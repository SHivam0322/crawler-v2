So many products use terms like 3D, markerless, natural features so loosely it's almost deceptive and make it very very difficult to define how to deliver the  desired UX.  2) this is a very new domain, in great need of UX professionals. Because it's early, and everything that exists was designed & documented by R&D engineers, there are many UX limits to the technology, and for a UX designer understanding these limits is  a bigger challenge than coming up with a compelling concept. Silka was designing e-mags for 3.5"" floppy diskettes, CD-ROM kiosks, web pages in '95, mobile web sites in 2002 and this is the area she puts most effort into (though she is not technical and sees no need to be as she focusses on understanding the user, but she makes the engineers explain the limits very clearly and very simply).  3) nearly all AR today is based on rendering an augmentation on top of some pre-configured image that is positioned in front of the camera. From a UX point of view this just sucks. Don't even bother trying to polish that t*rd. A reusable AR UX requires technology that works anywhere, and does not break the illusion that the content is part of the world. From Dekko's position we started with the desired UX and worked backwards into inventing some amazing, patented technology, that solves the UX problems we observed. 4) hardware form factor is a real limit on experience design. People won't hold a device in front of their face for more time than it takes to take a picture. They will hold their device for long periods at 45 degrees while sitting, or at waist level while walking. 5) Design experiences that do not *require* behavioral changes by the user. This is hard to find the fit with AR and where the opportunity is for a UX designer to add value. Digitize existing analog behaviors. AR is effective for disintermediating other interface metaphors such as icons or lists, and allowing the user to more naturally experience their world in real-time. 6) Understand where AR adds value and where it doesn't. eg many people have tried to apply AR to user-problems that a map solves far more elegantly. Dekkos application of AR is more akin to cinema-style CGI applied to the real world in real-time. If you think about how CGI enhances the cinema viewing experience, AR done right enhances real-world viewing experiences. 7) understand how to design for 3D space, not just 3D content. The structure of the space you are experiencing is a major design constraint/opportunity. All current AR technologies are unaware of 3D space. Dekko is solving this problem for smartphones & tablets in software. Kinect is a good current example of what can be done knowing something about the structure of the space you are augmenting. 8) think about how to design for an unknown environment. This is a much harder problem than it sounds... Designing AR experiences is hard, and the few UX designers doing it professionally (like Silka and also Helen Pappagiannis http://augmentedstories.wordpress.com/) are pioneering an entirely new medium. These opportunities only come along every few decades...",2021-03-06T10:56:04.912Z,"What type of studies do I need to become an expert in augmented reality? ",Quora

As you move your head around there are sensors in the goggles that the software uses to draw the 3D scene from your perspective as you look around within it.

As you move your head around there are sensors in the goggles that the software uses to draw the 3D scene from your perspective as you look around within it. The software can display a subtly different picture to each of your eyes - which (mostly) fools you in to seeing the “virtual” world in three dimensions. AUGMENTED REALITY: In “augmented reality”, it’s very similar - but the goggles aren’t opaque. You can still see the real world. The computer graphics are overlaid as an opaque or semi-opaque layer on top of the real world. So, you could imagine a game, where somewhere in the city there is a hidden treasure. Maybe there are clues to where it is. You walk around in the real world - everything seems normal - until you find a clue…maybe in the form of a big red arrow seemingly painted onto an office building or something. The office building is real - but the big red arrow is computer graphics. Not all of augmented reality is done with goggles - sometimes it’s done on the cheap with just a cellphone. In that case, the designer takes the image from the phone’s camera and displays it at roughly the right size so that it almost looks as if you’re looking at the real world THROUGH the phone’s display. As you move the phone around - it’s like the display has turned into a sheet of clear glass. Now they can draw graphics over the real world video stream - and it’ll be like there are these invisible things in the world that you can only see by looking through this magic piece of glass. APPLICATIONS: Augmented realiity is used in some games - the “Pokemon Go” game being the classic example where Pokemon characters were “hidden” in various real-world locations - and you could go there and find them and see them through the magic “window” of your cellphone.  The system is networked so two or more players can see the same character in the same place - but from different directions. But there are also serious applications - I’ve seen systems where some person is inspecting an airplane engine - and a computer is showing them which specific places in the engine need to be checked. So the service tech is wearing the goggles - they can see the real world engine right in front of them - but the computer is overlaying an arrow showing where some voltage should be measured - maybe also displaying the maximum and minumum voltages that should be there. Here, a circle-clip has to be removed - and the computer shows where the clip is (overlaid on the real world engine) as the part number and the instruction of what to do.  Basically the computer helps out the technician by “augmenting” the reality of their own eyes. OTHER USES OF THE TERM: I worked for a company that made a “virtual try on” system for people who were purchasing sunglasses. They’d go to the company website - make a short video of their face - turning left and right - using their cellphone camera. We’d analyze the video and make a 3D model of the person’s head. We could then render a realistic image of any of hundreds of pairs of sunglasses over the top of the video - and allow you to see yourself wearing them. The system rendered the glasses themselves along with realistic shadows and reflections of light shining through the translucent parts onto your face. In this case, there are no goggles involved - it was all happening as if the cellphone screen was a magic mirror that reflects your face as if you were actually wearing the glasses.

I talk about the first step, 3D modeling and processing, on my blog on Augment. Each step is an intuitive process, and there are different methods and practices for distinct uses. Whether you are looking to develop in Augmented Reality or you are creating content for AR headsets, understanding the technical process will help you broaden your perspective. At this point, we will walk you through the concept of 3D models and their deployment in AR. 3D content still needs an engine to bring AR to fruition, and this software can be adopted through an augmented reality SDK. This AR SDK includes a rendering engine for the 3D model, as well as tracking detection and depth sensing to orient it in the 'real world'. Each software solution has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is helpful to understand the different types of tracking used in Augmented Reality.Tango has joined forces with Lenovo for their first Tango-enabled device, called the Phab 2 Pro. In brief, the Google software has a few capabilities that will power huge leaps for Augmented Reality, especially through mobile devices. Tracking When a movie needs to use 3D elements mixed with live action, the CGI supervisor will place tracking markers around the set in order to give the computer a sense of what the environment looks like. It uses these specific points to generate a rough idea of the space so that the computer-generated element can move around in it and still look realistic. Think of Augmented Reality as the real version —not the work around— for this kind of technology. How does it work?An AR SDK must learn and track the environment in real-time, creating and updating its view of the environment many times per second. The most common ways of accomplishing this tricky feat are Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) tracking, Depth tracking, and Pattern tracking Depth Perception Depth sensors can detect how far or close objects are in relation to your device. Understanding depth helps you interact with virtual elements in the real world. Virtual objects will fuse with the true environment, because their depth is anchored to an object with true scale. On a more practical basis, understanding the real world becomes much easier. For example, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro can use Tango’s software to measure how tall an object is or how much space you have. Rendering	The most common uses of 3D models today are either in the world of entertainment or product design. However, most 3D models are stuck in a 2D world. Even the best 3D element will still likely only be displayed on the flat canvas of a monitor, and interaction with it will be limited to a mouse or a remote control. But as we have seen, developers are rushing to change that; soon, 3D is going to explode from the screen and begin inhabiting the real world. AR is the end result but there are many software programs and technologies used to prepare the 3D content for such a process. I go into more depth about the entire process and the softwares involved when rendering a model, AR SDKs, exporting 3D models and more in Augment’s eBook on AR. As for the hardware, we dive into that as well. But the most accessible and trustworthy medium right now would be a mobile experience. The hololens is out to early parties and the Meta 2 is on the way, as well as other alternatives. But most AR experiences have been seen through mobile at the moment.

We might see commercial uses for BCI by the end of next decade e.g. communication, vision etc.Electric Vehicles - With solar power and other renewable sources of energy becoming much cheaper than conventional energy and becoming increasingly accessible; startups in EV sector are destined to grow.Artificial Intelligence - With easy access to computation and data, there will be number of startups providing solutions to problems with AI; which traditionally required extensive human capital.Computation for Machine Learning - A major limiting factor in current machine learning practices are expensive compute hardware required to train the models. Newer edge computing devices which not only helps in inference, but also in training will be available from startups in the next decade.Computer Networking - With 5G & Satellite Constellations providing low latency Internet to remote corners of the world; startups offering new services which weren’t possible due to latency issues in the past such as remote gaming, remote robotics etc. would enter the scene.Faux Meat - Alternatives to meat, such as plant based meat or lab grown meat which retains the flavour & nutrition of meat would address the ethical implications of killing animals for food and also decrease methane emissions from livestock.Wealth Inequality - With rising wealth inequality (1% of the world has 50% of world’s wealth), unemployment due to economic slowdowns and automation; there will be degradation of lifestyle quality and increasing law&order situations incl. but not limited to terrorism. Startups working to address wealth and other inequalities would rise.Climate Change - This is the most important problem, the reason why I included at the end is because it has a role to play in all the other problems discussed earlier. Due to the economic impact of climate change, governments would incentivise startups to work in this area.With Global heating, there will be rise in cancers among other diseases increasing the healthcare expenditures world over.With irregular monsoons, there will be shortage of fresh water supply around the world.Irregular monsoons would force drastic changes in the agricultural practices which could further affect the decreasing soil health.Increasing livestock to feed growing human population is increasing the methane (greenhouse gas) release into the atmosphere.Alternatives for plastics and other hazardous materials are a need of the hour.Post COVID-19 Reality I wrote the above (OCT 2019) before the new COVID-19 reality, I would have loved to be wrong; but looks like Healthcare did turn out to be the most important trend for this decade, although I didn’t expect it to be instigated by a pandemic. Here are some other trends which has accelerated due to our new reality, • Medical Equipment Manufacturing - The reliance of Governments on few manufacturers and certain countries for critical medical gear has caught them off-guard during this pandemic. Local manufacturing of the medical equipments have already started in several countries, many involving their startup ecosystem. The need gap for cost-effective, scalable medical equipment manufacturing is clearer than ever. • Pharmaceuticals - As with Medical Equipments, the dependence of the Governments on pharmaceutical products, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), Vaccines from certain manufacturers and countries has created dire consequences. This has created a need gap for startups to enter Pharma industry which was soon becoming an oligopoly, coupled with lesser compliances and faster approvals for the pharmaceutical products in the future. • Enabling Remote Work - This could anything from video conferencing tools, cloud tools, to startups which provide infrastructure for Working From Home, strengthen home network security and everything in-between. • Enabling UBI - COVID-19 pandemic has clearly shown the need for Universal Basic Income, few countries have already started the process of exploring the ways to implement UBI for safeguarding their citizens. Fin-tech Startups which enable UBI implementation measures will be employed to solve several problems in this area. Edit : Typo with exist.

Arguments about nostalgia, brand, accessibility, etc. are insufficient because they’re true of any Pokémon game, and also of many of Nintendo’s recent releases, like Zelda remakes for 3DS and Star Fox Zero for Wii U. It’s also worth noting that augmented reality alone can’t make a great game, since it’s been done before and more often than not feels like a gimmick. Riley Patterson rightly points out that Go’s availability at zero cost on phones that people already own (as opposed to a $40 game for a console fewer people own) is important to its success; I view cost as a necessary, but not sufficient condition for Go’s huge success. If you’ve ever watched or played Pokémon, the most striking thing about the Pokémon universe is how pervasive Pokémon are in everyone’s daily lives. Pokémon are on the news, kids grow up wanting to be Pokémon trainers, and Pokémon even serve societal functions. That experience is so core to Pokémon’s essence, but to date, no Pokémon game has been able to replicate it. Sure, Blaziken looks pretty realistic on Pokémon X/Y for the 3DS, but once you close your handheld, it’s gone. There’s always been this nagging feeling of emptiness when you stop playing, because your world and the people in it are so similar, yet disappointingly different than the world of Pokémon. Playing a game on your handheld is just too different from the Pokémon universe. Pokémon Go changes everything because it expands beyond the console in a way no game ever has, and that’s just what Pokémon needed. The whole point of Go is that Pokémon are a part of the real world—not just your handheld—which is the whole point of Pokémon itself. There's no plot, no barrier to entry; you just exist in the universe, and your path is whatever you make it. Essentially, Pokémon Go taps into the very core of what made Pokémon successful in the first place. Familiar places like your home and your office are completely different now that they’re filled with Pokémon. People are unabashedly running around in public talking about and catching Pokémon, so you can see the game no matter where you are. Suddenly, you don’t have that feeling of emptiness anymore, because even if your phone is in your pocket, Pokémon are all around you. It’s that novel experience that has caused the app to take off. These photos aren’t my own, but it’s not uncommon to see the below:  (via reddit Go Team Mystic! • /r/pokemon, not a photo of me)  (via Pokémon Go is doing what few apps can – driving real-world traffic) The app itself has some glaring flaws. It’s unreliable, slow, and crash-prone. Fundamental gameplay mechanics like healing, battling, and grinding are completely and utterly broken. But none of that really matters (for now), because you’re finally, perhaps unbelievably, living in the Pokémon universe like you never have before. Pokémon Go is, frankly, a breakthrough. Will Go maintain this level of immersion for long? Almost certainly not, particularly if the gameplay experience doesn’t improve dramatically. The novelty of being in the Pokémon universe after 20 long years will wear off. But, Pokémon Go may very well be the pivotal moment for its genre, and games like it may soon become the norm. Pokémon Go is so popular because it has immersed players into its unique universe more so than any video game in history.

There are several potential research areas (which almost always have some overlap). These can be further subdivided into subtopics. -Hardware optics & rendering: vergence-accommodation conflict, latency-related aspects, pupil/eye-tracking for AR/VR, foveated rendering, varifocal and multifocal / light-field displays, etc.-Tracking/ego-motion/registration: vision-based and IR-based, IMU-based, hybrid methods, filtering, etc.- 3D reconstruction (also factors into tracking/ego-motion, but much more focused on SLAM / reconstructing the geometry, moving geometry, concurrent segmentation aiding reconstruction, kinematic structure of the geometry, material properties, lighting of the scene, etc.- Networking: distributed content/sharing platforms for AR/VR applications, coordination between headsets & other wearable computing devices, etc.- As related to AR applications, semantics / higher-level computer vision problems, such as object segmentation, detection/recognition, tracking, classification, logic- Interaction & applications in AR context: haptics, higher-level interaction & GUI based on computer vision inputs, teaching / training / simulation You’d just have to figure out what interests you most, and start learning.I hope this helps!

This response could be very long, however I will try to stay concise. this step is probably the most relevant if you wish to start on the right foot. Your idea needs to be written out and conceptualized in the form of screens and flows. you need to sit down and expand your idea into various directions. Imagine a mind map with a center “your idea” and branches describing various directions you want to take it. You can create screens, flows with start and end, ideas you like from other applications. Essentially this step allows you to expand your idea so you can have a better understanding of what it is you want. The more clarity you have the better you will be able to convey your idea to the team that could build it. On the other hand of course you can hire people to expand your idea, they will work with you to develop all the artifacts I described above.Once you build out your concept, you need to hire a team to build it. This could be one or more people depending on the complexity and time to market. The more people you have working on it the faster you can deliver it. Hiring the right team is a process in itself. Perhaps you have friends who understand software development and they can recommend people or you may have a budget to hire a team to build a prototype (minimal viable product MVP) that would allow you to understand how your application functions.In addition to developing it you need to test your application, deploy it, and support it in production. All of this is typically done in parallel at various stages.Above is highly condensed, there are significant details in each of the steps above that would need to be discussed and explained. Based on the complexity of your idea it could take a few months or more to build it. Keeping it simple and focusing on core functionality will allow you to build it quickly and get it out on the market given the right team.

On the other hand, customers are fascinated by the new entertainment possibilities, but do not want to invest in head-mounted displays (HMDs) as long as the offering is so small. This is going to change during the next five years.” To keep pace with consumer interest and leverage the opportunities of immersive technologies, organizations must address three main challenges in AR and VR hardware and technology. Challenge No. 1: 3D design interface The biggest barrier to wide adoption of immersive technologies is the lack of good user experience design. 3D interface design is difficult and expensive, and there are few people with the necessary design skills to overcome these issues. The main goal of user experience design is to get users to just don their HMD and go to work. However, this is not solely a design challenge. Challenges such as eye strain and sound disorientation need to be overcome. Nobody wants to buy a device or an experience that gives you a headache. Challenge No. 2: VR is missing two key technology elements for mass adoption Although VR is already available to consumers through devices such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Sony PlayStation VR or Samsung Gear VR, it has still not moved beyond a niche market. To enter the mainstream, VR hardware needs to incorporate two important features: convenience and control. Convenience means both availability and access. Availability means there must be a lot of choices, while accessibility is tied to cost and functionality, meaning the hardware and underlying technology must be easy to use and available at an affordable price point. We expect that smartphone and mobile VR will offer an adequate experience at an affordable price that will complement the more high-end HMDs. Control means agency. At the moment, not all VR devices offer the immersive experience the user expects. There are still many challenges with gesture and movement control. Challenge No. 3: Smartphone competition Despite user-experience limitations, smartphone convenience and developer familiarity means that smartphone AR will establish an early strong foothold in the market. The hardware is already widespread and has a strong developer base. A handheld smartphone AR can deliver good experiences today, but will prove inconvenient moving forward. Users do not want to locate their phone and then hold it at eye height for extended periods of time. A hands-free AR HMD experience will make the experience much more comfortable, and experts predict that AR HMDs will come to market in significant volumes only after 2020. As vendors refine HMD technology, consumers will be their target, but that won’t happen until they refine and advance their designs AR in the enterprise, however, will see some early successes and gain traction more quickly than general consumer AR. These solutions will be purpose-built to address a business need such as the ability to draw on a screen or moving image during a remote meeting or presentation, architectural walkthroughs, or be used in controlled environments where devices need industrial certification or device resilience. These use-specific HMDs will be band-aid solutions that will service limited purposes, or will be limited to niche circumstances. As vendors refine HMD technology, consumers will be their target, but that won’t happen until they refine and advance their designs at the enterprise level first. The biggest barrier to wide adoption of immersive technologies is the lack of good user experience design Enterprises already use immersive technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and virtual reality.However, experts expect it will take 5 to 10 years before these technologies reach a mature level.

In simple words, we can say visualizing the computer-generated content on the real world through some gadgets like a smartphone or headsets. In the Pokemon Go game, players enjoy the game through location-based Augmented Reality technology. This game completely changed the segment of the game industry and the word Augmented Reality becomes popular. This is the one sector where the gaming industry uses such technology and now we can see many industries are slowly changing their marketing strategy by using the latest technologies. We remember the time when the advertisements were published in the newspaper, announced on radios, pamphlet distribution, slowly with the change in technology companies start presenting their ads on Televisions and with the upgrading of technology way of promotion also upgrade. Today when everything is on based on technology the promotions of the companies also based on the same. We can still find the traditional marketing techniques but on the other hand, they are using the latest technology to entertain their clients by a more transparent way of promoting their service and products. Today we can see companies like Real Estate, Print Media, Education, Automobile, Manufacturing, and many others are adopting the AR technology to engage their clients. With the help of such technology, they are able to showcase their products or services to their clients on a more entertaining and detailed format. The industries till the time presenting their work either through photo presentation or through videos, but the augmented reality helps them to showcase their information in any manner they want either in 3D animation, audio, video or including all. For industries like real estate, the augmented reality will help the buyers to visualize the floor plan, floor map on their smartphones by scanning the tracking device prepared by real estate company, that might be print of floor map, a model of the building or just the brochures. This technology helps the real estate company to present the view of the building, flats, interior design, room sizes, clubhouse, and all the other details they want to show. This also helps the buyer to understand the project in-depth before finalizing the decision to buy it. A clear concept helps the buyer to invest in the property which they can imagine ""how it looks like after completion"" before the construction begins. Similarly in other industries like Training and Development or in Manufacturing units, Augmented Reality help the organization to reduce the cost consumption on training sessions for new employees or trainees. AR technology helps the industries trainer to provide a live demo of the product manufacturing by scanning over the machinery or any tracking device that trainers want to scan and show how that machinery works. It not only reduces the chances of damages but also provide the proper and step by step knowledge of machinery function. If this Augmented Reality technology is presently providing such unique features of showcasing products and services to their clients than the future of this technology will change the daily life of an individual. The future of kids education will be completely based on these types of technology, where students can not only learn about the basics but also feel and memorize the things they have listened and learned in their life. Like taking example today many playschools start teaching the students through AR technology, where they are able to visualize and understand that A for Apple and how Apple looks like. Similarly, this technology will soon enter into everyday life, anyone wants to visit any tourist place, they can collect the video graphics information about that place through scanning it on the map, or any tracking device. Supermarkets will also soon provide such technology, where the buyer just by scanning the shop or product will gather complete information with offers and discounts. The technology is rapidly updating itself and so the market too, new technologies is nothing just the up-gradation of the previous one, and so the AR will also upgrade and comes with something more exciting and useful features.",2021-03-06T11:01:39.588Z,"What is the future of augmented reality?

I think by the 2090s, Depressingly large parts of the world will still not be affluent. Major cities will have some gleaming skyscrapers, totally out of bound of the majority, where the richest and most powerful will exclusively reside and live (both above the ground, and under it in vast spaces).Some parts of the world will be exclusively only for the super-plutocrats - not even the super-rich. These super-plutocrats may even end up making their own military, with frighteningly powerful satellites that will be able to detect and direct attacks on approaching enemy devices and men. Others will learn to let them be on their own.Areas will be claimed out of the high seas by these super-plutocrats, and entirely new cities built there, out of bounds for everyone else.The first human colonies on the Moon or maybe even Mars will come of age, with the first babies born there becoming adults. Many of them may never come back to Earth ever.Terrorism will take on new meanings - terror groups will use genetic engineering to create terrorists in a test-tube. Entire states will fall prey to disruptive terror groups which will arise out of seemingly nowhere to take over weak governments, and retreat more and more into the medieval age. Unable to bring any change, the powerful will simply let it be. Actually, their “strategic interests will coincide”!Endless energy through cold fusion at commercially feasible rates and room temperatures will mean even the ordinary will be able to have comfortable lives (provided they get access to it).Money will be points collected (and lost) by individuals automatically in a giant national repository, updated each moment, depending on number of steps walked, energy consumed or saved, help offered, tasks completed, thoughts contributed to the National Server, and so on.Citizens will keep criticising taxation policies.Food will be practically free.

People grew tired of it.Schools and colleges as exist today long ceased to be. Neural implants have allowed access to knowledge at will, and turned educational “institutions” places only for developing social connect and civilisation, little else.Kim Jong-ever would be ruling North Korea, threatening to blow up Moon and soon enough, Mars, with his nukes. He will have his rebellious Generals blown by nuclear tablets.The American and Chinese platinum domes would have insulated and isolated those nations totally from any physical attacks.The United Nations would be deliberating how to end the conflicts in Middle East.South China sea will turn into a pond, surrounded by new artificially created nations by the PRC.Japan would vanish. There would be no more Japanese left. They stopped reproducing long long ago.Taiwan will claim entire PRC mainland as its own. PRC will shrug it off using the “One China Policy” ruse.The Republic of Eurostan will debate what rights to grant the minority whites still left in some remote pockets. Turkey will influence the debates.A “no nation” would be founded by the 2050s, where those who hold only the ultra-liberal values will be allowed to enter. As soon as they will stabilise, a populist will turn it on its head.India will reach 180 crores in population, and the neural newspapers would be decrying the third rise of the Right-wing in a 100 years.

Let me elaborate them by points and probably finalise I believe is the “most important”. Interpersonal Communication : Though it may not be able to entirely replicate human presence and touch. I feel this technology enhances communication, make it more personal, in terms of virtual presence resembling actual in person. Imagine an aged parent (in India) longing to see and talk to his/her child settled across the continent (may be USA). Now, Skype or Facetime are good at the moment, but augmented reality makes it more much in person experience.Education: I love MOOCs, it gives me access to learn from best of Professors/ Professionals around the world. Imagine a student from a village in India, able to speak to a teacher from a reputed learning institute and learning from them. MOOCs at present have limited reach, because of the lack of personal touch. As it is said in India - if you learn live from Guru, learning becomes enriching. So, I believe teachers across the world will be able to reach classrooms any where in the world.Engineering : Yes, I believe it comes under social change because , augmented reality is a enabler in democratising Engineering design and product development (in combination with 3D printing). When that happens, market dynamics change especially in developing countries with young technology work force. At the moment, where the developed countries lead is the design innovation and augmented reality will scale down the entry barriers as the design process becomes much more intuitive and practical. Of course, specialised skill sets are needed, but enabling technology is one Im stressing here.Robotics: This is an interesting area. Some work is in good progress already - like the remote surgeries by doctors. I believe, in future, a person will be able to login to robot remotely - just as they do on a computer now ( yea…those Teamviewer sessions) and troubleshoot a machinery in a plant at a remote place without moving from his/her office, located anywhere in the world. This is going to an amalgamation of augmented reality, Internet of Things, Computer Vision and similar technologies into a product form.There are few other thoughts like digital shopping experiences and live monitoring of remotely located structures/works, etc, but I don't really believe them of having significant social importance , at least not as much as the above. They may help business with marketing and reaching potential customers.Not a social aspect but it does help Scientific Research as well.Coming to the end, if I have to choose the most important change from my perspective of living in a small city in India - it will Communication and Education (Yea, both of them). I couldn't choose just one they are equally important and I hope this technology makes human contacts seamless and of course borderless.

Step 2 Integrate Google Map to your Unity3d Project Step 3 Integrate Character and Interacting with GPS Data Step 4 Generating Monsters on Map (Part A) Step 5 Generating Monsters on Map (Part B) Part 1 Setting up Back4app Parse on your Unity3d. Go to https://parse.com/docs/downloads  Download Unity Blank Project (v1.7.0) Download https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7k7pGQXUypGTWRqS1BqVDBWQUU/view?usp=sharing for updated Parse SDK for Unity3d  Open Unity3d Parse Blank Project -> Click Upgrade if required.  Replace Asset/Parse/Parse.Unity.dll to the latest one. Go to Asset/Scene The Parse Initializer GameObject will miss some scripts. Add ParseInitializeBehaviour to it.  Type your Application ID, dotNet Key, serverUrl to a parameter from your Back4app dashboard.   Create a GameObject and add script component to the Scene for testing.  Add following code to TestParse.cs   using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; using Parse; using System.Threading.Tasks; public class TestParse : MonoBehaviour { // Use this for initialization void Start () { ParseObject testObj = new ParseObject(""TestObject""); testObj[""a""] = ""HI""; testObj[""b""] = ""Back4app""; Task saveTask = testObj.SaveAsync(); } // Update is called once per frame void Update () { } } Press Play Button on your Unity3d Editor  Go to Back4app database dashboard to check the success or not.  It is connected with your back4app account successfully if you find your uploaded data in the database.  Part 2 Integrate Google Map to your Unity3d Project To generate the terrain like Pokémon-Go, we need to integrate Google map your Unity3d Project. First, create Plane and Name it as “Map”, create directional light.  Second, Create a script “GoogleMap” and add to Map Game object.  using UnityEngine; 	using System.Collections;  	public class GoogleMap : MonoBehaviour 	{ 		public enum MapType 		{ 			RoadMap, 			Satellite, 			Terrain, 			Hybrid 		} 		public bool loadOnStart = true; 		public bool autoLocateCenter = true; 		public GoogleMapLocation centerLocation; 		public int zoom = 13; 		public MapType mapType; 		public int size = 512; 		public bool doubleResolution = false; 		public GoogleMapMarker[] markers; 		public GoogleMapPath[] paths;  		void Start() { 			if(loadOnStart) Refresh(); 		}  		public void Refresh() { 			if(autoLocateCenter && (markers.Length == 0 && paths.Length == 0)) { 				Debug.LogError(""Auto Center will only work if paths or markers are used.""); 			} 			StartCoroutine(_Refresh()); 		}  		IEnumerator _Refresh () 		{ 			var url = ""http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap""; 			var qs = """"; 			if (!autoLocateCenter) { 				if (centerLocation.address != """") 				qs += ""center="" + WWW.UnEscapeURL (centerLocation.address); 				else { 					qs += ""center="" + WWW.UnEscapeURL (string.Format (""{0},{1}"", centerLocation.latitude, centerLocation.longitude)); 				}  				qs += ""&zoom="" + zoom.ToString (); 			} 			qs += ""&size="" + WWW.UnEscapeURL (string.Format (""{0}x{0}"", size)); 			qs += ""&scale="" + (doubleResolution ?

Type some dummy parameter to try the Google Map.  If the plane shows the correct location as your parameter, the Google map is successfully integrated. You can use Refresh method to refresh the Google map to change location.  Part 3 Integrate Character and Interacting with GPS Data Create LocationManager Gameobject and add the following code. This code is getting the GPS Data and updating the Google Map when GPS data is changed. using UnityEngine;  using System.Collections;  using UnityEngine.UI;    public class LocationManager : MonoBehaviour {        public GameObject map;      public GameObject spawn;      public float lat=0;      public float lon=0;      float lastlat=0,lastlon=0;      public GameObject latText;      public GameObject lonText;        // Use this for initialization      void Start () {          Input.location.Start (); // enable the mobile device GPS          if (Input.location.isEnabledByUser) { // if mobile device GPS is enabled              lat = Input.location.lastData.latitude; //get GPS Data              lon = Input.location.lastData.longitude;              map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().centerLocation.latitude = lat;              map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().centerLocation.longitude = lon;          }            }              // Update is called once per frame      void Update () {  //      <---------Mobile Device Code----------->          if (Input.location.isEnabledByUser) {              lat = Input.location.lastData.latitude;              lon = Input.location.lastData.longitude;              if (lastlat != lat || lastlon != lon) {                  map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().centerLocation.latitude = lat;                  map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().centerLocation.longitude = lon;                  latText.GetComponent<Text> ().text = ""Lat"" + lat.ToString ();                  lonText.GetComponent<Text> ().text = ""Lon"" + lon.ToString ();                  //spawn.GetComponent<Spawn> ().updateMonstersPosition (lon, lat);                  //Add above after you complete spawn part                  map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().Refresh ();              }              lastlat = lat;              lastlon = lon;          }  //      <---------Mobile Device Code----------->    //      <---------PC Test Code----------->  //        if (lastlat != lat || lastlon != lon) {  //        map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().centerLocation.latitude = lat;  //        map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().centerLocation.longitude = lon;  //        latText.GetComponent<Text> ().text = ""Lat"" + lat.ToString ();  //        lonText.GetComponent<Text> ().text = ""Lon"" + lon.ToString ();  //            spawn.GetComponent<Spawn> ().updateMonstersPosition (lon, lat);  //        map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().Refresh ();  //        }  //                    lastlat = lat;  //                    lastlon = lon;  //      <---------PC Test Code----------->        }        public float getLon(){          return lon;      }      public float getLat(){          return lat;      }    } Let test the Google map again. It is successful if the Google map change when you change the GPS Data in Runtime.   After that, create a Capsule as a character and a Cube as Direction of the character on top of the Google Map. (For me, I place the character at X:0 Y:0.07 Z:0) Add a compass to your character when you test with your mobile device.  Make sure your character is located correctly by checking Latitude and Longitude on Google Map.  Part 4 Generating Monsters on Map (Part A) Foe Generating Monsters, we need to do some calculation on placing the monster with their longitude and latitude location. Because the ratio between Google map, reality and Unity3d XYZ-world is different. To figure out how to calculate the relationship between them, we need dummy data. For more detail : how to calculate. http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html First of all, we need to set initial latitude and longitude on Google Map first (You can choose where you want) and set the Markers on the Google Map.  Press Run, You will find the label on your Google map.  PS: The reason why we cannot use the marker to be a monster because it is combined with the texture. The marker itself is a part of the texture but not a Gmeobject so we cannot do any implementation on that. Beside that, we will make some dummy GPS data of monster on Parse server, later on, so we need to know the corresponding ratio on the monster game object position.  After that, we create a cube and place on top of the label.  Record this position. Now, we need to find the exact distance between the player GPS location and the marker GPS location. The distance between start (37.38373, -122.0133) and marker (37.384782,-122.012893) can be calculated by this script. public static double DistanceBetweenPlaces(double lon1, double lat1, double lon2, double lat2) { 	float R = 6371000; // m 	double sLat1 = Math.Sin(deg2rad(lat1)); 	double sLat2 = Math.Sin(deg2rad(lat2)); 	double cLat1 = Math.Cos(deg2rad(lat1)); 	double cLat2 = Math.Cos(deg2rad(lat2)); 	double cLon = Math.Cos(deg2rad(lon1) - deg2rad(lon2));  	double cosD = sLat1*sLat2 + cLat1*cLat2*cLon;  	double d = Math.Acos(cosD);  	double dist = R * d;  	return dist; } and then calculate the XYZ world distance between the CUBE maker and the Player Capsule. (-0.563,0.07,-1.915) and (0,0.07,0). This is a simple calculation, so I don’t list how to do it. After that, the ratio will be found by this equation Ratio = XYZ world distance / Exact Distance. Once we have this ratio, we able to calculate how far the monster should be placed according to the Player location. However, the possible location still undefined because we don’t have the bearing between the player and monster. To calculate the bearing. We can use this code. public static double BearingBetweenPlaces(double lon1,double lat1,double lon2,double lat2){ 	double y = Math.Sin (deg2rad (lon2) - deg2rad (lon1)) * Math.Cos (deg2rad (lat2)); 	double x = Math.Cos (deg2rad (lat1)) * Math.Sin (deg2rad (lat2)) - Math.Sin (deg2rad (lat1)) * Math.Cos (deg2rad (lat2)) * Math.Cos (deg2rad (lon2) - deg2rad (lon1)); 	double bearing = Math.Atan2 (y, x); 	return bearing; } After we get the ratio and bearing, it is possible to convert Longitude Latitude location to be XYZ-world coordination, which means we can place any monsters with latitude longitude location to correct game world location. public static double[] convertXZ(double lon1,double lat1,double lon2,double lat2){ 	double ratio = 0.0162626572; 	double bearing = BearingBetweenPlaces (lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2); 	double distance = DistanceBetweenPlaces(lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2); 	double x = Math.Sin (-bearing) * distance * ratio; 	double z = -Math.Cos (bearing) * distance * ratio; 	Debug.Log (""X"" + x.ToString () + ""Z"" + z.ToString ()); 	double[] xz = { x, z }; 	return xz; } With the above code, we know the correct XYZ coordination to spawn monster. Part 5 Generating Monsters on Map (Part B) While we are able to convert Longitude and Latitude data to the game world, it is time now to create some dummy monster data on Back4app parse server. Go to your Parse back4app dashboard and create a class call Monster.  Add a column: Location with data type Geopoint.  Insert some monster dummy row that around you.  The dummy monsters are set, they are waiting for you to call. Then I create a MonsterSpawn GameObject with script Spawn. Drop the LocationManager GameObject to it (For getting updated GPS Data) M prefab monster for spawning a monster.  It is time to fetch the dummy monster data from back4app to your program. void Start () {          monsterXZCoordination = new List<double[]>();          monsterLL = new List<double[]> ();          var query = ParseObject.GetQuery (""Monster"");          //you can use WhereWithinGeoBox or WhereNear or WhereWithinDistance to simulate pkmgo serach range          playerlon = locationManager.GetComponent<LocationManager>().getLon();          playerlat = locationManager.GetComponent<LocationManager>().getLat();          query.FindAsync ().ContinueWith (t => {              IEnumerable<ParseObject> results = t.Result;              foreach (var result in results) {                  ParseGeoPoint temp = result.Get<ParseGeoPoint>(""Location"");                  double[] tempxz = GeoDistance.convertXZ(playerlon,playerlat,temp.Longitude,temp.Latitude);                  double[] trueLL = {temp.Longitude,temp.Latitude};                  monsterLL.Add(trueLL);                  monsterXZCoordination.Add(tempxz);              }              spawn = true;          });          } The above code gets the result one by one and converting the GeoPoint data to be XYZ-world coordination, and then push the result to the List. After adding the result is fetched, spawn becomes true to allow program spawns the monster. void Update () {            playerlon = locationManager.GetComponent<LocationManager>().getLon();          playerlat = locationManager.GetComponent<LocationManager> ().getLat ();            if (spawn == true) {              monsterSpawn ();          }          if (monster.Count != 0) {              if (lastlon != playerlon || lastlat != playerlat) {                  //DebugConsole.Log (""Changing"");                  updateMonstersPosition ();              }                        }          lastlat = playerlat;          lastlon = playerlon;        }        void monsterSpawn(){          //DebugConsole.Log (""HIHIHI"");          for (int i = 0; i < monsterXZCoordination.Count; i++) {              GameObject temp = Instantiate (m, new Vector3 ((float)monsterXZCoordination [i][0], 0.07f, (float)monsterXZCoordination [i][1]), new Quaternion (0, 0, 0, 0)) as GameObject;                //DebugConsole.Log (temp.transform.position.ToString());              monster.Add (temp);          }          spawn = false;      }      void updateMonstersPosition(){          timeOfupdate++;          for (int i = 0; i < monster.Count; i++) {              double[] tempxz = GeoDistance.convertXZ(playerlon,playerlat,monsterLL[i][0],monsterLL[i][1]);              monster [i].gameObject.transform.position = new Vector3 ((float)tempxz[0],0.07f,(float)tempxz[1]);              //DebugConsole.Log (timeOfupdate.ToString()+""th update:""+i.ToString()+"" ""+monster [i].gameObject.transform.position.ToString ());          }      }      public void updateMonstersPosition(double lon,double lat){          timeOfupdate++;          for (int i = 0; i < monster.Count; i++) {              double[] tempxz = GeoDistance.convertXZ(lon,lat,monsterLL[i][0],monsterLL[i][1]);              monster [i].gameObject.transform.position = new Vector3 ((float)tempxz[0],0.07f,(float)tempxz[1]);              //DebugConsole.Log (timeOfupdate.ToString()+""th update:""+i.ToString()+"" ""+monster [i].gameObject.transform.position.ToString ());          }      } After the Monsters are spawned, the monsters will keep updating when the player GPS data has updated. Testing. The monster is spawn at correct XYZ coordination with their Latitude Longitude data.  Part 6 How to move the Player (solve google map texture slow problem!) Until Part 5, the movement of the player is relied on the Google Map texture updating. However, it is not effective to play it. The user experience is not good. To solve this problem, we “unlock” the player. Make player move on the map. The algorithm behind is similar to updating the monster. we apply on the capsule. compare the last GPS data and new GPS data to calculate how should the player move in the Game world. As we are updating the position of the player, therefore we don’t need monster update and google map refresh function anymore. what you need to do : Modify LocationMaganger.cs Add GameObject playerCapsule : Drag your capsule to this comment or delete monster update and google map refresh in update() Add player movement logic if (lastlon != 0 && lastlat != 0) {//skip at move player at the first update of GPS double[] tempXZ = GeoDistance.convertXZ (lastlon, lastlat, lon, lat); Debug.Log (“Last lon:“ + lastlon.ToString () + “lastlat:“ + lastlat.ToString () + “lon:“ + lon.ToString () + “lat:“ + lat.ToString ()); Debug.Log (“Player should move to X:“ + tempXZ [0].ToString () + “ Z:“ + tempXZ [1].ToString ()); Vector3 newPositionTarget = new Vector3 (playerCapsule.transform.position.x+(float)tempXZ [0], 0.07f, playerCapsule.transform.position.z+(float)tempXZ [1]); playerCapsule.transform.position = newPositionTarget; }else map.GetComponent<GoogleMap> ().Refresh (); ***** this google map refresh does not need to be Commented, because we need it to init the texture and the first time using UnityEngine;using System.Collections;using UnityEngine.UI;

The ""Magic Schoolbus""  Virtual reality will allow teachers to take students on guided virtual field trips to foreign locations, to historic events, or to witnesses processes too small, too big, too fast, or too slow to see in real life.  2. The flight simulators Virtual reality will allow students to practice real-world skills that are too dangerous, or too expensive, or too rare for novice students to attempt, and it will allow professionals to keep honing and expanding their skills. Medical students can practice surgeries, ecologists can practice identifying rare species, language students can practice new vocabulary, mechanics can practice tricky repairs, sales people can practice their scripts, and, of course, new pilots can practice flying airplanes.  3. Virtual classrooms Virtual reality will allow students to attend classes no matter where they are located. This means that students will be able to practice teamwork, to learn from one another, and to develop lasting relationships. In order words, students will be able to enjoy some of the advantages of a an actual campus experience without having to go away to school or taking time off from their careers. 4. Virtual self-study Today, students anywhere in the world can learn almost anything they want just by going online. But it can be hard to demonstrate that knowledge, or to develop the kinds of professional networks that you get from direct access to teachers and fellow students. Virtual reality will provide self-motivated students with the opportunity to find peer groups, to work on projects together, and to demonstrate their expertise in front of peers and experts. For example, many students do volunteer work to practice their new skills, or join professional organizations for networking opportunities. There's already some of this happening online, but virtual reality will expand the opportunities for both dramatically. 5. Values and socialization Virtual reality will open up the possibilities for modeling values and other behaviors. Medical training simulations aimed at medical professionals in emerging countries, for example, could help make hand-washing an automatic habit not only by having the students wash their hands when needed, but also by having other professionals do so as a matter of course, helping to model the behavior. Virtual reality can help convey the joy of discovery and scientific exploration, model a love of mathematics. Or convey basic social skills like tolerance and mutual respect.

There is merit to some of these arguments: VR headsets are heavy and designed for adults, who have bigger heads and stronger necks.Children generally have lower spatial awareness than adults, and are thus more likely to bump into things if they are wearing a headset.Adults have inter-pupillary distances that are larger than those of children. While some headsets have adjustments for eye separation and focus, they require an adult to fully understand and communicate what is “right” for them. If you have ever tried to take a young child to an optometrist, you will understand how difficult it is to really know if an eyewear prescription is correct.Suspected neurological damage: in this argument, VR is not “real” and therefore messes up your brain. This may occur in a number of ways: VR motion sickness, in which the brain is temporarily confused between the visual and vestibular inputs. Nausea is usually enough to make people stop when this effect occurs.Rapidly flashing images can trigger epileptic seizures. This is possible on a TV, but even more likely if the user is fully immersed in a VR headset.Stereo discrepancy cues: the eyes receive stereo images providing depth cues, but the eye focus distance to the displays is always fixed. This discrepancy may have unknown long-term 3D vision effects.Exposure to inappropriate content: this is the age-old argument that has been used since the days of rock music, blues, heavy metal, rap, and the first video games. The only solution is parental awareness and judicious supervision. Disconnection from “reality”: extended exposure to any immersive medium has been claimed to lead to a number of psychological effects: Inability to distinguish between reality and virtual experiences, leading to risk of psychosis.Strong emotional content coupled with highly immersive experiences, leading to structural behavioral changes. This effect is used in VR exposure therapy to treat PTSD and phobias.Overwhelming preference for VR content, leading to neglect of activities essential for everyday life and normal social functioning.Overall, as with mobile phones, VR should be used carefully with children. In my own work on VR-based neurorehabilitation, we put a lot of effort into designing data gloves suitable for children. We never used headsets, as they are simply not suitable for small children - especially those with pre-existing neurological disorders. Personally, I would only use current-generation VR headsets on children whose head size has already reached that of a small woman, so that the immediate risk of physiological effects is minimized. The child should also have no known epilepsy risk, and corrected-to-normal vision with no visual field deficits. They should also be able to clearly communicate what is comfortable for them, both in terms of the ergonomics of the headset and the visual fidelity of what they are seeing on the displays. Exposure should be initially very short, with regular checks that the child is able to self-report any nausea, muscle pain or other effects.",2021-03-06T11:11:47.254Z,"Why do some people advise against children using virtual reality hardware?

We used to employ more than 1000 workers until 2009-10. After that we downsized our operations because imports were cheaper. Currently we shut it down because the math is no longer working out and we are producing at a loss. We are the main source of livelihood to the surrounding 5-10 villages. Since i belong to a mini-society which can be taken as a sample of a larger one, i shall answer the question from my perspective. What happens to the lower middle class? This class belongs to a group of workers who might be aged between 20-50. They work all their lives inside a mill or factory acquiring at the most 1 or 2 skills. If their company gets shut down, a guy aged 20-30 might be able to find and apply himself in a new job. But a person between 40-50 may not be able to do it because their best time was already behind them. Overall there will be a shift of workers from villages to towns and cities in search of job. In a village, these workers can live self sufficiently - they get affordable housing and food, and live their life in their own level of comfortability. Once they shift to a city, they will no longer have their comforts, their living standards get worse and what they earn may not be sufficient for their living. What affect does this have on the society? As someone mentioned, with all these changes, the lower middle class will shrink. But in which direction does it flow? It flows downward. Meaning lower middle class now becomes poverty class. With all these shifts, an uncertainty is cast on the future of the children of such class. There is a chance that a generation of them will lose their future. Why should we care? There was an answer which says words similar to ""lets not complain but move along"". In my opinion we should be more compassionate than that. I know that things like these are beyond my control. But i have listened to and seen the pain and suffering of my workers who are with us since the 90's. I am in my late 20's and i am more than confident that considering my education and work experience in a different country, i can start a new business(imports/exports etc). But same cannot be said about the 500-1000 workers who are now out of work. If my mill affected 5-10 villages, how many villages would 1000 mills affect? The least we could do is voice our concerns and depict their hardships on a wider forum. As Thomas L.

So that You as a user are just immersive in the VR world with some (depth information) stuff poped up to some extent enabling you to recognize depth. Long Answer: Immersion is basically an unique experience that is connected with the world of virtual reality. Over here the user whole exploring the three dimensional world of virtual reality will simply immerse into this make believe world as the real world. It is basically a feeling of involvement of the user in the virtual world intelligently designed by experts. They have the power to interact with this world. This unique combinations where the user can immerse as well interact with the simulations is known as Telepresence. This is devise by the famous computer scientist Jonathan Steuer. Thus the user forgets about his real world scenario, forgets his present identity, situation and life and immerses him in a world of imagination, adventure and exploration. He gets more focused about his newly created identity inside the Virtual Reality world. Types of Virtual Reality Environments There are many types of virtual reality environments, each with their own level of immersion and features. Some of which are below: Semi-Immersive Virtual RealityCAVE Fully Immersive Virtual RealityCollaborative Virtual EnvironmentsDepending on the type of environment, the level of immersion will differ. For instance, a semi-immersive environment doesn't aim for complete immersion, which allows it to operate at costs much less than the CAVE. On the other hand, total engagement is not possible, which the CAVE can easily accomplish. Collaborative environments are a special case in which they may or may not aim for complete immersion but the main goal is to share a virtual experience with real people. The type of virtual reality environment chosen is entirely dependant on budget and the goals of the project. For example, the air force uses a virtual reality flight simulator as a training tool. This is one example of a semi-immersive virtual reality environment. A fully immersive environment would just not necessary.

Virtual reality requires more effort. You have to put on a headset.You have to move your body.The problem is people don’t like to work hard when it comes to learning. However, if virtual reality helps you learn information better, then people might gravitate towards it.  Still, history shows us that people rather choose the less mentally taxing channel for learning even if it’s worse for absorbing information. For example, people can teach themselves everything they learn in college through online mediums such as Udemy and YouTube. It’s a faster way to learn better information than attending college. You get access to world-renowned experts at your fingertips! But people don’t like taking responsibility, so they lean on college to make decisions for them. Not a good idea. College leads to no applicable workforce skills and an average of $30K in debt. So, for the foreseeable future, the classroom setting will be on a laptop with instructional video and blog posts.

Auth0: This startup is leading the way for identity verification by combining existing login and identity verification options into a few lines of code that developers can quickly add to their applications. It’s led by former Microsoft Jon Kelsey after being “annoyed about how hard it was to integrate identity into apps”. It’s since raised $15M from Trinity Ventures and others to bolster its identity platform.Coding Dojo: Coding is a key aspect of the startup tech world and Coding Dojo wants to promote coding and make coding experts more accessible to founders and CEOs. It operates coding bootcamps in Seattle, Dallas, Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., Chicago and LA. It offers courses in Python, Ruby and other programming languages, teaching students the basic of coding in just 14 weeks. CEO Richard Wang has the aim of“[transforming] the lives of 1 million people through programming literacy by 2025.”WiBotic: WiBotic provides reliable wireless power to charge aerial, mobile and aquatic robot systems. How many times have you been stuck without battery on your phone? Well, the same applies for robots. WiBotic is creating the infrastructure for robots to charge whenever and wherever— so companies can focus on robot tasks rather than keeping their robots charged,” WiBotic CEO and co-founder Ben Waters says.M3 Biotechnology: M3 pulled in $10 million in funding to develop advanced therapeutics to wipe out neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s. “Where current therapies primarily address disease symptoms, M3 has patented … proprietary technologies differentiating itself to create disease-modifying treatments with the potential to restore lost connections between brain cells, turning degeneration into regeneration,” the company says. It’s compound has reversed both cognitive and motor deficits around neurodegenerative diseases, showing the power of tech in improving lives.Pixvana: Virtual reality is an exciting aspect of startup scenes, and Seattle’s virtual reality development is led by Pixvana. “With virtual reality video, people will tell new kinds of stories and it will require unique technology,” founder Forest Key says. They want to make sure that virtual reality reaches its full potential by making sure virtual reality experiences look amazing.So while it’s hard to narrow down the exciting startups in Seattle, these are a few of my favourites.

It can surely be determined that virtual reality will indeed affect lives going forward, here is how: Training and Development sector- Many industries may benefit from the inclusion of virtual reality solutions and applications. For example, pilots in training will need to learn how to handle an aircraft while in mid-flight, preparing for any manner of situations that may arise. VR steps in, taking the form of flight simulators, where these novice pilots are given real-life situations to thrive in, via the virtual reality mode.Health Sector- Similarly to the training and development sectors, by employing virtual reality options, medical practitioners that are still receiving training and education within this field are able to easily practice their diagnostic prowess, as well as surgical techniques without incurring any actual risks as would be a very real probability before the advent of VR solutions.Gaming- Gaming is the most obvious sector that would incorporate virtual reality systems, gaming and VR definitely go hand-in-hand. Facebook recently teamed up with the creators of the Oculus Rift headset, game players are able to get a feel for what VR gaming is bound to look like when it does take the leap and become available for mass consumption. From PS players to XBox players to PC game players, even ardent online casino game players may be able to optimize their gameplay if VR is incorporated within their various online slot gaming.Movies and Television- Its sure to be a complete game changer, the prospect of being able to enjoy a time when VR could be introduced to the film sector will no doubt equate to an entirely new way of watching films. This novel experience may include a type of viewing where individuals watching will determine which direction the film will go. The level of free-will operation when engaged in the virtual reality mode, by engaging in the predetermined virtual world.Check out to know more:How Virtual Reality participating in our life | huntsends Continue Reading",2021-03-06T11:18:11.547Z,"How do you think virtual reality devices will change our world?

At the moment it looks like superconducting circuits are the best candidate, and their commercialization might give some improvements to classical computer hardware in terms of energy efficiency and clock speeds. These circuits are also very sensitive to noise, and while that is generally A Bad Thing for computing, it is not so bad for sensing. Some of the best magnetic field sensors are SQUIDs, and can detect magnetic fields in the mT range. Sensors are like lasers in that the number of applications are really hard to imagine, but on the whole it should be a significant step forward. An expert on superconducting circuit technology (or other possible experimental realizations of quantum computers) could say more on this. In terms of what they will enable us to do computationally, there are very few quantum algorithms that give exponential improvements over classical ones. But this is not a requirement for innovation, and much of the time we only care about polynomial speedups over polynomial algorithms in practice. This makes sense when you think about scaling, because for someone running a 5-month job on half a supercomputer, square-root speedups start to look very attractive. These are small steps forward that also happen in classical algorithms research, but over time many of these compound and the pieces come together sometimes in a really dramatic way. If you are curious about these small steps for quantum, you can take a look at the Quantum Algorithm Zoo. It's important to remember that because we don't know the underlying architecture of the quantum processor, these speedups may be enhanced or negated in practice. There is one exception to the above, and that is the simulation of quantum systems. This gives an exponential improvement in the amount of memory required to simulate quantum states (time complexity is polynomial even for classical algorithms). It's difficult to understate how important this would be for materials science research, though I'm not an expert in the area. I do research in both machine learning and quantum computing, and I've written a quantum computer simulator that can run around 26 fully-connected qubits on my laptop. Back of the envelope calculations lead me to a figure of around 40 qubits for using all the memory on Titan, the fastest supercomputer in the U.S. On the other hand, I can do machine learning experiments with huge amounts of data on my laptop, which gives me a lot of freedom to try a lot of things out. I'd imagine that I could do just as much for a quantum computer if I could just play with it. I expect this to be the case for researchers who want to be able to tinker with simulations for different types of materials that have quantum mechanical aspects. This could give a significant boost to fields working on some bigger problems, like room-temperature superconductors, topological insulators, plasma containment, or protein folding. I'm just speculating on the actual applications that would benefit, of course. To finish this off, I like to think about this quote which you may have seen before:  ""I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."" --Thomas Watson, founder of IBM Probably one of history's worst predictions. But think about what happened after computers were commercialized and why that made this quote so incredibly untrue. Thousands (soon to be millions) of brains were pointed at the problem of programming a computer to do things they didn't want to do anymore. Quantum computing is a tiny young field right now, and an even smaller fraction of that is algorithms research, but someday a curious layman can read a few tutorials on the internet and start hacking on their own quantum chips. I don't doubt that there will be many significant applications of quantum computers discovered once they are available.",2021-03-06T11:19:17.693Z,"What are potential innovations that will stem from the successful development of quantum computing?

Now I don’t think there is anyone who is unaware of PCs or the Internet, unless you have been living off the grid inside a cave or some Island with a tribe. Virtual Reality is destined to witness an explosive growth. The question is WHEN? With every new technology, there has been a pattern. Initially the technology is in concept stage, it is researched and developed, there are prototypes and after a lot of testing and funding from tech juggernauts it is released in the market for the ordinary consumers. Radio, TV, Cell Phones, Refrigerators, Microwave, Etc…all these things were asked the same question but now we all know, without these the world feels like an incomplete place. Cellphones when introduced during the 80’s were a Vanity, only the rich could afford one and carrying one was a status symbol, either you were rich or someone of significant importance but now things are totally different and the younger generation is all surrounded by technology. So adapting to VR will not be much of a challenge. But VR has been facing a big challenge for quite many years, to understand about the future of VR is is important to emphasis on some of the strong reasons what has held VR back all this while. Now VR has been there for a while, it made its debut in the 50s and has constantly struggled to make an impact on the consumer market. It has tried to emerge out of the realm of research and development and has constantly tried to set a foot in the consumer market but has failed all the time and there are solid reasons for that.  It all began with Sensorama in 1957 which was a huge machine for upto 4 people to watch movies. While it claimed to be an immersive cinema experience, it turned out to be a gimmick and failed to impress the audiences but hey! atleast something began, it was the first of its kind and gave people an idea of what could be achieved. Eventually we moved on to head mounted displays or HMDs which were much smaller than the Sensorama but they all felt more of a prototype rather than offering any kind of an immersion. Through out the years various companies including Sega have tried making their own version of VR headsets, it was during 2010 when a young inventor Palmer Lucky, the founder of Oculus Rift (Which now belongs to Facebook) made a prototype which was convincing and gave an experience of true VR. Not only the Tech was smaller in size compared to what had come in the past, it offered a wide viewing angle and bolstered a pair of high resolution displays with minimal amount of head tracking latency. The tech seemed promising and big names started stepping forward to research and innovate the technology. So as things began to look bright, more and more people started supporting the kick starter and got hands on the prototype. In 10 years the VR landscape has changed drastically and many big tech companies have invested in VR, have contributed towards the research and development of the platform and have brought their own products into the market. These are companies like Oculus, Samsung, HTC, Microsoft, Valve, Nokia, Google, Sony and many more.  For the last decade there has been a lack of good content which will push VR sales in the market. Surprise fact If you are into PC gaming, chances are you must be aware of Doom.  It was during the late 80’s and Early 90’s when PCs were slowly getting more and more popular in the consumer market. iD software came up with Doom, the game was ground breaking and revolutionary for the time. It was so popular that it actually managed to outsell the then current version of Microsoft Windows and people only purchased PCs’ to play Doom and believe me, there is a Doom TV Commercial which features Bill Gates, it was so damn influential. Have a look:  This is the point I’m trying to make. Doom was the system seller. VR is currently at the same juncture and there is one contender in the market who can turn the odds and make VR mainstream in 2020. They are poised to do what Doom did back in 1993. If there is anyone who can do it, i believe it is them. Valve, the creators of Half-Life. A game which revolutionized the Video game industry for what it is today.  Not just gaming, once the market for VR grows, the possibilities will be limitless. Imagine all of your 5 senses pulled into a reality which is crafted by imagination. The possibilities are unimaginable. The experiences will be unparalleled. It will be nothing short of revolutionary. Content Creators, Medical Science, Defense Technology, Education sector, Digital Marketers, Movie Producers, Tourism, Shopping and so on. It is limitless.

It has been long since professionals got able to render super photorealistic 3D scenes out of modeling and animation tools: they can create a mount, a river, or a house, as well as various physical and chemical effects that are almost indistinguishable from reality, though fidelity of such models still have incremental improvements enabled by hardware and algorithmic advances. Leading Head Mounted Display(HMD) producers such as Oculus have also achieved noteworthy breakthrough such as dynamic focal plane, which would significantly boost fidelity and virtual comfort to watch VR contents. But, as VR users might have all noticed, human characters in VR, especially the faces, are still very cartoonish. That’s not because professionals are not able to model one that’s photorealistic. Check the example below, which represents how real modeler are actually able to make virtual humans:  The reason why such human models are not yet adopted in popular social VR platforms or VR games is that technology is not quite there where we can apply animation to these models so that they can have complicated facial expressions that live humans would have. A normal human has 43 facial muscles that enable her to show 10k+ distinct facial expressions, more than 3K of them being emotionally meaningful. On the other hand, we also have incredible ability to detect emotions based on subtle changes in facial expressions. Our minds learn about how facial expressions might imply slightly different emotions from different people. Without some substantial breakthrough in both model animation and expression detection on human faces, we would be no where near achieving behavioral realism for human characters. When a character has high visual realism (its appearance look like real humans) but is without behavioral realism (it doesn’t act like humans and deliver human emotions) that matches, it inevitably becomes weird and scary and falls into the uncanny valley.  To avoid it, VR developers had to sacrifice visual realism altogether and go for cartoonish characters.   Current efforts to help VR cross the uncanny valley center around developing hardwares and algorithms to detect and decode facial expressions on humans and reflect them on avatars in real time. Computing and neuroscience company MindMaze proposed a way last year. It announced the new MindMaze Mask, which is a ring of electrodes headset producers can install into their products. The mask detects a user’s facial expressions based on which parts of her facial skin is touching the detectors and with how much pressure they are touched, and then have the avatar reproduce one of 10 facial expressions based on these data. This is quite a promising and exciting design and hopefully would be welcomed by headset producers, although VR still has a long way to go until avatars can convey complex emotions that humans embrace.

Although he had already been working with it for some time at that point, I was just a child. He had defined it as the “simulation of reality”, based on the human senses. As such, he pointed out that since people have two eyes, VR must be stereoscopic. If they are not stereoscopic, the system is only surround video, not VR. Stereopsis is what gives VR the perception of immersion. However, since people do not have eyes in the back of their head, and are not continually spinning around, the field of view does not have to be 360 degrees. Not only that, but such visual coverage is undesirable for several reasons. At any one time, whichever direction a person was looking, about half the pixels could not be seen, and therefore were wasted. Since both eyes are required for perceiving voxels, even more of the perceivable volume than that was actually wasted with 360 degree systems. And, expecting the user to continually spin around is a severe imposition. Some years later, I met Mort in person, and we became partners on several projects. Conceding that people normally do look around to a limited extent, we did some empirical testing. We found that for many applications, a field of view encompassing about 230 degrees allowed a person to “look around” and observe as much or more than what would be seen in typical real-life situations. Also, that coverage could be attained without requiring stitching, and less wasted pixels and voxels. And, when doing live-action photography, there was no longer the problem of not finding anyplace to hide the crew. We used this to design systems that were much more economical and much more practical than 360 degree systems. They encompassed many other attributes as well. Unlike the visual part, audio should cover 360 degrees in all directions, since we can hear sounds from any direction, no matter which way we are facing. Although headsets are a convenient way to display VR images and sound, they are not the only way. We designed several different systems, including some that did use headsets and some that did not. He had regarded augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and extended reality (XR) as subsets of VR, with different amounts of opacity or transparency or coverage, but the same general perception. Each could (and should) include as many of the other human senses as practical. This is necessarily a very brief overview of only part of a much more complex concept.

Here are a few of the main ones: 1) Speed: it can take anywhere from one to twelve months to buy a company, and if both parties are interested, three to six months is pretty realistic.  There is extra time involved to then integrate this acquisition into your company, but it's still faster than building in many cases. Your existing employees aren't sitting around twiddling their thumbs, they have their own (presumably important) work to do, which they would need to complete and then transition to building a new prod Continue ReadingThere are many reasons why a company would buy a product, rather than build it.

There is extra time involved to then integrate this acquisition into your company, but it's still faster than building in many cases. Your existing employees aren't sitting around twiddling their thumbs, they have their own (presumably important) work to do, which they would need to complete and then transition to building a new product which could easily take much longer. 2) Intellectual Property: in some markets, the IP around a product may be more valuable than the product itself. Especially for very broad patents which could be used on additional products. Buying a small company for more money than they've ever seen could be cheaper as a capital expense than licensing the technology in all the ways you might want, plus it keeps it out of your competitors hands. 3) Competitors: One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was to ""hire the people you're afraid of having work against you."" If you think your competitor could benefit from the acquisition, you may be motivated to buy a company you don't even want or need, just so they can't get it. 4) Customer: A company may acquire a startup just to get their customers or market share. This is less common than you might think, but does happen, particularly in niche markets or for consumer products (with millions of users, typically). 5) Team: It's surprisingly expensive to recruit and vet a talented team, let alone one that's high performing and works well together.  It can be cheaper and faster to acquire a complete team, at times. 6) Market perception and ego: Surprisingly, a common reason is simply that it feels good to scoop a hot deal. Maybe a senior executive championed the acquisition and her reputation requires that she land it. Maybe it boosts the relevance and competitiveness in the eyes of analysts/customers/market.  Ego plays a big role in many deals. 7) Profit: Counterintuitively, profit motives are less frequent, but they do exist. There can be tax or accounting (balance sheet) advantages to deals, which may be a driver in some cases.  Legally, the board and executives have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders to maximize value, so at least nominally this is part of the deal. In practice, however, this probably is the justification more than the actual incentive. There are as many reasons to acquire as there are acquisitions, but most fit into one or more of the above patterns.",2021-03-06T11:30:08.061Z,"Why do big companies buy startups when they could do it themselves from the ground up?

This also gives employees a seemingly physical involvement which offers the satisfaction gained from a real training. 2. Work Collaboration in the Workplace Some companies have embraced virtual sharing to allow personnel to collaborate on assignments without relocating to one physical location. For example, where a company has remote workers from different geographical locations, it is necessary that they coordinate and complete tasks on time. Since teamwork is essential for a company’s success, VR technology makes it possible for workers to hold meetings through video conferencing and deliberate on issues. With this technology, employees can gather in the same room and consult without meeting face to face. This saves unnecessary travel and allows them to work on assignments concurrently and complete tasks within the shortest time possible. 3. Creating Ideas and Forecasting Trends Virtual reality allows businesses to come up with fresh ideas and perform tests before implementing them in the actual environment. This immersive technology allows companies to forecast trends and determine the performance of projects beforehand. Companies can determine their potential sales performance and customers’ growth in a virtual setting. In car manufacturing, for instance, the end product of a design can be tested to determine how well it will be accepted in the actual market. Engineers can test a car’s safety in a virtual setting before the actual manufacturing process begins. Potential customers can also test drive the vehicles using virtual reality headsets before making purchase decisions. Consequently, this helps in making the production process efficient: allowing companies to come up with the best products that satisfactorily meet the goals of the end users. 4. Pain Management Uses of virtual reality in medicine are widespread. For example, this technology has been used in pain management for patients undergoing treatments that inflict insurmountable pain such as cancer. Each treatment pain of the cancer patient can be helped and managed. Consider other high pain treatments such as, high degree burns, physiotherapy treatments, broken limbs, and open wounds. When patients wear VR headsets, the technology is used to distract their brain and confuse the pain pathway by drawing their minds from the suffering. Dentists are also using the technology to soothe patients when extracting their teeth or conducting root canals and other dental surgeries. 5. Training Medical Students The virtual reality technology is used to assist medical students to learn and acquire work experience faster. With this use of virtual reality in education, medical students can learn how to conduct delicate surgical procedures. Since the procedures can be time-consuming and risky, VR helps the students to perform real surgeries without putting the lives of patients in danger. The trainees can also use this technology to increase their hours of practice in a virtual setting, eliminating the fear of risk on real patients. 6. Treatment of PTSD Post-traumatic stress disorder is common among soldiers due to the trauma they were exposed to during combat. This disorder has become more widespread than previously thought. PTSD is also found in the general population and is not limited to the combat soldier. PTSD is a mental disorder that faces anyone who has undergone petrifying experiences, both physically and mentally, such as sexual assault, abuse, and road accidents. Virtual reality can assist in treating the fears in patients with PTSD by helping them to replay what they went through. As a result, reliving the experiences can help the medical team to understand the patients’ conditions and come up with ways to help them cope better. 7. Training on Social Cognition to Manage Autism The number of patients suffering from autism, a social developmental disorder, has been on the rise. This problem has mainly been attributed to the increased awareness about the condition among parents and guardians – but may have many other causal conditions, including environment. Autism impairs the reasoning, interaction, and social skills of patients. Virtual reality technology can help in managing the condition by boosting the patients’ brain activity and imaging. This can be achieved through introducing the patients and parents to different social scenarios and then using medical and psychological training teaching both guardian and patient about the best usage behavior in each situation. This gives each the opportunity to practice before the occasion arises. 8. Managing and Treating Anxiety Disorder Anxiety creates a sense of panic in patients. Some describe their feelings as the individual feeling as if they have lost the ground beneath their feet. Some have chest pain or feel like they must escape to a safer location. A notable symptom of anxiety is breathing difficulties. This symptom and many other variables that the patient deals with can be monitored, explained and controlled using virtual reality. The medical team can use functional apps fused with the VR technology to monitor the individual patient’s breathing patterns and offer appropriate scenarios for the patient to consider and choose. If needed the medical team can quickly administer anxiety medication thus saving the time lapse between traditional medicinal responses. 9. Therapy for Paraplegics Persons and patients with differing physical abilities can have the opportunities to use VR tools to experience the thrills of various environments without being confined to their physical locations. Notably, VR headsets are being used to enable paraplegics to build back their brain functions and regain control of limbs. This is one of the most exciting uses of this new VR technology and can’t be overemphasized for those in this suffering state. 10. Leisure The tours and travels industry has largely benefited from the virtual reality technology. For example, the industry has been using this technology to give clients a feel of various holiday destinations around the world. Clients can visit different destinations in a virtual setting before making travel choices. In this way, the world becomes a place where all who wish to can learn and immerse themselves in other cultures and traditions. This can lead entire generations to a greater understanding and appreciation for people globally. If someone doesn’t have access to what it take to reach a destination physically, they can still visit these locales and experience the greatness offered in these regions of the world. Learning such a wide serving technology has become quite easy where ever your in the world with just an computer and internet connection you can easily learn it from your home and bring up your own ideas and skill in VR.if you want to experience and gain more knowledge about VR just visit SP Robotic Works - Learn and Build Online to Become VR Developer . they are India’s most leading Robotic community providing a world class teaching and skill development to their students and Roboteers. so have a look which might be helpful for your future to be a part of future technology Hi,Previously VR was generally associated only with the gaming industry. Now it’s on fire with new opportunities for use.it is amazingly being applied in various fields to manipulate physical surroundings. VR allows its users to experience the real environment in more immersive ways. Here are 10 amazing uses of virtual reality today. 1. Recruitment and Training The corporate sector has largely benefited from the revolutionary technology.

Let us take back to the year 1996 when the computers had disk space in the order of GBs and RAM on the magnitude of MBs.

(non-complementary) Computers (as in computation speed, scalability and optimization)Energy (as in efficiency and alternative resources)Economy (as in development of technology with few economical resources)Comfort and Integration (how much of our lives will be liked with technology)Health (how do that increasingly lazy and home-bound people will thrive to live a healthy life)Environment (how can we live peacefully without harming our fellow species)Development of Instruments and Sciences (how do we break our knowledge barriers e.g finally build an Alcubierre Drive or make a teleporter or connect human minds or the likes of ""impossibles"")Each of these sectors can further be divided into three broad parts, Profitability, Sustainability and Innovation. We need to actually hit the ""G-Spot"" among these three. As a new start-up has to find a a sweet spot among these to claim its spot in the pages of history and call itself ""Successful"". Please allow me to write about this question despite lacking the knowledge of future. The following piece of text is a ficional work to create an illusion of the future, the unknown. Not an accurate simulation. We all lack too much information. You may ask why did start with 2050? I was supposed to foresee the near future. Not 34 years into it. But the point is, we are always preparing for the future. If we create a vision of 2050, then we know where to go and our research should be about how to reach there. and if it is parallel to the masses, it will be popular and people will be come to buy it. Advertisement Media Well, the driving force behind the internet, how do we promote our products. Though, limited to ""smart"" algorithms, a lot of work needs to be done behind this. Simply, knowing more and more about a human's interests or the context does not help. It is helping, but people will soon adapt to it and less advertisements will be successful. It is harmful for both the Ad-agency, the end user and the company. So, the advertisement media should really come forward and make a ground breaking research onto how to boost its clients' revenue in order to sustain itself. A person's interests might not help. Like I often search on Google about Cars and I get a lot of car advertisements the following day. But what Google does not know is that, I am camouflaging my interests from Google. why? Simply because I don't want my ads to be like ""Get laid in 27 days"" or ""How to get slimmer in just 2 weeks"".  Rather, I would prefer those ads to be seen in private. For example, in my Google+ profile at 11PM. When no one is really with me. But that isn't the case and I simply can't see those ads in a public computer. While checking my facebook or in some other pages. So, apart from behavioristic metrics, certain other metrics such as time, mood, financial ability, selection of products, frequency of purchasing, type of consumed content and a lot other features. I would also like to see other methods of monetization outside the internet. In broadcast TV, there is virtually no personalized ads at all. If television subscriptions could be subsidized and the advertisements be genuine, I see a potential. Let me put it in a context. I am watching Cricket, since, upon subscription, I have created an account online, with the knowledge of my search history, channel, content and interest, along with time. I might be greeted with an advertisement about weight loss. And there might be a button to know more. which will send the whole program to my email. And I might just check it out after the match is over. Which provides the advertiser a unique opportunity to make more money and that will translate to the ad-agency. Sure, for it, a lot of integration needs to be done. and significant increase in investments and research. But the potential is much more. And it is surely sustainable Virtual Reality The internet, by all means wants to be real. It needs to be integrated with your life to the point that the world becomes a point. Singularity. While thats far from being real. The more real the virtual world becomes, the more people will spend time on the e-world. We now have online banking, online dating, online cab booking. But it all takes place is somewhat of a cumbersome manner. A person feels horny at night, opens laptop, due to behavior analysis, Google Chrome shines up. Goes to Chrome, enters pornhub, pornhub has his analysis, suggests the right genre. Or he presses a button in his glasses. And gestures pornhub, with motion tracking, it opens pornhub and shows him only a few selections. He chooses the right option by swiping hands like Tony Stark and indulges in self-satisfaction. While playing, instead of showing those useless ads saying, meet teens from your area, there might be no distractions, him being a suscribed customer. But he might be interested in some pizza or a bar party or maybe a bottle of vodka which can be shown to him after he finishes watching! This is a really extreme case. Most other integrations would be rather subtle yet significant. The aim is to generate revenue, and by integrating it with ones' life, we generate it. But privacy is a major concern. The more computers become intelligent, the more we should be afraid of them. If I save my card on the computer, it can now purchase things, with just the input of a PIN and the right selection. one and a half decade back, saving on phone meant, ""Save as draft"" and enter it on the kiosk. Similarly, one and half decade into the future, we might just be waving our card in front of our glasses, touch our fingers on our smartwatch, select the brand of whiskey and done, the nearest drone will fly to us in no time. Carrying the spirit of the future. (pun intended) Additionally, deep integration, like a mic in the buttons (cost effectively) and a earphone in the glasses (or collars) might help in calling wirelessly. Given that the earphone can be hidden in a way that is not cumbersome, is light weight and lasts quite some time (better if we could use our muscular energy to power it though) Quantum Computing While still a dream, research should be put into it. If the quantum nature of particles at the lowest levels could really be harnessed, nothing would stop this start up from being a brand. Admittedly, suited for NASA though. Alternative and Renewable Sources of energy While a lot of renewable and sustainable sources of energy is currently in use, i see less of them in day-to-day life. Like, we push usage of bicycles. But bicycles don't have headlamps, horns, from a single source of energy. It is rather intriguing. We can, with our current knowledge of technology, make a bicycle, that can have a LED headlamp, horn, a digital display and maybe a GPS or a phone (charger) or maybe a mp3 player. All driven through our feet. For interfacing, we can have microcontrollers, sensors, and buttons embedded onto the ""dashboard"". With perfect selection of materials, good road and motivation, we can ride from our home to office on our ""feet"" without losing the convenience. In normal traffic, we don't run significantly faster than a bicycle, if we consider that a bicycle is indefinitely cheaper to operate and loses that layer of fat from the sagging neck as well.  From thereon, with Visible Light Communications and other technologies, we can easily save the environment. Say, we make a plant, that can relay visual light information, we can actually use a plant to wire our broadband connection. And also help in photosysthesis. Other than that, a plant has so many things going in itself, so many reactions, and it also gives out energy. Without cutting a tree, if we learn to use its energy (without burning fire; overly futuristic, but it has to be considered, I have given a practical example above). We might just have a better planet. Apart from that, we can have vegetarian computers!! How cool is that? Apart from these overly futuristic ideas, we might just have motorcycles that run on electricity, with denser cells, recharging stations and better mileage. Also, we don't harness our energy. During our school days, we all made a project where we revved a motor to light up a bulb. We don't use that at all. In mechanical ages, we had springs to store our energy that used to run clocks, while the clocks were inaccurate, the energy was adequate to run a modern day digital clock for a MUCH longer period. If we just wind up a digital clock (or power bank), we can have a sustainable technology that just works with our energy. In theory, that will benefit our health and work out our fats as well. And no! the research won't cost you a fortune either. Save the planet earth, from ozone to stray dogs, everything is benefial If we think the right way. While we can't help being a non-vegetarian (what sin did those poor plants do? They are living beings as well), we can't surely help with killing of stray animals that just rots and invites bacteria. We can decompose a body, technologically, derive energy from it. Or we take those decomposers and use their skill of deriving energy from the deceased, reverse it, ""charge"" them and make bio fertilizers from electricity and elements which are not ""decomposed"" by them. Apart from it, in the near future, we can encourage energy saving pracices and the government should mandate it. Plantation should result in increase in the subsidies and lack thereof should be penalized financially. If we lose money by cutting trees uselessly, we will automatically stop. Trees equals money. As start ups, we can provide eco friendly solutions, such as muscular energy, solar energy and mechanical energy. Which can in turn, be integrated with other solutions such as virtual reality which in turn be integrated with an ad-agency which in turns gathers information from our web. That kind of development can actually take the world by storm, ah sorry, I would say a blizzard. Health How do we encourage health benefits? How, on earth, can we motivate people to run on a treadmill when the deep integration of internet to intranets to internet of things delve onto making people lazy. Simple. Make their energy seen. A human releases serious energy while working our, if a treadmill is integrated with a small turbine, which in turn charges a power bank, we can finally be happy with that. and we can also ""measure"" our levels with the released energy. Other than that, we can make it available to public gymnasiums. And I bet, I would go into a gym to charge my phone. Or maybe charge a battery that can be fitted onto my bicycle that will drive it when I feel a bit tired. Or maybe, I take that battery, and fit it onto the coffee maker and my gym workout makes me a coffee. No doubt, a lot of energy will be wasted. But currently, our 100% energy is wasted while we lose fat. But we can actually convert those fats into a cell and power it to use it in a creative manner while we are gaining muscles. It is like a win-win situation and a big turn on (motivation) for the lazy and the people who don't like to spend money much.  Verdict There are a lot of sectors that a stat up can focus on. It has to change peoples' lives. For the better. While being nearsighted helps in generating revenue. Being a little bit farsighted and aspired sustains that revenue. If we care about our environment, our environment will surely care for us. While some of ""ideas"" that I put here might be way too futuristic. They are not bad. And some of them are attainable in a relatively shorter term. I didn't focus on the web or the phone. But the smartwatches, IoT and other VRs have a potential to easily outwit the convenience of the phone. Phones have a lot of features, packed into a compact package. While it definitely helps us, but having other devices, seemingly unimportant, might one day help us significantly. The phone is here to stay. But the other form factors of this device can not be ignored. They will be great. At the same time, deeper integration with our lives will help. And sources of energy is a valuable factor. If we can sustain a renewable energy, it will help our civilization in the long run. Thank you for reading. Hope it gives you an idea, some motivation and some vision on how the future might be.

Add tiled displays, optics, mechanical and ergonomic structure, etc and the cost of the unit would soar. This meant that only serious users could afford it, and at $20,000 or something a pop, that could only be the military and, defence the aerospace industries. Then came the smartphone boom, and with it the pixel density wars. This made traditional LCDs a viable contender for the displays for HMDs. Although the first Oculus had a 7 inch LCD with 1280x768 resolution, which was more inline with the industrial grade LCDs available for some time at that time, which led to horrendous screen door effect, It showed that the tech was viable and gave the masses a taste of VR. Previously, due to poorly design earlier consumer targeted designs, and due to poor marketing and awareness, the VR HMD was not considered a viable product in the consumer space. Oculus had the marketing nailed. Even though they show a “work in progress” design, they focused on the correct selling point, and promised vehemently to improve the weaknesses.

It not necessary that you should go to the offline colleges there are many online colleges that are providing courses which are much better than online colleges. If you would go for online courses then you can find time to improve on your skills on the more important thing that matter to you that is the VR, for that you can do some workshops etc and simultaneously you would be doing your course from one of the colleges that would offer online Computer Science Degrees. In this way, you can get two things done simultaneously at one go. What are some virtual reality jobs? Some of virtual reality jobs include research engineer, programmer or software developer, interaction designer, system analyst. Virtual reality research engineer, for example, performs the research related with VR in the company. You need to know in deep and detail on VR and exploring on how to improve its technology and platform in various ways.  Where to start? A degree in art/technology/ design or maths and coding are all useful bases from which to launch yourself into a career in virtual reality development. An undergraduate or postgraduate degree in any of the above could be really helpful for getting your foot in the door, especially with big companies. The internet is full of useful resources that you can use to hone your skills and gain more specific experience in virtual reality beyond your degree. Not only a degree in computer science since VR is a wide area with factors that will combine various factors. It includes Computer science, Applied mathematics, Psychology, some aspects of neural science, and some designing skills. So, it is important to have a hang of all of these to have a successful career in VR. If we have to choose one of the above-mentioned aspects the most important thing that you should know apart from computer science is designing. So it would be that just like computer science degree, you can also go for an online Design degree. This would increase your employability chances. As per the online platform The Statistics Portal, the number of active virtual reality users worldwide is predicted to reach 170 million by 2018. The VR market is expected to grow very fast and it would be growing at an approximate increase of 3000%.  VR is the creation of virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we believe that we are really there.

Emergence of Augmented Reality will Fuel Virtual Reality Augmented reality is VR’s sister industry. Based on statistics the augmented/mixed reality industry will be MUCH larger than VR by 2023. Virtual reality’s reboot started in 2012 with Oculus’ Kickstarter being successfully funded and purchased by Facebook. Why? VR from a time standpoint is much more time-consuming than augmented reality. Additionally, Magic Leap is one of the most funded startups in history. ML promises a mixed reality device that is coming soon for creators this year. Many speculate and say VR won’t take off because it can’t be used in public or in tandem with other activities. I believe this is a narrow point of view and doesn’t address all of the uses that VR will mostly be used in entertainment, and other completely immersive scenarios. Common usage of augmented reality will lead people to fully immersive virtual reality experiences. By the time AR picks up in the coming years, VR content and experiences will be much better and appeal more to mainstream audiences rather than the current niche uses. Limitless Unfathomable Experiences I interviewed Jay Samit on the Humans 2.0 Podcast. Jay is a major influencer in the world of mixed reality technology. He brought up a very interesting point during our conversation. He said when the iPhone came out, nobody had any idea what kind of mobile applications we could use. The early app store was filled with fart and gun apps with no real utility or purpose. Point being, even if VR / AR is being used for mundane trivial applications today, it doesn’t mean it will look that way in 5 years. Due to limited processing power virtual reality experiences are quite limited. Imagine the future metaverse as a limitless world of intention and thought. Virtual Reality is an idea of fully immersive technology-mediated dream worlds. Rendered mind spaces where the only limit is your imagination. My favorite example of an unfathomable VR experience today is GE Healthcare’s virtual reality specialty software. It can help radiologists, doctors, and surgeons better read the human body, perform diagnoses and make their decisions. The VR app lets Doctors step inside internal organs and navigate, travel forward from side to side, and even search for polyps and other tumors. . 5G Networks Are the Gateway Today, VR/AR developers are limited by various factors like thermal efficiency, sensor, multimedia technologies and other technical factors. Slowly but surely computer architecture innovations, such as heterogeneous computing, have improved power and thermal efficiency. Integration efficiency has improved due to better transistors and Moore’s Law. Optimized algorithms, such as motion tracking, run better on the hardware. However, the real gateway for amazing unlimited experiences for VR/AR in an increasingly mobile world…is 5G networks. According to NBC news, 5G networks are projected to bring three benefits to the masses. Faster speed: Data transfer speeds are projected to be about 10 times higher with 5G than is possible with 4G. Expect significantly faster transmission of images, videos, and immersive content. With 4G/LTE, downloading a high-definition movie might take about 10 minutes. With 5G, it is reported to take less than a second.Shorter delays: Though it’s not always noticeable, there is often a brief lag in time from when data is sent to when it’s received. 5G should reduce this so-called latency, making it possible, for example, to watch high-speed virtual reality video with no delays or glitches.Increased connectivity: Cell towers equipped with 5G technology would have greatly increased capacity over 4G/LTE. Which means more people with devices should be able to communicate at the same time without any volume lag errors.5G is the fuel that will lead to extraordinary innovation in not just virtual and augmented reality, but also broader technologies like IoT and how we connect with each other on the internet. The industry will Develop Universal Protocols and Frameworks Virtual reality can be a bit confusing and even intimidating for newcomers looking to join. Most frequently, I hear issues about compatibility and how content is distributed and even how VR games look and feel with controls. Just like the Web has brought out API’s SDKs, OS, virtual reality is converging into a collected and unified platform. Voluntary guidelines and standards are sure to improve the industry for consumers and developers. Organizations are on the move to achieve this future goal like the VRARA, IEEE, VRSB, and the Virtual Reality Industry Forum (VRIF). IEEE announced that a working group will establish definitions, categories of VR and AR devices, and standards for quality, user interfaces, and file formats.

For the last 10 or 15 years, amusement experiences have been kind of in stasis - certainly there are incremental improvements in theming and servo control that have allowed pretty elaborate things to happen. But you’re still manipulating physical objects, using pyrotechnics, etc. In the next ten years, I see the guys building hardware for ‘big experiences’ coming up with lots of novel ways to leverage VR and AR to make better amusement rides and better simulation experiences. Simulator rides that were Pretty Fun without VR become absolutely mindblowing with it (as one of the guys behind Force Dynamics I can attest to this). And AR has the potential to turn, say, roller coasters into something else entirely - what, we don’t know, but the hardware behind rides and experiences will change drastically to take advantage of these changes. There are already hybrid VR experiences like this, but they’re mostly repurposed standard amusement hardware. Once people see what they can ‘get away with’ with VR, the hardware will change to take advantage of new options, and companies that build that hardware will benefit. VR and AR, in my opinion, are at their best not as standalone output devices but when used in concert with other hardware - not just controllers but anything from interactive simulators up to whole worlds you can touch and feel (The Vision of Infinite Dimensions) - and there will be big chunks of businesses that spring up to fill that need. Many of them probably don’t even exist yet, but look for a few small companies to make waves followed by big arcade and amusement players jumping in.",2021-03-06T11:36:25.381Z,"Which hardware companies will grow because of VR and AR?

It seems like more and more, technology is changing almost on a daily basis. According to Kelly (2010) Most change in the past cyclical: A forest was cleared for a field and then a farm was abandoned; an army came and then an army left. Droughts followed floods, and one king, either good or evil, succeeded another. For most humans, for most of the time, real change was rarely experienced. What little change did happen occurred over centuries That doesn’t really follow suit with how technology is being developed. For example, companies like Samsung and Apple are releasing new phones before their old models are even out of the packages. Xbox and Playstation are coming up with new systems regularly, making systems that have only been out a year or two obsolete. Ways to make our graphics better, our gaming experiences more rewarding, and our calling more efficient are constantly being discovered. Technology wants to grow, and it is. But that still doesn’t really fit with what Kelly’s comment about humans experiencing change as a very slow process. These companies, such as Apple, think they have to come out with something bigger and better every year to appeal to the masses. Is that what humans really want though? But that still doesn’t really fit with what Kelly’s comment about humans experiencing change as a very slow process. These companies, such as Apple, think they have to come out with something bigger and better every year to appeal to the masses. Is that what humans really want though? While some people were excited, many reacted negatively, not understanding why Apple was releasing this as opposed to making what already exists better (for example, many complained that the Apple charging cords are fragile and the wires break easily). Technology is continuing to grow at a rapid rate, but I’m not sure that it’s necessarily because technology wants that. It’s more so because companies feel the constant need to be the best of the best and outdo each other. Instead of developing the technology we already have, and making it the best it possibly can be, new technology is constantly being released without enough testing. Apple’s new iOS comes to mind. When iOS 9 was released, many people were wary of the new operating system because Apple is notorious for releasing operating systems with a lot of bugs. This one was no difference. There was a slew of bugs and issues that needed fixed, and Apple has released a few updates to the OS, because instead of releasing it when it was ready, they cranked out a new system that was supposed to be “better.” With App Clips, users have a fast and easy way to discover apps through new visual indicators called App Clip codes, as well as through NFC, shared links, and more. App Clips launch within a few seconds, immersing the user into a piece of the full app experience and giving developers a fun, new way to reach customers exactly when their app is most useful. Once inside the App Clip, users can easily install the full app with a single tap.  This year, Apple is providing developers with even more ways to deeply integrate their apps into core platform features in order to deliver powerful functionality in a way that also protects user privacy and security. The new Find My network accessory program lets third-party device makers take advantage of a network with hundreds of millions of devices, while continuing to offer end-to-end encryption so only the user can see the location of their item. HomePod also has a new program to integrate third-party music services. Email and browser app developers can offer their apps as default options, selectable by users. And Safari for Mac is adding support for the popular WebExtensions API used by Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, making it easy for extension developers to work with Safari, and distribute through the Mac App Store. Xcode is at the center of all development on Apple’s platforms, and with Xcode 12, it has a fresh new look to match macOS Big Sur. New document tabs make opening multiple files fast and lightweight to support interface files, and logs and project files each open in their own tab. Navigator fonts now match the system size, or can be set to small, medium, or large. And Xcode 12 builds macOS Universal apps by default to support new Macs with Apple silicon. Debuting alongside macOS Catalina at WWDC 2019, Mac Catalyst made it easy for developers to bring their iPad apps to the Mac. With macOS Big Sur, Mac Catalyst apps automatically inherit the spacious new design, while giving developers powerful new APIs and greater control over the behavior of their apps. And now developers can choose to keep their Mac app scaled at a resolution to match their iPad app, or take total control of their Mac interface to create a truly custom Mac experience. Developers can distribute their Mac Catalyst apps to customers in 175 countries on the Mac App Store, and let customers easily enjoy apps and in-app purchases across Mac, iPhone, and iPad with universal purchase. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

Only 14% Of Virtual Reality Device Purchases Are Made By Women A 2016 report surveyed 4 million U.S. consumers and found that females make up only 14.3% of online shoppers who purchased a console game and a virtual reality device. Interestingly, females account for 44.6% of online shoppers who bought a console, mobile, and PC games. It seems that females are interested in gaming, but not necessarily virtual reality yet. I also found the number of active VR users worldwide and it is very interesting to see how it’s growing throughout the years and this is a great example to demonstrate that the industry it’s growing each year.  Retrieved from The Statistics Portal The global virtual reality market size was valued at USD 960.9 million in 2016 and expected an exponential growth over the forecast period from 2014-2025, said Grand View Research. The projected market potential benefits from diverse and affordable VR devices, and its ability to be incorporated into the widespread application from commercial to medical fields. The considerable market potential attracts many tech companies to share the big pie. Although the VR market is highly dynamic, the competition is also very intense, requiring the tech companies to upgrade their products consistently.  Image retrieved from Statista Virtual reality is a hot topic in the field of science and technology. It is assumed that the cost of hardware and the complexity of production are the obstructions for the massive adoption of virtual reality. However, the experts from the VR industry have different opinions. Virtual reality is an underestimated field that could bring changes to medical therapy, professional training, and life experiences for both consumers and business beyond videos and games.

Although the VR industry is still in the valley currently, it is rising steadily. As the technology develops, devices such as VR headsets and VR cameras are getting more affordable and providing a better experience, data transmission becomes faster, the barrier to produce and enjoy VR content is lower than what it was before, which allow more people get access to enjoy VR content. After they get to know VR, the demand for more quality VR content would grow, which stimulus the expansion of VR market. The future of VR content is to be more interactive and engaging. The earlier virtual reality was almost exclusively gaming trend, but VR game and videos have an implicit boundary. The main theme is to engage the audience. Unlike the traditional film viewers who passively accept the information that the filmmakers want to convey, the audience who wears VR headsets can interact with the story to decide the direction of the story. In other words, the ending depending on how the audiences choose in the interactive components. Therefore, the audiences become the characters and have the power to control the VR stories.

With the development of cloud computing, and the social acceptance of data aggregation, we're gathering a tremendous amount of information about everyone and everything. Some companies have been doing this in niche cases (such as Google and search), but data from everywhere, and everything, is now being collected and correlated. IoT will be playing a big part in all of this. One of the biggest hurdles in this area comes from the need to figure out what the data really represents, and how to translate that data into valuable knowledge. This is where machine learning plays its part. Machine learning can often be considered a way of finding answers to questions you didn't know to ask. For example, power and water consumption may increase proportional to the amount of warm beer sold on a single day in the states with teams in the SuperBowl. With the right metrics, maybe it's determined that this is because the beer needs to be chilled, and the fridge is accessed 20x as much as normal, and the number of toilet flushes increases as well. As a result, when a state gets a team in the SuperBowl, based upon the amount of beer sold, you could predict more accurately how much water and electricity would be consumed. This is a silly example, but it's meant to show how additional insights can be derived from seemingly innocuous data. While there's always the concern regarding privacy and security, it's the consumer that determines whether the tradeoff is worth it. A stranger will be shocked if you were to ask them if they enjoyed their ribeye at Lefty's Restaurant last Tuesday, and yet they posted this information to the Internet for billions to see. This only becomes a concern when they observe it used in a way other than that which they originally intended. However, on a positive note, this enables you to specify your desired contents for your kitchen and pantry, and your Internet connected trash can will know what you've used, your stove will know what you've fried, your microwave will know what you've cooked, and your shopping list could be automatically generated for you instantly. With the right automation, your food could be ordered when it is most cost effective, and delivered to your front door, making grocery runs a thing of the past. You're also able to specify your meals for a week, and order only what's necessary for the meals, but excluding what you already have in your kitchen and pantry. You are able to ask your automated home, ""What can I make from the ingredients already in my house, and using leftovers from meals made over the previous week?"" You'll get a list of potential meals, their recipe, a weblog and video showing you how to make it, projected into your eyes by your HoloLens, while you Skype with your Grandma and watch a movie on your ceiling. Big data is already here. We just have to determine how to make the most of it. Currently, it's Big Data and Machine Learning.

It is assumed that the cost of hardware and the complexity of production are the obstructions for the massive adoption of virtual reality. However, the experts from the VR industry have different opinions. Virtual reality is an underestimated field that could bring changes to medical therapy, professional training, and life experiences for both consumers and business beyond videos and games. Speaking of virtual reality, the first thing people think of might be watching 360 videos. However, most people might consider such immersive experiences as passive ones while ignoring the active interactions. Like the traditional 2D videos, 360/VR videos add the fascinating stereo sounds and visual effects to reinforce the immersive experience, but more could be achieved beyond this point, such as designing more interactive components and more dynamic storylines. Eddie Lou, founder of Sandman Studios, pointed out that the passive and active interactions are not mutually exclusive. It is more about storytelling. For example, Fresh Out, an animation produced by Sandman Studios and selected by 2018 Venice Film Festival, has more than one ending depending on how the audiences choose in the interactive components. In other words, the story is dynamic and unpredictable. In this case, the animation could be considered as a game or an interactive story.  In fact, there could be no explicit boundary between VR games and videos. They both require comprehensive storylines, visual effects, and interactive elements. However, more VR content creators may be familiar with VR videos while not all of them know a lot about VR games. VR films can be the potential tool to turn those audiences to the players, said Hugh Hou. Huge Hou, Co-founder of CreatorUp, has collaborated on a VR horror film called Willow’s House recently. It engages multiple players to participate in the film, play the roles and communicate with each other, which is more like a game, or even a social tool. Most importantly, like Fresh Out, the players can decide the direction of Willow’s House. “VR content is still in the preliminary stages in the consumer-oriented market,” said Karen Zu, Marketing VP of PICO technology. After the audiences purchase the VR headsets, how to turn them into active users is still challenging for the whole industry. To solve that, thinking about how to improve the interactive experience would be a key factor. What Is The Role Of VR In Business World? When creators are struggling to create a comprehensive storyline and immersive VR experiences for the audience, corporations and organizations have already started to apply VR to their business. The two most significant applications are medical therapy and professional training. A study found that VR could be used to treat phobias. “In a clinical trial of a new virtual reality treatment for fear of heights, participants reported being much less afraid after using the program for just two weeks,” the study said.  Shuai Yuan, Chief Growth Officer of insta360, shared a story accordant with the study results. A doctor from New York used insta360 Pro to treat autism and PTSD patients by filming the things that his patients were afraid of, the subway for instance, and showed to his patients. By doing that, the patients can experience whatever they are afraid of in a safe environment, which helps them overcome their fears. Zu mentioned how VR used to treat drug addictions. Therapists will get the individual with the addiction put on a VR headset and navigate them through various scenarios. By using the exposure to the drugs they are misusing in a virtual environment, the therapists can monitor patients’ responses and teach them the coping skills. Professional training is another field that VR has widespread uses. There are many professions in which making mistakes can be disastrous, such as those of a surgeon, pilot, soldier, race-car driver or other professionals. Because the simulative training in these fields has always been a challenge, a virtual environment can sufficiently help them prepare for the real-world scenarios. What Is the Next Tipping Point For Virtual Reality? There are still some glitches VR needs to fix before it becomes massive-marketable, but VR will continue to evolve in an ongoing process. One consensus was that social-driven content will accelerate the spread of VR. “Only social-driven content will increase the interaction amongst people, which makes the users stay longer on the platform,” Shuai Yuan said. This viewpoint can’t be denied since we’ve already witnessed the success of multiple-player games. Although the preconditions for the massive adoption of VR are sufficient, the popular beliefs in VR are limited. “The VR headsets are cheap enough, and the contents are adequate,” said Kevin Leung, GM of HTC Vive Shenzhen and Director of Vive X. He added, “Many people don’t understand VR, but they could spend plenty of times watching 2D videos. The real problem is how to change the perceptions for VR.”  Other problems need to be fixed before the massive adoption of VR are fill the knowledge gap and build the relevancy with the audience. “The VR education is costly,” Zu mentioned. “There is no efficient medium to teach people what VR is and how to use it.” Therefore, the audiences don’t know how VR can be relevant to their real life. The tipping point for VR might reach three to five years later because of the high education costs. “The market penetration is still low in China,” Leung said. “There are so many opportunities for VR, but the key is how to position it (in the market).“ The global virtual reality market size was valued at USD 960.9 million in 2016 and expected an exponential growth over the forecast period from 2014-2025, said Grand View Research. The projected market potential benefits from diverse and affordable VR devices, and its ability to be incorporated into the widespread application from commercial to medical fields. The considerable market potential attracts many tech companies to share the big pie. Although the VR market is highly dynamic, the competition is also very intense, requiring the tech companies to upgrade their products consistently.

Maybe it's something to get used to. Maybe the hardware still needs to improve. Maybe human beings will always need to take breaks when using VR. Into the unknown As is so often the case with new technology, there are many unknowns. Further studies into how VR impacts brain function are required to understand the potential pros and cons, while discourse on the social implications of the technology is equally important. Like most things in life there are potential risks but, used wisely, virtual reality will bring positive experiences to millions. Tripping over wires The latest disadvanced of VR systems is about cables. The Vive, Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR coming later this year all are tethered by thick bunches of wires leading back to your PC or game system. After using these systems in self-contained demos and in-work settings, you cand got tangled. Full-room VR like the Vive means walking around with a long cable trailing behind you and across the floor. The cable can sometimes snakes around your legs or under the feet.

It's great for narrative games and 360 films where you want different emotions associated with different positions and directions of gaze within an experience. Scoring for VR usually sucks compared to films or games, as there is no director or television framing the action. The user choses where to look in VR, and if there is a different emotional state in front of or behind the user, traditional scoring can't tell that story in a meaningful way.

A few misconceptions: VR is a new field It’s not. It’s been used extensively in research since many years. VR induces vergence-accommodation sickness Yes, but it will be solved very, very soon. Here, check this video out.  Lack of standards It’s simple really. There is too much competition between the big players to standardize VR experiences. Improvements are constantly being made and with the advent of Deep Learning and other AI algorithms, VR experiences are getting better and better. Once the field becomes more open and well researched (in 10 years, give or take 2), it will get standardized. Things that need to be standardized: Headset weight.Limits for delays in focal rendering.VR objects will move and appear within normal eye and head movement ranges.Limits for display luminance range per frame, per focal arrangement. Since the screen is fixed at a viewing distance in front of our eyes, there is a limit to the range of brightness our pupils can assimilate without hurting our eyes.Adhering to Photopic and Scotopic brightness ranges and the accommodation time needed to switch between the two.Limits of continuous VR exposure and its effects on sleep cycle, everyday functions etc.Limits on buffering and rendering delays, refresh rates, optical distortion around the periphery, depth offsets across the visual field etc.The effects of VR pornographic material on the human sex drive.Limits on objectionable materials and invasion of comfort zones. We humans have a ring of comfort, or a safe proximity zone which should be adhered to.VR is only for gaming and pornography It’s not. It will be pushed on us consumers using them, because let's face it, these are the two most addictive fields. Education, Data Analysis, Art and Filmography are other fields which would get a boost out of it. Consumers have a choice No, you don’t. It’s happening, with or without you.

It is very easy to use and you can make a complete game with it in Unreal (although there are ‘some’ limitations to it, but they won’t bother you unless you’re not working on a AAA project) When you realize you are interested in programming, you can continue learning it to advance.

From here on, you can buy any course for VR or you can just use the VR SDKs with whatever engine you work with and you will have no difficulty in working with them and making VR games.

Image retrieved from Statista What Is the Next Tipping Point For Virtual Reality? There are still some glitches VR needs to fix before it becomes massive-marketable, but VR will continue to evolve in an ongoing process. One consensus was that social-driven content will accelerate the spread of VR. “Only social-driven content will increase the interaction amongst people, which makes the users stay longer on the platform,” Shuai Yuan said. This viewpoint can’t be denied since we’ve already witnessed the success of multiple-player games. Although the preconditions for the massive adoption of VR are sufficient, the popular beliefs in VR are limited. “The VR headsets are cheap enough, and the contents are adequate,” said Kevin Leung, GM of HTC Vive Shenzhen and Director of Vive X. He added, “Many people don’t understand VR, but they could spend plenty of times watching 2D videos. The real problem is how to change the perceptions for VR.”  Other problems need to be fixed before the massive adoption of VR is to fill the knowledge gap and build the relevancy with the audience. “The VR education is costly,” Zu mentioned. “There is no efficient medium to teach people what VR is and how to use it.” Therefore, the audiences don’t know how VR can be relevant to their real life. The tipping point for VR might reach three to five years later because of the high education costs. “The market penetration is still low in China,” Leung said. “There are so many opportunities for VR, but the key is how to position it (in the market).“ If you are a 360 VR creator, feel free to follow and request me any 360 or/and VR relevant questions! :)",2021-03-06T11:58:04.902Z,"Is virtual reality just a trend?

If you’re in an AR app, the glasses would reduce opacity and overlay information over the real world. In a VR app, the glasses would be opaque and immerse you completely in a virtual world.Accessories that engage your remaining senses would become available - haptic gloves, bodysuits, rigs, etc. “Ready Player One” has a good description of what these could look like.Devices would use one of two possible display technologies: Devices that look like wraparound sunglasses (so your peripheral vision is covered) and still use projection on a lens like today’s devices do, but with far better resolution.Devices that use retinal projection (Magic Leap is trying this now, but not sure if they have succeeded) to paint directly on your retina.In terms of software, there will be a ton of “virtual experiences” for everything from porn to games to travel to music concerts. Productivity apps like meetings and conferences, confidential document exchanges, remote work. Education would undergo a sea change as students experience history first hand and travel around the world and into space. The nature of how we work might change as we blend in virtual and real world items. You could use your voice to dictate a document, make corrections using your stylus glove - all on a virtual letter that is displayed on your real desktop as if it were a real sheet of paper. As computing paradigms shifted from command terminals to GUI based systems in the 80s, the ability to manipulate real 3D space would give rise to a new way of interacting with computers. But all this is still in the short term. It’s simple extrapolation of what exists today. The real difference will come around 2030-ish when we bypass the optic nerve and implant signals directly into the part of the brain that processes input from our senses. This could be via a neural lace of the kind Neuralink is working on, or nanobot nodes that bond with your neurons, or something else that no one has thought of yet. An implant like this would allow you to control your AR/VR apps using your thoughts, and have complete fidelity between virtual input coming in from the implants and real world input coming in through your senses. It would be hard to tell the difference between the real world and the virtual, if the integration was seamless.

Instead of eliminating data and communication bottlenecks, as the Web has done, virtual reality will allow people to share experiences, eliminating bottlenecks of geographical and social distance. And temporal distance. And that annoying bottleneck that is reality. Take any random industry. Books, say. You can have a virtual reality book store where authors come as their avatars to do readings, customers gather for book clubs, and you can browse through an infinite number of bookshelves, go into movie theaters to watch movies based on the books, play games based on the books, even go into virtual recreations of the books and experience them from the inside, as one of the characters, or as yourself interacting with characters in the book.  Virtual reality applications can be distributed to help market the book. Virtual meetings can bring authors, agents and publishers closer together -- or allow authors located far apart from one another to collaborate on projects more effectively.  So if you wanted to work in this industry, what skills would you need? If you wanted to create immersive experiences based on books, you might learn about immersive story telling and game design from any of a number of different perspectives -- story planning, project management, programming, graphics design, sound design, 3D modeling, character design, etc... etc...  Also, when do you plan to enter the workforce? The earlier, the more fundamental the skills you need. For example, on the Web, early Web developers needed to know HTML. Today, HTML helps, and so does Javascript, but the majority of websites are put up with just Wordpress, which requires a lot less technical skill. As time goes on, more and more industries will be pulled in. Law, for example, often lags behind technology. So, if you want to become a lawyer specializing in virtual reality law, you might focus on the law aspects first, with a concentration in cyberlaw, and just try to stay current on virtual reality news until the industry is mature enough for things to start happening.

High-end, immersive video games like .. well, like all of today’s top-tier games … make a lot more money than, say, text adventure games. People like to get caught up in things. Sometimes, the immersion gets in the way — on a smartphone, an old-school game like Tetris can be easier to play than one with a giant immersive world. So we’ve got Angry Birds and Candy Crush, simple, casual games that you can play while waiting in line at the supermarket. And sometimes the technology just isn’t there yet. Video calling has been available for years now, but still hasn’t really replaced traditional phone calls. It’s still cumbersome to use, there’s no eye contact, you have to brush your hair and pay attention to the person you’re speaking with… But that’s starting to change as the tech gets better. I think it will take time for VR to get good enough to use outside of particular use cases, like video games and training simulations. It will need to become pervasive, much easier to use, with a natural interface, high resolution, no lag, no motion sickness.. none of that is there yet. But a lot of progress is being made on all these fronts. I think that as computers shrink and technology starts to pervade all we do, AR and VR will become the default user interfaces. Your phone will shrink down so far that there’s no actual thing you’re holding in your hand anymore. It’s built into a ring or earring or contact lens or whatever. And it can generate augmented and virtual reality environments for us without bulky, specialized headsets. So if you’re having a business meeting, you can have Star Wars-style holograms of the other people there with you, all the way to having the entire room around you disappear and be replaced by the virtual conference space. You’ll wave your hand, and your entire environment changes around you. That could via IoT devices — the walls change colors on command, or become windows onto virtual (or real) landscapes. Or via holograms and other AR/VR technologies, where the walls don’t actually change color, but it looks to you as if they do. It’s already coming. My $200 TV takes up a good chunk of my living room space, and anything I’m watching on my phone, I can throw to the TV via Chromecast (or, on the upstairs TV, Roku). Within a couple of years, it will cost $100 and take up the whole wall. A couple of years later, we’ll have smart wall paper. VR and AR will just be the virtual side of that, and it will be ubiquitous, and easy to use, and our kids will grow up never knowing anything else. Totally mainstream. The history of technology and communication is that the more immersive it is, the more value it offers, and the more the public demands it. High-end, immersive video games like .. well, like all of today’s top-tier games … make a lot more money than, say, text adventure games. People like to get caught up in things. Sometimes, the immersion gets in the way — on a smartphone, an old-school game like Tetris can be easier to play than one with a giant immersive world.

After they get to know VR, the demand for more quality VR content would grow, which stimulus the expansion of VR market. The future of VR content is to be more interactive and engaging. The earlier virtual reality was almost exclusively gaming trend, but VR game and videos have an implicit boundary. The main theme is to engage the audience. Unlike the traditional film viewers who passively accept the information that the filmmakers want to convey, the audience who wears VR headsets can interact with the story to decide the direction of the story. In other words, the ending depending on how the audiences choose in the interactive components. Therefore, the audiences become the characters and have the power to control the VR stories.

I practice Nichiren Shoshu True Buddhism • NST Nichiren Shoshu Temple as a lay member. Here is a lecture by one of our Priests. Earthly Desires Are in Themselves Enlightenment Congratulatory Address at Transfer, Opening and Gohonzon Enshrinement Ceremony, Myohoji Enichizan Temple, Los Angeles, May 19, 1996 ….In the world today, we see that the five impurities of the age, of desire, of the people, of thought and of life itself have deeply permeated and intensified in society. From beginning to end, people uphold erroneous outlooks on daily life and the world and possess greedy desires, which cause them to live a completely twisted life. The degeneration of the mind and soul is growing alarmingly widespread. According to the Buddhist doctrines, evil causes and evil associations, without fail, will bring about negative effects and negative retribution. It is clear, therefore, that the future will be steeped in the three evil paths of hell, hunger and animality. Thus, Nichiren Daishonin, the founder of True Buddhism, stated: This path will enable people to become Buddhas even without separating themselves from mundane desires. (Gosho, p. 1287) People immersed in the three poisons of greed, anger and stupidity can immediately transform themselves, as entities of delusion, into the manifestations of purity, the most supreme enlightenment of the True Buddha, without first discarding their desires or eliminating their greed, anger and stupidity. The key lies in the essence of the mystical doctrines of the Lotus Sutra, the Three Great Secret Laws of the True Buddha Nichiren Daishonin. Moreover, a passage from the “Oral Teachings,” the Ongi Kuden, reads: The likes of Nichiren are separated from these five impurities. Since the land where we stand is peaceful, it does not represent the impurity of the age. Since we are the true entities of the Original Buddha, we are not manifestations of the impurity of the people. Since we embrace the mystic principles of “earthly desires are in themselves enlightenment” and “the sufferings of birth and death are in themselves nirvana,” we are not defiled by the impurity of desire. Since we are entities of the original enlightenment from the incredibly remote past of time without beginning or end, we are not manifestations of the impurity of life. Since we are practitioners who have honestly discarded the expedients and who expound the supreme Way, we are not defiled by the impurity of thought. (Gosho, p. 1729) Thus, the fundamental resolution of the delusions of the earthly desires that prevail in all forms of life and the suffering caused by them is to believe in the Buddha and the Law through which all aspects of life have been correctly expounded, based on Myoho-Renge-Kyo. The key to this resolution exists in following these teachings and honestly discarding the expedient doctrines and, furthermore, in embracing Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo with sincere faith and performing shakubuku, the ultimate propagation. The Daishonin wrote: I proclaim that the single character denoting “faith” is the seed to enlightenment. (Gosho, p. 1738) As this passage shows, faith is, indeed, most important. Faith is manifested in our determination and our sincere devotion to the Law and to the Buddha. The Daishonin stated the following in his Gosho “The Gift of Rice”: Common mortals can attain Buddhahood if they cherish one thing: faith . . . in a time of famine, offering the Buddha the single bowl of rice on which one’s life depends is to dedicate one’s life to the Buddha. (Gosho, p. 1544) In this way, the Daishonin instructs us that our faithful devotion to offer the benefits of our lives to True Buddhism is the fundamental source of true enlightenment and happiness. I ask you all, from today on, to further strengthen your resolve in your determination to protect and serve True Buddhism and to advance forth, centered around your local temple, in the activities that will bring you benefits, as you practice for yourself and for others and perform shakubuku, and re-shakubuku. (Note: This lecture can be read in its entirety in the book: Sermons 1992-2002 by Sixty-seventh High Priest Nikken Shonin.

Innovation needs development which needs money, and the innovative people rarely have millions to throw into uncertain projects/products. VR’s initial push is to video games, which has been going on for few years now. Some think it has failed because there aren’t new megatitles like Half-life: Alyx every month, but in reality this was probably the best VR could expect from the initial market roll-out: it actually works! We got surprisingly excellent first generation PCVR and almost unbelievably excellent stand-alone headsets with Quest 1(snapdragon 835 running 3d VR games… say what now?) and of course the new Quest 2 which is just great except for facebook learning everything about you.***Next step in VR is to prove all the money people wrong, because right now they’re looking at VR games and scuffing at the little money it’s making - and they’re not really wrong.VR gaming was always going to be a hard(but obvious) path for virtual reality; PCVR gaming needs a great PC hardware and 500–1500€ VR headset: That is not going to be a large consumer pool for years, although it is a consumer pool with enthusiasts ready to pay enthusiast prices. Maybe the innovation you’re looking for are this kind of stuff: Facebook Experiments With Mind-Reading Tech to Control VR Gabe Newell on Brain-computer Interfaces: 'We're way closer to The Matrix than people realize' Teslasuit’s new VR gloves let you feel virtual objects and track your pulse HaptX Secures $12M Financing to Produce Next Generation of Haptic Gloves This extremely slippery VR treadmill could be your next home gym Varjo raises $54 million to bring VR with ‘human eye’ resolution to more industries Eye tracking is the next phase for VR, ready or not What it Feels Like to Roll Through a Virtual World in the Virtusphere As you can see, there IS a lot of innovation ongoing in virtual reality space, a lot, but it takes time and money to bring new tech/paradigms to a platform that is only in its first generation itself. Remember that there are not that many VR users overall yet - the field needs to mature and prove itself before the big money gets interested, but it’s not long now.  Taken from: 30 Virtual Reality Statistics for 2020 | KommandoTech *Note that that 171M is probably bullshit, as there are 1–2M active PCVR users and 5M+ PSVR owners and Quest 1 has sold ~1M units and Quest 2 not that much yet. My guess would be 10–15M actual active VR users(smartphone VR not included).Maybe VR arcades and such bring few millions more but hundred million… maybe if you count everyone who has ever downloaded a VR or AR app on their phone. Nonetheless, VR is growing exponentially and future is looking good for it.  One aspect where innovation is happening in VR space is education and training sector, because that is where the big money is for VR(and AR). Imagine a vocational school that has one teacher to teach 30 students how to use an industrial dishwasher-system, where each student has to learn the theoretical information, then have the teacher show the instructions for the whole process or parts of it, THEN do it themselves multiple times to leave a good memory imprint of the job. BUT there is no time for everyone to do multiple rounds on the real machine which takes like 30 minutes and where the teacher has to be present. That works fine and we’ve had decent workers and results forever, but that process takes a lot of time and resources. With VR assisted learning, you can learn the theory and the practical work quickly and efficiently, repeat it as many times as you want and even have the teacher drop by to answer questions or give some instructions.When you’ve completed the virtual work process, let’s say 10 times(15–20 min each), and you feel comfortable about the process, you get to do the real world process once, like before, but now you already know it and are just reinforcing the learning you already did in VR. The best thing is that your teacher could be 10 or 10 000km away and still teach you equally. Here is an example of such simulation for the Quest(disclaimer: it’s made by my company):   How about this scenario: You have a university in Africa or India, or where ever, that doesn’t have the funds to purchase an expensive scientific device. The students will learn the theory of it, because it’s essential, but they never get to have any practical learning with it - even though they will surely need to use that machine at industry job.Just simulate it. It doesn’t even have to be scientifically perfect where virtual molecules fuse and stuff; It just has to teach the practical steps of using the machine, so that the students have a clue when they have to use one irl. It’ll be a career saver, or at least money saver, when employer doesn’t have to send you to a course to learn the machine. Virtual reality is the future platform of education.  Just gonna mention AR quickly… It’s great but it’s not for everything.VR offers immersion, where AR offers augmented information. Both work for different applications, for example AR will be amazing for repairmen who can connect to “smart” features of modern homes/construction and get a wide array of information to display nicely without obfuscating your vision:Can’t remember the schematics for this particular factory? Just display them and a walking path to the source of the problem and how to fix it, while getting real-time feedback. My guess is that VR will become one of the main tools for education, training and also entertainment, while AR will become more akin to our smartphones: every one has it and it’s just obvious quality of life improvement that gets integrated into society, but it’s not gonna have the best games or best media features etc.  ***Funfact: With Quest 2 Facebook tracks things like your height, hand size, posture, line of sight, ofc the space you’re in and objects in that space, and the usual everything you do in the oculus store/device. And now you’re forced to connect your real identity to it.There was already a study that showed that you can recognise a person from a pool of our 500 users just based on those posture/height/hand measurements ,so Facebook knows if you are not using your headset but someone else - and it probably knows who it is by matching your friends and acquaintances from facebook to the data it’s getting.It’s honestly pretty scary stuff; the potential of this intimate data connected to facebooks already unfathomably large database of user info.",2021-03-06T12:09:55.645Z,"Why is virtual reality innovation taking so long?

The launch of the Microsoft Kinect in November 2010 prompted Virtuix Founder and CEO Jan Goetgeluk to believe that virtual reality was about to make a come-back. He started working on the Omni motion platform in 2011, driven by a desire to walk naturally in VR instead of pushing buttons on a gamepad or keyboard while sitting on a chair. After two years of research and development, Goetgeluk launched the Omni Kickstarter campaign in June 2013, which raised more than $1.1MM and became one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns at that time. Since those early days, Virtuix transitioned from focusing on the consumer market to selling Omni systems to the commercial market, primarily to location-based entertainment venues through the company’s global distribution network. Virtuix has shipped more than 3,000 Omni systems to date, and distributors have installed Omnis in over 500 commercial venues on five continents, making the Omni the most widely distributed VR hardware besides the headsets. Since its Kickstarter campaign in 2013, Virtuix raised $16MM from investors including 10 venture capital funds, two strategic investors, Mark Cuban Companies, and private investors. The company has grown to a team of 30 employees with offices in Austin, TX (its headquarters), and in Zhuhai and Shanghai, China.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a fascinating concept of science fiction for decades, but many researchers think we’re finally getting close to making AI a reality. NPR notes that in the last few years, scientists have made breakthroughs in “machine learning,” using neural networks, which mimic the processes of real neurons. This is a type of “deep learning” that allows machines to process information for themselves on a very sophisticated level, allowing them to perform complex functions like facial recognition. Big data is speeding up the AI development process, and we may be seeing more integration of AI technology in our everyday lives relatively soon. While much of this technology is still fairly rudimentary at the moment, we can expect sophisticated AI to one day significantly impact our everyday lives. Here are 6 ways AI might affect us in the future. 1. Automated Transportation We’re already seeing the beginnings of self-driving cars, though the vehicles are currently required to have a driver present at the wheel for safety. Despite these exciting developments, the technology isn’t perfect yet, and it will take a while for public acceptance to bring automated cars into widespread use. Google began testing a self-driving car in 2012, and since then, the U.S. Department of Transportation has released definitions of different levels of automation, with Google’s car classified as the first level down from full automation. Other transportation methods are closer to full automation, such as buses and trains. 2. Cyborg Technology One of the main limitations of being human is simply our own bodies—and brains. Researcher Shimon Whiteson thinks that in the future, we will be able to augment ourselves with computers and enhance many of our own natural abilities. Though many of these possible cyborg enhancements would be added for convenience, others might serve a more practical purpose. Yoky Matsuka of Nest believes that AI will become useful for people with amputated limbs, as the brain will be able to communicate with a robotic limb to give the patient more control. This kind of cyborg technology would significantly reduce the limitations that amputees deal with on a daily basis.  3. Taking over dangerous jobs Robots are already taking over some of the most hazardous jobs available, including bomb defusing. These robots aren’t quite robots yet, according to the BBC. They are technically drones, being used as the physical counterpart for defusing bombs, but requiring a human to control them, rather than using AI. Whatever their classification, they have saved thousands of lives by taking over one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. As technology improves, we will likely see more AI integration to help these machines function. Other jobs are also being reconsidered for robot integration. Welding, well known for producing toxic substances, intense heat, and earsplitting noise, can now be outsourced to robots in most cases. Robot Worx explains that robotic welding cells are already in use, and have safety features in place to help prevent human workers from fumes and other bodily harm. 4. Solving climate change Solving climate change might seem like a tall order from a robot, but as Stuart Russell explains, machines have more access to data than one person ever could—storing a mind-boggling number of statistics. Using big data, AI could one day identify trends and use that information to come up with solutions to the world’s biggest problems. 5. Robot as friends Who wouldn’t want a friend like C-3PO? At this stage, most robots are still emotionless and it’s hard to picture a robot you could relate to. However, a company in Japan has made the first big steps toward a robot companion—one who can understand and feel emotions. Introduced in 2014, “Pepper” the companion robot went on sale in 2015, with all 1,000 initial units selling out within a minute. The robot was programmed to read human emotions, develop its own emotions, and help its human friends stay happy. Pepper goes on sale in the U.S. in 2016, and more sophisticated friendly robots are sure to follow.  6. Improved elder care For many seniors, everyday life is a struggle, and many have to hire outside help to manage their care, or rely on family members. AI is at a stage where replacing this need isn’t too far off, says Matthew Taylor, computer scientist at Washington State University. “Home” robots could help seniors with everyday tasks and allow them to stay independent and in their homes for as long as possible, which improves their overall well-being. Although we don’t know the exact future, it is quite evident that interacting with AI will soon become an everyday activity. These interactions will clearly help our society evolve, particularly in regards to automated transportation, cyborgs, handling dangerous duties, solving climate change, friendships and improving the care of our elders. Beyond these six impacts, there are even more ways that AI technology can influence our future, and this very fact has professionals across multiple industries extremely excited for the ever-burgeoning future of artificial intelligence.

Perhaps one of the most important reasons, it is finally paying off to develop in VR. Games have an audience. Training and simulation software in VR are slowly taking over their video and text counterparts in the automotive, military, and space world. Not to mention it is blending with AR.It’s mainstream. This works against it in some aspects, as VR, AR, and MR are now buzzwords that are used quite liberally, and solutions that don’t really benefit from it are thrown around in hype. However, Hollywood (think Ready Player One) and Youtube personalities jumping in are making it acceptable to wear bulky and dorky headsets, to a point where there is a shift in functionality rather than looks. This is important because it drives adoption rates beyond engineers and geeks.

This multi-sensory experience was also the first ‘3D film’, designed for a single viewer and enabled the viewer to become immersed through multiple sense in the media. For example, he used an oscillating fan so that the viewer could feel the wind blowing on their face.  The first HMD that we would recognize was built by Ivan Sutherland in 1968 with the help of his students and was nicknamed the ‘Sword of Damocles’ as it was so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling by a metal pole. By today’s standards, it seems rather primitive, only displaying wireframe models for graphics and no text at all.   The first modern style HMD was named “The Datavisor“ and was able to display graphics and text from computers of the day.  And it looked awesome. It literally looks like the images are being piped into your brain via the eyes. This has to go down as the most cyberpunk looking VR head-mounted display ever. From this point in VR’s history, it is ‘just’ resolution and fidelity boosts to get to our modern consumer-based headsets. We can see many peripherals and equipment that was created in the 90’s that foreshadowed our systems today with life-size accessories and controller methods to further immerse the content consumer in the scene. Unfortunately, due to the primitive state of graphics at this point in time, the full benefit of such systems had yet to be realized:   Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that layers virtual enhancements atop our existing reality. AR is developed into apps and used on mobile devices to blend digital components. As technology gets better this will be integrated into contact lenses and glasses for consumers to consume and interact with. NASA’s take on VR is surprisingly close to the systems we are using today.  NASA worked on the social aspects of vr, creating avatars and enabling communication within the virtual space. This is unsurprising as they were looking at the effect a VR system would have upon long-distance space travel. Whilst NASA concluded that these systems would be beneficial they stopped working on them due to their ability to cause nausea due to low refresh rates and technological ability at the time. AR has always found a home in more industrial or businesslike settings with 1992 marking the birth of the term “augmented reality.” It first appeared in the work of Caudell and Mizell [1992] at Boeing, who sought to assist workers in an airplane factory by displaying wire bundle assembly schematics in a see-through HMD. Its engineers were trying to work with wire bundling and cable management around aircraft and would previously have to remember whole constructs such as this one shown below:  From the start, they knew they were onto something when a software engineer was now able to carry out the bundling and management with an early head-mounted, see-through device:  In 1993 a system called KARMA had been created, a system that incorporated knowledge-based AR. This system was capable of automatically inferring appropriate instruction sequences for repair and maintenance procedures. KARMA was the first knowledge-driven AR application. A user with an HMD could see instructions on printer maintenance: What a customer would see:  What a repair technician would see:  From here, it is easy to see how we got to systems such as hololens and others that keep one rooted in the real world whilst being able to access virtual and simulated data. Mixed reality (MR), also sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds combining elements of both AR and VR to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.  Mixed reality aims to keep one immersed in an environment where a prime focus is to keep you in a separate realm, so to speak, distinct from either the real world (where AR keeps you) or an or a virtual realm attempting to replicate the real in a simulation (as in VR). Mixed reality systems have only become available (and in any way useful) as AR and VR have hit maturation as its only with fully realized systemic kinks worked through that the technology industries and back garden shed type hardware hackers can get to the ‘usefulness’ of MR. If you are a 360 VR creator, feel free to follow and request me any 360 or/and VR relevant questions! :) Virtual Reality (VR) is an artificial environment which seeks to synthetically introduce stimuli to your senses. This means that one’s sight, sound, touch, smell, and even taste can be artificially stimulated. The Sensorama Machine, invented in 1957 then patented in 1962 was the first interactive film experience in which viewers were invited to watch a film which would use all of their senses. This multi-sensory experience was also the first ‘3D film’, designed for a single viewer and enabled the viewer to become immersed through multiple sense in the media.

The Arkansas Razorbacks football team has a room where they train with virtual reality and simulation-based learning in a mixed reality where the virtual reality becomes reality when they are not on the field. Mixed reality is a blend of the world we live in enhanced by technology that brings an added dimension to what we are seeing, feeling, and tasting. The applications within the event sphere are incredibly interesting. At the 2016 SXSW, virtual reality was all the rage and at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show tech pundits were touting virtual and mixed reality as one of the biggest factors that would change the everyday human experience over the next decade. Mixed reality within the education industry to both enhance students’ ability to learn and take in information while also giving them the opportunity to personalize the way they learn. Using 3D projections and simulations, students can interact with and manipulate virtual objects in order to study them in a way that is relevant to themselves and their studies.By inserting three dimensional objects into a classroom as a means of gauging the size, shape, or other features of something, students can gain a deeper sense of understanding as to what it is they’re studying.Students at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio were able to take advantage of the Microsoft HoloLens in order to teach anatomy as well as enable professors to teach and interact with students despite being hundreds of miles away.Mixed reality in engineering is slowly but surely becoming a game-changer. From 3D modelling and virtual sculpting to remote repair guidance and project monitoring apps, there are various ways in which the engineering sector has begun to take advantage of mixed reality devices. Using 3D modelling apps on mixed reality devices, professionals are able to build their projects up in a shared virtual environment so as to give them the best chance of spotting errors while also allowing for real-time manipulation of designs that can then be evaluated and checked.Project monitoring apps are also growing in popularity owing to their ability to project 3D or 4D design models over structures as they are being built. This can then help engineers and construction workers visualize progress as well as inspect the quality of what has already been built.Entertainment VR entertainment has been around for decades and because of this, it’s the most acclimatized and most widely available of the three technologies from an entertainment perspective. Augmented reality games and apps are coming out thick and fast since the success of Pokémon Go and there’s little reason to suspect they’ll peter out anytime soon.However, mixed reality entertainment is already here with companies like Magic Leap, Lucasfilm and Industrial Light And Magic all looking to delve into mixed reality entertainment. Magic Leap’s attempt at mixed reality is a little different to most, however. Using what they call a Dynamic Digitised Lightfield Signal, Magic Leap’s tech projects images directly into the eye, without the need for it to bounce of an object and then head towards the eyes. This tricks the brain into think the object is there, when in reality, it is a projection.Healthcare From over-the-shoulder surgeries, whereby surgical students could be taught remotely by experts as they performed actual surgeries, to studying the anatomy using mixed reality environments to map the different layers of the human body, the potential for mixed reality applications in healthcare and medicine cannot be overstated. Being able to produce three-dimensional models of the anatomy complete with information accessible at a mere gesture could change the way health care and medicine is taught while also transforming the way in which medical students learn, using three-dimensional holograms in a virtual environment rather than two-dimensional diagrams from medical textbooks here in base reality.There is also the potential in healthcare for mixed reality and machine learning to combine their talents and create healthcare experiences that allow doctors to take advantage of the intelligence and data provided by machine learning with the visualization and interactivity capabilities of mixed reality technologies.",2021-03-06T12:23:01.222Z,"What is the best real-time example of mixed reality?

MageSpider : Client Reviews | Clutch Rating: 4.7/5 Affordable Price: $1000 To $10500 However, UberEats may have to go a long way to become a leader in the Indian online food delivery app market. This is because some players have been in this industry for almost 10 years and are doing pretty well to earn trust by providing the best service. There are few fundamental expenses included in developing a Food Delivery App For IOS And Android and we here at MageSpider bear the few which are- Developer’s expenses :- They take normal expenses for an engineer that can range from $10-35 per hour for the per hour basis criteria or around $100 for a month in general. These figures keep on changing as per the aptitude and specialization needs from the engineer. Cost of the gatherings :- This involves a huge amount of money that we need to spend on social affair, overviews, conferences and on the staff that will carry out such employment strategies. Design and development :- Applications configuration and its development is the total that any business will spend on its engineers and related staff. This also includes the cost of different licenses as well as the cost of Hire mobile app developers. Testing and publication :- Bug fixes are vital, so after an application is created it should be rigorously tested for any kind of fixes. And as far as the idea of outside testing is considered, the expenses increase. To distribute an app, one-time charge, $20 is payable. Application market :- There are necessary marketing costs involved because the advertisement is essential. Without advertisement, you can't be sure about your app reaching the target market. According to MageSpider's recent statistics, there are very few estimated costs. Simple table-based app-here customers provide content, instructions and examples from similar applications. There is a sum of $1000-6000 with a few extras like a GPS locator, bell, whistle like social media integration. Database App-In this case, the customer needs to provide the designer with all the details, content, design, graphics, directions, etc. The cost comes from the app's usability and app logic. This is an overly heavy project because the database that drives the food delivery application is critical. These applications cost up to $8,000-$50,000, similar to food delivery apps similar to food pandas. This kind of food delivery app makes everyday life more comfortable because people prepare food at home and provide comfortable service in online food delivery apps.

First, some reality check - Not everyone from an IIM is Tom Cruise - Every student from an IIM does not bag a multi-crore package. In fact, most do not. However, a lot of them start with Rs 10 lac + annual packages, and if they have what it takes, can double / trible / quadruple those in a few years flat. Many start with a low grade - just about more than Rs 5-7 lacs p.a., say.Not every Subject Expert is worth his salt, either - It is a mistake to assume that every single student who clears all the stages of the CA exam (one of the toughest in India), or graduates from the reputed Law Universities (not everyone gets in), is a genuine expert, ready to demolish the world! He/she may not be. They often are good at some topics, average at others, and bad at some. Many of them may be out of sync completely with latest IT tools, communication skills, and presentation / visualisation abilities. [ I say this out of my experience as an employer for more than 2 decades ]What do companies that hire these MBAs really want? - If you check the career graph of the most successful IIM graduates, you'll find them great at these 5 things -Leadership ability - the strength with which they lead a team, or the full company itselfLearning ability - things change, and change itself accelerates, making intense learning ability a key to sustained leadershipSmartness - the ability to see what'll sell, and what'll bombPeople skills - the passion to connect with team-members, work positively with them, bring the best to the table from everyoneAbility to take stress - the strength to consistently put in efforts day in, and day out (needs terrific emotional, psychological and physical fitness)So anyone who is an MBA from an IIM and is blessed with these traits, or can develop these in time, will reap rich rewards. As long as companies will exist, they will need exceptional leaders to ensure their survival and prosperity. But are the packages really justified? Yes, and No. Yes - because they help snatch the best talent available on campus, and ensure that competition doesn't get it. No, because they can lull someone into complacency pretty soon. But do the IIMs really develop the 5 skills mentioned above? A clear anwer - No. Most of the people making it to the best of the IIMs have these latent skills, and the selection procedure just ensures such people get in. And then, they have the environment, the tools, the opportunity to really break through. But is the selection procedure perfect? Not at all! It's just like all other imperfect examinations in the world, that are great at minimising imperfections, not eliminating it. So being a domain expert is irrelevant? Not at all. The most successful of CEOs will need the best of domain experts to aid their grand vision. And yes, a lot of CAs and some Law experts also end up doing an MBA, to shore up their CVs, and take advantage of certain opportunities otherwise out of reach. A simple example - Abraham Lincoln, who never fought personally in any battle let alone the massive US Civil War, is consistently ranked as the best US President ever. He was great at leading, getting the best Generals, and demolishing competition to ensure national unity. He is revered precisely for that. So how exactly is a leader different from a manager? The difference between a leader and a manager is often simple -  a leader knows the goal and can rally people to that. A manager helps manage the journey to that goal.a leader can see things in the future (don't ask me ""how""); a manager can help convert that into reality through day-to-day operational excellencea leader can passionately drum up people's conscience and energies into a unified whole, raring to go; a manager (or a functional expert) provides the nuts-and-bolts for the raceSo what should I do? Become a leader, or a manager? If you were leader material, you would never even ask this question. So can domain experts like, say, CAs never lead a company?  Not at all! Many with the skills needed to do THAT are doing it. Example of one great CA doing precisely that is the dashing Mr. Kumar Managalam Birla! He has something interesting to say, here - CAs face major challenge from MBAs: Kumar Mangalam Birla  Finally, are the packages really justified? The late Sumantra Ghoshal, one of the most clear-headed of management gurus India has produced in a long time, used to say - ""... and only 10% of managers have the right mix of energy and focus to make all the difference ..."" Those proverbial 10% are the ones running the show today.

Demand for improved sports-watching experiences and creative advertising are the two biggest industries driving growth in this medium and the volumetric video market is expected to grow to $5.8 Billion dollars by 2025. Augmented reality shopping, virtual reality concerts like Charli XCX’s VR concert, and using gaming as a way to hang out with friends are all examples of how companies need to consider 3D technology for the future of their business. Volumetric video is “a technique where a human performance is filmed from all angles creating a three dimensional (3D) video, allowing the user to view any point of the performance from any angle.” Volumetric content can be placed into augmented, mixed, or virtual reality. It can be viewed in 360 degrees or as a 3D asset on a flat-screen. Marketing & Customer Retention Creative advertising is one of the industries driving volumetric video because it’s a “spectacular technology that can be deployed at shows, live events, product launches, advertising and promotions, exhibitions, presentations, and conferences.” Improved Retention Rates Volumetric video does more than let a person watch a scene. They can actively take part in it with hardware like virtual or mixed reality/spatial computing headsets. One of the key benefits of 3D experiences is presence. People feel like they’re actually in a scene or interacting with an object. This type of physical activity increases retention, making training stick better than traditional training tools like slide presentations and 2D video. Training Program Flexibility Volumetric video paired with augmented or virtual reality revolutionized employee training from onboarding, corporate HR training, product or process training, and more. Being able to put an employee inside the environment they work in with actual 3D video of the objects and people they’ll work with provides a completely new context for learning. With volumetric video, employees can take part in more than pre-recorded sessions. Volumetric video can be live-streamed so that employees can shadow the experts in real-time without putting themselves in a situation before they’re ready. Employees can even watch volumetric feedback of themselves to see how they performed, giving them the opportunity to see how they can improve next time.

With easier and more accessible use, for a variety of different functions (besides video gaming), widespread adoption seems likely. Make no mistake, AR/VR is set to enter a whole new phase of mainstream acceptance in industry, on our phones, and through a whole new class of personal devices – and 5G is going to be at the very heart of the revolution. So AR/VR is ever evolving and be in contact with Technostacks, an expert in AR app development for latest updates.

Being part of that great legacy means sharing in the reputation and credibility of a brand. Compared to other up and coming business software companies that struggle to find a market that will trust them, MS Dynamics already commands an audience. Besides the brand recall, another advantage is that many businesses already have Microsoft products in their tech stack. MS Office, Outlook, SQL, Windows, Azure—all these are MS applications that have their own following. Office and Outlook have been around for decades and remain the go-to apps for managing documents, emails, and other back office processes. SQL is a popular database among developers, and Azure is one of the leading cloud PaaS. All these MS products are connected to Dynamics, making Dynamics a natural choice for companies already used to Microsoft systems. Being part of the MS line doesn’t mean that Dynamics has limited integration possibilities. Similar to Salesforce, MS Dynamics has its own partner app listing. MS Dynamics also integrates with phones and other business software to further accelerate sales and enhance customer service. To round this up, I’d like to reiterate that the main strength of MS Dynamics is its place in the Microsoft enterprise.

I could have bought the iPhone 7s, and had the new highly anticipated Google Pixel phones been available in my market I would have placed a pre-order, my plan was to wait until it was. Then I saw the Mi Mix. You can refer to its specs in other answer, but in short, it packs the highest end specs in the market available till date (the 3999rmb model), but that is alone is not good enough for me to forgo Google Pixel’s Google Assistant and Daydream VR for it and not why it is important. Its use of Cantilever Piezoelectric Ceramics technology made possible a design of beauty that has not appear in the smartphone industry for a long time (with the exception of Sharp’s bezel-less phones). It’s beauty combined with its ceramic technology and unrivaled specs have convinced me to go out of my way to procure this phone that is not sold outside of China. And I believe I am not the only one. I could have the very best phones USA, Japan or Korea has to offer, but I am choosing a China phone instead. For sole reason that I believe it is the superior product. How many of you could imagine yourself buying a China phone even just a few years back? I couldn’t. And it is the underlying implications that makes it important. China has produced an (arguably) superior consumer product in one of the most competitive tech industry in the world. You could say Xiaomi has been producing superior products for years, that is only arguably at best and none of them have stood out as much and left reviewers shell-shocked. In a future where Chinese tech consumer products might dominate or at least become world market co-leaders, people will look back at the Mi Mix and say “That is where it all began. That was when people stopped calling China products copycats and start telling themselves, hey I want to buy that.” It is important because this phone heralded a new chapter in history for China’s products and I can imagine a great source of national pride for the chinese. So congratulations China, you have achieved a historical milestone, and I will support you even if it means risking no warranty coverage for my new phone. Now, Xiaomi and by extension China, has one final step to go before it can justifiably claim its tech win over USA and Samsung and shake off its copycat stigma once and for all, that is for the Mi Mix itself to live up to its marketing. If it unfortunately pulls a Samsung Note 7, then well, this will be a humiliation on a national level that will be remembered in the tech industry for years to come.

In 2015 and 2016, VR was on the cusp of the new trend, but the industry turned into a very low point last year, a lot of companies went bankrupt or shut down, while some survived and became today’s industrial pioneers. Although the VR industry is still in the valley currently, it is rising steadily. As the technology develops, devices such as VR headsets and VR cameras are getting more affordable and providing a better experience, data transmission becomes faster, the barrier to produce and enjoy VR content is lower than what it was before, which allow more people get access to enjoy VR content. After they get to know VR, the demand for more quality VR content would grow, which stimulus the expansion of VR market. The future of VR content is to be more interactive and engaging. The earlier virtual reality was almost exclusively gaming trend, but VR game and videos have an implicit boundary. The main theme is to engage the audience. Unlike the traditional film viewers who passively accept the information that the filmmakers want to convey, the audience who wears VR headsets can interact with the story to decide the direction of the story. In other words, the ending depending on how the audiences choose in the interactive components. Therefore, the audiences become the characters and have the power to control the VR stories. The global virtual reality market size was valued at USD 960.9 million in 2016 and expected an exponential growth over the forecast period from 2014-2025, said Grand View Research. The projected market potential benefits from diverse and affordable VR devices, and its ability to be incorporated into the widespread application from commercial to medical fields. The considerable market potential attracts many tech companies to share the big pie. Although the VR market is highly dynamic, the competition is also very intense, requiring the tech companies to upgrade their products consistently.  Image retrieved from Statista Virtual reality is a hot topic in the field of science and technology. It is assumed that the cost of hardware and the complexity of production are the obstructions for the massive adoption of virtual reality. However, the experts from the VR industry have different opinions. Virtual reality is an underestimated field that could bring changes to medical therapy, professional training, and life experiences for both consumers and business beyond videos and games.  Image retrieved from Statista Many of these innovations are promising us ways to change the way we live life in a more productive and connected manner. It’s estimated that in the 2020s these technologies will converge into a synergistic human man-machine. Here are my predictions Standalone Headsets Are the Mainstream VR Devices This one is pretty simple and may seem quite obvious. Facebook is launching the Oculus Go this year (hopefully) for an extremely low price of $200. Facebook is the technology empire to do this and fuel VR for the masses. According to John Carmack, Oculus CTO noted that the Oculus Go will perform “significantly better” than the Samsung Gear. Oculus has also partnered with Xioami to create an Oculus Go version for China coined the “Mi VR Standalone” that looks almost identical to the Go. I wrote another feature on VeeR of the 6 Best Standalone Virtual Reality (VR) Headsets in 2018. Oculus isn’t the first and many more manufacturers are following the trend and coming out with their own standalone devices. The pinnacle of standalone performance is HTC Vive’s Focus headset that uses “world-scale” and is similar to the HTC vive, a powerful headset tethered to a PC. Depending on the success of the Oculus Go will decide how the industry moves forward. Facebook is going to use their technology infrastructure to make virtual reality popular, and I believe will open a VR standalone race between varies companies if the public decides the devices are good enough for the price.  2. The emergence of Augmented Reality will Fuel Virtual Reality Augmented reality is VR’s sister industry. Based on statistics the augmented/mixed reality industry will be MUCH larger than VR by 2023. Virtual reality’s reboot started in 2012 with Oculus’ Kickstarter being successfully funded and purchased by Facebook. Why? VR from a time standpoint is much more time-consuming than augmented reality. Additionally, Magic Leap is one of the most funded startups in history. ML promises a mixed reality device that is coming soon for creators this year. Many speculate and say VR won’t take off because it can’t be used in public or in tandem with other activities. I believe this is a narrow point of view and doesn’t address all of the uses that VR will mostly be used in entertainment, and other completely immersive scenarios. Common usage of augmented reality will lead people to fully immersive virtual reality experiences. By the time AR picks up in the coming years, VR content and experiences will be much better and appeal more to mainstream audiences rather than the current niche uses.  3. Limitless Unfathomable Experiences I interviewed Jay Samit on the Humans 2.0 Podcast. Jay is a major influencer in the world of mixed reality technology. He brought up a very interesting point during our conversation. He said when the iPhone came out, nobody had any idea what kind of mobile applications we could use. The early app store was filled with fart and gun apps with no real utility or purpose. Point being, even if VR / AR is being used for mundane trivial applications today, it doesn’t mean it will look that way in 5 years. Due to limited processing power, virtual reality experiences are quite limited. Imagine the future metaverse as a limitless world of intention and thought. Virtual Reality is an idea of fully immersive technology-mediated dream worlds. Rendered mind spaces where the only limit is your imagination. My favorite example of an unfathomable VR experience today is GE Healthcare’s virtual reality specialty software. It can help radiologists, doctors, and surgeons better read the human body, perform diagnoses and make their decisions. The VR app lets Doctors step inside internal organs and navigate, travel forward from side to side, and even search for polyps and other tumors. 4. 5G Networks Are the Gateway Today, VR/AR developers are limited by various factors like thermal efficiency, sensor, multimedia technologies, and other technical factors. Slowly but surely computer architecture innovations, such as heterogeneous computing, have improved power and thermal efficiency. Integration efficiency has improved due to better transistors and Moore’s Law. Optimized algorithms, such as motion tracking, run better on the hardware. However, the real gateway for amazing unlimited experiences for VR/AR in an increasingly mobile world…is 5G networks. According to NBC news, 5G networks are projected to bring three benefits to the masses. Faster speed: Data transfer speeds are projected to be about 10 times higher with 5G than is possible with 4G. Expect significantly faster transmission of images, videos, and immersive content. With 4G/LTE, downloading a high-definition movie might take about 10 minutes. With 5G, it is reported to take less than a second.Shorter delays: Though it’s not always noticeable, there is often a brief lag in time from when data is sent to when it’s received. 5G should reduce this so-called latency, making it possible, for example, to watch high-speed virtual reality video with no delays or glitches.Increased connectivity: Cell towers equipped with 5G technology would have greatly increased capacity over 4G/LTE. Which means more people with devices should be able to communicate at the same time without any volume lag errors.5G is the fuel that will lead to extraordinary innovation in not just virtual and augmented reality, but also broader technologies like IoT and how we connect with each other on the internet.  5. The industry will Develop Universal Protocols and Frameworks Virtual reality can be a bit confusing and even intimidating for newcomers looking to join. Most frequently, I hear issues about compatibility and how content is distributed and even how VR games look and feel with controls. Just like the Web has brought out API’s SDKs, OS, virtual reality is converging into a collected and unified platform. Voluntary guidelines and standards are sure to improve the industry for consumers and developers. Organizations are on the move to achieve this future goal like the VRARA, IEEE, VRSB, and the Virtual Reality Industry Forum (VRIF). IEEE announced that a working group will establish definitions, categories of VR and AR devices, and standards for quality, user interfaces, and file formats.

Greater depth in conceptual learning: Conceptual learning refers to acquiring and assimilating knowledge that goes beyond rote learning or a mere accumulation of facts. It is a form of learning through which students are able to grasp ideas and concepts that they can later on apply to new contexts. The use of VR can be critical in enabling students towards achieving greater depth in understanding conceptually rich subjects. Think about it, is it enough for a student just to know the formal statements of Newton’s Three Laws of Motion? Wouldn’t it be better if that student could see for themselves the application of those laws outside of a textbook? Learning enriched through the use of VR could provide that deeper level of connection with a concept.Bridging learning gaps in a classroom full of diverse learners: Whether each and every student has a VR headset in a classroom is not the issue. The crucial question for educators will be how to provide the best learning experience for everyone in the classroom, in spite of the differences in proficiency level, pace of learning, learning style and motivation. If a particular student does not understand a concept fully, there should be additional teaching tools available to the teacher to help that student bridge those learning gaps. With this in mind, the objective of providing students with access to an immersive environment is to make learning more engaging, interactive, and personalized.In many classrooms around the world, a homogeneous setting is no longer the norm. It is time to address this fact, and allow technology to help level the playing field. Gone should be the days of taking an immigrant child into the class, and hoping for the best. If a Syrian student is placed into a Canadian classroom, their ability to succeed will be predicated on their language ability, in either French or English. With localization of content, it is now possible to have a child study a difficult topic such as Hybridization in Arabic, then once successful, require them to replicate that in English. Once the content is understood, it is much easier to make that relatable in another language. This assists not only the student, but informs the teacher of that student’s ability (or lack there of) and sets them together on a course of action.Beyond falling prices, there has been significant advancements in graphics and processing power, the future of VR looks promising. However, the question of what the future holds for VR really comes down to content. The most important factors in creating a robust learning environment are, simply put, good quality immersive content, a rich diversity of topics, and sophisticated metrics of evaluation. A library of good, vetted STEM content exists at the moment, charting an important course for the use of virtual reality in education. An expansion of this into other subjects and fields of inquiry will be important to solidify the use of VR in the classroom, set to take its rightful place alongside a pen and notebook, PC and tablet. Considering that the future heralds lesser limitations in terms of tech specs, the way forward for VR will be to make a richly experiential mode of learning for everyone a rule and not an exception. The future is a realm of all sorts of unimaginable possibilities. But it isn’t too difficult to answer the question of where VR will be in the next five years. With prices of VR headsets coming down significantly and more and more people waking up to the benefits of VR, one can reasonably conjecture that VR is poised to become a standard part of every classroom in the future. We’ll start with just a few of the benefits that VR can bring to a classroom.

6043775fed76476feda2c14b,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-innovative-startups-in-Western-Europe?-,"What are the most innovative start ups in Western Europe? With the start up business model sewing itself into public consciousness more and more every year, it is becoming increasingly challenging to be the flag-bearer for your idea in the sea of all these hard-working and sleep-deprived teams around you. If your idea is original enough, solves individual or societal problems and at the same time is convenient and cheap, there is a good chance you are onto something. To give you some examples, here are several of the most innovative start ups in Western Europe:  Mush (United Kingdom) Around 10%-15% of women who have recently become mums suffer from post-natal depression. Mush is here to change that. The app encourages new parents to connect with others on a local level by enabling chatting, swapping and selling items. Even though parent-tech is a rapidly growing field of tech and thus is extremely competitive, the app has been an explosive success in the US, Canada and Australia.  Digital Shadows (United Kingdom) Large-scale hacking and leaks occur regularly. As Digital Shadows put it themselves, they monitor, manage and remediate digital risk across a wide range of data sources within the open, deep and dark web. The company is focused on protecting organisations' businesses, brands and reputation. Currently, Digital Shadows monitors more than 100 million sources in order to detect breaches, attacks and leaks. Just try to comprehend the immense quantity of information their A.I. mechanisms process.  Silent Circles (Switzerland) Silent Circles is an Enterprise Mobile Privacy Platform, which focuses on encryption, security, mobile technology and privacy. Alongside their software and an encrypted peer-to-peer service for mobile devices, they have developed a privacy-focused smartphone (Blackphone), which was designed with a secure network to protect users’ information from hackers and intelligence agencies. You may not know this, but Silent Circle is currently deployed at full scale in both public and private organisations all over the world: major pharmaceutical companies protecting R&D activities, government organisations protecting mission critical communications both in and out of countries, high tech businesses protecting intellectual property and M&A activity (to name a few). In an age where everything monitors everything (or everyone, if you like), Silent Circle keeps conversations between employees, customers and partners private.  The Future Group (Norway) As the name implies, the start up deals with something that will be the daily dose of fun in the future. Having started in 2013, The Future Group has developed the new Interactive Mixed Reality (IMR) entertainment platform. It enables users to play in a fully-rendered 3D environment, which, as you might already imagine, provides unlimited possibilities. Always wanted to cruise above L.A. in the Blade Runner universe? Got it. Always wanted to beat Voldemort in the courtyard of Hogwarts? No problem. Oh and also, Nolan Bushnell (the legendary founder of Atari) works with them as well.  Starship Technologies (United Kingdom) Pizza is important, right? Starship Technologies is here to bring Star Wars-like droids to your neighbourhood, or, for that matter, your doorstep. The start up seeks to revolutionise local delivery and since the guys behind it are co-founders of Skype, these autonomous, six-wheeled robots are to become the usual thing sooner rather than later. They have already run tests in 16 countries and partnered up with Just Eat and Domino's Pizza, not to mention raising £13.4 million in funding. The revolution of delivery has begun, so be careful not to bump into one of the couriers.  SWORD Health (Lisbon, Portugal) By linking tech and healthcare, SWORD Health is on a noble cause to democratize access to highly efficient and high-intensity rehabilitation therapy without increasing operative costs. Using A.I. tracking, the platform digitises human motion and gives real-time feedback to patients during the course of rehabilitation. Since it enables doctors to give feedback remotely, the platform can be used anywhere, including sanatoriums, homes, etc. SWORD Health has already partnered up with hospitals in China, Sweden, Portugal and the US, meaning that the medtech industry is taking off and is on its way to maximise the potential of healthcare.  Mimi (Berlin, Germany) Mimi Hearing Technologies allow you to test your ears and subsequently protect them by personalising the way you listen to music (and everything else) to suit your ears. By combining their scientific data of hearing capacity and the customer’s listening behaviour into a rich ear print, they innovate the way one listens and experiences music. Once the test is done, algorithms are at work to adjust the sound across devices you use according to your own personal “hearing profile.” As Mimi themselves state it – ears are not perfect and hearing gets worse over time, like any other body part. With over a million ears tested, twelve years of R&D, a breakthrough sound processing technology and two medically certified apps, it seems that calling the Mimi team experts in hearing ability and listening behaviour is an understatement.  Stanley Robotics (Paris, France) Imagine a modern version of Wall-E managing parking lots. That is precisely what Stanley Robotics are doing – its army of high-tech A.I.-lead valet robots named Stan moves and stores vehicles in reserved bays and private car parks, maximising use of space and thus increasing the number of vehicles in an area by 50%. There is more: every Stan is powered electrically, which means zero emissions. Also, the existing parking lot requires no additional construction work. The company is already fully operating in Paris’s Charles de Gaulle Airport and has raised €3.6 million in 2017.  Lemoncat (Berlin, Germany) After spending time in Silicon Valley, Doreen Huber was in awe how easily companies were bringing catering for their employees. When back in Germany, she had noticed that there was no strong online portal to source food for company events. To change that, she launched Lemoncat, an online marketplace with one vision: to put an end to boring sandwiches in the office and replace them with a healthy, varied and delicious diet. You choose whether it is a company breakfast, business lunch or delicious snacks, for 10 or 2000 employees. Lemoncat takes care of the rest. The service is live in more than 80 cities in Germany and has raised more than €9 million.  Linkilaw (United Kingdom) Linkilaw is here to disrupt the process of seeking legal advice, which up to now has been mostly tiresomely waiting for long amounts of time, paying large sums of money for an hourly rate and consequently getting your problem solved partially (if at all). The start-up draws up all the necessary documents for your legal issue for a fraction of the industry's price – be it a non-disclosure agreement, a pack of documents for your freelancing to take off safely or to start that new eCommerce project you were always dreaming about. If your legal issue is beyond the scope of Linkilaw services, they refer you to several of their lawyers, handpicked accordingly to your problem. Oh, and they are fast – you are sure to get the ball rolling within less than 24 hours following your first call. - Oh, and in case you decide to that make that amazing startup idea reality, be sure to check out Linkilaw in the process of doing so.

According to Gartner, a leading information technology analyst company, in 2019 5G became the most attractive technology along with artificial intelligence and digital ecosystems. This is quite expected: over the past few years, mobile communications have proven indispensable not only in the home, but also in large-scale industrial and innovative processes. Fast and uninterrupted data transmission is vital for the development and effective implementation of digital twins between enterprises and the industrial Internet of things, unmanned cars, cloud technologies and other technologies. 5G technology is able to transform not only the speed of communication between people, but also fundamentally change the very principles of information exchange. The whole material world - transport, buildings, industries, medical devices and so on - will be closely connected through electronic devices, software, sensors and cloud storage. All this will be possible thanks to the unique technological characteristics of 5G. The fifth generation communication standard allows to connect more than 1 million devices on the area up to 1 sq. km, supports connection at movement of the subscriber up to 500 km/h and allows to transfer data at a speed of more than 20 Gbit/s. Due to the wide range of available frequencies (especially high frequencies with short wavelengths and narrow directionality), the introduction of 5G increases traffic capacity, data transmission accuracy and stability, minimizes delays in Internet connections and increases the energy efficiency of equipment. As German Klimenko, former Internet Development Advisor to the Russian President, explains, ""4G communications are quite sufficient to meet the needs of an average consumer. The real need for 5G lies on a different plane: now the IoT market is growing exponentially, the number of devices connected to the network is rapidly increasing - from phones to fridges and kettles. The reality that surrounds us is growing in technological processes, and here, without changes in technology, speed and communication logistics itself, further development is impossible. According to GSMA research company, the Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation and the Union of Mobile Operators of LTE, the Russian communications market (which has already reached maturity with 89% of unique subscribers) will start commercial implementation of 5G from 2020, and by 2025 the share of fifth generation communications will grow to 46 million connections - about 20% of the total number. Despite the fact that this rate of development is considered to be higher than the world average, Russia continues to lag far behind the leading countries in 5G implementation and development - China, USA, South Korea and others. According to Dmitry Konarev, Huawei's leading expert on wireless technologies in Russia, it is premature to talk about the serious influence of Russian technology companies in the development of 5G. ""However, it should be noted that Russian companies are investing in studying the electromagnetic compatibility of future 5G networks with satellite networks - the latter we have quite a lot. Besides, there is a wealth of experience in their use. In the future this may have a positive impact on the formation of the final standard. Besides, Russian operators are actively testing 5G pilot zones. Only for the last year Huawei and MTS presented a project on management of ""smart cars"". In Russia, the introduction of 5G technology is fixed at the state strategic planning level. The federal project ""Information infrastructure"" of the national program ""Digital Economy"" is aimed to provide sustainable 5G coverage to all major cities with population over 1 million people by 2024. At the moment, German Klimenko explains, there is a kind of ""pre-start hype"" in Russia: ""LTE networks are actively operating and their use continues to grow. For most of our operators, the main revenue stream comes from Internet traffic. Therefore, they are interested in the expansion opportunities that will be available thanks to 5G. There is an active struggle between market players for the right to own frequencies"". Among the most promising applications of innovative technology, noted: unmanned transport, telemedicine, remote surgical operations using augmented or mixed reality equipment, as well as the creation of information infrastructure for Industry 4.0 and industrial Internet of Things. Ericsson experts have calculated that processing and transmission of one gigabyte of traffic in 5G networks will cost ten times cheaper than in existing 4G networks. All this refers to 5G, as a progressive and necessary technology, which is beginning to be actively implemented throughout the planet. Along with positive feedback on 5G, there are other opinions. Studies are being conducted on the negative impact on health and privacy. For example, this has happened in Belgium, the Swiss city of Vaud and American San Francisco. Radio frequency radiation (RF or RFR) and electromagnetic fields (EMF) are increasingly being positioned as new types of environmental pollution. The opponents of 5G are positioning themselves as advocates of health and privacy. For example, there are reports that the 5G network uses and transmits frequencies that affect our sweat glands that work like antennas. Or 5G can affect our biggest organ, our skin. Above all, electromagnetic fields provoke early aging and problems such as impaired fertility, brain, heart and DNA function. There are scientists who are trying to prove that short term devices are more dangerous than permanent exposure to electromagnetic fields, which is not quite correct. In addition to all of this, we read about the dangers of 5G, not only for health, but also the danger to life.  It's hard to argue with that. For example, when cell phones appeared, many scientists claimed the danger of cell phone conversations. A study of this problem has shown that in the usual use of smartphones, they do not cause any dangerous effects on the body. Just do not abuse this gadget and do not ""hang"" online all day long. Science has proven that any high-frequency magnetic field causes disorders of a living organism. But above all, it depends on the intensity of the radiation. In normal life, we are constantly surrounded by various electromagnetic radiation, ranging from the usual electrical network, to radio, television, computer networks and even the radiation from processors, which are in all advanced gadgets. Everything depends on the distance from the hazardous devices and their intensity. In normal life, humans are not threatened by all these radiations, although many scientists recommend limiting the time you use high-tech gadgets. In my opinion, RT spoke about problems with 5G only in the context of the reaction that arose when discussing new technologies. It is simply not correct to talk about purposeful discrediting of this direction. A certain suspicion of everything new naturally causes discussion of this problem. For example, in Russia the introduction of 5G was somewhat delayed only because the frequency range used by this technology was occupied by intelligence agencies. As far as I know, but now this problem has been solved and the introduction of 5G is in test mode in small communities. The final implementation will take place only after quite thorough tests, but 5G should occupy its niche.",2021-03-06T12:42:22.342Z,"Why is Russia today spreading that 5G is bad for your health?

If I nerd-out, I just might lose most of you. Volumetric video is essentially the same idea behind photogrammetry, except that volumetric video adds the fourth dimension of time. No matter the resolution of capture and the frame rate, one is left dealing with truly staggering amounts of data. Here is a “dramatic” but accurate representation of photogrammetry achieved with a DSLR method (not the only way):  Imagine a human is standing in the center of a specially designed studio for the purpose of volumetric capture, such as his one developed by 8i (the person here is Logan Paul):  You will note a camera behind him on top of a tripod covered in green screen material. What you do not see from this angle, is that there are multiple cameras arranged around him in a similar fashion. After a performance is captured, the unneeded areas are matted out, the remainder has the green removed. Now, this is where it gets complicated, and involves all types of maths. The short of it is: by knowing the appropriate information for each camera placement (we’ll simplify here to just the camera location in this explanation), computer software triangulates and interpolates the overlapping visual information. Sheer computing power takes over at this point, and it generates what is known as a point cloud. It is exactly like what it sounds, a bunch of points in space with geometric and depth information, not unlike this clip:  As one can see, by itself, point cloud data isn't very useful (very ‘noisy,’ for one) for our end goal in video. The software must now crunch through the point cloud data, to connect all those fine points, and creates a more traditional 3D mesh with the appropriate textures from the capture, applied to it. Thankfully, this is now a much more simplified process than it used to be. Here is a quick example of point cloud data cleanup, using AutoDesk ReCap (Reality Capture) enterprise tools:  It’s not 100% automated, as it requires manual cleanup and correction, but it’s pretty good, and is only getting better all the time. The end result looks something like the following video:  I should point out that 8i, and others like them, have proprietary tools for their services. Furthermore, the end result, while it can be delivered as a point cloud or mesh, is actually delivered as a type of pixel that has both color and depth information. Technically speaking, it is not a mesh, which is why, when used in a game engine or compliant web browser, renders very fast, no matter which angle is being used, in real-time. On the plus side, this means more computation intensive tasks may be sent to the CPU and/or GPU. On the downside, well, for everyone else but 8i, it means one must license their proprietary volumetric pixel CoDec (which is not standardized as of yet for any consumer-level items, as of this post). Prior to companies such as 8i offering this as a commercial service, it was relegated mostly to research and high-end visual effects (most notably perhaps first in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). This can all be traced back to USC and multiple-award winning researcher, VFX Supervisor, and just all-around genius: Paul Debevec.

I would have thought that a Texan still regards themself as a Texan. A federal EU containing the UK may well allow England to express herself again. The economic arguments of Brexit are meaningless to me. The EU is by far our largest market, so remaining close, with free movement of everything, is a strong benefit. Further, the more distant, large nations (e.g. India and China) have little commercial interest in us; Germany exports its cars into China, but the UK makes cars only because the UK is within the EU. Brexiteers ignore the reality that proximity is primary in trade. There are 1.9 million British living in the EU. Without a deal to protect their interests, most would flood home, but to where? What houses, what hospitals, doctors and dentists, what schools? My eldest daughter retired to Spain and has set up a business there; she is terrified of being forced out. I thought we all enjoyed having great plumbers and builders from the EU. They charged less that the British and were a lot keener to work. Why would anyone want to threaten them? Our hospitals are staffed by many migrants, often from the EU. It was a Spanish surgeon who operated on my wife’s spine. When I entered A&E one Christmas, my nurse was Romanian. We want them out?

I understand that some very successful or gifted people may sound pretentious at times, but maybe there are some grounds to understand that. If you know how good you are, then it is hard from time to time to hide your ambition. People just as Elon Musk, or Richard Feynman (the genius Physicist with a Nobel in 1965), or Beyoncé Knowles might have seemed to be pretentious now and then, but it cannot be denied that they are/were very talented.  (Feynman, baby.) But I am not writing an answer about them. This is about a professor I have known — initial “F” — who was morbidly pretentious, without the least iota of talent. In fact, he was a below average teaching assistant at this university, and at some point in 1990s (far before my time), the university had decided that all teaching assistants with a state of service of at least 10 years in his faculty, were to be tenured as a professor. (This really happened.) Big mistake. Many of them were not ready to be a professor, and some never would. He was one of the latter. And although he was a fairly good teacher — but not capable of answering the questions of the brighter students — he totally changed once he became a professor. He loved the power. The juice it brought. I could talk you about how he bullied the younger people, how he recruited people by making false promises he could never fulfill, about his many lies. I could talk you about the many and major mistakes he wrote down in his class notes, and the troubles there were when bright students remarked those inconsistencies (and the backlash on those students). I could also talk about the lies to his kin, who lived in the false reality that he was an honest talented researcher with a mission. All these facts are expressions of his sick pretentiousness, taking his own modest talent into regards. But instead, I will tell one story. At some conference, he gave a lecture about a long-standing conjecture he claimed to have solved with a Ph. D. student. In fact, he made it very clear that most of the ideas were his own. (A very weird thing to begin with.) This was quite the news, because by now, many good researchers were rather hesitant when talking about his qualities as a researcher. In fact, he almost never succeeded in having original ideas, and was a copycat beyond comprehension. And now this. One of the best researchers — worldwide — in the field, who knew the capacities of both F. and his student, was in the room, and immediately was highly suspicious, because he knew the conjecture very well, and had thought about it deeply. When the lecture was over, the questions came. The hotshot researcher asked his questions at the end. By now, he already knew that the proof was flawed. So he asked some questions to start with. As usual, F. answered using his very good memory (avoiding arguments or proofs). Then the question came about the crucial step in the “proof.” He could not answer it. Again a similar question. He could not answer it. And after some more similar questions, instead of admitting something was wrong, he said: “I must say that this is the one idea my student came up with, and I did not check it in detail yet.” So it was the student’s mistake, not his own. He first claimed the result, and then blamed an innocent, in public. What a total asshole.  Visit and follow me at Quora ! References: Google images. Further reading: Richard Feynman - Wikipedia.

We can spin our stories around them. The funniest thing about this question is that the article from Financial Express mentioned in the question detail is more than one year old. Most of the answers are currently dated and have no relation to the points made out in the article. The news story itself is no great shakes and does nothing to substantiate the premise of the question. Past Trends : No one has the crystal gazing abilities to know what the market would do in case of any political event. On November 09, 2016, we had the Demonetization news from the previous evening combined with US Election results coming in leading to Donald Trump becoming President of the USA. His win was supposed to be an economic disaster. Experts had predicted a 10% crash in the markets. Nothing of the sort happened and all the Stock Markets world over went on making the new highs. This is how it happened on November 09 and 10 in 2016.  From a low of 8002, we were at near 8600 next day. So much for the expertise of the so called experts and their predictions. Election Results and Markets: Let us look at what happened when BJP led by Mr. Narendra Modi won the Lok Sabha Elections in 2014.  On the day of results ( May 16, 2014 ), it moved to the high point of 7563 from the previous close of 7123. Over next two days it was business as usual. Probably the electoral victory was already factored in. Actually markets do not go up by much when the expected things happen. It is when the unexpected occurs that the big move happens. When UPA won the second term in 2009, this was the market reaction:  Results were on a Saturday ( May 16, 2009 ). Markets went up by more than 15% on UPA victory. It does not matter to the market whether BJP wins or UPA wins. Markets look for stability. Does it actually matter if the markets go up ? : All the hype about BJP winning and markets going up is created by the media. It does not make any money for us. Stock markets are not one day wonders. Neither these are casinos where you make your fortune or go bust with one right or wrong bet. It is sustained performance over a period of time which matters. BJP Government was formed on May 26, 2014. NIFTY on that day:  NIFTY on Friday June 15, 2018 :  It has moved from 7359 to 10817 in a little more than 4 years. Let us say in 49 months. A gain of 47% in 49 months. A good performance indeed. Let us compare it to the NIFTY movement during the much maligned UPA 2 Government. Like mentioned earlier in this answer, NIFTY went up by more than 15% in two days when the Election Results were out in 2009. Dr. Manmohan Singh took oath of office for the second term on May 22, 2009. NIFTY on that day was at 4238.50.  We know where it was when Mr. Modi took over in 2014. It was 7359. In 60 months of UPA dispensation, NIFTY had gone up by 3120 points. With the base number as 4238, this means a gain of 73.60% in 60 months. Stock Markets did actually well even in UPA 2 times. Some of the credit in the last part can be given to the projections of a BJP victory in 2014 which kept the markets up. But that kind of gain should be automatically built in for the current regime as well with their projections of winning again in 2019. To Summarize: In 60 months of UPA 2, NIFTY had gone up by 73.60%. In 49 months of BJP Government, NIFTY is up by 47%. These are the facts. There is no hype surrounding these numbers. These are not based on the knee jerk movements based on the election result. And it is certainly no reflection on the quality of governance or economic reforms. UPA 2 was certainly a mess and was voted out. But the markets did not care then. Today also things are not as good or as bad as perceived by the supporters or detractors of the ruling party. And again the market does not care two hoots. Markets always do their own thing and trying to fathom that is an exercise in futility. Well, the markets may rise higher for a day or two if Narendra Modi wins the elections for his party in 2019. After those two days, it will be back to reality as always. Politics and Markets generally do not mix well contrary to what the experts on business channels keep telling us everyday. We just have to take the time to look at the reality ourselves. I trust that this answers the question. Thanks for reading. Enjoy the weekend.

Where blockchain is decentralized distributed system for faster, transparent transaction. So, ofcourse they are different as it is like a website made on react vs react technology! But, still lets find out how blockchain has been applied in the bitcoins and also what bitcoins are with top 5 difference between blockchain vs bitcoin!So, let just get started!!! 1.How Bitcoin is different from Blockchain A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Blockchain was infact designed for bitcoins!Whereas bitcoins is a ledger( A distributed ledger is simply a database spread across different nodes) started in 2009 as a cryptocurrency which is built on blockchain technology. 2.How Bitcoin uses Blockchain The Bitcoin blockchain in its simplest form is a database or ledger comprised of Bitcoin transaction records. However, because this database is distributed across a peer-to-peer network and is without a central authority, network participants must agree on the validity of transactions before they can be recorded. This agreement, which is known as “consensus,” is achieved through a process called “mining.” 3.What is Bitcoin all about Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a ‘digital wallet’ app on a smartphone or computer. People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. 4.Other applications of blockchain than cryptocurrency Data in the blocks need not be limited to financial transactions only as in voter registeration done in switzerland people are identified using the hashes of blockchain whose coolest part is that in UPORT app you need not login with password!! It has expanded to real estate and because blockchains are direct transactions there are no brokers here. ArBit has developed its own sort of coins that rewards musicians for their contribution and many more!!!This field is on its way to blow up!!! 5.Data mining in Bitcoin Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin’s public ledger of past transactions or blockchain. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. After someone uses Bitcoins, miners engage in complex, resource-intense computational equations to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. Through mining, a “proof of work” that meets certain requirements is created. The proof of work is a piece of data that is costly and time-consuming to produce but can easily be verified by others. To be considered a valid transaction on the blockchain, an individual record must have a proof of work to show that consensus was achieved. By this design, transaction records cannot be tampered with or changed after they have been added to the blockchain. -Engineer Diaries(Follow Engineer Diaries for latest tech, startup and career news in India!)

60437a82ed76476feda2c74d,https://www.quora.com/How-can-game-user-interfaces-inspire-better-tech-products?-,"Game user interfaces tend to serve the majority and don’t focus on expert level users as they need to make money. Sometimes this means not allowing too much customizations. For example today there are many third party input and output devices (joy pads, keyboards, steering wheels & pedals, guitars, laser guns, drums, 360 treadmills, etc., and output devices like vibration feedback, 3D visuals, higher frame rates, color coordination of lights with onscreen action, etc.) which can arguably enhance the experience, but the game may not support it. I myself struggle with joypads as I’m a used to keyboard and mouse, and would really love it if all games provided that support. Another aspect is customization of controls quite popular in keyboards and touchscreen controls. UX should consider the availability as well as the configuration of these options. As games get more advanced and step into Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality the technology that supports it become very important. The usability, weight and comfort over prolonged use, the amount of horizontal and vertical viewing, object depth of field etc… in the future tech will progress enough to place Mixed reality into a lens in our eyes instead of putting on a display headset. If you look back in time as a kids had to startup a windows 98 computer or place a cartridge into their Sega at home which would take a while to Load and start playing with all kinds of sounds besides the game with up to two players max… today we simply slide out our smartphones and play often online with hundreds of other real players! Though Technology was key here it was the fact that the need to interface in this way that created a gap in technology that needed to be closed. One of the patterns I’d like to highlight is that it is common for imagination to precede the technology that bring it to reality… if you read old SciFi novels you will mentions of Tech like Skype, smartphones, magnetic levitation transportation etc… Heads up displays was first a need for jet fighter pilots who didn’t have time to view the dashboard so the user interface needed to be wherever the pilot looked….technology had to then come up with a way to show the data using a see through screen but due to limitations of human cognitive function and interfacing tech needed to redesign the solution based on UI required. My answer isn’t a direct answer but I’m trying to cover various ways that the user, UI and Tech inspire each other. Though they say necessity is the mother of all invention, they forget to clarify that necessity includes the need to be creative.

When the world’s largest tech companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple) are investing billions into the development of VR technologies, you know something big is on the horizon. Experts say that this VR revolution will be bigger than the advent of the mobile phone, and the first company to create a consumer VR product that is adopted by the masses will win big. Really big. So why should designers care? Designers should care because the market that has provided them with reliable work over the past few decades and is about to shift towards a new paradigm of immersive 3D content. Sound, touch, depth, and emotion will all be integral to the VR experience, making even the most novel 2D screen experiences feel boring and dated. *Note: Realizing there is a lot of overlap between virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR), I’ve decided just to use the term ‘VR’ in this article for the sake of simplicity. I will explore AR/MR in more detail in a future article. Getting Started I wrote this article to help people get oriented with the processes, tools, and principles when creating VR experiences like we have in our company. Let’s dive in! The Best Way to Learn about VR design…Is in VR In VR you’re not just an observer, but you’re a participant in the story with an option to influence its outcome. Pretty cool, right? So before you even start thinking about designing for VR, it’s critical to experience it first hand and really understand how it works. Google Cardboard is a great entry point for newbies, as it is affordable ($15) and works with any smart phone. For people who want the best quality experience and are willing to pay for it, Oculus Rift or HTC Vive are the best options. The Oculus and Vive both have natural hand controllers, which let’s you interact with your virtual spaces. The Tilt Brush and Google Earth VR apps are great interactive experiences to try first.  Tilt Brush “We’re finally going to be free of the 2D monitor. It’s been a window into virtual reality that we’ve all looked into for 30–40 years.” — Brendan Iribe Think Beyond the Rectangle After you have an idea of what VR feels like, it’s time to think about what kind of experience you want to design. We’ve all grown so used to designing for rectangles because every viewing device is a rectangle. When you’re in immersive 360 space, your environment is boundless. Do you want to create a first person game? Maybe an educational app? An interactive movie? Whatever it is, start simple and think about what you need to start an MVP.  Oculus Home UI Sketch Ideas Getting started designing your VR experience isn’t too different than the process for designing a web or mobile product. You will need user personas, conceptual flows, wireframes, and an interaction model. As you ideate on design ideas, consider some of these fundamental questions: How do people get started?What affordances are provided to guide people without overwhelming them?Do you want to err on the side of providing too much guidance or create a minimalist environment that doesn’t overload the user with too many choices?Don’t expect people to know what to do and where to go. Slow and progressive familiarization, visual clues, and guidance from the software should all be used to help the user. Don’t Reinvent UI Patterns VR apps with intuitive user interfaces — similar to what people use on their wearables, phones, tablets and computers — are what will make VR accessible to the masses. Novel interactions are fun to come up with, but it increases user’s learning curve. Similar to designing 2D interfaces, designers should use size, contrast and color to denote hierarchy. In VR, size is based on the distance between the user and a piece of content, so it’s important to understand the scale of content and appropriate viewing distance. For example, knowing how large to design your type is tricky, but fortunately there are many precedents in the real world. The same considerations made for print design (billboards, posters, books) are helpful when designing content for VR.  Billboard; Samsung Gear Home UI Consider how you interact with a touchscreen monitor today. There are a number of patterns that we have all grown to understand such as swiping, pinching to zoom, and long tapping to bring up more options. These are all considerations that should be made in VR as well. I’m confident that as more designers come into the VR field, there will be more minds to create and vet new UI patterns, helping the industry to move forward.  Google Cardboard UI Guidelines Tools Pencil and Paper Before getting into any software, it’s crucial to get your ideas out on paper. It’s fast, cheap, and helps you express ideas that may take hours in software. This is especially important because moving from sketches to hi-fidelity can cost much more in 3D than in 2D. Software Some designers start with tools they already know like Sketch, others use it as an opportunity to learn new tools. It really depends on what engine you are going to use to build your app. If you are building a 3D game, you’ll want to use Unity or Unreal Engine. Cinema 4D and Maya are also widely used, but mostly for complex animations and renderings.  Unity Frameworks There are three major frameworks to choose from when designing for VR: Mozilla A-Frame, Daydream VR, and Unity VR/Unreal SDK. Mozilla A-Frame is for Web VR and can be used platforms such as Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear, and Oculus Rift.Daydream VR is for midrange VR and works with mobile phones only.Unity VR/Unreal SDK are for high end headsets including Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and HoloLens (AR).Experience Principles When you’re designing for VR, you’re designing for the capabilities of people as much as you’re designing for the capabilities of the system. So it’s essential that you understand your users and the issues that may come up while they experience VR. “Virtual reality is the ultimate empathy machine. These experiences are more than documentaries. They’re opportunities to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes.” -Chris Milk Physiological Comfort Designing an experience that is comfortable for people is the most important consideration (and a difficult one). If you’ve ever used a VR headset for more than 20 minutes, you’ve likely experienced some sort of fatigue or nausea. VR can confuse your brain because your body is stationary but you’re viewing an environment that is moving. Providing a fixed reference point, such as a horizon line or a dashboard that stays with you as you move, helps ease nausea. If there is much movement in your app— accelerating, zooming, jumping— it must be controlled by the users or they will become sick. Environmental Comfort Just like in the physical world, people can easily get uncomfortable in small, large, or high spaces (claustrophobia/agoraphobia/vertigo), so it’s important to understand scale when designing in VR. If you design a space that’s too big, users may get lost. If a space is too small, users may get claustrophobic. There are many ways to guide people through your virtual environment. Non-spatial methods including audio and light can be especially useful. Audio can be used for spatial positioning and light can be used to reveal a path to follow. The gaming industry has used these techniques for years to help guide people through their journeys. Ergonomics When first designing for VR it’s exciting to think about creating futuristic interfaces like we’ve seen from Hollywood blockbusters like Iron Man or Minority Report, but the reality is those UIs would be exhausting if used for more than a few minutes. The following diagrams help to illustrate the comfortable range of motion zones:  Source: Mike Alger, Alex Chu  Source: Mike Alger, Alex Chu We’ve all been affected by some sort of “text neck” syndrome at some point (the soreness felt from looking down at our smart phones for extended periods). Depending on how far you lean over, poor posture can create up to 60 pounds of pressure on your spine. This can lead to permanent nerve damage in your spine and neck.  Image: Torrance Memorial Medical Center As VR is adopted by a wider audience, it will be essential to establish healthy habits and movement standards. Instead of trying to adapt ourselves to fit the limited interactions supported by our existing technologies, our interactions with VR platforms will need to be as natural and intuitive as possible. This “natural computing” paradigm — that is, interactions that no longer have to adapt to the limited form factors of the computer (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen) — will allow us to interact with the digital world in the same way we interact with the physical world. “Instead of trying to adapt ourselves to fit the limited interactions supported by our existing technologies, our interactions with VR platforms will need to be as natural and intuitive as possible.” Input Methods When you’re wearing a VR headset, you can’t see what is in your hands. Unlike gaming controllers that we’ve grown accustomed to (Playstation, Xbox, Wii), VR hand controllers have to be suitable for “blind mode” use. Every platform has different methods to engage with the VR environment. For example, Google Cardboard has only one button, Oculus and HTC Vive both have two hand controllers which provide six degrees of freedom. The controllers enhance the VR experience by allowing users to pick things up and physically engage with the others.  Sound While sound is often annoying when using the web or mobile apps, it is a integral part of VR. Consider the phenomenon of synesthesia, where stimulation of one sense leads to the automatic triggering of another sense. For example, you smell something and get the illusion of taste. This also works with sound. Since tactile feedback is still lacking in VR, sound is a great way to provide feedback when users touch objects. 3D Sound — aka Holophonic sound — is still in its infancy, but will be transformative in how we experience VR. We are all used to stereophonic sound, which provides sound coming from two channels (left/right), but holophonic sound allows us to tell if sound is coming from above, below, or behind us. Think of when you are outside and hear an airplane. You intuitively look up, right? Having this sound experience in VR is what will make it truly immersive. VR Design Guidelines In closing, I recommend checking out a few resources that will give you a broader understanding of how to design for VR. Google VR Guidelines, Oculus VR Best Practices, and the UX of VR are the best places to start. After reading through these resources, you’ll easily be ahead of the crowd. Think, Explore, Create What’s exciting about designing for VR right now is there are very few established conventions and very few experts — it’s a completely open field! If you start designing for VR now, you could be the expert in one year. If you already have experience in gaming or architecture, you already have an head start. This industry shift from 2D to 3D is not only a great opportunity to rethink paradigms of human-computer interaction, but be involved in the creation of a entirely new field. Just like the process of coming into any new field, it’s essential to be constantly reflecting on the new opportunities in this industry. There are infinite opportunities to innovate, improve, and create brand new experiences in this space. So think big, be critical, and break out of your 2D thought process!",2021-03-06T12:51:13.554Z,"How easy is it to design VR games? ",Quora

I easily pass that star because the speed of thought is faster than light, and so I travel past yet more stars whose light will never reach Earth. And then yet more do I travel to the outer reach of the last photon of light from the last star before empty space continues. I do not stop. I enter the lightlessness and keep going until space and time begin to “thin out.” But yet there is FULL AWARENESS despite materiality’s utter sublimation. Out here, with only Identity yet remaining, all defining by even God’s mind ceases. Beyond identity there is…..there is…. Out here. Out here. Out here. There is….. Seems infinite to me. Awareness never wavered. Same deal when I look within. When one travels within, it’s like stirring a campfire with a stick.The stick is the intellect at one end, the heart in the middle, and the soul at the end where you hold it. As we stir, the very tool we use is also consumed. As we get quiet inside, we reach the SAME distant reaches, and keep going.The final frontier passed is from being into pure being where consciousness is known as immaterial — not as the workings of neurons. At some point, soul becomes too confining, so the last nub of our stick to tossed into the flames of knowledge too. What remains is awareness, and the tick-a-tocks of brains become sterile, meaningless, illusory. No phrase like “infinite consciousness” can possibly represent reality. To one who has not seen this vastness clearly, all the above is bogus blathering bunkum by a bonkered brain. And by that I mean, me. This is the rub. Knowledge changes when consciousness changes. The dream you is not the waking you is not the transcendent you. The guru cannot talk you into enlightenment even with absolutely flawless statements. Only by transcending can true statements later be appreciated. You want more rub? Here: If you are an expert in brain physiology and cannot FIND COMMON GROUND with an expert in, say, Kabbalah, or The Vedas, then you are not an expert. Anyone being snooty towards the religious folks is not educationally mature. Any religious person being snooty towards the scientific method needs to remember that Jesus did chemistry by mixing spit and clay. We are all trying to grasp God.

Congratulations that you choose to begin to learn politics rather than being part of those huge chunk of cynics whose knowledge of politics is limited but their cynicism with politics is unlimited. There are 3 stages through which you can understand politics which will be a mix of theory and practice. 1. Basic Stage - Reading Politics At this stage, all you need to do is Read. Read as much as possible. Read Local Newspapers in Local language along with National Newspapers. If you are a Kannadiga, read Kannada newspapers covering mainly regional politics along with National Newspapers covering National scene. It will help you understand how regional politics influence national and vice versa. Read multiple newspapers and see how different people view same issue in different light.  At the end of this theory stage, you will be theoretically able to write many of the political questions in Quora and still be seen as expert. But you are not expert yet. Most don't go beyond this stage and end up writing theoretical stuff. But you should go ahead. 2. Intermediate Stage - Feeling Politics Throw away the theory. It's time for getting a “feel” of the crowd, understand what motivates a crowd, what makes people tick and how a leader goes about his task.  At this practical stage, you can go to any political crowd and raise a few slogans for any cause, observe and feel the psyche of a political activist and also the pull of a leader. You will unlikely be able to give a speech as a new person in the group although attempting a speech if you have an opportunity would not be bad. If nothing else, go join a Bajrang Dal group on Ram Navami and scream “Jai Shree Ram” at the top of your voice across the street. After this stage, you will never ask why XYZ politician with less education is Prime Minister while other one with more academic credentials are not. You will already know the answer as you may have already known how key Leadership is in taking forward a nation and how it is. In one go, it will have taught you more about leadership than all other books put together. It is for a reason that Top Journalist across India still go on the field to collect their information while they can easily get it from their employees. 3. Advanced Stage - Reading & Feeling Politics At this stage, you should be able to do that which many politicians do naturally - Understand and even feel the political dynamics even while sitting reading in a remote corner of any country. In short, feel the pulse of the nation by just reading.  I distinctly remember the late Shiv Sena Chief Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray, the man who literally moved the masses in Maharashtra remarking to a journalist in an interview “You read the lines in politics. But I can read between the lines”. A deep understanding will require you to go back to history, Indian philosophy and civilization studies apart from Sociology and Politics. You will begin to have a bird's eye view of how today's reality fits into with the world view and the evolution of this civilization. You will begin to see the root causes which often begin much before you were born and also possible ways to resolve it. You will also see the tremendous roadblocks to the issues facing the nation in term of identity and development. P.S : I have replied to political part only as the question demanded. You need much more broader reading like economics, law and government policy for contributing much more to the nation. A politician here from BJP.

However, I would be willing to bet that AR (Augmented Reality) will continue to be a growing trend in technology — and not just visual AR. I personally believe that AR will continue to the point where we will be essentially almost a new species, if that makes any sense. Those old ideas of having a chip put into our hand in the future won’t happen, but look at how smartphones specifically have affected our brains — immediate access to all the information you could ever need, moreso than ever before in history. Never before have we been so connected. That said, when you think of AR you think of Google Glass and Heads Up Displays. I don’t think it will always be that obvious. Look at the new Pixel Buds with Google Assistant and Google Translate built in — if you have a Pixel phone paired to them, it will actively translate up to I believe 40 languages instantly? Absolutely incredible. And these aren’t prohibitively expensive — under $200! Look at technology like Be My Eyes — for under $10 grand, which, given, is a lot, but not for what it can do, it can enable blind people to see again. Absolutely mind blowing. I would argue that AR is at play with this one too. Look at things like Apple Watch and Galaxy Gear — I think this technology will go from awkward (like it is now) to almost a part of us — just like how the iPhone in 2007 was awkward, now the smartphone is practically an extension of ourselves. So, in conclusion, I think that VR itself will be a fad, and may stick around in forms like Oculus Rift for gaming, but beyond that, I don’t see VR itself taking off much more. However, AR will take off for sure, and I think the difference is that AR augments the existing reality that you’re already in, virtual reality replaces the reality you can see with a new reality — and AR is more practical. That said, VR gaming is insanely cool. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T12:53:22.134Z,"Is virtual reality really the future? ",Quora

In the case of a death by illness, a person’s guardian will be aware that they are near death and will be there to guide them to the spirit world. Guidance back is necessary because a spirit will have become identified with the mortal life and may be disoriented for a time. In the case of accidental or sudden death, if a person’s guardian is not near they will be alerted by the incident. (In the process of a guardian being “bound to their charge,” they are automatically alerted to both positive and negative extreme states.) In those situations in which a large number of deaths happen in a brief time period, such as in a natural disaster, a spirit’s guardian might be assisting others and they might end up on the wrong spiritual plane, but they do not remain earthbound. They will soon be redirected by spirits who have been called to assist in the process of multiple returns. While spirits do not “stay” earthbound, they do sometimes return later. A spirit of sufficiently high status can choose to appear in the form of an apparition (ghostly figure) that resembles their former human self, but this can only be done within the guidelines of the spirit world. A spirit must first successfully complete the fifth stage of transition back to the spirit world, on the plane of manifestation, and then make a request of a Master or Council stating their purpose for appearing in the physical world. This is almost always a one-time occurrence, with subsequent sightings being imagined by those who have heard of the first one. Some spirits experience difficulty in completing the stages of transition and become what are referred to as errant spirits. They sometimes return to earth and linger near a loved one or in a place that was significant to them, but they cannot manifest as an apparition. They might be classified as earthbound, though that is not a term used in the spirit world. Some mortals have an awareness of these energies. Some errant spirits are motivated by the human feelings they retain to interfere in the life of a mortal. They do not have evil intent but act more as an irritant. Their actions are allowed because it serves as a challenge for that person’s spirit, rather like a pesky younger sibling in the life of a teen-ager. Other than as an apparition, a spirit who is not an errant spirit might also return to the physical realm, and they do not need permission if it is simply to observe or watch over their loved ones. They do need permission, and a specific purpose, if they wish to be close enough and exert enough energy that a human would be aware of their presence. This will be easier for spirits of higher status. In these instances, their visits are usually brief, even if frequent, and the term earthbound would be less appropriate. *My sources are two spirits who spoke to me through another person (not channeled).

You’ve mixed up the three different origin stories of super-metals of the Marvel Universe.

Vibranium was part of an alloy which accidentally (or on purpose) created the proto-Adamantium used in Captain America’s first round shield. Attempts to recreate the shield would later lead to the discovery of Adamantium. You have confused the origins of at least three of Marvel’s most famous metals, proto-Adamantium, Adamantium and Vibranium. Since I have written about all three more extensively in other treatments, I will keep it brief to correct your misinformation. Proto-Adamantium: Captain America’s comic canon shield is the most durable substance on Marvel Earth. It isn’t likely to be the most durable substance in the Universe, but on Earth, it has no equal; it is completely unique. Called proto-Adamantium, this alloy cannot be affected by any natural force on Earth.  The shield can only be affected by someone who has the ability to alter the fundamental forces of reality. If you can turn sunshine into kittens, you can probably affect Captain America’s shield.Forged by accident, in an alloy mixing a series of unknown compounds, metallic alloys, Vibranium, plus a little Chemical X (a secret ingredient as yet unknown deposited while a scientist was asleep during the creation process) resulted in Captain America’s unbreakable shield.The creation of this particular metal was an accident and has never been repeated effectively. (I secretly believe a time traveler from the far future came back, altered the formula to create the iconic shield to serve some purpose in the distant future… But that’s just my idea.Adamantium: In a search to discover a means of replicating Captain America’s shield, unsuccessful time after time, eventually led to the perfection of the next best thing: Adamantium.  Almost completely indestructible, this alloy is the most durable substance commercially able to be created on Earth (in small amounts worth a billion times their weight in gold.) Objects made of Adamantium cannot be destroyed except by reality alteration.Adamantium starts as a resin suspension which is shaped (or applied) while still in liquid form. Better like it, though, because once it sets, it cannot be reshaped or altered.Objects coated in Adamantium increase their durability a thousand fold; making anything thus coated capable of being broken only by the strongest of beings. (Hulk, Sentry, Gladiator, Blue Marvel, Red Hulk). Early Ultron bodies were coated with Adamantium and were able to deflect even the direct attacks of Mjolnir.Adamantium is extremely rare on Marvel Earth, with the bulk of it in the hands of the government, its operatives, metahumans and super-scientific organizations who do everything in their power to find, steal, or create more Adamantium.Vibranium: Vibranium is a metallic substance with unusual properties. It can absorb or redirect physical, sonic, vibration or kinetic energy which strikes the metal. Used in armor, it can blunt the force of weapons, reducing their damage dealing capacities to a fraction of what they were previously.   Despite what you may have read in early comics, Vibranium is not naturally-occurring. It is a manufactured substances (believed to be made by the Celestials) of which there was only one source of on the entire Marvel Earth in any great amount, the Vibranium Mound of Wakanda.Harnessed by the Wakandans, Vibranium has been experimented with constantly for a thousand years, with the royal family and its retainers, gaining significant opportunity thanks to the properties of the Mound. Vibranium is very durable, likely a hundred times more durable and resistant to damage than ordinary steel.Any form of kinetic energy directed toward the material is absorbed and the energy released either under control as a weapon or protective barrier, or omni-directionally bleeding off excess energy harmlessly. The Wakandans have mastered using this material as part of their technology and are the leading experts on Wakandan Vibranium.Vibranium can also create mutagenic effects on living things who are too long exposed to the material without the proper protections and safeguards. It is this mutagenic property which led to the creation of the Panther Cult and the Black Panther to protect citizens of Wakanda from mutants created by Vibranium exposure.  For the Research hounds among you: In 1985′s Captain America #303, (see above) we meet MacLain who, we learn, created Captain America’s shield…and yes, in MacLain notes we learn the shield is composed of adamantium/something-something/vibranium/iron alloy.

There is just this attitude that you are “dirty” if you buy or use birth control, ie. you only need a condom if you or your partner may have an STD. This gets to the second point, education. Sex education seems to be nearly non-existent. In american public schools it was always a source of debate and embarrassment, what topics and how in depth sex education was taught. But, the end result is that I was taught a pretty good idea about reproductive systems, womens cycles, as well as methods, reasons, pros/cons of various forms of birth control. From what I can tell boys are taught little or nothing and girls are only taught about the “rhythm” method as the only acceptable. Oh, and whatever your views on it, abortion is strictly illegal Third, There is a lot of poverty and very high un-employment / under-employment. This is kind of self perpetuating. I mean You take very dense population, with little to do but hang out ( being un/under-employed ). Tell them not to use birth control. Mix in cheap available liquor and popularity of western pop culture. This is a simple formula that equals lots of babies, Babies born to parents that were not ready nor able to afford them.

She can catche you in one of those submissions from any position. She was already on a 12 fight win streak and submitting every female in the way. Along the way she rose to superstardom rarely seen by a woman in MMA. Infact, she became the biggest star, bigger than GSP at her time. This lead to her giving more time to media then any other fighter. This can sometimes hinder your training because you have limited time for everything when you are the biggest star. And sometimes you het stuck in a routine especially when you are winning your fights in 30 seconds. She is a submission artist but last of her few matches ended in TKOs. This can give the people who have lesser knowledge on MMA an illusion that her striking game is also dangerous. That is not the case. These opponents were not that established strikers but had background in wrestling, BJJ etc. Honestly, UFC had not seen an established woman striker before. And knocking out her opponents in last few matches might have given her a false sense of her striking abilities. The truth is that she had not faced an established Striker and her she was, facing HOLLY HOLM. Now, for people who don't know about HOLLY HOLM. She is a world champion professional boxer who was champion in different promotions at the same time. She defended her title 18 times and has been named Fighter of the year a couple of times. In short, she was the best and the biggest opponent for Ronda. Now, the thing is that before going to MMA from Boxing, she actually did kickboxing in between and had an amazing kicking ability. She was know for her devastating left high kick with which she would actually KNOCKOUT Rousey. Here is what happened. Ronda knew that she had a superior grappling and ground game. But for that to work she had to get into a clinch with Holly. That means she had to close the distance between her and Holly. Secondly, staying at a distance from Holly was always dangerous because that gave Holly space to unleash her kicks. So thats why you can see that from the start Ronda was after Holly keeping the distance small between them and nullify Holly’s kicking. But here is where she went wrong. She had to close the distance between them but instead that she was actually directly running at her. This played right into Holly’s plan as she is established counter stricker. That is she waits for her opponents to engage and then she can catch them coming in with her elite level boxing. Now this is not Ronda’s fault. Her couch should have made a good plan. Ronda was literally running into Holly instead of maintaining close distance. Or maybe Ronda was to overconfident about her striking and was looking to knock her out. She should have known that in the past she knocked not so established strikers. And when she faced Holly, she knew there was a huge gap in her striking. Infact, Ronda had lost the match in the very start when she got tagged by Holly. She had never been hit with that power and that to cleanly. She admitted in her Ellen interview that she was literally out of control after she got hit with the first punch. She was scared after that. She came to know the huge gap in her striking with those initial punches. And she couldn't implement her grappling or judo because she couldn't come close to Holly. At the same time she couldn't stay away from her because of Holly’s lethal high kick. Just imagine being in Ronda’s position. She is the biggest start in MMA. She is fighting in Australia in front of 50000 people which is the biggest crowd attendance in UFC History and her plan is completely falling apart. She has been outclassed in striking and her grappling has been nullified. She went into panic mode and after that Holly was happy picking her apart. Her movement completely froze Ronda. She punced the hell out of her. And when she got space and opportunity, she unleashed her killer left high kick and snapped Ronda’s neck knocking her unconscious. Ronda’s poor preparation and Holly’s excellent game plan lead to this. Other than poor game plan, many other things lead to her downfall. She did too much media which lead to lesser preparation time. She was very overconfident as we know. People comparing her to Mike Tyson and saying she could fight Floyd Maywheather. Another thing is she completely looked out of shape for this match. Her body was not in fight shape. At weigh ins she looked in shape but that might be due to over dehydration to make the Weight Cut. Well it is easier said then done. It is not easy to be Ronda Rousey. Lets see how she comes back against Amanda which hits a lot harder than Holly Holm. Fighters like her and Conor are pron to such fall due to the hipe surrounding them. No one knows how this 1 year gap has affected Ronda and how she will approach her return. Conor was ready to go again after the first Nate fight. We hope that she comes back with a bang. First of all we all know how great is Ronda Rousey.

They may have more than one. Spirit Guides can alternatively be the consciousness of any of the other earthly kingdoms, such as a nature or water spirit. It all depends on your own prior incarnations within the 144 Dimensions of Oneness. You can have many Spirit Guides. As an aside, concerning the need for true spiritual protection, you may also have “other energies” that want to be your spiritual guides (though you wouldn’t think to call them that) from your prior incarnations (when you may have been association with dark energies created out of the lower ego’s goals in that lifetime), and the essences of those energies still desire you to continue within those energies this lifetime. So these would be energies that you may not desire to have part of you this lifetime. Which is why Angels, Spirit Guides and Guardian Angels are so important. Guardian Angels are specific to you and this lifetime. You may have more than one but most people have one main guardian. They are always a Being who knows your Soul and has signed on to assist you in your Soul’s Spiritual Growth this incarnation (they will usually be part of your larger soul family of 144 higher self souls). Typically they do not assist others in this role, just you. You may have spent a few or many lifetimes together previously. In between your own incarnations, you may have been this persons Guardian Angel. (Technically they are not usually Angels in the strict sense. See information that is more detailed on having your Guardian Angel take on the role of being your spiritual Gatekeeper in my other Quora posts.) Angels are infinite in number and act to assist Humanity as a whole and all individuals as needed. They can do so only as long as those souls being assisted desire it either as a physical person or as a higher self soul. If the free will of a human does not desire such assistance or believe in it, assistance becomes quite limited even for the higher self essence of that soul. All human souls come from the Angelic Realm of the dimensions of 50 through 100. Humans do not return to the Angelic Realm between incarnations as an Angel, though they can travel to the Angelic Realms. If a soul has Ascended back up to those dimensional levels beyond the 49th, they do return to the Angelic Realm, and in such cases they would not then incarnate at the lower ever again. In such cases they could act as an Angel or, if they formally had chosen to become an Ascended Master, then they would act in that role which is a more specific form of service to Humanity’s Spiritual Growth. (For example, the Elohim Masters are such souls). As a distinction, Ascended Masters are technically any human (living or ascended out of the physical vehicle) who has taken on such a specific role and has achieved and is holding continually within the full integrated consciousness of the seventh dimensional level or above. (The full integrated consciousness includes the physical, etheric, emotional and mental energy bodies.) Ascended Masters who are no longer incarnated in physical bodies do not ever reincarnate at the lower dimensional levels to which they have already surpassed. However they can, just like Angels, choose to manifest themselves for appearances, which may or may not be as a human soul expects (and therefore might not be recognized). Avatar Masters are those who can re-create the physical adult body at will for teaching or interacting within the lower dimensions but they are not technically reincarnating.

I can and do decide my way in the world, and psychopathy has nothing to do with my ability to do so. If I do something wrong, I chose that action, and I have to accept whatever that action brings to me in terms of consequences. I would like to say the same for all psychopaths, but there is an issue with that. If you follow me, then you have probably heard about the psychopath mixing desk that Kevin Dutton speaks about. For the uninitiated, here is what I am talking about; Whenever most of us hear the word ‘psychopath’ it’s images of Ted Bundy and Hannibal Lecter that flash across our minds. Not scalpel-wielding surgical geniuses, silver-tongued secret agents or super-cool Special Forces soldiers. The reality, however, is rather different. In stark contrast to the headline-grabbing soundbites thrown out by the media pundits and the film industry moguls, when psychologists like myself use the word ‘psychopath’, we’re actually referring to a specific subgroup of individuals with a distinct subset of personality characteristics. These characteristics include: RuthlessnessFearlessnessImpulsivitySelf-confidenceFocusCoolness under pressure  Now, if we imagine each of these characteristics as being the dials on a personality ‘mixing desk’ which may be twiddled up and down in various combinations, we arrive at two conclusions: 1. There is no one-size-fits-all, objectively ‘correct’ setting at which these mixing-desk dials may be tuned. Instead, the most effective alignment will invariably depend on TIMING, and on the particular set of CIRCUMSTANCES you may happen to find yourself in. 2. By the same logic, there will be various jobs and professions which, by their very nature, demand that some of these mixing-desk dials are cranked up a little bit higher and a little bit lower than normal – that demand a degree of what we might call ‘PRECISION-ENGINEERED PSYCHOPATHY’. In other words, none of the knobs and sliders on the mixing desk are ‘bad’. Far from it. All of them have their place on it because: Dialled up at the right LEVELMixed and sequenced in the right COMBINATION, andDeployed in the right CONTEXT and with the right INTENTION . . . each of them adds to the quality of the overall soundtrack. All right, caught up? Excellent. Caveat number one, and the one I am not certain about. The debate still rages. Pretty cool about the precision engineered psychopath, right? It is, I agree. However. What about those that aren’t? What if you have all those traits turned up to ten. You lack empathy, no conscience, and now let’s add in a few more ingredients. What it you aren’t that smart? What if you had a terrible upbringing and no one taught you any life skills at all? Let’s say you also have all the antisocial traits of ASPD as well. What would that sort of psychopath be like? Not great would be my guess. Pretty toxic, dangerous, brutal, without impulse control, no ability to predict the consequences of their behavior, and generally unpleasant. I have never met a psychopath like this, and I don’t know how they think. I know how I think, and know that I can control myself. I don’t always (or often) want to, I want to do what I want to do and frequently social expectations wreaks a bit of havoc on that desire. However, they point is, I can do it. Can this other type of psychopath can? I don’t know. They seem to cycle in and out of prison, and maybe that is because they genuinely can’t help it. Who knows? Unless you live in that sort of mind, you can never know if they are in control of their actions, or if their noisy traits make that impossible. Caveat number two. This one I don’t have any qualms with, and that is while psychopaths should and are responsible for their actions, I don’t think the very fact that they are a psychopath should be a sentence enhancement, or that it should make the death penalty more likely. That to me is unacceptable, however, that is how it works. Take this for an example; “There’s a lot of stuff that looks like it’s junk and should be filtered out by the courts, but it’s not being filtered out,” said Arizona State University psychology professor Tess Neal, the lead author of the study. One controversial psychological test, the Hare Psychopathy Checklist—Revised (PCL–R), came under fire in the American Psychological Association’s journal, Psychology, Public Policy, and Law. In a joint statement first published on-line on January 30, 2020, thirteen expert psychiatrists and psychologists wrote that while the test may have general usefulness in measuring psychopathy “as a construct,” it is “inappropriate [to use] the PCL–R to draw conclusions about an individual’s risk for committing serious violence in high-security custodial facilities.” Such conclusions are often critical in capital sentencing determinations in states such as Texas in which finding that a defendant poses a continuing threat to society is a prerequisite to imposing a death sentence. The experts criticize the PCL–R as plagued by adversarial allegiance — mental health witnesses called by the prosecution will rate a defendant’s level of psychopathy higher than defense experts will during “evaluations of the same person, made around the same time, and even when made on the same information base.” They also say that “the association between PCL–R scores and serious institutional violence is negligible,” making the test unreliable as an indicator of whether a defendant will actually commit violence in prison. The PCL–R “cannot make predictions that an individual will engage in serious institutional violence with any reasonable degree of precision or accuracy,” they say, “and should not be used for this purpose in capital sentencing evaluations.” I have been discussing the abject failures of the PCL-R since I started writing here. I will continue to do so because it is a terrible tool and should at the very least be retooled, and at most may need to be entirely discarded. The person that appropriated and changed this list from an original list created in the 1940s, removed some of the features that were actually applicable, and added in several that are not, and had a great deal or personal investment both egotistically and financially, has so much of a vested interest in it’s continuous use that he will sues people that challenge it’s status as the “gold standard” in psychopathy diagnostics. Currently that is what it is considered; *Finally, the PCL-R has been described by prominent psychopathy investigators as the “gold standard” for the assessment of psychopathy in adulthood (Lynam & Gudonis, 2005, p. 383), and was referred to in the 16th Mental Measurements Yearbook as “the gold standard for the assessment of psychopathy” (Acheson, 2005). *The PCL-R is regarded as the ‘gold standard’ (Wikipedia 2013) in scoring psychopathy. However concerns have been raises against the PCL-R as a method for scoring psychopathy because of it’s divergence from Cleckley’s original construct, as well as concerns of systematic measurement error, research on underpowered sample sizes, and frequent inappropriate application. A sentence should be based on the crime. It should not be based on race, gender, brain structure, and I tend to find that even motive should probably not be considered. Is it different because you murder your spouse because you were in a jealous rage, or because you wanted the insurance money. You still killed them, so the sentence should be the same. Psychopathy should not be a sentence enhancement. I believe that psychopaths should absolutely be held to account, but not more heavily penalized for the way their brain was genetically coded.
