Both depend on each other to position an organisation in the eyes of it’s stakeholders, clients and consumers. Corporate Communications mainly deals with the written and, at times, oral communication that needs to be done in order to keep all the stakeholders informed of a company’s vision, mission and strategic objectives. It involves internal as well as external communication, depending on who needs to know what. Corporate Communications use various different platforms to keep a company’s stakeholders updated of it’s activities. Website, brochures, newsletters, stakeholders’ letters/messages, annual reports, magazines are all external corporate communications mediums, while emails, announcements, minutes of meetings, intranet are internal communication platforms. All the above mentioned platforms are used to disseminate important information about an organisation’s present and future plans. Good organisations take corporate communications quite seriously because they know its their duty to share their plans with their stakeholders/shareholders. Here comes the role of Public Relations. As the name suggests, this department specifically deals with the information that goes out to the masses, in order to position an organisation’s brand in the eyes of general public. Public Relations use the external communications prepared by Corporate Communications to generate a positive image of the company. It uses mediums like press releases, social media, public activities, presentations etc. to create public interest in the products/services rendered by a company. Many a time, Public Relations team works closely with Corporate Communications team to identify external audiences (their tears too) and prepare appropriate external communication messages and publication materials. Public Relations department also engages with media agencies, advertising agencies (though Corporate Communications and Marketing are primarily responsible for recruiting an advertising agency) to reach out to masses and spread the company’s message. It is important to remember that Corporate Communications and Public Relations need to work very closely and exchange timely information to function successfully. Any lapse between the two departments can lead to huge losses. Keeping this in mind, a large number of organisations merge the two departments into one, under one manager/head to ensure smooth execution of activities. Both the teams sit together to identify their target audiences and agree upon the mode of communication as well as the content so that there is no discrepancy or ambiguity about any message. Public relations professionals now outnumber journalists in Canada, which happened a few years ago. PR in Canada is very mixed, with varying roles in urban to rural settings.

60423303ed76476feda201de,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-a-public-relation-consultant-target?-,"Every single morning, I wake up to 50+ pitches from Public Relations firms. A handful customize their email outreach by calling out a specific piece I had written they liked, or commenting on the writing I share on Quora/Medium. But the vast majority get inside my inbox by using a software tool to scrape my email from my Inc Magazine column. They want to know if I’d be interested in interviewing their client—a founder, a CEO, a small business owner, a mompreneur, etc. I’m not. And the reason I’m not interested isn’t because the person they’re pitching isn’t worth talking to. I’m not interested because it’s overwhelming to sift through this many messages in bulk. After I’ve Select All/Deleted every single PR pitch I’ve received, I can count on my inbox being flooded again by lunch. I have to clean my inbox every 3 hours. It’s obnoxious. If you work with a PR firm, I want to explain to you what you’re paying for: You’re paying for the above experience. You’re paying a firm to mass-blast columnists—many of whom don’t get paid. For the ones who do get paid (like myself), payment comes in the form of page views, not a flat rate per article. And as someone who has written over 400 articles for Inc Magazine exclusively, data has showed me the least popular article type is one about a founder nobody knows about. You’re not Mark Zuckerberg. And you’re not Elon Musk. If I want views, I should either write about Facebook, or I should write about something universal—like productivity, leadership, etc. (And not in the form of interviewing someone and repeating the same 3 leadership lessons every single founder on earth shares.) Which means, your PR firm is asking columnists to spend more time writing something that will yield less views. It’s a poor strategy. Instead, I highly encourage founders, CEOs, and serial entrepreneurs to flip their strategy. I’m not saying PR is worthless. PR has a time and place. But in order to execute PR well, you have to understand something about columnists (and, being one of them, I’d like to pull back the curtain and share something you don’t know). Columnists don’t have very much time. When I first started contributing to Inc Magazine, I was working 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at an advertising agency. After work, I’d ride the train home for an hour, head to the gym, make dinner, and then finally sit down to write around 9:00 p.m. I didn’t have time to interview people. Nor did I have time to try to figure out if the founder or executive a PR firm was pitching me was actually credible. I’d Google their name and the only thing that would come up would be the bio on their company website. I had no idea whether this person was someone I actually wanted to talk to—or if they had anything valuable to share in the first place. Instead, I ended up writing articles based on information I could easily find online. I wrote about founders whose work I admired on Medium. I wrote about CEOs who had podcasts or keynote speeches I enjoyed. I wrote about people who put themselves out there, and made it easy for me to source their insights. 99% of founders and executives don’t have a personal brand online. In fact, they’re invisible. What happens, then, is they spend thousands of dollars on PR. The PR firm pitches columnists in bulk (mistake #1). On the off-chance a columnist opens their email, reads it, and wants to chat with their client, the columnist ends up spending 5x the time writing a piece that receives -5x the viewership (mistake #2). And during the writing process, they struggle to give context to what the founder or executive shares because there’s nothing they can link to on the Internet (mistake #3). I know—because I have experienced all of these pain points as a columnist. To be perfectly honestly, these painful experiences are what gave me the idea to start Digital Press. A PR firm would be exponentially more successful (and columnists would have a much easier time writing) if the founder or executive already had a library of content online—authored by them. They would be able to make themselves for relatable. And columnists would easily be able to source their insights. It’s astounding to me how, when I break all of this down for our clients, and we start collaborating with their PR firm or department, how much more effective their efforts become. We’ve actually had CEOs start building their library of content, and then have publications reach out to them, asking if they’d like to contribute directly. This speaks to a much larger life lesson I believe is true in any context: Shortcuts are often longer roads in disguise. But when you take the time to do things the right way from the beginning, your work ends up paying dividends in the long run. Strategic public relations allows practitioners and clients to integrate PR tactics into an overall communications or marketing plan. It creates the opportunity to work towards a measurable, definable goal that further supports how public relations can help businesses grow. It is beyond sending out a press release and hoping it gets picked up by a reporter or that you get an email requesting an interview for your client. Strategic public relations includes identifying a goal or outcome and then employing various communications tools to achieve the defined goal. A plan of this ilk examines website domain authority and authoritative bloggers and influencers who can not only reach your target audience but support increased traffic to your website through authoritative links. It is expert positioning through content marketing and guest blogging tactics. It is leveraging social media and social media advertising campaigns to increase brand awareness and drive conversions on your website.  Public relations is evolving at a rapid pace and strategic PR is really the intersection of media relations, social media, content marketing and SEO. While the benefits are numerous, here are five reasons why engaging in a strategic PR plan can generate truly fantastic results: It Supports Company LongevityIt Influences Revenue Drivers, Supporting Lead Generation and Sales in the Digital LandscapeIt Builds AwarenessIt Gives You Leverage Over CompetitorsIt Builds Trust It is not typical work (yeah, which one is actually) but for me is SPECIAL. Sometimes you spend time with journalist - talking, meeting, laughing (let's be friends!), sometimes you need to have hard conversations. Sometimes you spend half of the month in your car driving to clients, meeting, press conference. Sometimes you create big strategy and can see its effects in newspaper or influence internet source. Sometimes you Sometimes you are postman, call center worker, negotiator. Sometimes you sleep on your notebook keyboard preparing month reports. Then you explain to the client why results are so high/low. Forget about work from 9am to 5 pm. You must be always there. You must be fast and/or funny (social media), serious as as adult should (meetings), work slow and precisely (creating strategy), work fast (reacting to crisis), be an artist (good creations) and do excellent maths (reports, statistics).

This is not because the country is dangerous, it is one of the safest countries I have been to, but because it will get boring. There are vast distances between anything. It takes 8 hours to get to Adelaide from Melbourne, and 6 hours to get to Canberra. It takes even longer to get to any of the other major cities. Outside of the cities, Australia is sparsely populated. Australia is not like the US or Canada where the majority of people live in smaller cities (like with 100,000-900,000 people) suburbs and towns. Australia has over 14,000,000 people living in their cities with a population of over 1,000,000, and a total population of only 23,130,000. 61% of their population lives in 5 cities: Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, or Adelaide. Melbourne and Sydney are both much larger than Los Angeles (within the city limits). Brisbane is bigger than Chicago (within the city limits), and Perth and Adelaide are both just slightly smaller than Chicago. In contrast in the US, about 22,000,000 people live in a city with a population of over 1,000,000 (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, and Dallas are the US cities with a population of over 1,000,000), out of our total population of 318,900,000. Less than 7% of the US population lives in a city larger than 1,000,000. The bulk of the population lives in suburbs and metropolitan areas outside of the large cities. Looking at population density this becomes apparent:   Keep in mind that the green areas have a population of 2-10 per square kilometer.  Yes most US cities are part of larger metropolitan areas, but that is kind of my point. In Australia it goes from the center of urban sprawl to nowhere much quicker than in the US. A drive in Australia outside of the US won't be at all like in the US (except maybe Alaska). You will see very few towns or people outside of the cities. What I am getting at is... it will be boring by yourself. Taxis Don't waste your money on taxis if possible. Seriously, they are not dangerous but Australian taxi drivers are weirdos, and taxis seem less reliable than in the US or Canada, and more expensive. After 10 sometimes the demand is so high (with tons of drunk people calling cabs) that it will take an hour or two for a taxi to arrive after you call them. I still remember the stupid 13 Cabs song from being on hold for 45 minutes. Another time I was going to the airport to catch a flight back to Melbourne, and two professors from the U of Melbourne got a cab and invited me to come along. I did. We were then told very NSFW party stories by the cab driver for 45 minutes on our way to the airport. The final cost was like... 70$ or something. After we got out, the professors told me their last cab driver was even worse, and told them intimate details about his sex life and his affairs with 3 women. It costs 20-30$ a day (in Australian dollars... like 13-21 USD as of Jan 14 2016) to rent a crappy car from Rent A Bomb (see Driving). Public transport(ation) is also very reliable in any of the larger cities. It is not very confusing once you know the geography as there are signs everywhere. Public Transport(ation) Public transport(ation) is pretty cheap. To get around Melbourne now costs edit: 39$ per week. I advise trying to learn the geography of the city, or else taking a map everywhere. Bus and tram stops always have very helpful signs on them telling you where the busses or trams go, so if you know where you want to go, it is easy. Trains generally have digital signs posted above the platforms, or at the entrances to the platforms. Driving If you try driving in Australia, have one of your Australian friends or family members drive with you the first time to give you pointers if possible. My first time driving I drove my girlfriend to get her new glasses, and her mum was in the car too telling me what to do driver's ed style. It doesn't usually take a rocket scientist to figure out how to drive on the left. The only difficult things for me still are traffic circles/roundabouts and using my windshield wipers and turn signals. I have a bad habit of looking the wrong way as I enter a roundabout just from driving on the right my whole life. It is also very confusing for me to use turn signals. On righthand drive cars (with the steering wheel on the right) the signal to turn or turn on your high-beams is on the right, while the knob for wiper fluid and windshield wipers is on the left. Even after driving for hours I still sometimes turn on my windshield wipers or squirt my windshield with wiper fluid when I mean to turn on the signal for right or left. This mistake is just funny, and really won't put you at high risk for crashing. Australians also complain about their drivers, but Australian drivers are better than American drivers on average, and much better than Canadian or European drivers. One problem for American and Canadian drivers is that the road markings in Australia are 100% different. Opposing lanes of traffic are divided by white lines, not yellow:  Don't make the mistake of driving in the wrong lane because of this. Signs also say things like ""overtake"" instead of ""pass"" and ""give way"" instead of ""yield"". These aren't too confusing though. Edit: Don't be in a hurry too much It can be frustrating, but it seems like Australians are not often in hurries. I remember walking faster than people and having to get passed crowds, and then I just decided to walk slower, and that fixed the problem. I think some of the other answers here where politeness was an issue, had problems where they were going too fast in interactions with salespeople. 10 an American that did graduate school in Australia I agree with most of the previous answers, here are some things I noticed: Neither culture is better or worse, most differences are cultural, historical and scale based.

You won't find equivalent college sports there but you will find pro Aussie rules. It is hands down 100 times easier to learn and enjoy as a newcomer than American football (Go Tigers). It also has the benefit of not having replay, the follow on legal analysis of each play and they let the guys play without disrupting play every 2 minutes.I had many British, American and obviously Australian classmates. What I learned is Americans think it is too British and the British think its too American. The Aussies just wish we would both stop talking about it.Learn very early how the shout system of drinking works. I argue that the Aussies are the fastest at ordering the next shout (in American speak that is buying the next round in a bar) in the world. If you’re a light weight drinker (never been a problem of mine) you will be in trouble fast.Never use the word fanny, even though your churchgoing grandma uses it in the States.Parties are generally BYOB...learned that from my Scottish classmate. He was very polite about it but was still embarrassing as i was polishing off his 4th beer (again never been a lightweight).Lastly, one of my favorite stories is from a British (wife) and Aussie (husband) couple friends of ours. When entering Australia and reading the customs form question, ""Have you ever been convicted of a crime?"" She turned to him and asked him"" if i say no will they still let me in?"" The Brits still enjoy riling up their Aussie nieces and nephews.I will stop here and say I enjoyed my time there immensely and can't wait to go back and see my many lifelong friends I made there. These were all things I learned over 10 years ago so take them with a grain of salt. As an Aussie, who now lives in the US, I have noticed how open and forthright Americans are when it comes to religion. People will happily tell you how often they go to church or what faith they follow. Freedom of religion is protected by the US constitution so it’s a pretty big deal to Americans. You’ll even find the term “in God we trust” everywhere from schools, court houses, and money.

You’ll even find the term “in God we trust” everywhere from schools, court houses, and money. Mississippi is even proposing to print “in God we trust” on the state flag in lieu of the Confederate battle symbol. By contrast, Australia is becoming increasing secular, and many people claim not to be religious. In fact, according to the 2016 census, more Australians identify as being not religious 30.1% than any other religion. People do not openly talk about religion and it is something that is kept private in Australia. As a precaution I would recommend that you avoid discussing religion in a public setting. While Australians are generally a friendly bunch, religion is one of those contentious issues, which could ignite a debate. Similar to religion, I would also recommend that you avoid talking about guns, as most Australians are gun control advocates. That is unless you are also a pro-gun control advocate. In that case Australians will be only too happy to tell you how crazy they find the US obsession with guns. Another thing to be aware of is the way some Australians like to joke around. We call it “taking the piss”. This often involves some type of banter regarding a person's country of origin or accent etc. It’s often meant as a term of endearment, but sometimes we can take things a little too far, or people become derogatory. As a result, some foreigners may take offence to someone “taking the piss”, as they see it as an attack on them or their culture. The only piece of advice I can give is to just laugh it off. If you build a rapport with these people you can even start to dish a little bit of it back. Unfortunately Australia has its fair share of idiots, and if they offend you, I recommend walking away. There’s no point in spoiling your vacation over some dickhead. One last point I will touch upon is that people in Australia will often say “please” and “thank you” in one sentence. I’ve noticed how people in the US don’t tend to use those terms as much (at least not in New York anyway). They aren’t necessarily being rude, it’s just a cultural thing, or perhaps a New York thing. For example, my wife who is American will often ask me for a glass of water when I am up, but she never says please or thank you. On the flip side, she is often amused when we visit Australia, and I say “please” and “thank you” in one sentence (e.g. “could I please have a coffee thanks”). I think most Australians expect these types types of niceties in conversation and you could receive some gruff service if you fail to adhere to these social norms. Apart from that, I think most of the other contributors to this forum hit the nail on the head with their suggestions.",2021-03-05T13:39:10.199Z,"What should an American never do when visiting Australia?

Even if they only win $10,000, that's still more money then they have ever held at once. Trust me …. I won $10,000 on a FastPlay ticket after work one day. I bought the ticket, sat down in the grass and played it while waiting for my ride. I couldn't believe my eyes. I honestly thought it must have been some sort of mistake. Ten thousand? That couldn't be right, that couldn't have just happened to me. It did though. I went down to Augusta with my ticket in hand and walked out with a check for seven thousand dollars. Here's the kicker though, it put me into a different tax bracket at the end of the year and I had to go back and pay another two percent in taxes on EVERYTHING I had made that year, so I didn't get a tax return either. They sure do find a way to get it back. Even still, I cleared about five thousand dollars and that was the most money I have ever had at one time, in my entire life. I know that might sound pitiful, especially to those of you who spend five thousand weekly, but for me that was a lot of money. I immediately bought my kids a bunch of stuff they wanted. They got to pick out toys that they never would have dreamed to even look at before. Otherwise, it basically paid off a lot of debt. People blow through their money because it's probably the first time they have ever been able to spend without feeling restricted. They can splurge on things they have always wanted or wanted to do. But money goes quickly, and before you know it, it's gone. Easy come …. Easy go.

It turned out that he was part of a syndicate with the rest of his family and his share of the winnings was £6 million. It’s now 2018 and he’s earning £8 per hour working in a supermarket. What went wrong? Simple, he thought that because he was a millionaire he was able to lead a millionaire’s lifestyle. Within a week of receiving his winnings he’d spent the best part of £300,000 on cars. He’d booked holidays all over the world complete with first class flights Continue ReadingIn 2010 somebody I know walked into work one day, announced to us all that he had won the lottery and was quitting, and walked out again. It turned out that he was part of a syndicate with the rest of his family and his share of the winnings was £6 million. It’s now 2018 and he’s earning £8 per hour working in a supermarket. What went wrong? Simple, he thought that because he was a millionaire he was able to lead a millionaire’s lifestyle. Within a week of receiving his winnings he’d spent the best part of £300,000 on cars. He’d booked holidays all over the world complete with first class flights that in total probably cost him £100,000. A month later he completed the purchase of a £1.5 million house. He filled that house with the most expensive luxury items he could find. If I had to put a figure on it I’d guess that he probably spent around of £2.5 million within the first 12 months. He was loving life, he was living like a millionaire, never having to worry about money, able to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, without a care in the world. He didn’t have to listen to anybody around him any more, he was his own boss. Unfortunately in 2015 it all came crashing down. When he won the money everybody around him advised him to be sensible, to have his finances properly managed so that it would provide him with long term stability. However he didn’t want to hear that, because he wanted that £6 million now, he didn’t want to use that to earn him a much smaller amount than that every year because he was a millionaire, how was he going to live like a millionaire if that money was only earning him £200,000 a year. So when 2015 rolled around he pretty quickly found that he was living in an enormous house that cost a lot of money in general upkeep, he had a fleet of very expensive cars, now worth very little, that were extremely expensive to run, he had simply built up a lifestyle that needed a millionaires bank account to sustain when the reality is that he was a not particularly bright English Language graduate with an almost empty bank account. He ended up selling the house for less than he paid, got rid of all of the cars for less than half of what they cost him in the first place, steadily sold off the luxury items he owned and still continued to try and live like somebody with money. Even at this stage he didn’t decide to be sensible with what he had and very quickly he worked his way through what little he had remaining. Middle of last year it all finally ended, his pot ran dry, he used the last little bit that was remaining to get himself a mortgage on a tiny little new build property near Bristol and started looking for work again. So that is why I personally think that a lot of lottery winners end up broke in a short space of time. They think that having millions in the bank enables them to live a millionaire’s lifestyle. I know a guy who’d hit a mil and was working in the dollar store a year later. It’s because it would require a sudden change in personality in order for such a gambler to hold on to winnings. Let’s face it; the people who usually win the lottery are not people who happened to spend a dollar one day out of the blue and they got amazingly lucky. The people who win usually play $10, $20, $100 a week. They buy lots and lots of tickets. My friend was always an impulsive type. Skipping school on a whim, for example.

In order for them to hold on to a lump sum, they’d have to suddenly decide they were changing their ways. Mutual funds, bonds, a Prius — what fun is that? No way! How about investing in a new pizza-flavored ice cream company and some great paintings of Elvis and James Dean? And fly First Class to every overpriced tourist trap! The person I know simply blew through his money, as a million really isn’t that much, after all. He probably still plays lotto. And he stocks items at the dollar store. Better would have been to buy a dollar-store franchise, perhaps. Maybe he’d make 23 cents per item sold. Those pennies add up.

She distributed the 50 Lakh won in Kaun banega Crorepati to Gujrat Earthquake victims.She also works towards upliftment of women in Rural areas, Primary school education. So , let me question myself why I consider her to be most intelligent. She did not trade off her education for acting.She honed her acting skills and saw that her dance does not go unnoticed.Many actresses see that they marry some wealthy actors and get settled. But Madhuri Dixit , took a decision which surprised many. She married someone outside her profession , a renowned surgeon.She always kept a low profile, which depicts that she is always grounded.She also does behind the stage work for underprivileged societies, no hush-push about those.Finally, she maintains cordial relationship with almost everyone on the industry.With these in mind , I could vouch for Mrs.Madhuri Dixit Nene to be the most intelligent actress in India.

Academic, conference-full, big, internationally collaborant, mind-bending physics full of low pays, long hours, most golden-hearted people you ever meet and challenges that will never leave you bored. It wasn’t an easy choice, when I was younger I was constantly flipping between art, writing, journalism, history of art, engineering, astronomy and good old making money in IT and all of them had their own advantages. Physics differ depending on the field and application and different people tend to driff to different areas of it. I would risk a statement that the “crazy” and experimental part draws in most of the ENTP so particle physics, quantum computing, antimatter physics, laser physics: anything that’s really abstract, fun and makes things explode from time to time. Going through the typical characteristics of an ENTP and physics I think I could see those pros and cons: Pros: Lifelong learning: When you do science you can never stop. Every other month, every other year you work on something else, who knows, may in a decade you’ll specialise in a field you didn’t even knew existed when you were studying? It’s enough to keep ENTP minds occupied, challenged and even overhelmed most of the time.Conferencing and collaborating: Being an extravert who loves talking and presenting is a huge advantage in science. Travelling to all parts of the world to talk, to present, to find funds and new connections is a very important part of any research and in a field full of INTPs and INTJs being the person who can connect with others easily and loves presentations turns the part that scientists usually hate the best part of the job for the ENTPs.Independence: No matter if you work on a University, in a huge collaboration or a smaller Institute you’re usually the only person truly responsible for your career, work and plans. I structure my own days, I work during mornings, or in the middle of the night. Sometimes I work 3 hours. Sometimes 13 hours. I plan my own path and my own work. It’s only possible, it’s absolutely necessary in this kind of work.People: In my experience science is full of cheerfull, honest, adorably shy, curious, tolerant people with golden hearts. They keep up with ENTPs sense of humour, they fall right into this narrow field that gets ENTPs loyalty and respect, they can teach the ENTP hard work, discipline and focus and at the end of the day they are a safe space made out of NTs.Cons: Getting in: Starting your path in sciences through university degree (and then another and another and another) is a marathon. It requires many things that don’t come to ENTPs naturally like repetition, long hours of studying, reading, coding. There is so much to learn ovver such a long span of time that the ENTP way of just winging it doesn’t work anymore. You just have to get out of your comfort zone and learn how to do stuff regularly. Good news: it’s possible and it’s something that ENTP would struggle with at any other path in life.Practical problems: There are many things that someone who wants a professional career in science needs to keep in mind. The studying is very long, and never really ends. There are some well paid jobs there, but it’s a norm. You will probably have to move around the world a lot after your work, or field of study (open position for production of pions in Jakarta? I’m coming!). You will work on a very, very small part of a bigger puzzle and it will get frustrating sometimes. You may take one all-nighter too much and burn out. But then - I think every career has things like that.Loneliness and demotivation: While conferences and workshops are were ENTP thrive still the bulk of work is sitting in your office, staring at the screen and answering questions on Quora instead of writing your article. There is a lot of work that needs to be done alone. There are many outposts or positions that will make you travel out of your support net of friends into new cultures or simply very distant places (writing from above the polar circle here so forgive me my gloom). There are moments when this work feels isolating and it cuts really badly the ENTP need for someone else to push the first rock of the avalanche of motivation. But there are many physicist who work in the same place for decades, there are even more physicists with kids and family and there are many ways to work around it by keeping active, more social interests outside of your work. The good news I found this out the hard way and I’m going to save you some grief. The bad news? I found this out the hard way—later in life and dealt with a lot of confusion and grief along the way.

The bad news? I found this out the hard way—later in life and dealt with a lot of confusion and grief along the way. I love creating, re-structuring music, dance, poetry, learning languages, disappearing in cultural places for months and immersing myself in language. I also love for engaging in lively discussions and debates about physics theories into the early morning hours without a need for sleep or eating, learning other languages and cultural perspectives of physics and challenging present models and wondering if we could go beyond current models and re-invent physics itself? Unfortunately, I grew up an environment that held me back—that valued a strict puritanical work ethic over following one’s dreams (and viewed academics as “derelicts”). I come alive in academia because I am constantly learning and devouring anything from literature, poetry, computation to theoretical physics, quantum chemistry, QCD, discovering new particles, theories, and wondering if gravitational waves are made of oscillating particles and potential dark matter? This sense of self (re) discovery allowed me to follow (or how I learned to stop doubting myself and love) my childhood calling in Theoretical Physics. I am also known for “not suffering fools gladly” and had a wicked way of browbeating people in my younger years (But I have managed to keep the beast in check nowadays) and I could use some help in the sitzflesich department. That said, years of experience can save you the trouble now: Customer Service: Including having breaks and lunch timed (*shudder*), calls micromanaged, meeting metrics and standards—especially if those metrics leave a lot of unfinished work and more callbacks by customers who did not get their products-which defeats the purpose of the term “customer service” And is not rational in any sense…Administrative/Secretarial/assistantship positions (enough said).Anything that stifles your creativity, or doesn't allow you to push the edge.Micro managers and control freaks (How many ENTP’s reading this just cringed at that word?). Micromanagers that are constantly timing you, rather than letting your creativity flow.Caretaker position (Do not confuse for leadership)-anything that requires you to care for large groups of people and think for them-whatever their needs could possibly be.Anything considered mundane.Any place that keeps secrets and hides things-especially closes off education rather than the free exchange of ideas (I saved the worst for last because this is my version of hell).None of the jobs listed above are terrible, and are wonderful and enriching for the right personality type—just was not best with me.

And people have to be hired and paid to complete them. The idea of a job being useless is argumentative.

Remember word of mouth is one of the best marketing tools, so make sure you don't forget to provide a quality customer service as the first few customers trickle in, they can help you grow your initial user base the quickest, especially with the advent of social networking and the role it plays in influencing large numbers of friends, which can help spread the word like wildfire. That leads me on to my first point: Social Networking - Set yourself up on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and any others you can manage. These tools have given startups a great way of marketing their business for free. Take time to interact with others and offer value. It may be advisable to offer special introductory offers to entice your first few customers. Make them feel special and they might share the experience with their friends, followers, network whatever you want to call them. Give it away - That's right offer your product or service for free! Now this might not always be possible but if you can it's a good way to build up users. You can integrate this with your social networking strategy and offer your first 20 followers or fans your product/service free. This also builds up your social network. Now I know giving your product away for free doesn't make you money but you can offer your product free to gain users. I personally count a customer as someone who has paid for the product or service. giving your product away for free will increase its users and help you gain your first proper customer. If you are an online software company for instance you might even offer a basic free version or free trial in the hope of upgrading them to a paid package at some point, therefore creating a profitable ROI over the lifetime of that customer. Think a little closer to home - Friends, family, ex colleagues may all be potential customers. They would also be more inclined to buying your product as they may feel obliged to help you out. They can also be perfect in helping you see potential problems, where you might be going wrong. Spotting these and fixing it before you get too many customers from further afield who find problems, which may harm your brands reputation, is a benefit of selling to those closer to you. Network - This is an important step in making your business known. It also gives you the chance to learn and meet potential influences that can help spread the word about your business. Attend networking events for those in your industry, social meet-ups for small businesses and conferences. All of these will help you widen your network and help get yourself out there as well as your business. Bear in mind that you yourself are a brand also and this has a direct influence on your company. Paid Advertising - If you have some money to spend, putting it into a marketing budget can help you branch out. Whether you spend on marketing online, offline or both depends on your business. A local restaurant may use both local newspaper ads and Google local ads. A software firm may use only online advertising in the form of PPC (pay per click) such as Google adwords or may pay for banner placement on a targeted website.

While the strategy is designed for service based businesses, it works for product based companies regardless. Here’s what I am going to cover: The Overlooked Strategy: How we use it and get clients/customers quickly and for free.Blocking out 1–2 hours everyday so that you can execute the ‘Four Power Activities’ mentioned below. 1. Hunting.2. Advancing.3. Farming.4. Closing. Pratik, what is this ‘Overlooked Strategy’? The overlooked strategy is often, you know, overlooked. The Overlooked Strategy involves using social media like LinkedIn and Facebook groups. This strategy involves using your personal Facebook profile to join Facebook and LinkedIn groups, if you should know anything about social media in 2020, that would be, the groups on Facebook and LinkedIn is where you can directly reach hundreds of thousands of potential customers directly without paying Zuck anything. Now lets talk more about, the four power activities. I personally suggest clients to block around 1–2 hours daily for this activity as this will definitely increase the business significantly overtime. Surprisingly, many owners need instant results, which isn’t possible and thus, more often than not, they just don’t follow it. This table right here, have made us quite a good amount of money and I believe it would help you as well. Feel free to take a picture and put it on your wall or something, it helps.  🟥 HuntingI use to spend around 45 minutes every day at the start of my work, hunting for new clients/customers in Facebook groups. If your startup is a SaaS based product or a physical product, small activities like, commenting on other people’s post sharing genuine value and plugging your product in, works very well.🟩 AdvancingSpend 15–30 minutes advancing the potential clients/customers. Talk to people you had a conversation with yesterday, etc.🟦 FarmingIts just as what it sounds like, sowing for a better crop tomorrow. Here, we sow content. A really high quality content to ensure when we will be approached by our clients, they shouldn’t be seeing some whacky quotes and designs on our page. Spend money on hiring a professional graphic designer, its worth it.⬜️ ClosingHere, you can close the client by either sending them to your website and let them take the action, which would be followed up as well, which should lead to closing or, simply a strategy session for service based business, where you should give as much value as you can in those 15 minutes, that they should know you know what you’re doing. building you some authority and trust instantly.Its funny how ridiculously well this thing works, yet I do not see many people using strategy like this for their websites or businesses. The best part is, once you know what's working, you can simply automate the entire process mentioned in the table and let it run on its own. Hope it helps. Pratik.

The answer I got “We know you are a good programmer. Can you show us the user interface to see how it works?”. 2. Any useful open source project on Github is too complex for a beginner You’ve probably been told 1000+ times to contribute to open source projects on Github in order to build your portfolio. Don’t! Your life is gonna turn into a dark terrifying tunnel with no end in sight. Most projects, even the one’s you think are simple, are huge piles of code with complex logic. A beginner struggling to understand the basics of a programming language can only hope to get an idea of what’s going on. You are going to waste your precious time figuring out the impossible. 3. Hiring managers won’t look at the code You thought a nicely laid out Github profile would land you the dream job? I am sorry. Hiring managers won’t look at your Github. They will definitely ask you for your github account url. But even if they check it out, they won’t figure our what’s going on. Only my fellow programmers occasionally visit my profile to star a few of my repos. In order to be hired you will have to take a technical test regardless of how much code is already on your Github. 4. Store code on Github, have a different portfolio website. Look at Github as a code storage and version control tool, not a portfolio site that you should direct your clients to. When you build a product you are actually selling, your code will be in a private repo, where nobody ever sets their eyes upon it.

Contributing to open source projects when a beginner is a holy adventure into frustration. It’s a painful waste of time. Learn by building your own simple versions. Here is my advice: Create simple user interfaces that solve a simple problem that anyone can easily use. For example, create an app that schedules Tweets or Facebook posts. With or without Github, this app with a strong word for you in your job search than plain code that can’t talk by itself on Github. Most developers make mistakes that hinder them from landing their dream jobs fast enough and end up wasting their time. All the best in your job search. Cheers!

I did the entire menu system for this game. I did the backend for this website and it supports an average count of 100,000 daily users.” That’s what you want. Contributing to open source projects is actually an advanced skill. You can certainly try, but you will spend a ton of time trouble-shooting. That’s fine, if you can learn that way. You might have to fight to have your changes go through. Sometimes you won’t know when to fight and when to listen, because you don’t have enough experience to know when the other guy is right about a change. That world can be tough, though a lot of guys learn exactly by doing that, over and over. There are only two or three solid ways to get a job: get a degree or certificate of some kind, network (know someone), or finish a product. Those options actually have value in that order. So finishing a product is the most valuable and having a degree is the least. Though note, that I am assuming you are equally skilled in all 3 categories. Obviously you need the talent too. What if you can finish a programming problem but can’t troubleshoot new tech? Like what if the company uses 3 APIs that you have never used before? So your code breaks and you need to find 3 critical pieces of information about a library that is 100 thousand lines long. Do you know how to do that? On time? Can you do it alone? Do you have the courage and soft skills to ask for help, get the help, and make the person helping you feel good about it? Do you ship on time? Software has all kind of issues. There are unexpected bugs. There are maintenance issues. Sometimes you can’t scale. Sometimes you just get bored. Working on a passion project for a few hours a week is nothing like working 40 hours a week on the same boring bullshit, that just needs to get done. Are you productive in that kind of environment? There are so many questions that can’t be answered with Github, or a resume that doesn’t reference completed work, that the other person can relate to. You know what solves all of this problems? A completed project. If I can see what you accomplished, with actual results, then I have something to work with. Then I know that you did everything that is needed to get something done. The 1 thousand things you need to succeed, you have, for sure, unless you are lying. Though, lying about what you did only works for so much, so that’s not usually an issue. Proof. Prove you did something cool. The neat thing about software is that it is so open-ended that you can do pretty much anything. The hard part is picking something. Then you have to finish. Then you’ll get a job, easily. Absolutely NOT!!

You should have some significant amount of code on GitHub or your GitHub profile ought to be pretty active if you want to come across as a passionate or a serious developer to potential employers or anyone who’s sole aim is to judge you is a total BS. I mean, what were developers doing before GitHub wasn’t a thing? How were they getting jobs? Another trending BS: WHAT… you don’t know how to write the code for reversing a binary tree from scratch & then re-reverse it and then grow some apples and oranges on it, you just use the programming language API & you call yourself a developer? Yeah!! I just use the API because that saves me time & it is well tested. I know there won’t be any errors in production because of the API code. I prefer to use the API because I always have a deadline as opposed to writing the entire API from the ground up. Reversing a binary tree is not what I do in my day to day development work. Coming back to contributing to open source. What if I don’t write open-source code? What if I don’t want to make the code of my application, the core algorithms public? Under these scenarios - Am I not a developer? Will I be debarred by the developer society & sentenced to eternal solitude and blacklisted by all the employers? Honestly, when I was a beginner I tried looking into the code for some popular open-source projects with the hope of contributing to it & was rather overwhelmed and thrown back by the sheer complexity of the project, lack of documentation & the intensity of overwhelming electromagnetic waves coming out of it. Warning: If you are a beginner no matter how passionate you are don’t try contributing to open-source at home.

Rather Churchill uses the phrase to emphasise the contrast with the “Dark Age” that would threaten if the racist, populist and extreme right wing ideologies of the Nazis gained power across the whole world. Let me start with some indisputable facts, although at least one answer denies these. When I visit the Conservative Home website, I can find the speech made by Boris Johnson, on 9 May 2016, over six weeks before the referendum vote on 23 June 2016, where he said, “We can see the sunlit meadows beyond. I believe we would be mad not to take this once in a lifetime chance to walk through that door…” Boris Johnson's speech on the EU referendum: full text Johnson was echoing a speech by his hero, Winston Churchill, that specifically mentioned “sunlit uplands.” Since “sunlit hay meadows” are a well-know Continue ReadingLet me start with some indisputable facts, although at least one answer denies these.

I believe we would be mad not to take this once in a lifetime chance to walk through that door…” Boris Johnson's speech on the EU referendum: full text Johnson was echoing a speech by his hero, Winston Churchill, that specifically mentioned “sunlit uplands.” Since “sunlit hay meadows” are a well-known topographical feature, there is not a whit of difference in meaning between “sunlit meadows” and “sunlit uplands.” So, despite it being denied, elsewhere, it really happened! Reminding people about claims made during the referendum campaign is necessary to prevent the political revisionism that is commonplace with people who supported “Vote Leave.” Those who deny that the phrase was used are deliberately distorting the truth. Andrea Leadsom also used the precise words in the aftermath of the referendum when she stood as a candidate for party leader. So, it has been used by a member of the government, as mentioned in the question. The expression resonated with the public, which is why Johnson used it and commentators made the link to Churchill. I will now go to the website of “Vote Leave” here Michael Gove: ‘The Facts of Life Say Leave’ where we can all read and watch Gove’s speech, delivered on 19 April 2016, more than nine weeks before voting day. Here are some extracts. “The day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.” “BRITAIN CONTINUES IN THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ZONE” “The In campaign often argues that we would find it impossible to reach a trading agreement with EU nations after we vote leave. While there are, of course, some questions up for negotiation which will occupy our highly skilled Foreign Office civil servants, resolving them fully and properly won’t be any more complicated or onerous than the day-to-day work they undertake now navigating their way through EU recitals, trialogues and framework directives.” “There is a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Turkey that all European nations have access to, regardless of whether they are in or out of the euro or EU.26 After we vote to leave we will remain in this zone.” “As our European friends adjust to the referendum result they will quickly calculate that it is in their own interest to maintain the current free trade arrangements they enjoy with the UK. After all they sell far more to us than we do to them.” This is the “they need us more than we need them” claim that was often repeated and is still being repeated today! He continued, “Why would any of them wish to commit an act of profound economic self-harm? And if any of them did, why would the other EU nations let them?” Since Project Yellowhammer disclosed that the UK is willing to leave without a deal and to damage its economy, and no one is now denying that the UK economy will suffer damage, why would the EU 27 not be willing to suffer similarly? Gove also said, “It is sometimes claimed that we will only get free trade if we accept free movement.” He continued, “WE WILL TAKE BACK CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION Further, there are five more countries - Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey - in the queue to join the EU - and the European Commission, as we have just experienced ourselves during the recent negotiation process, regards ‘free movement’ as an inviolable principle of EU membership.” This was “Vote Leave” playing its racist card. Other “Vote Leave” supporters mentioned that 80 million Turks would soon have the right to come to the UK after joining the EU. In fact, there is zero chance of Turkey being admitted to membership in any foreseeable time line. The UK’s recently negotiated - but not yet ratified - trade agreements, with Japan and Turkey, both provide for more rights of those countries’ citizens to move to the UK. India has made clear that it will require more visas for its citizens to move to the UK if the UK wants a trade agreement with it. Boris Johnson made a promise that holders of British Overseas Citizen passports in Hong Kong would be able to come to the UK, too. There was no Parliamentary scrutiny and no referendum on any of this, of course! In conclusion, the promises have not just been abandoned; those who made them, or their apologists, try to deny having done so! In the age of the internet, the true position can be established very easily. However, alongside the denials, we can also learn that the overblown promises will not be kept. Now, citizens of the UK have been warned of the need to prepare for substantial disruption to the economy and much else. The short answer to the question is a resounding “YES!”",2021-03-05T13:57:06.749Z,"Have the promises of sunlit uplands from the government been abandoned in favour of a more realistic picture of what to expect after the transition period ends?

The American classroom hasn’t changed much since its establishment. There has of course been many technological and social improvements.

When I enter my mathematics class, as much as I love it, I do not learn how these concepts are applied to the real world. I just sit down, grind through dozens of problems and hope for the highest marks. There are some problems which aim to prepare children for the real world, from unit conversions to compound interest, however none of them engage students. This leads to young Americans being unprepared for the path which lays ahead of them. Most kids won’t need to know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, but most kids will need to know how to file their taxes and avoid an audit from the IRS. Additionally, the current education system stunts creativity amongst the brightest students. Those who desire to be ambitious entrepreneurs and politicians aren’t allowed to pursue their interests, and are forced to labor away writing an analytical essay on Edgar Allan Poe. Why should we be allowing America’s youth, the future of this country, to be denied an opportunity of a proper education; an education which prepares them to change the world for the better. Elon Musk’s own school, Ad Astra, has recognized this and has taken steps to address this problem accordingly.  At Ad Astra they treat kids like kids, and not prisoners. I hope for more schools which see the humanity in kids, and take steps to educate them properly. Let’s not educate kids on disengaging topics which they will likely never apply to their everyday lives. Rather, let’s educate kids on how things are done in the outside world. It’s important to understand the world around us, and I hope that more schools teach that correctly.

I am a student who graduated in 2017 and I can tell you first hand that this is a decision I will regret for the rest of my life; I feel horrible for making my parents pay for this program just with the hope that I would have a better future. The program is definitely not worth it. I would rather spend 20% more and go to Australia or Canada and join a 3rd tier university than join this college and I feel this due to a lot of reasons. Here are some of those. 1. It is not the same as SP Jain Mumbai. Even though they have a similar name, it is not the same. Your final degree is not the same and people are now realising this. It comes down to poor quality of student discussions, the faculty , the management or the placements. 2. You are not their customers, the companies are. Which means they will market and pull you towards joining the program until you pay all the fee. Once you have no liabilities towards them, they don't care about you or your future as they have fresh batch of students who pour money into this scam. All feedback surveys are taken before you finish your course or get placed. Quite similar to Trump University; please refer to John Oliver video about Trump university, it is very similar to SP Jain. 3. Their placement committee is a group of unqualified and insensitive people who have no regard for students. Sure, they market themselves as having the good placements. But it's got nothing to do with the efforts from institut. Students take the initiative for the jobs and only 1% land up in good jobs. The rest are forced to accept whatever job offer they get, irrespective of salary else they will not be provided with any assistance for placements and they have to pay a fine for not taking the jain (there are people who were forced to accept jobs below what they were doing before joining this institution) 4. They will honey dick you to a point where you will not complain. We were provided with lavish villas and expensive facilities when we didn't need them. We invest in a course to learn and come out with a good future. But all the fee we pay is invested towards providing extravagant houses and expansion of SPJain to Spain and California instead of concentrating those funds towards building good futures for its students. 5. The management consists of a bunch of ruthless people who will pounce on a $2 bill given a chance. They literally charged $100 per person for dinner during my graduation, additional charges for renting graduation robes and photographs (about INR100000 for your parents to visit your graduation). 6. Their own employees secretively admit that it is not worth joining this institute. After my course, I spoke to a marketing executive to give my feedback about the course and she reveals that she would never invest in a course like this. Can you imagine that. She has made hundreds of students like me join the course while she herself is not convinced of what the institution offers. 7. They invest heavily in marketing and PR due to which they are ranked highly and cover up all their shortcomings and mistakes. I can go on and on and tell you about how horrible this college is and I just cannot digest the fact that I graduated from this college. If anyone plans to join this college, please don't! It's a waste of money. It's better to take a small part of the expenditure and go on a world tour. Or invest it in a small business of your own (however small it may be) or just look for a new job and work for 2 years, you'll end up in a comparable position. If you really want to pursue higher studies, I suggest you do a proper MBA and not a Global MBA or Universal MBA; nobody cares. Nobody knows SP Jain outside India and nobody will. SPJIMR is different from SPJSGM, I wonder why do people says that SPJSGM tries to use SPJIMR’s brand image or something like that whereas worldwide people knows & talk about SPJSGM not SPJIMR.

Also, our industry interface projects are one of the best platforms to showcase your talent to the company at present projects that were offered by Top MNCs and consulting firms are so challenging and are assigned with a mentor from the company depending on which company your group get. Along with that, we have got many companies coming for internships and full time opportunities. Recently I have got 2 internship opportunities with one of the Big 4 firms and a startup company in Singapore through networking when the school organised corporate meet events but am waiting for other good opportunities with a higher package from the school’s career service. And the most important thing if you go abroad for an MBA or any other studies hardly international schools will provide you career service, campus placement happens only in India. I have friends from Macquire, La Trobe & so on…… living in Sydney who have completed their MBAs but till now for 1 and half years they are not able to land up a job (hope they get it before their visa expires)….. . I feel like people shouldn’t compare SPJSGM with SPJIMR, I know SPJIMR is a good institution in India but it is just like you are comparing an international B school with a national level school but with good historical records, personally I feel like SPJIMR have very low diversification of students, staffs & activities can't say much about the institution as I don’t know much about it. In SPJSGM we have global learning activities, students from different parts of the world, faculties from worldwide reputed institutions from LBS to your Ivy league B schools and even top IIMs too ( both full time- visiting). *PS I wont like to disclose my identity as of now as my mates don’t know about my internship offers also I don’t want them to know about it the environment is super competitive here among the students. The course in SPJGSM pushes you badly out of your limit and might make you addicted to black coffee with only 3 to 4 hours of sleep a day. So, I would suggest analyse it on your own which one is better for you. But a big reply to those in Hindi - “Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad” , so we might not know about SPJIMR and you might not know about SPJSGM so don’t come up with any wrong conclusion.

Just last week Swarm announced the official agreement to join the OpenFinance Network (OFN) to list all Swarm’s SRC-20 security tokens on the trading platform. OFN is the first security token trading platform based and regulated in the US. Which means, now residents in the US can buy, sell and trade legally compliant security tokens, with Swarm’s SRC-20 tokens being one of the foremost to be offered by the platform. Swarm is a pioneer of the security token market, with the partnership of OFN signalling the first of many liquidity sources for SRC-20 token holders, opening the gates to access a wider audience of potential investors. Furthermore, in the last month Swarm has made significant ground in the space with the release of its first individual tech equity token, to represent shares in the $5.8 billion company Robinhood with the (RHET token). Not long thereafter, Swarm released its open-source Market Access Protocol (MAP), inviting security tokens and platforms (like OFN) to integrate and build upon it within their own systems. Swarm has been billed as the blockchain for private equity, providing investors with an alternative means of attaining and offering tokenized shares in real assets - such as properties, companies, institutional investment funds, etc., with no minimum entry fees. All regulatory, investor qualification, and jurisdiction requirements are built into the SRC-20 token and compatible to be traded with all other security tokens. Swarm has built the globally compliant infrastructure to reform the current restrictive processes investors face today by eliminating the middlemen and connecting the investor directly to the equity holder, while ensuring all legal and regulatory requirements are met in a secure and reliable environment. What the security token industry needs in order to accelerate its growth is a universal protocol and language to build upon within a standardized framework, and this is exactly what Swarm has set out to achieve. Soon the SRC-20 tokens will be live and liquid on the OpenFinance Network trading platform, and of course already live the Swarm Fund.

Most PR objectives relate to giving information, influencing opinion and building or sustaining attitudes and feelings. There are different types of PR - internal relations, public affairs, financial, and media and marketing. Marketing PR which can be used to support the launch of a new product, invite press to test drive a new car, create an event when the 50th shop is opened, and sponsorship which can be used to defray costs and cement relationships with suppliers and distributors by offering free tickets to events, for example, or restaurants may invite journalists to review their new menu. Depending on the problem or objective, audiences will also be divided into primary and secondary groups. Launching a new product will mean more emphasis is placed on marketing PR groups, rather than financial audiences or the government. Furthermore, an individual can belong to more than one audience, so consistent PR communications across audiences is vital to avoid conveying contradictory messages to the same members of different publics. In today’s social media environment, I often think it can be like King Canute trying to hold back the tide and weary organisations and their PR people face a danger of becoming reactive, it’s all just too much sometimes. Take, for example, the disgruntled passenger who posted a sponsored tweet to express their anger regarding their lost luggage, only to be met with the reply: “Our Twitter account is only manned 9–5.” In today’s 24x7x365 “always on” economy and particularly in the travel industry which is highly competitive, you’d think BA could have staff on standby at home monitoring the account. I think it’s just the size of the task versus the small percentage of complaints likely to occur and the cost involved, that stops them investing in such slick customer service. But, you’d like to think that, God forbid, an aeroplane crashing on the runway would mean their Crisis Management plan would swing into action slickly and smoothly no matter what time of day or night. I’m pretty sure it would. PR is all a matter of proportional response. In order to survive in the ever-evolving communications business, with radically changing technologies, PR practitioners need to continue to do more work in moving towards positioning themselves as strategic advisers. It’s not easy. Nowadays, one size does not fit all. You need people who are specialists. For example, someone geared towards video and AV production will think very differently to the blogger and content creator. On the other hand it makes sense then for the PR manager to position themselves more strategically within an organisation, aligning themselves with the business objectives and supporting the company’s long-term profit base as they can oversee the success interpretation and distribution of key messages to markets, via the different specialist heads of divisions. In other words, if you just leave your specialists to get on with their bit, then fragmentation and ultimately confusion will reign in the marketplace(s) and as you know, “a confused mind does not buy”. The importance of relationship building is still uppermost in the PR manager’s tool-kit, particularly with the media, the heavyweights such as Huffington Post, spring to mind. Being in august journals such as this, can boost share price and provide valuable authenticity and credibility among buying audiences. There are three areas where the PR manager needs to focus - training and development so as to remain relevant and valued; expanding the use of PR as a strategic tool, instead of dropping back into being just one of the promotional tools and using PR as a means to measure and evaluate results which in turn it can communicate to the Management or the Board or the Client, thus proving the value and worth of the function in the strategic business arena to grow the business. PR is also used for financial results, employee relations, crisis management and reputation management and sometimes may not be called upon to do anything except be “on stand by” should a disaster occur in which case the pre-prepared plans will quick into action. PR is an important tool in understanding changes in internationalisation, Government regulatory departments and their impact on marketing activity and market entry. Back in the day you used to have to be a working practitioner in the PR industry for 10–12 years before you could apply and call yourself a Member of the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) still the main body for individual membership today. That’s how long it took me. These days, to reflect the speed of change, it’s now only 2 years. The Millennials have taken over. Entitled, super-qualified, smart, competitive etc., etc., coupled with the fact that the industry has fragmented and become more specialised. At the same time, it is integrated! How does that work? Well, you still want your integrated marketing communications - a Brand, a Vision, a Strategy but within that you now have to have specialisms, the “PR Manager” can no longer do it all. Thus, some agencies are re-forming around Ideas, Content and Creative (Strategy). Traditional PR agencies are regrouping with digital agencies to ensure they cover all specialisms. One account handler (PR executive) can no longer do it all. What works for written content, may not (will not?) work for audio or social etc. Certainly, the PR person has made the jump from tactical to strategic and is very much a powerhouse when it comes to “hacks” to leap frog a company forward - a viral video can be more than worth its weight in gold and PR people are traditionally creative brain-stormers. Increases in the speed of communication and the ever-increasing channels of communication mean that the PR executive has had to extend their capabilities from beyond their traditional word-smithing capabilities. Since the primary function of PR is to communicate, changes in technology have a particularly significant role in this industry, creating new means to deliver messages and how messages are delivered through new mediums such as advertorials, infomercials. PR has come of age in that it now seeks to employ management professionals from “blue chips”, those who understand business agendas and can therefore integrate with the management team. From the PR manger’s viewpoint, they wish to use their experiences and awareness of the company (or client’s) diverse mix of publics (and channels) to help the strategy formulation. The PR function also now recognises it cannot do everything and will pull in the specialists and align campaigns accordingly, it’s keeping it all together that’s the challenge and measuring and reporting back has become very complex which is why CRM systems are so valued, so campaigns can be run and monitored using a dashboard. This is where technology is so useful to the PR function, as it frees up the PR manager to oversee the communications strategy, create the messages, divide it up and then leave it to the specialists to get on with the execution of the campaigns tailored to suit their channel or medium. It also provides invaluable reporting that can’t be done any other way. This is why it’s so helpful to the PR manager/function as traditionally it’s sometimes been a role which has struggled to prove its worth. Here’s a start for this discussion.
