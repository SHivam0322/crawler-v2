I’m 30 years old, so I don’t quite know what the situation has been before I was 10. As the web itself has evolved, so have those tools. Still, web developers have not gone extinct in the past 20 years. Nomatter how advanced those tools get, they will always be limited to allowing you to achieve no more than 10% of what a good developer can provide. Such tools are actually quite limited. You need an actual developer to handle complex tasks. At the very least — those tools allow you to create only static sites. Even if they provide options for some dynamic widgets (like a section on one page would pull the latest blogposts you’ve entered elsewhere on the site) there would always be the need for custom dynamic functionality, not offered by the tools, so you end-up needing an actual developer to code this for you. You need a web developer to create those tools in the first place. A machine (or a piece of software) cannot replace it’s creator. You would need a person with web development skills to convert the user input in such tool to actual dev code to power everything up. So if you’re using such tool — you may not communicate your needs to a developer, but at the end you’re using the product of one who has simply provided you more control of what you’re getting. And with greater control comes greater responsibility, as if you break something — you won’t have the developer fix it for you. A tool like Webflow is a cheaper option, providing cheaper results. That is not necessarily a bad thing. If you need something simple and are OK with spending some time to achieve it — Webflow (or similar tools) would probably be the best thing you can consider.

I’ll try to answer it to the best of my ability. The question of “how much” comes up daily for web developers and virtually all other service providers. Some web developers have “packages” and varying levels of development that they offer so people new to internet marketing can see menus, as if they were ordering at a restaurant. The problem with this approach is that most people’s needs don’t fit comfortably into a pre-defined box and I’ve never met or worked with a client yet who didn’t need more than they thought they did, and didn’t want more a month or two later. So, it’s tough for web developers to give an exact price, honestly, on a service that requires in-depth discovery. A good, professional web developer, digital marketing specialist, SEO specialist, or really any other type of professional who works in advertising or marketing, has to talk with you at length before prescribing the best way to solve your problems and help you get more business through internet marketing; and almost everyone has tried to build their own sites before calling us…so there’s always facts attached to emotions we have to work through before we can really do a good job. Anyway, let’s get to your question directly. When you say “simple” to me, that word immediately sends up a red flag, because as we were discussing above, what may be “simple” to you may not be so simple to a programmer or developer who has to find ways to create the solution you want. And if it’s were truly “simple,” you’d have already done it by now - unless you are a programmer and developer yourself, know how to solve the issue and just don’t have the time, in which case you’d either budget the time to do it or know how to budget and scope the project. To many web developers and programmers who have what I call “real world” experience (and aren’t just installing a free template and then taking off), that word “simple” can be insulting to them right off the bat. It would be like going to a doctor, telling the doctor what is bothering you, how to perform the surgery, what tools to use, and that the procedure should be “easy.” I know you didn’t mean it that way, so let’s move on. I’m not familiar with WebFlow, and have no way of knowing why a developer would choose it or what’s going on with that aspect of development but price for any website, has to be determined based on a number of factors and can be determined in a number of ways: The developer can charge hourly. This is very common and (to me) a very bad idea because it takes a service that should be an ongoing process of internet marketing and reduces it to buying a single item like a cup of coffee or a toaster. But some developers still charge hourly rates. Most experienced developers won’t work for less than $100 per hour, which is very reasonable if the developer has credentials, a portfolio of real sites you can look at, verifiable testimonials from real people, and has professional memberships and affiliations. So the developer in this instance would speculate based on information provided, how many hours s/he think it should take and then quote an estimate. This presumes no last minute changes, revisions, content coming without issues, and so on. Another way is charging by the project, which is what we do. This is where we look at the hours we speculate the project should take to fulfill, but we also look at the overall value we are delivering to the client. And then the developer can quote an estimate based on that. For example, to a home re-modeler, two new referrals coming through the website could be worth 15–20 grand each, easily. One quality lead could be more than that. Now imagine that same person getting 4–6 phone calls or e-mails per month or per week as a result of the website. Now, all of a sudden, we go from delivering an empty template with no real value, to transforming a business within a few months, literally helping families provide for their futures. I’d say if we feel we can deliver that, and the client wants that and can understand that and is organized sufficiently to handle the increased leads, we’d ask for a percentage of what we make for the client and discussing building a relationship with the client, so that the “lead machine” can keep running forever without interruption. That’s called “value pricing” and since it’s a little complicated and many developers can’t do that, and many business owners can’t handle it, it’s not common. The down-side to all of this talk about price-hunting is that it suggests that we look at a process as if it were a single item or commodity. If we do this, it limits the Returns On Investment (ROI) we can get back - since the person you would work with is not being paid to deliver quality results, you as the client are not looking for actual ROI results just lowest price, so this creates a situation where nobody is really doing their best or focusing on delivering results (such as making your phone ring more and getting you to the top of Google search results). If we look at websites as marketing machines or online representations that can make more money for a business, they become more valuable, and this is what websites were always meant to do and be. It’s the “free” and “DIY” website template builder services that promise something for nothing that confuse people into believing websites are simply “one and done” items with no depth and no possibility for generating return. Finally, even on a very simple, rudimentary level, if we compare websites and internet marketing to look at price, it might help to be aware of other ways businesses attempt to market: Newspapers will ask for a few thousand bucks to run an ad in a daily newspaper for several weeks. Anything less doesn’t pay their massive overhead. What will you get back in return? Nobody can really say with honesty. If you put an ad in a yellow pages phone book, I’ve heard some people say it can cost as much as $500 per month. And yet who reads a phone book any longer? Why would you refer to a phone book when you can whip out your smartphone, hit up Google, and get what you want within seconds? And yet they’re still around and charging close to $500 per month for a very simple ad very few will ever in fact see. A year of that kind of payment can add up quickly and easily rack up to 6 grand. Ads in radio or television cost more, since they reach more people. So if a web developer asks for several thousand dollars for a quality website, knows what they’re doing, has references and experience, make sure the site works on all devices, and asks you about SEO, does his or her homework to make sure you get referrals from the site and cares about your business, no one can say that 2–3 thousand is unfair or not worth the investment. I’m sure others will chime in saying they’ll help you for $50 and so on, or that you can “do it yourself” and so on, but ultimately results are what should matter the most. If you get more leads, more referrals, more phone calls, more e-mails coming in daily or weekly, that’s worth the investment. Good luck with everything and hope this helps a wee bit.",2021-03-06T07:10:58.293Z,"How much should I pay a developer to build a website through Webflow web builder? ",Quora

I would create the flat/static design in photoshop, then work with a developer to get the project over the finish line - it wasn't fun. And I found myself at the mercy of the developers (who were great) for what the end product ended up being (which was always surprisingly different than the designs I created...). Basically, I didn't know how to code, and didn't have the time/effort/mindset/insert-designer-excuse-here to do it. And why do it anyways? Designers shouldn't spend their time writing in a language that only 1% of the world understands. We design things - that's what we do. And yes the web is built on this strange language called HTML (and CSS), and it's important to understand its principals - but I could never get to the point of fluency in writing it all by myself. And I know I'm not alone. I meet thousands of designers (some of the best in the world) that feel the same way. We want to create with our eyes. We want to design from our gut. We don't want to write code. (Steps off soapbox) Then Webflow came along (on a bright summer day in 2013). Funny story - was passed along from one of my developer friends, who I'd worked with many times before. It allowed me to take the teensy weensy bit of knowledge I had about code, and apply it in a visual way that felt good to me. Within weeks I was already building real websites for clients (Although back then they were only one-page wonders...). Within months I was designing full-blown production websites for large companies, some of which receive (to this day) millions of visits per year. All custom built/designed from my own design brain, and made a reality by using Webflow. I never would have been able to do this with a tool like Squarespace/Wix/Weebly, simply because what they give in consistency and well-designed templates, they lack in creative freedom and allowing the designer to create something unique/from scratch. Those other tools enable, but Webflow empowers. Now - That doesn't mean that Squarespace (and others) don't have their place. Because they most certainly do. They play an equally as important role in the web ecosystem. I've met many folks that simply need a website now. They don't really care what it looks like, but need something that looks good, and need it in a short amount of time. The fact that someone can go to a source like Squarespace and get online in a matter of minutes is one of the reason the web is so amazing today. Squarespaces of the world have lowered the barrier to entry and allow people that couldn't have gotten online before, to be able to do so. The side effect of this? Now we are seeing a standardization of the web, where we see the same templates over and over again on sites all across the web. This is where Webflow shines. It breaks this trend by empowering designers to surpass the constraints of template tweaking and build amazing sites like these: http://booking.timekit.io/http://www.dariostefanutto.com/http://moreofthesa.me/https://www.newstorycharity.org/http://minewire.webflow.io/http://wars.webflow.io/http://geospace.webflow.io/ And literally thousands of others. They couldn't have been created in Squarespace. They couldn't have been published live in Photoshop. Webflow combines the two to empower designers (and anyone) to build the future of the web without the limitations. Have any more questions?

Webflow is a visual custom-code builder for web designers. Imagine Sketch welded on top of Sublime Text -- a drag-and-drop canvas that creates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the background. The code is easily exported and developers will find that it's lean and clean. No fluff, bloat nor templating — only the code you make — which makes for very fast page-loads. Webflow is cloud-based with free SSL on everything, including their free staging URL’s. That means no plug-ins or updates to monitor and maintain, like with WP. With a Webflow-built and hosted site, content management by non-tech folks is far superior, because you can edit, post and publish on the page. With WP, one must open a dashboard that is jam-packed with a non-intuitive user-interface, constant plug-in updates, and lots of irrelevant options. Webflow has a huge amount of free learning resources, but knowing some basic HTML and CSS concepts will help you ramp up faster. Its online support is extremely responsive and personalized, whereas WP is community-supported and harder to utilize. Price-wise, Webflow with hosted CMS is more than a WP install on shared hosting (like Blue Host or GoDaddy), and less than managed hosting (like WP Engine). So, for making unique, fast, and custom web sites, Webflow is often a better value.",2021-03-06T07:18:49.278Z,"What are the differences between WordPress and WebFlow? ",Quora

Each of these ways, has pros and cons, but the simplest way to decide is to use the Developers triangle and choose which 2 of the 3 items is most important to you. Free Websites Builders Probably the simplest to use, the Free Website Builders offer the ease of use (quick and easy), with minimal cost but sacrifice not only on quality…but also functionality. Meaning, you are very restricted to the type of content you can put on the website, as well as what you may like it to actually do. These are for very basic 1-3 page websites. Template Websites The majority of the cost involved in building a website is in the Design. So, logically, by using a Template Website for the design of your website, you essentially cut a large portion of your cost. So you get pretty good quality, and the cost / time is really not that intestive…so what is the catch? The only drawback on using template sites, is you will generally not have the knowledge to customize it to your needs, (Meaning you are going to have to either learn how to or hire a programmer) and most do not come with a CMS system (Content mangement System) which allows you to edit the content on your site your self throught a backend management area. Now some templates are all ready made to put on a CMS. There are several to choose from, but instead of confusing you, I will let you know that WordPress is by far the best CMS to use. And if you are going to use Wordpress as a CMS, then you might at well start there shouldn’t you. WordPress Websites Over 90% of the website I design are built using Word press as the CMS (Content Management System). Now basically, all we are not talking about is “Skinning a CMS” (In Web Designer Speak). We are looking to find the best methods of getting an interface (design or look) onto the WordPress system. Within the world of building a Wordpress website, there are several different choices which have their own little Developers triangle (Cost, Time, Quality). Overall though, the WordPress websites are without a doubt the best middle of the road option you can choose. Do-It-Yourself Web Design You might look at the developers triangle above and ask, “Why would anyone want to build a website this way”. Well, if you have the Time, but not the money and you are looking for something you can build yourself, and also develop a pretty handy skill set, then you might actually like Do It Yourself Web Design. I’m not going tot teach you how to code, but I will point you in the right direction as far as, tutorials, tools and pitfalls to look out for. Professional Web Design YES, I know, I’m a professional web designer so it would be only blaring obliviously for me to push my services. Right? Well, if that’s what it looks like I apologize, but my intent is only to make you aware of what is involved in Professional Web Design, and help show you what to look for when hiring a pro to build your site, as well as what you should expect as far as cost (This one will get me into so hot water quickly.

I expect there will be fewer tinkerers and freelancers in the Drupal community, though, with these market changes. A few related points I’ll make: Re: Contrib modules not ported or slowly being ported: I don’t think community momentum is entirely behind this issue. The improvements in Drupal 8 core make it much easier to develop custom functionality with the entity API, without relying as much on contrib modules. On higher-budget projects, you will have a developer who can customize from there, so there will be less need for piecing together contributed modules to build your Drupal site. Also, piecing together modules, as has been common in the past, results in kind of crappy websites. They never quite fit right together. For someone with a limited budget, it’s the only option, but…Contrib modules have no viable business model (on their own), so people can’t put much energy into them until a client pays for their development work. This is totally different than what we see in the WordPress community, of course, where the plugins are more polished, but everyone charges for them. This is better for the low end of the market, though a hard game to keep up with SquareSpace, Webflow, etc.The new Drupal 8 API has been a hurdle to learn, but it’s so much nicer to work with once you do. I’ve built a couple fairly complex Drupal 8 sites so far, and the process is much more enjoyable than working in Drupal 7. Overriding existing functionality results in a lot less spaghetti code.

When I learned the language, I was impressed with how every little thing about programming was ""rethought"". Certainly not ""invented"", but it seemed Martin Odersky and company was choosing the best ideas out there for every aspect of a JVM programming language.  It's a nice direction to head in. I'd warn not to be too shy of web development.  A lot of programming today is centered on it.  It's worth it to learn how to create a clean, RESTful web service API and a websocket-enabled server, at the very least.  There are interesting projects out there, much of which require a web-friendly front-end.  Web development such as this really goes hand in hand with mobile development, since you'll often need to have a backend to provide the data for your mobile apps.  I also didn't see mention of databases in your question, so if you haven't touched MySQL or PostgreSQL, it might be a good time to start. Anyway, the main benefit of the JVM ecosystem is not Java or Scala, however.  It's the libraries, frameworks, and JVM-friendly technologies available.  See what's out there, like Spring webflows, AspectJ, Apache Camel, JMS, and Hadoop.  Everyone likes Jodatime!  And you studied multi-threading, but what about an actor system like Akka? However, if mobile development does pull you in, maybe Android is for you.  Another hot field recently is the ""Internet of Things"", controlling random devices such as home appliances intelligently via Java.  Also, I saw a fun demonstration at OSCON of someone programming their quadcopter and Roomba to sing to each other as the aircraft hovered over the other.  Where's the video?... I found it.  It was with Clojure, another JVM language:   If you don't think robotics is relevant these days, you're kidding yourself.  Google just invested heavily in it.

Webflow's design flexibility, lightning speed performance, and ease-of-use make it quite a success story as I find Webflow referred to as the next-generation tool for building and launching websites by newcomers and professionals across the web. If you are already familiar with other website builders the market is filled with, you are aware they promise all-in-one solutions for any design project, but in reality, more than not they fall short on both the design and development side.

Web designers and users who don't enjoy bothering the code, but need easily customized platform. [CHALLENGES & CORE FEATURES] Is it worth my time? The designer's role is to create a mockup or a prototype usually in software such as Xd, Figma, or Sketch. Developers try to make it happen in the real world, by coding it. How many times the designers introduced stunning effects in hi-fi prototypes, but developers had a hard time reproducing the same layout or effect in code and optimizing for different screens? A gazillion times. But, Webflow is a different beast. The visual design and code are not separated. Your project in the visual editor is powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Webflow also allows you to reuse CSS classes. Once defined, you can apply a class for any elements that you want to have the same styling. Webflow prioritizes design thinking a lot.

In the end, even the best designers are limited in terms of their taste and creativity.On the other hand WordPress is a powerful platform Flexibility: WordPress is far more flexible that all the above platforms, and you are supported by a huge open source community including thousands of plugins providing functionality of all kinds.Tons of Free Apps: A lot of 3rd party companies write their software to be compatible with WordPress such as Zendesk, Hubspot, HotJar, and many more.You own your website: You have complete control over your website and can easily move it from one hosting environment to another.Up to date with innovation: Being open source means that it is faster and easier to keep up with the technology, new applications, and new ways of doing things.Easier To Grow: Much easier to scale your website as you grow.Of course there are several challenges with using WordPress: Which Theme To Use?: There are many themes to choose from, but which one to pick, and will it be supported in the long term?Which Plugins To Use?: There are thousands of applications called plugins that you can use, but which ones will be suitable, and supported in the long term? Which ones are compatible with your theme?Management: You have to manage your own hosting, performance of your website and hosting environment performance, which is not straightforward especially if you are not highly technical.Time: Obviously there is a learning curve involved.Cost: If you hire a designer, then thats an added cost.If this is just a hobby site, or you are just trying something out, I would highly recommend Wix, Weebly or Squarespace.

Each line of code serves as an instruction—a logical, step-by-step mechanism for computers, servers, and other machines to perform an action. To create those instructions, one must know how to write code—a valuable skill that’s sometimes in short supply. But what if you could build software without writing a single line of code? That’s the premise behind no-code development, a software development method that has been gathering momentum. With the help of no-code platforms, it’s possible to develop software without writing any underlying code.  Image: Webflow “No-code allows people who don’t know how to write code to develop the same applications that a software engineer would,” says Vlad Magdalin, co-founder and CEO of Webflow, a no-code platform for building websites. “It’s the ability to do without code what has traditionally been done with code.” No-code development could also be regarded as a form of visual programming. Instead of text-based development environments, users manipulate code elements through drag-and-drop user interfaces. A popular example is MIT Media Lab’s Scratch programming language, which uses graphical programming blocks to teach children and adults how to code. “It’s more like using building blocks that have logic,” says Lacey Kesler, co-founder of the Visual Dev School. “It’s a way to empower people to create for the web without learning how to code.” No-code programming is a natural progression in the realm of software development. What began as low-level programming using assembly language—which is as close as programmers can get to machine code instructions—evolved into Java, Python, C, JavaScript, and the other programming languages of today. This evolution involved adding layers of abstraction to hide the complexities behind machine code, making programming easier for software developers. Despite being a product of technological evolution, no-code development isn’t a novel concept. The computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools of the ‘90s predate today’s no-code platforms. But CASE tools, as their name suggests, only aim to aid certain activities in the software development life cycle—and not the actual coding itself. Microsoft Visual Basic and Adobe Dreamweaver—which still require knowledge of code—are considered earlier iterations of no-code tools.  Image: Microsoft Microsoft's Visual Basic no-code tool is used here to program a virtual agent. Today, various platforms exist to enable no-code development. These include Microsoft’s Power Apps and Oracle’s Visual Builder to create mobile and web apps, Oracle’s Application Express to develop business apps, and Salesforce’s Lightning Platform for customer relationship management apps. Even Google is getting in on the action with its recent acquisition of AppSheet, a no-code platform for building mobile apps. These tools and the applications built with them are gaining traction in the tech world. According to research from Gartner, low-code application development (which also encompasses no-code) will make up more than 65 percent of application development activity by 2024, with three-quarters of large enterprises using at least four low-code development tools. So what’s behind the growth of programming without code? “With more powerful computers, more accessible cloud computing services, and better programming languages, you can start building software that allows you to build software,” says Victor Kuppers, vice president of marketing at Betty Blocks, a product that enables no-code assembly of applications from components known as “blocks.” No-code development is also a solution to a supply-and-demand problem: a rising demand for generating more software, but a limited number of developers who can create that software. “There’s a clear need in the market for more people to create software, and what you can create with code is so valuable,” Magdalin says. “Yet coding is such a difficult skill to learn that the world just can’t catch up. No-code tools are emerging because they’re much easier to learn compared to getting a computer science degree or going through a coding boot camp.” “No-code allows people who don’t know how to write code to develop the same applications that a software engineer would.”—Vlad Magdalin, Webflow Aside from this minimal learning curve, no-code platforms allow for faster application development, which could lead to lower costs for businesses. It could also eliminate any issues between a person’s vision of a product and how a software engineer brings that vision to life through code. “Software is designed to meet a certain purpose, solve a particular problem,” Kesler says. “With visual development tools, we’re able to do that without handing the project off to a developer or learning how to code it ourselves. It gives us the ability to solve our own problems.” But perhaps the most important advantage of no-code over code is making software development more accessible. “We’re moving into a world where people who understand the business situation the best or those who interact with customers the most will be building the product themselves,” says Emmanuel Straschnov, co-founder of no-code platform Bubble. “Given that technology is such a central part of our lives, more people should be able to create it. No-code development takes the power of creating software and spreads it among everyone.” Programming without code is still not a one-size-fits-all solution, though. It won’t have the same precision and won’t offer as many possibilities as code does. “Because it’s a higher level of abstraction, it will be limiting in some ways. You won’t have the same flexibility as code,” says Straschnov. Moreover, no-code platforms aren’t meant to replace software developers. “I’m a former software engineer, so I used to have the same fear,” Magdalin says. “Just because coding has been automated doesn’t mean the entire skill is gone. In fact, it may even be more valued now. Every business will have something unique that can’t be addressed by a no-code solution. You still need developers for the exceptions that these visual tools don’t support.” When it comes to the future of no-code development, Straschnov sees it as becoming a natural part of the software ecosystem, with more companies switching to no-code platforms and software engineers extending these platforms to make them more powerful. “I hope the future of no-code is one framed in a positive light because it’s democratizing software development,” Kesler says. “I know how to code—I was solely dedicated to Ruby on Rails, but I realized that’s not how I like to create. Once I found visual development, it changed everything for me. No-code development allows others to create in a way that feels natural to them.”",2021-03-06T07:33:47.877Z,"Is it really possible that a non-programmer builds a very good app with a no-code approach?
