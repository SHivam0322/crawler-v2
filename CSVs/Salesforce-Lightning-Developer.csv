Visualforce and the Issues faced by Developers ?Visualforce is very well adopted by the developers. Visualforce is a server-centric technology in comparison to Lightning experience which is basically client-centric. So, it was needed that Visualforce must be evolved to a certain extent, for the developers to utilize its full potential. Let us delve into some of the issues that the developers face, while using Visualforce in Lightning experience. Issue # 1 : There was a problem that is faced here that the markup of VF was not matching that of the design, so SLDS came into picture but this was still a persistent problem. A parallel implementation of SLDS and this was mapped with the markup for VF. Moreover, the VF components were made to have the look and feel of the components in the Lightning experience. ‘ Issue # 2 : Where to Start ? The developers need to know where to start. We have the Visualforce Usage API and the Analyzer to help us in this type of issue. Visualforce Usage API It acts as any other API and when used against the Salesforce org returns the number of page views of your Visualforce page for a duration of say last 30 days. This was for resolving the issue on migrating to Lightning experience. Moreover, it helped people to understand which all pages were viewed by the end users. All these were well documented in the trailhead modules but for people who did not have sufficient time to read, the Visualforce Analyzer would be an useful tool. Let us now understand what is this tool all about ? Visualforce Analyzer For this there is a parameter called Lightning Readiness Check, accessible from the setup. When we click, this runs a report by the running the metadata against the org. This gives information on the org and how it fares in the Lightning experience. This lets you choose those pages with action items for whatever you are supposed to do, with these pages. There are many instances when Visualforce pages are used inside the Lightning experience.

I’m a Salesforce certified Admin (ADM-201), Developer I (DEV-401)(retired), and Platform App Builder (DEV-402). And I’ve been in Salesforce since 2010, and in senior Salesforce leadership since 2014 (~4 years), building and managing quite diverse applications. I’m also INFP and quite sensitive to user frustration with my applications, where I work exceedingly hard to streamline processes and interfaces to create the least friction. Because less routine friction for users translates to less friction in every interaction that user has over the day, both with clients and colleagues, and that is noticeable if you pick up on such things. So let me tell you some things I’ve picked up. First, “Lightning” is a misnomer. In all real-life scenarios it has been slower than classic, in both the interface interactions, and in loading records. Largely because it relies on large quantities of Javascript on its interface while Classic does not.Second, a bunch of features that are Classic staples are still missing from Lighting. Including some big ones. Like the ability to Mass-email from Listviews which was only introduced to lightning in Winter 2018. Or how the ability to schedule reports and dashboards (a daily staple in every implementation I’ve ever experienced) was entirely missing at release. And this is painful to a point where you think that they are purposely shedding features to either save themselves work, or create more of a paid-app market, or because they have less real-life experience using Salesforce than building it.Third, and the most prominent reason why I will not be forcing lightning on any of our offices at my 5000+ employee organization, is that the interface is actually far less intuitive than what Salesforce decided to call “Classic” after coming out with “Lightning”. Meaning, it has a ton of whitespace around all fields, and places fields below their field tags, doubling the amount of space one field takes, even before injecting whitespace. But even worse, instead of showing all the related record data, you now have to click all over the record to access what used to be viewable at an immediate glance on “Classic”. The net effect of both of this being a reduction in viewable data density that is by my estimate around 65% per viewed record (before having to click on something).Fourth is a new nuisance, and is how the related lists on parent records (like Opportunities associated with a Contact record) are limited to showing only 3 relevant fields until you click on them (going to a page away from the parent). And how the child record names when appearing on a parent record are shortened instead of wrapped when viewing them, basically making viewing child records of any parent a huge hassle.And that is my evaluation. And my best overall conclusion on their efforts with lightning is that they are trying their hardest to create an interface that people can both Mouse and use Touch on. Hence why all the icons for features and tons of whitespace. What they’re not understanding is the lesson of Windows 8.1, where in trying to marry the Touch experience and Mousing experience, they’re ruining it for both. And what introducing “Lightning” currently does is to overall introduce more friction and frustration; measured in extra clicks, extra mouse surfing, information visibility dilution, missing utility, and increase in support requests and questions. You can view this yourself if you allow your users to see what a record looks like in Classic vs. Lightning and actually let them intuit and choose. And the effect is the same even if the user has no “old way” of thinking and is new to both interfaces. Try it. Edit (4/10/2018): To add several other issues here that I’ve discovered since I have chosen to edit them into this answer so others researching the issues can find them together. 5. Quick Actions, meant to replace Javascript buttons in classic, are only enabled for standard objects in lightning, meaning that if you wish to reproduce a Javascript button in Lightning that works with more than standard objects, you need to learn the Aura programing framework (Java).6. There is no way to add Related List buttons to related lists, you can only add custom buttons to the very top button row. Hi there.

I’m a Salesforce certified Admin (ADM-201), Developer I (DEV-401)(retired), and Platform App Builder (DEV-402). And I’ve been in Salesforce since 2010, and in senior Salesforce leadership since 2014 (~4 years), building and managing quite diverse applications. I’m also INFP and quite sensitive to user frustration with my applications, where I work exceedingly hard to streamline processes and interfaces to create the least friction. Because less routine friction for users translates to less friction in every interaction that user has over the day, both with clients and colleagues, and that is noticeable if you pick up on such things. So let me tell you some things I’ve picked up. First, “Lightning” is a misnomer. In all real-life scenarios it has been slower than classic, in both the interface interactions, and in loading records. Largely because it relies on large quantities of Javascript on its interface while Classic does not.Second, a bunch of features that are Classic staples are still missing from Lighting. Including some big ones. Like the ability to Mass-email from Listviews which was only introduced to lightning in Winter 2018. Or how the ability to schedule reports and dashboards (a daily staple in every implementation I’ve ever experienced) was entirely missing at release. And this is painful to a point where you think that they are purposely shedding features to either save themselves work, or create more of a paid-app market, or because they have less real-life experience using Salesforce than building it.Third, and the most prominent reason why I will not be forcing lightning on any of our offices at my 5000+ employee organization, is that the interface is actually far less intuitive than what Salesforce decided to call “Classic” after coming out with “Lightning”. Meaning, it has a ton of whitespace around all fields, and places fields below their field tags, doubling the amount of space one field takes, even before injecting whitespace. But even worse, instead of showing all the related record data, you now have to click all over the record to access what used to be viewable at an immediate glance on “Classic”. The net effect of both of this being a reduction in viewable data density that is by my estimate around 65% per viewed record (before having to click on something).Fourth is a new nuisance, and is how the related lists on parent records (like Opportunities associated with a Contact record) are limited to showing only 3 relevant fields until you click on them (going to a page away from the parent). And how the child record names when appearing on a parent record are shortened instead of wrapped when viewing them, basically making viewing child records of any parent a huge hassle.And that is my evaluation. And my best overall conclusion on their efforts with lightning is that they are trying their hardest to create an interface that people can both Mouse and use Touch on. Hence why all the icons for features and tons of whitespace. What they’re not understanding is the lesson of Windows 8.1, where in trying to marry the Touch experience and Mousing experience, they’re ruining it for both. And what introducing “Lightning” currently does is to overall introduce more friction and frustration; measured in extra clicks, extra mouse surfing, information visibility dilution, missing utility, and increase in support requests and questions. You can view this yourself if you allow your users to see what a record looks like in Classic vs. Lightning and actually let them intuit and choose. And the effect is the same even if the user has no “old way” of thinking and is new to both interfaces. Try it.

And who could forget the Lightning Design System? I would say that Lightning Experience is getting there. It is not ready for prime time quite yet, because performance is slow (think ‘rolling thunder’ rather than ‘lightning’). There are still many features, functionalities and customizations that are not supported in Lightning Experience, although that list is shrinking with time. Eventually the Salesforce Classic UI will be retired and Lightning Experience will be the standard UI of Salesforce. When that day will be, I’m not sure. My best guess is that Lightning Experience is 6–12 months away from most companies making the switch from Classic. I imagine Classic will still be accessible for many more years. I am soon to release a training course on Lightning Experience, so you can check out Salesforce Lightning Experience | Transition and New User Training Course to get updates when that releases. Lightning Process Builder is pretty solid. It still isn’t great when you are dealing with processes that need to happen in bulk, but it is steadily improving. This will continue, as Salesforce continues to innovate and add things that can be done with clicks vs. code. It’s still clunky from an interface responsiveness perspective, and making edits can be a pain. However, the power that it wields is awesome. I am using it more and more. Lightning Components and Lightning App Builder - It is the future, and the future is now. So I’d say it is ready for Prime Time. It’s early, and so there’s not a lot of tutorials and code samples to leverage in learning. The ability to create not only apps on the AppExchange, but also Lightning Components, is an exciting opportunity for the development community. Taking these components and dragging them into your own apps via the Lightning App Builder opens up a mind-boggling array of possibilities. Lightning Design System - This is the UI Library and CSS Framework that you can leverage for your Lightning Apps. Salesforce has recently baked this into the platform so that you no longer need to install it as a static resource. Here’s a relevant blurb from the Lightning Design System website: “The Lightning Design System CSS is now automatically included for Lightning Components running in the Lightning Experience and Salesforce S1 mobile application (via app.css).

My best platform is different, these are the requirements for me and maybe for some of you, so I can develop my app very fast and also go deep when things get sophisticated (my experience says, it always gets sophisticated eventually). No blocking when I want to do some advanced stuff,No proprietary languages or technologies,Support favorite UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular etc)Open Source ModelMicro service supportNo pre-compile or code generation, immediate previews and deploymentDeploy anywhere (AWS, GCP, Azure or any Kubernetes cluster) with one clickFull featured web based IDE without any browser plug-insTeam support, Live collaboration and version controlNo code support for basic development (forms, grids, dashboards, workflows, notifications)Advanced Access ControlMobile UI supportSo far, Code2.io (was iCodeBetter) is the only solution that I could find for my needs. Main Page of Code2, you can jump into the wizards without writing any code and you can start building your business app.  You can always see what you’re doing and how the tables, queries, forms and grids are related to each other. If you are developing a big project, it will save your time and mind. It visualizes all the impact analysis for you.  You can always see your ER diagrams and tables. Code2 generates DDL scripts for you, but if you’re an advanced developer, you can customize those scripts and put extra indexing and partitioning parameters.  You can see the wireframes of your forms. You real forms are in your favourite UI framework. Yes, Code2 stores everything in metadata, so you can see your UI in your own choice (React, Vue, Angular or ExtJS) and you change it and its templates anytime you like. You can also manage best practice conditional statements from the wireframe previews.  Every business project requires Access Control List, sometimes it gets very complex, so you need a tool manage those things. In Code2, you can manage everything from IDE and track it visually. Row based or column based ACL is a just few clicks away. Btw, everything you set here applies both for your frontend and backend side.  Although Code2 generates responsive UI pages for you, you can also create more mobile oriented user experiences by leveraging Code2’s mobile UI capabilities. You can also convert these mobile UIs to a native application.  You can also manage your Kubernetes cluster inside Code2. You can monitor, deploy or change its parameters.  Managing APIs and integrations are also realities of all business software. In Code2, you can create your APIs from your business objects, but also integrate external APIs by just importing Swagger (OpenAPI) or Google Discovery Documents with a click.  I cannot say Code2 is for everyone, but if you are looking for a platform that helps you develop really fast and when things get sophisticated and you need advanced deeper interaction with platform, Code2 is the real winner.

Solutioning without CodingIf you want to make a career in building solutions in Salesforce for your company or as a consultant to other companies, you can go quite far without know how to code. If you have no interest in learning how to write code, you still need to understand where a solution may require it.  So in other words, even if you don't write the actual code, you need to know when code should be written and what that code should do. Then you may need to describe that to someone that can write code and check their results. So when do you need code? The short answer is when declarative programming (""clicks not code"") can't give you the results you want. As of this writing (August 2015) there's a lot of stuff you can do without code, and Salesforce keeps adding more non-code features and flexibility. (And there's a ton--arguably there may be more complexity in the non-code capabilities of Salesforce than in Apex or Visualforce. I know plenty of coders that get completely lost in the non-code part of Salesforce.) But you're still programmingWhile you may never write a line of Apex, you will still program, in the sense that you're logically breaking down a process into discrete little instructions and then building a solution. For example, I needed to create a set of rules in Salesforce that route customer service cases to the right team based on the type of problem, the license level of the customer, and even special adjustments for cases that came in over the weekend. I totally nailed it without code using Salesforce's non-code tools. BUT! I had to think through all the possible paths the case could take and also account for what happens if something get stuck along the way.  There are also plenty of situations where you're writing stuff that looks like ""regular"" code. For example, you may write formulas in Salesforce to make calculations on records or in reports. Same thing: you'll need to break the logic down into discrete little instructions. But in this case you're writing syntax that looks very similar to formulas in Excel or even really complex Google search strings.  So... If you're afraid not coding in Apex will limit your career, it doesn't need toIf you want to focus on coding, there's plenty of opportunity (nobody has really explored this interpretation of your question--Salesforce coders are highly in demand)If you want to learn to code, there are a ton of resources out there to help. But you should also learn the click-and-drag side of Salesforce.If you'd just rather not code, there's still plenty that can be done.There are a lot of other questions and answers on Quora on where to get more info on learning Salesforce.

Once you move to Lightning it works on website and mobile without writing any additional code. The Lightning Experience interface is more modern, with a focus on using visual elements to display information and a more intuitive and effective use of screen space. Salesforce Classic’s uniform layouts with stacked boxes of text in columns and rows are hard to scan and give a false impression of data hierarchy by only using vertical space. As compared to Lightning Experience layouts make use of both horizontal and vertical space to display elements and use different shapes and colors to call out important information and highlight differences between types of elements. In Salesforce Classic, you’re almost always looking at a static HTML page. Saving updated data requires a full page refresh, and editing things like list views or dashboards requires loading an entire separate editing interface, and then saving and reloading to view your updates. Lightning Experience is built entirely differently. Saving updated data doesn’t require refreshing an entire page, and saving data in one element can update data in other elements immediately and seamlessly. The piece of Salesforce that was missing in classic is that flexibility and customizability was the user interface. Lightning changes that. Along with Lightning Experience, Salesforce has also introduced the Lightning App Builder and the Lightning Design System, which allow you to leverage the underlying design system of Lightning Experience to easily create apps or enhance user experience. A completely re-imagined user experience and platform.

Lightning Ecosystem: Making the App Home to your Company Lightning Ecosystem is an entire structure of tools and methods to build your app with high functionality Lightning Ecosystem also allows the possibility of not compromising on the quality of your app3.

Is it good for the future and the main thing, without having any relevant work experience, how can they get a job in Salesforce? I will try to explain all the points in this answer so that it answers most of your queries. What is Salesforce? To give you a one-liner answer, Salesforce is a CRM tool, as a matter of fact, currently the world best CRM tool available in the market. Let me help you understand the concept of CRM tool.  Almost on a daily basis do we shop online. We use various e-commerce websites like Flipkart, Amazon etc. Then you may also try ordering online via Dominos. You may have a subscription at supermarkets like Walmart or Target or Big Bazaar and Spencer’s from where you get notifications that this particular product is on sale. Many times you get targetted advertisements too. All the data that you feed into the system, based on your shopping list and a number of other criteria help the company to understand your shopping needs and the CRM will device various strategies to improve the company’s sales by customer retention. Targetted ads are one thing when you shop online, it helps you with various recommendations. And side by side, it also stores all the information, your data, your last orders, even your credit card information.  All these go into making a CRM tool that not just provides you with the service but helps the company to increase its sales. Now, this is just one example of what a CRM tool does. A tool like Salesforce offers many more options to the users to work with.  What is the scope of Salesforce in future? Is it beneficial to learn Salesforce as a fresher? This is something my seniors used to tell me at my first project and now I would say the same thing. You would consider yourself lucky to get a chance of working with Salesforce as a fresher! The demand for Salesforce professionals is higher than ever! The technology not just pays well but has a huge potential, huge market and huge opportunities for the future.  Being the Number #1 CRM tool in the world, Salesforce is one of the niche technologies that you can think of building your career with. Even though the salaries differ from company to company, a Salesforce professional earns decently, above the market standards and it increases handsomely as you gain work experience. The Salesforce ecosystem is predicted to create 1.1 million new jobs by 2022 in India alone.  How to get started with Salesforce? What are the pre-requisites for it? Pre-requisites: From a high-level point of view, Salesforce has two career paths - Administrator and Developer. For the Developer track, yes, you would need to learn to code. One needs to know Java and SQL in order to start writing code in Apex, which is the programming language for Salesforce and HTML and CSS in order to code in Visualforce. You would also need to know Javascript in order to code in Lightning. However, if you are someone who is not interested in coding, there is a parallel career path which is that of an administrator. The work of a Salesforce administrator mostly revolves around declarative tools that do not involve coding.  In Salesforce, we do not directly jump into coding when there is a new requirement. We first check if this can be done using the declarative tools that Salesforce provides, which is the role of an admin. If the tools do not suffice, only then we move to the programming approach. Being a Salesforce administrator requires a lesser amount of technical expertise and over the years, you can find yourself as a Consultant. However, the salary prospects of an admin is a little lesser than a developer and the demand for developers are more than admins. Getting Started: Being a hot technology which is in high demand, Salesforce is attracting professionals a lot lately. By 2022, Salesforce expects to have an $859 billion revenue and generate 3.3 million jobs! So many people are trying to get their hands on Salesforce, learn it and apply for jobs.  The best way to learn Salesforce is through Trailhead. Trailhead is Salesforce's own learning tool where one can sign up for free and learn almost everything Salesforce has to offer. Trailhead is a gamified portal where there are modules you can learn from, get hands-on experience in modules, build projects and earn badges along the way. You also get an exposure to real-life simulated scenarios where a business use case is presented to you and you work on the solution and attain Superbadges. You can start learning with Trailhead, go through the trail mixes which are specially curated for Admin and Developer roles. Try to implement the same in your Sandbox so that you can have practical knowledge. You can choose to learn from other online resources like Udemy for reference. In the end, you need to complete the Superbadges on Trailhead. Completing a Superbadge really boosts your confidence which goes a long way to help you during your Certification exam.  How to earn Salesforce Certifications? See, the two basic certifications in Salesforce are the Salesforce Certified Administrator and Salesforce Certified Platform Developer - I. If you are looking to bag a job offer, it is suggested you earn at least one of these two certifications; better if you can earn both! As I said, you ideally start with the Admin portion first and then move on to the Developer portion. For the preparation, Trailhead is the ideal path. There are specially curated trail mixes for the certification exams that you can practice.  Anyone who wishes to appear for these examinations, I would suggest you go through Trailhead for starters. You may choose to skip the Hands-on just for the exam purpose but it is good practice to solve them too. Followed by courses on Udemy, they will help a lot to understand the concepts deeper and I would definitely recommend that. Also, please do not refer to any kind of dumps that are available in the market. It is a myth that you cannot pass without the dumps, I am one example who passed three of them without any malpractice.  How much does it pay as a Salesforce professional? Without giving you imaginary figures, I will share the real-world scenario that is out there. Salesforce Ben has recently conducted a survey where they planned to understand the average salaries for Junior, Mid-level and Senior level Salesforce professionals. They also checked for the number of certifications each held and how the salaries differ by seniority and cities. A total of 1,670 Salesforce professionals participated in this survey all over India.  To give you an idea of how much in demand Salesforce is, here is the list of the annual salary details for Salesforce professionals working in different roles in India: Pardot Consultant - Rs 6,61,518Tester - Rs 7,52,285Marketing Cloud Consultant - Rs 8,37,200Business Analyst - Rs 8,49,695Marketing Automation Specialist - Rs 8,63,333Salesforce Administrator - Rs 8,86,659Salesforce Developer - Rs 9,00,835CRM Manager - Rs 12,07,500Salesforce Consultant - Rs 12,77,967Project Manager - Rs 19,17,739Solution Architect - Rs 22,09,977Technical Architect - Rs 26,76,672The survey also did a city-wise breakdown of the salaries: Ahmedabad - Rs 9,27,001Bengaluru - Rs 12,66,478Chandigarh - Rs 10,60,286Chennai - Rs 12,18,069Delhi - Rs 16,75,918Gurgaon - Rs 14,56,577Hyderabad - Rs 10,13,945Indore - Rs 7,56,250Jaipur - Rs 7,65,688Kochi - Rs 7,65,353Kolkata - Rs 12,97,381Mumbai - Rs 10,49,865Noida - Rs 8,48,068Pune - Rs 10,40,428 How to get a job in Salesforce? Coming to the most important point, how to get a job! Without having a single certification, it is difficult to get a job in Salesforce unless you join some service-based companies who allot you in random projects and you get lucky to land up in Salesforce. That was my case actually but you cannot surrender everything to fate.  LinkedIn is your best friend in that case. There are plenty of job openings that you can find on LinkedIn for the requirement of Salesforce Administrator or Developer for entry-level positions. While learning Salesforce, if you can build some cool stuff on your own in your trial org, you can showcase them too during your interview. that will provide you with a little experience and the interviewers are bound to be impressed.  I hope that clears many of your questions. If you still have other queries, do let me know and I can append them in this answer itself so that it provides the readers with a one-stop solution for all their questions, doubts and queries.

Also I could use “cloud” in other sense: here in Salesforce we say Salesforce Cloud, for Salesforce Product/Service. So the Salesforce Sales product is the Salesforce Sales Cloud. I'll try to be clear when I use the term “cloud” in one sense (datacenter) or the other (product/service) Another important message: for Salesforce ""Nothing is more important to our company than the privacy of our customers' data"". In any way that Salesforce decides to deploy and implement the physicality of its solutions, always, always this is done following this core value: Trust. Yes, Salesforce has its own cloud What today Salesforce veterans (plus 5 years in the company) call sometimes Salesforce “Force.com” or “core” (Force.com | Salesforce Developers) is what we can say “original” Salesforce offering. Today it has morphed and included several other products and extensions at the pace of 3 releases each year. The features added all the time come from organic development and a lot of acquisitions. The “core” platform, called Lightning Platform is hosted on own/run Salesforce datacenters. So we can say that Yes, this product, Lightning Platform, is run on Salesforce own Cloud or datacenters. The Salesforce Lightning Platform (Architecture) is the basis for: Salesforce core CRM: Sales, Service and Marketing (core) Clouds (read Cloud as product)Also Salesforce Communities, Billing, CPQ, B2B Commerce, Field Service Lighting and Einstein Analytics run on the same Platform (and also deployed on the same infrastructure (hence on the same datacenters)picture here can get more complicated when you look under the hood, and these clouds (=products) sometimes make calls to functionalities that run on other “clouds” (for example intensive processing of lots of data in bulk is run outside the “core” lighting platform and using services hosted in another cloud (another cloud service or datacenter - this is the case for scheduling in Field Service Lighting for example)Also it allows you to extend these Clouds with your own business logic, including extending the UI, datamodel and code (see Trail: Developer Beginner: Developer Beginner)You can connect it to virtually everything using Salesforce APIs (see Trail Lightning Platform API Basics: Lightning Platform API Basics)Salesforce hosts these clouds in several datacenters around the world to comply with several data residency and other privacy and security standards. In the long history of Salesforce acquisitions, some products where running already on their own “clouds” (as datacenters here), for example like Pardot, or today Salesforce B2B Marketing Cloud. Also we can say that Yes, Salesforce has its own cloud to run Salesforce B2B Marketing (or Pardot for old time Salesforce veterans and Pardashians also) Same with Salesforce Marketing Cloud (ExactTarget acquisition): it run on its own cloud, and today are part of Salesforce as well. I will add here B2C Commerce Cloud (Demandware acquisition). Looking under the hoods many other features run on Salesforce own (or managed) clouds, including the hardware infrastructure. The main objective is to make all these products (or clouds) interact seamlessly, and always protect our Customer's data from hardware issues and potential cybersecurity attacks. How this is done? A lot of engineering ingenuity I will say, also carefully assessing solutions to be acquired that have same architectural principles: public cloud and multi-tenancy in general. If you want to get into the details, I recommend this article in Medium “The Magic of Multitenancy (https://engineering.salesforce.com/the-magic-of-multitenancy-2daf71d99735)” by the amazing group of people that make all the Salesforce Magic happens: follow them in Medium's Salesforce Engineering Also this white-paper can get you a view of what under the hood of the Salesforce Lighting Platform: Whitepaper: The Force.com (Force.com) Multi-tenant Architecture (Multi Tenant Architecture - developer.force.com) And these Dreamforce recordings also are super good: Salesforce Multi Tenant Architecture: How We Do the Magic We Do (Salesforce Multi Tenant Architecture: How We Do the Magic We Do), and An Insider View of the Salesforce Architecture (An Insider View of the Salesforce Architecture) For a learning path go to this Trailhead Module: Salesforce Platform Basics (Salesforce Platform Basics) No, Salesforce does not run some products on its own cloud There are 2 reasons, however it will be an oversimplification: acquisitions andother cloud services are great to develop and host Salesforce products and services, so why not use them?In the long history of Salesforce acquisitions, many solutions ended as features in the Salesforce Lighting Platform (Salesforce Content, Mobile and Service Cloud are some examples), and others, well their were running on public cloud services like Amazon AWS, so, why not keep them running there and integrate them, rather than porting to our own Salesforce Clouds? Examples of this are: Heroku (see Develop Apps with Heroku),Social Studio (see Get Social with Social Studio) andQuip (see Collaborate with Quip)Heroku is an amazing virtual cloud on top of another Cloud: Amazon AWS. You can sign up for an Heroku account and you will find it totally non-AWS: it is a super PAAS solution, and it is run entirely on top of AWS. So, in this case Salesforce does not own the cloud that Heroku runs on. Quip is a great collaboration tool to write content, share it and work together, and it also runs on Amazon AWS. And yes, also Salesforce is porting the Salesforce Lightning Platform to AWS. There are already some Salesforce Lighting ORGs running on top of AWS (see official announcement here https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2018/09/180925-r/) It depends ... Life and engineering solutions never are black and white: there are a lot of grades. This is why this section on It depends... Including for the Salesforce “core” Lighting Platform, Salesforce hosts its hardware on third party facilities: the building, and the physical connections (electricity, access to internet, cooling, etc), all the physical construction and maintenance of the data center is outsourced.
