That lets you sell into the benefit of your diverse background rather than having it be a risk / fear.

If you really want to start a career in digital marketing then go and get a job in a real advertising/digital agency. Learn from the people you work with, do courses on Udemy, read industry blogs, pay your fucking dues and don’t be a lazy scammer. sorry if this sounds harsh but digital marketing is about so much more than these fake gurus let on. If you want to stand out, focus on upskilling in data analysis, coding and machine learning. This will put you way ahead of other “average” marketers. After you’re done in that agency I mentioned above (after 2 years) go and work in a start-up and learn how to think critically and learn to use data to inform what experiments you should undertake. It will also help you think more critically about channel integration and attribution. You wouldn’t hire an untrained electrician to wire your house or feel comfortable having someone with no business training write a strategy for your company.

Because they get back $2 MILLION plus all the sales to a new customer. That’s pretty lucrative to me. But I also know hundreds of people who have invested in social media and lost all their advertising money. Proctor and Gamble spent $100 MILLION and never saw an increase in sales. What the difference. The company that made money realized there is no magic in the media. A media is just a delivery service. The magic is in the targeting and messaging. Any media just delivers your compelling message to your ideal prospect. If you get those two wrong, because you didn’t research them, no media will work. Social media has no magic. If you don’t get the targeting right, or the messaging is confusing, unclear, or boring, you won’t get results. And that’s not the media’s fault. Think of having a pizza delivered to your house as an analogy. If the pizza is lousy (equivalent of the message) or it is delivered to the wrong address (equivalent of targeting), does it matter whether it was delivered (media) by a car, unicycle, or jet? Nope. No media is ‘lucrative’. It’s how well you use a media to target your ideal prospect and how well you craft your messaging to get their attention and lead them to your sale. And since social includes more than 50 different types of delivery, you have to know how each one works to make it delivery your particular message to your specific target prospect. And this takes research. If you don’t do research you are just guessing. Make millions or lose millions- all based on research and understanding media. Good luck! Like any media, social is a great opportunity for marketing. I was on the phone with a company that spends $1 MILLION dollars a month on social. Why? Because they get back $2 MILLION plus all the sales to a new customer. That’s pretty lucrative to me. But I also know hundreds of people who have invested in social media and lost all their advertising money. Proctor and Gamble spent $100 MILLION and never saw an increase in sales. What the difference. The company that made money realized there is no magic in the media. A media is just a delivery service. The magic is in the targeting and messaging.

This statistic makes sense when you consider that most businesses are setting themselves up for failure on social media before they even get started. If you take anything away from this post, make it this: Social media is about building relationships. The entire purpose for which social media was created, was to give people a way to connect with one another. You MUST keep this principle in mind with every move you make while marketing on social media if you ever want it to work for you. Engage with people through pages, groups, and messages.Answer questions and respond to posts where you can offer help whenever possible.Form partnerships with other people and influencers in your industry.Be authentic to your brand. Find a cause or a value that aligns with your business and support it.Listen to what your audience is saying...then act on it.If you can show people that you’re genuinely interested in getting to know them, and that you’re there to provide value in the form of advice and help, then you’ll be able to establish yourself as an expert in your field. Don’t get caught up in the numbers. I guarantee you that almost every one of those 95% of businesses failed on social media because they became obsessed with numbers. Don’t get me wrong, there are numbers you want to care about. You want to care about your engagement, your cost per click, and other data figures that can inform your marketing, but stop watching your follower count. The amount of followers or likes that you rack up does NOT translate to the amount of money in your bank. The interactions you get on social media are more important - both for your business and your ranking.Concentrate on encouraging comments and shares, rather than follows and likes.High-quality followers are more likely to convert than a high number of low-quality followers. Deliver value. Your social media followers are real people. They appreciate posts that answer their questions, solve their problems, and keep them entertained. Delivering valuable, high-quality posts is what separates amazing social media marketers from just social media managers. Include lots of photo and video content.Post consistently, but don’t overwhelm your followers.Lay off the spammy sales pitches. It’s okay to include a link or promotion every once in a while, but keep it to a minimum.The last thing to remember is that social media marketing is an ever-evolving field. Platforms are constantly making new changes to their algorithms and the services they provide. What works one month may not work the next, so it’s important to be adaptable in your approach. If you’re still having difficulties with social media marketing, or if you’re looking for a quicker, more effective way to leverage social media for sales, then I suggest consulting a professional.

It’s time to create a solid content strategy. Don’t focus on only text based post and include a blog post, videos, info graphics, quotes, tips, gif and images.

This includes paying attention to the headline, image and description of whatever it is you’re sharing.

For example, if you are going to post something on Instagram, your first priority will be finding a stand-out image. Your caption is also important, but the image will be what first grabs a user’s attention. If you’re posting to Twitter, having a humorous or cleverly written post will be your main priority. Adding a picture is also effective, but it’s the words you want to focus on. Step 6: Increase more followers The best way to get followers is to follow other individuals. Don’t buy fake followers because they are not your targeted audience. Share informative content on your social channels on daily basis. Step 7: Create an ideal #hashtag Create a hashtag for your business. Encourage your audience to share their story and experience related to your business with your brand hashtag. Remember one thing; make your hashtag unique and short. Avoid complex hashtag. Step 8: Invest in a social media tool Many marketers use social media tools to boost their productivity.

This involves publishing great content on your social media profiles, listening to and engaging your followers, analyzing your results, and running social media advertisements. The major social media platforms (at the moment) are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Snapchat. How to make your Social Media Marketing Successful? #1 Strategy Before you dive right in and publish something on social media, let’s take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The first step is to think about your social media strategy. What are your goals? Which social media platforms do you want to focus on? What type of content do you want to share? #2 Planning and Publishing Social media marketing for small businesses usually starts with having a consistent presence on social media. Close to three billion people (3,000,000,000!) use social media. By being present on social media platforms, you give your brand an opportunity to be discovered by your future customers. Publishing to social media is as simple as sharing a blog post, an image, or a video on a social media platform. It’s just like how you would share on your personal Facebook profile. But you will want to plan your content ahead of time instead of creating and publishing content spontaneously. Also, to ensure that you are maximizing your reach on social media, you need to publish great content that your audience likes, at the right timing and frequency. #3 Listening and Engagement As your business and social media following grows, conversations about your brand will also increase. People will comment on your social media posts, tag you in their social media posts, or message you directly. People might even talk about your brand on social media without letting you know. So you will want to monitor social media conversations about your brand. If it’s a positive comment, you get a chance to surprise and delight them. Otherwise, you can offer support and correct a situation before it gets worse. #4 Analytics Along the way, whether you are publishing content or engaging on social media, you will want to know how your social media marketing is performing. Are you reaching more people on social media than last month? How many positive mentions do you get a month? How many people used your brand’s hashtag on their social media posts? The social media platforms themselves provide a basic level of such information. #5 Advertising When you have more funds to grow your social media marketing, an area that you can consider is social media advertising. Social media ads allow you to reach a wider audience than those who are following you. Social media advertising platforms are so powerful nowadays that you can specify exactly who to display your ads to. You can create target audiences based on their demographics, interests, behaviours, and more.",2021-03-05T15:49:10.994Z,"What is social media marketing? ",Quora

You don’t have to attend overpriced weekend financial seminars or learn the latest tricks and gimmicks sold by slick marketers. As John Bogle wisely stated, “The secret is there are no secrets.” The truth behind how to build wealth is public domain knowledge, simple to understand, and nobody is going to get rich selling it to you. In fact, it’s so simple it can be explained in just two sentences: Make more than you spend and invest the difference wisely. Develop simple daily habits that result in wealth accumulation. I know… you’re probably a little disappointed. You wanted something new, different, and clever – the missing ingredient that has held you back and will produce breakthrough results. The fabled “secret” every marketer tries to sell. Instead, I give you something dangerously close to what Grandma would have said. But listen to the voice of experience. I’ve coached hundreds of people from debtors to the wealthy, and the pattern is unmistakable. And it’s not just me singing this song. These same truths were taught by Benjamin Franklin hundreds of years earlier and reiterated by numerous authorities ever since. It’s timeless wisdom that has been proven over the centuries, and will also probably work for you (if you just put it into practice). In short, if you want wealth in this lifetime with the highest probability of success, then these two sentences contain the essential wisdom you need to know. Build wealth easily by following these two simple guidelines. Spend Less Than You Make and Invest the Difference Wisely The first sentence summarizes how to manage your personal finances so that you grow assets. It explains the importance of creating positive cash flow that you invest to produce additional positive cash flow. Notice how it’s composed of three separate yet connected ideas to form a single concept: Spend less Earn more Invest wisely There are endless variations on how to achieve this objective, but they all follow two simple themes: You can reduce spending immediately through various forms of frugality. You can increase your income through various strategies including changing jobs, getting a raise, or starting a business. In short, you must create a gap between how much you earn and how much you spend that results in savings to invest for growth and additional income. The twin themes of spending less and making more are not mutually exclusive, but they do require very different mindsets. Frugality is about living on less and requires self-discipline. For most people, there is a feeling of sacrifice when following this path, thus making it difficult to succeed. If that’s you, then frugality is a slow and difficult path to wealth because you will be in constant battle between lifestyle desires and financial freedom goals. For others, frugality is a pleasurable journey in simplification where fulfillment results from redirecting earned income toward financial freedom goals rather than squandering it on spending. It’s not uncommon for extreme frugalists to save 70% of income and achieve financial independence in less than 10 years, but it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. Another alternative is to raise the income side of the equation. The advantage to this approach is there is no theoretical limitation to how fast your wealth can grow because your earning capacity is unlimited. Many wealth gurus teach the income side of the equation as the “fast path” to wealth; however, if you don’t master the spending side of the equation, you still run a high risk of failure due to the all-too-common mistake of allowing spending to rise as fast as income. The greatest wealth builders focus on both sides of the equation together. They maximize savings by controlling spending while growing income at the same time. It’s the quickest, most certain path to increased savings for investment. Great wealth builders focus on both saving money and earning more. The third component to the equation – invest wisely – is also simple because everything you need to learn is available for free in the public domain. You don’t have to take investment seminars or build extraordinary expertise. There are two well proven paths: Paper Assets: Conventional buy and hold using low cost index funds and proven asset allocation models. Vanguard Funds offers you everything you need. Real Estate: Direct ownership of positive cash flow real estate in your local area. In summary, achieving financial freedom is really quite simple. Spend less than you make and invest the difference wisely. Rinse and repeat until the income from your investments exceeds your expenses. At that point you’re infinitely wealthy and financially independent. Want to know the secret to building wealth? It's a lot easier than you think - it just requires knowledge of two basic personal finance principles, and a plan on how to live by them. Get that plan here. With that said, the sad truth is few will achieve financial freedom despite the desirability of the goal and the simple path you must follow to achieve it. The reason is explained in the second sentence. Your Wealth Is Determined by Your Habits The reason so few people achieve wealth is because they don’t adopt habits that lead to wealth. As you already know, the formula is simple and fully proven. The only thing remaining is to take action with enough consistency to achieve the goal… and that’s where the problems occur. Here’s the formula for how this works: [(Small, Smart Choices) * (Consistency) * (Time)] = Wealth Procrastination is the single biggest wealth killer. You plan on getting around to it someday. You know what you should do but there is always some other priority. The kids need braces, the car needs repair, the kitchen needs remodeling. Action is where the rubber meets the road. It’s one thing to know what to do, and it’s something else entirely to get it done. That’s why habits are so critical. Habits are the reason postal workers become millionaires while lottery winners go broke. It doesn’t matter if you look at the writings of Benjamin Franklin from 250 years ago or Stanley and Danko’s bestseller The Millionaire Next Door. They all say essentially the same thing – the distinguishing characteristic of people who achieve wealth is they manage their money well. They have good money habits. They don’t earn the most. They aren’t the smartest. They don’t have any special training. They just have good money habits – brain dead simple. The reason good money habits are essential is actually scientific and results from the mathematics behind how money compounds to grow into wealth. Small changes done over long periods of time can create massive results. It’s an easy path to wealth. That’s why daily habits are so important. A daily habit of frugality saves small amounts every day that compound and grow over long periods of time to become substantial wealth. Try this Latte Factor calculator to prove it to yourself. A daily habit of increasing your earning capacity through training and education will add small amounts every day to your income potential. Small changes done over long periods of time can create massive wealth. Both of these daily habits will create an increasing spread between what you spend and what you earn, which will increase your wealth at an accelerating rate. This isn’t rocket science. It’s just daily habits dedicated toward a specific goal – building wealth. The habit causes the action which produces the result. It’s simple cause and effect. Habits are the easiest and simplest way for you to cross the bridge between how to build wealth using the simple formula above, and actually doing what it takes to achieve the goal. You don’t have to intellectualize the process or overcome massive obstacles. You don’t have to get ready to get ready. Instead, you just start today by adopting one habit that serves your wealth goals. Here are some potential starting points: Opt-in to your company 401(k) (if they offer it). Prepay a small amount on your mortgage. Find an unnecessary expense and eliminate it. Clean up clutter by selling unused assets (RV, boat, jewelry, etc.). Repair something instead of replacing it. Develop a niche expertise in your profession that commands a higher wage. Start learning about asset allocation or investment real estate. Just pick one habit and start today. Practice the habit until it becomes permanent, then pick another habit and do it again. Then another and another until you can see your wealth grow. Pick ONE wealth building habit to develop today to get started on your journey to financial freedom The greatest obstacle to building wealth is procrastination. Habits are the simplest way to overcome procrastination and get into immediate action. Habits reduce the entire wealth building process into bite-sized pieces that are easy for anyone to digest. The compounded effect of all these tiny actions over a lifetime becomes wealth. Want to know the secret to building wealth? It's a lot easier than you think - it just requires knowledge of two basic personal finance principles, and a plan on how to live by them. Get that plan here. Summary of How To Build Wealth The formula for wealth is simple: spend less than you make and invest the difference wisely. The mechanism to take action on the formula and produce results is equally simple: adopt wealth building habits. Here’s how it looks in a different format: [(Small, Smart Choices) * (Consistency) * (Time)] = Wealth The only question remaining is whether or not you will do what it takes. The only thing standing between you and wealth is the willingness to act on this timeless wisdom. Building wealth is simple. It doesn’t require luck, genius, or special connections. You don’t have to attend overpriced weekend financial seminars or learn the latest tricks and gimmicks sold by slick marketers. As John Bogle wisely stated, “The secret is there are no secrets.” The truth behind how to build wealth is public domain knowledge, simple to understand, and nobody is going to get rich selling it to you. In fact, it’s so simple it can be explained in just two sentences: Make more than you spend and invest the difference wisely. Develop simple daily habits that result in wealth accumulation.

I find the role evolving in two simultaneous directions as companies move away from the Wild West days of social media:  1. Seamless integration within existing functional areas: Social media expertise is getting integrated under the broader functional areas that it's helping make more efficient. For e.g. I have always been a part of our corporate communications team as I've helped define and run our blogging, microblogging, and outreach efforts. I find a lot of what I do now seamlessly integrated within our PR and Marketing infrastructure, over the years.  The same evolution holds true for other areas that social media has transformed irrevocably - Customer Service (ask Lionel Menchaca Jr. or Frank Eliason), Journalism (ask Huffingtonpost.com (website)), Global Marketing Consultants' Limited (ask Thomas Hoehn), etc.  In addition to my primary role in Public Relations and Web Marketing, I also interface with many of our other teams like customer service, internal culture (HR), business development, etc. when they have questions regarding social media best practices. Now, that element may disappear in the future as social media becomes more ubiquitous. I believe that's what Jack Benoff and Marcy Mcclelland-Massura are referring to in the above thread.  2. The emergence of an executive level social media strategist role: Kind of like what my good friends Frank Eliason (formerly at Comcast Products and Services and currently SVP of Social for Citigroup (company)) and Scott Monty (Head of social media at Ford Motor Company) do at their respective large organizations. Their cross-functional role helps define social media across the organization as it's integrated more closely with all functional areas, projects, etc.     And, this will become the career trajectory for social media expertise in much the same way a Marketing manager evolves into a VP of Marketing for e.g.  The challenge is that the ""social media strategist"" term has become a catch-all for so many diverse (in many cases ill-defined) roles that confuses the layman. Plus, companies themselves are slowly but surely learning how to integrate such expertise into their organization.  To recap, I see social media being integrated more closely into organizations (large and small) as they realize its undeniable benefits. And, in large organizations the need for an executive level social media strategist who defines the role across different functional areas will become the norm.

Social media has more impact on our daily lives than we can ever truly understand. There are so many significant and big advantages that come with social media when it comes to creating a brand for customers and during social media marketing.  Let me walk you through some reasons which make it safe to say that social media will be the future digital marketing hub. Changes in marketing style Since the inception of the Internet, people have changed their marketing styles with time, before the Internet people were used to using manpower, newspapers, billboards, mouth-to-mouth promotion and other traditional means to market their products and services. Then came the Internet and people moved to pop-up ads, then pay-per-click ads, then now since social media is so much a trend people have started seeing its potential. Time each and every person spend on social media On average each person spends almost 144 minutes or 2 hours and 24 minutes on social media scrolling through their feed. This time can be easily used to promote products and services using ad campaigns. Brand loyalty Having a social media presence for your brand is a necessity. With a social media presence comes the brand loyalty of customers towards the brand. Social media is a great platform because here people can relate to the product and with the brand and once that connection is established it is easier to sell them products and services. Social media influencer When was the last time you googled a product review, read the entire blog, and then actually made the purchase? Now tell me, when was the last time you saw your favourite social media celebrity using a product or service and thinking about buying it? The time difference between and the frequency give the answer. All the global brands use social media influencers to promote their service and products to their followers and targeted audience. Targeted audience Targeting an audience and running ad campaigns is far easier on social media platforms then it is on any other platform. In addition to that, since social media ads are shown in the form of posts, they do not irritate the users unlike pop up ads and pay per click ads. Looking for a digital marketing company If you are looking for a digital marketing company for your brand, business, product, or services then let me suggest a digital company.

Even though they are marketers, and not sales people, they cover a variety of roles as they chat to interested parties on your behalf. 2. A social media consultant makes your life easier. It’s true – a social media consultant not only helps you improve your business, generating leads, contacts etc, but also frees up your time so you can actually RELAX once you get off the clock. Handing over your social media strategy to a consultant is life-changing. If you don’t believe me, try it – even if it’s just for a month! Let go of trying to figure out what to post on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest etc. etc. 3. A social media consultant is your brand advocate. Imagine having someone else sing your praises, letting others know about your products and services, without spending extra on a PR agency. Your social media consultant will help you build long-term relationships, brand awareness and sustainable growth. They “become” you online and know your business very well so they can answer any question that might come up in their usual surroundings also. 4. A social media consultant helps you stay ahead of your competitors As your consultant will be online, analysing specific hashtags, seeing what others are saying about similar products and services to yours and answering any questions that people might have put out into social media, they can see clearly what your competitors are saying also. This can give you a strategic advantage. 5. A social media consultant is always online. Even in their “downtime” social media consultants can be found online! They love it so much they spend their spare time browsing social media sites for fun. Yes, technically they’re “off the clock” but that doesn’t mean that they’ll not bookmark something that would be of interest to your followers, or answer a question left by an inquisitive prospect. It’s all part of what makes a great social media consultant. There are many social media consultants out there, but not all of them are equal. Make sure that you find one that fits your needs and not just your budget.

Online marketing consists of anything you do to promote yourself, your products and services or business using the internet to reach people. The internet has grown to outpace and out-class nearly all other older methods of communication, meaning that every type of organisation from a freelancer to a non-profit organisation, to huge multi-nationals, can benefit from having a web presence. The internet is a cheap, low cost way to promote products and services, launch new Brands, promote an up and coming Artist and reach the biggest audience, just think of Facebook Lives – virtually no cost to set up and do and with the opportunity to reach a huge audience. The audience for internet marketing is not a niche audience. There is no “internet” demographic within an online marketing campaign. Anyone that uses internet marketing will continue to use it, it is not an isolated “one off” piece of activity as the cost of an internet marketing campaign is small compared to more traditional methods of advertising and has the potential to reach a very large audience. The number of people willing to spend money online is only growing. Because the Web is a diverse, interactive, multi-media space, it’s important to find the right balance, not every piece of promotion requires the use of all resources (and it would soak up too much time). It’s far better to be selective and the most successful marketers get better results through deciding which platform or type of communication will work best when launching or promoting a new product or service. The different components of Online Marketing: The website or blog forms the hub and social media platforms form the spokes. All efforts should be designed to drive traffic to your website. The objective is to set up a system, a process, a “consistency of effort” that will enable you to build a loyal tribe (following), engage them, educate them and encourage them to promote you and, or, buy products or services from you (or those you recommend) at some point. Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is getting tougher and tougher. There are only 10 slots available on page one of Google and they are generally dominated by the companies with big budgets; you used to be able to find good convertible traffic for “long tail keyword searches” but these days, although it’s good practice to ensure you have the right keywords, it’s difficult to rank on page one for organic searches. Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is the paid version of SEO, and this is where businesses of all sizes and budgets tend to spend their time, it’s particularly effective for the small business owner, e.g. Facebook advertising, where you can specify the amount you spend each day and turn it off and on. With over 1 billion accounts on Facebook and using the graph searches, you can easily tailor the target audience for your adverts (split test) to find out what’s converting best. The objective of both SEO and SEM is to drive traffic (prospects/leads) to product landing pages (which may be informative, educational or product purchase offers). Pay per click advertising (PPC) is similar to SEM and is where social networks allow you to create ads that integrate into their feeds, so you pay for clicks to your website. It’s like SEM but not limited to Google. Analysis of any data is crucial in order to judge what worked and where to concentrate spend in the future. Social platforms you can engage in today, include some of the most popular such as: Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, Snapchat, Tumblr, Google+, Youtube, Periscope, LinkedIn, Meerkat, Blab, Reddit, StumbleUpon. Content Marketing is very powerful. It encompasses blogging and video content. This content endures and you can build up a library of information and become known as an expert in your niche. Through education you can convert new audiences into interested followers and then encourage them to move over to become buyers. They will do this on the basis of “Like, Know and Trust”. Social Media Marketing is where you engage on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or LinkedIn and build relationships and then send them to your product and services landing pages. By giving them free information, showing your personality, displaying your products, demonstrating your authority, you can build a band of like-minded people who are interested in learning from you and following you. Affiliate marketing allows you to lower your risk by promoting a proven expert’s products and taking a commission for doing so. It is most effective where you have already built a loyal following and built a mailing list. It offers a low cost entry point to building an online business. Email marketing either to a targeted audience or general audience, is very powerful. Once you have got a person’s agreement that you can market to them, you can email them at any time, it’s a very powerful form of direct contact, providing education, information and asking them to buy when the time is right, this could be an offer for one of your own products or services or products you are promoting as an affiliate.

Because of brand power, you’ll find out through Google that the following companies are the best marketing consulting firms: Brafton (Marketing Consulting Services) and Bain & Company (Customer Strategy & Marketing). However, Marketing today is not the same as in the days of these legacy brands. Marketing has been shifting courses pretty fast because nowadays marketing is too reliant on algorithms and digital. And whether you like it or not, the marketing consulting businesses that do stand out due to brand power in today’s crazy competitive digital market, are NOT these brands. No offense. But don’t trust my word, check it for yourself. Nonetheless, these brands do have their place thanks to Brand power. But they’re likely not the best when it comes to knowing and understanding in depth the “openings” in the digital world, like SEO, Content Marketing, Conversion optimization etc. If you search for digital marketing on Google, do you get these two brands as result? No. Therefore, they might have better insights about overall marketing strategy, since they know information that others don’t because of their positioning in the market, as they tend to have access to high-level people that have the power to impact the whole market. As a consequence, these brands have access to privileged information that you’ll see much later on the news. But by that time, you are already late in terms of overall strategy. The truth is that when it comes to marketing consulting, you need both today: REQUIREMENT #1 - A smarter overall marketing strategy that positions your brand in the market of 6 months from nowREQUIREMENT #2 - A strong arsenal of digital skills like Tools, Tactics, Design etc, that make people remember your brand almost instantly because human attention is very scarce.CONCLUSION: The top marketing consulting firms are the ones that understand marketing in the Digital Era + are almost 100% certain of where the industry is going next + have very powerful marketing online. If, for example, the website of a marketing consulting firm doesn’t make you remember it, doesn’t provide a great experience, and doesn’t make you spend some time on it, then just ignore it. Because they’re likely not at the top of their game anymore. Overall marketing strategy alone is not enough. And strong digital skills alone is also not enough. Hope this helps, Take care!

This all depends on the type of business you've built and how aggressive you want to build it. Another thing to consider is that you want to automate as much as you can when it comes to your social media but don't just automate, you need authentic engagement as well and that only comes with somebody being on the platforms responding to your audience. Scheduling posts is the most important way of automating so that you can keep your social channels full of fresh content for your target audience. If you already have lots of content then outsourcing might make sense right away as they can start to work with your existing content and continue to build your audience for you. If you don't have a lot of content you may want to outsource someone to help you create it initially. When it comes to outsourcing, you still have to think of it as a long-term partnership.

I don't think I'd be quite happy selling burnt CD's, working as a janitor, recruiting, working in sales, working in real estate or for an investment fund, lead generation firm, entertainment company, in politics, at a discount membership, a nightlife company or even a bar.  I'd probably be happy with a clothing line, but that's another story.   With where I am today, I think I'm quite content with the changes I made in my life.

Among smaller places in Tamil Nadu - Madurai and two villages - Kilvelur and Koothanallur [spent about 10 years in these places]. A total of 7 schools and 3 Universities. The schools came in all forms - 3 Hindu, 2 Christian, 1 Muslim, 1 non-religious and 4 different boards of education. This forced me to learn a lot of different religions and adapt a lot.     2. I spent way too much time in school I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering, MS in Computer Science and an MBA. My research advisors during my MS program is one of the most noted figures in Computer Science and AI - Dr. Tim Finin. My thesis  on Multiagent Systems - Page on wordpress.com I did my MBA at the school that claims to be the world's best for entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship | Rankings | US News.  My Bachelors time was a productive one. I won a Honorable Mention at the 2002 Asia Finals of the prestigious ACM ICPC programming contest. Got a few International awards from the IEEE - Lance Stafford Larson Student Paper award and UPE award for academic excellence. The best moments came in when I got to meet the President of India thrice to talk about my research works - Why is Abdul Kalam widely loved and respected by everyone?  This conversation in the President's office is the one I will cherish for life. 3. Work My first internship was an opportunity to work at the prestigious Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore as a student research fellow in the summer of 2004. In 2005, I did an internship at a defense technologies startup in Washington DC. I then worked close to 4 years at Microsoft Redmond. I was a developer for Windows 7 and I have also worked in test for Windows Phone 7. Inbetween that was a period spent in Live Labs - the cutting edge futuristic incubation centre. By my mid 20s, I realized that I was having way too much fun and I forgot my core goals. I had frequent vacations, a nice sports car and rented a lake front house.  I decided to realize my fundamental ambition of becoming an entrepreneur. My colleague and I wanted to build financial tools for investors. Since US had no startup visa, we had to move back to India. But, in India we could not find the customers for our businesses as our target customers were in the US. To make ends meet, I ran a consulting business doing the following things Analyzing investment opportunities for high networth individuals through a premium newsletter program.Built a virtual university - NalandaU - it is not making any revenues either.Started a magazine to connect Indian entrepreneurs: http://theagni.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/agnimagazine-web.pdf Ran social media and inbound marketing campaigns for small businesses.Developing inbound marketing strategies for politicians.Besides running my business, I also got a lot of chance to travel around, met a variety of entrepreneurs, got married to a girl I loved and spent a lot of time writing. I have a few uncompleted novels now, and hopefully will start finishing them sometime. The virtual university (NalandaU) also forced me to understand a wide variety of topics.  4. Entrepreneurship 2 In 2013, my startup was a finalist in the prestigious Y Combinator selection. We had a great interview with my icon Paul Graham, but we finally didn't get through. But, we got into another good start accelerator who provided us the seed funding (Startups In The Fastlane: Jumpstart Foundry Startup ZingFin). The startup was about analyzing social media sentiments to predict stock market movements.  We got some good press: Does Social Media Affect Capital Markets? Babson MBAs Use Social Media to Predict Moves in the Stock Market The power of Carl Icahn's Apple tweet bodes well for Zingfin.comPain-Saving Insights From Seven Promising Startups At that time, somehow things didnt work and we pivoted to create another venture - belimitless.co.

Look, I’d love to tell you it’s as easy as these scammers want you to believe it is….Hell! I’ll be the first one to jump onto a profitable opportunity! But from being a successful marketer, copywriter and marketing consultant to all kinds of businesses and professionals myself for almost 30 years now… I can honestly tell you… It’s not primarily the platform that’ll make you successful as a marketer. It’s something much deeper then that. It’s something that you must figure out, long before you even think about what platform you’ll market on. You see, there’s NO MAGIC in using social media platforms to market products or services. Social media is just a delivery system to get your message out to your ideal customers (market). Just like a stage is part of the delivery system for a rock band, DJ, public speaker, or politician, so is social media just a way to get a your marketing content out. Nothin’ more. Nothin’ less. Is it the stage, which makes a rock bands, DJ, public speakers and whatnot effective? Of course not. What’s for more important in terms of making money with your marketing then the platform you’re on is… …WHAT you say and WHO you say it too! Is the penny droppin’ at this point? Everybody can post stuff on social media. Shit….There’s people on Insta or FaceBook, who’re doing nothing else but posting pics of cats on skateboards or some other inane stuff like that. But that doesn’t mean that, these people are making boatloads of money with their social media. Doesn’t need a genius to figure that out. So, if you want to actually make money with your marketing and magnetically attract customers, clients, patience…to your business…. You need to first figure out, what it is that your customers really want or really want to avoid. And then you need to figure out, what combination of words and images they respond best to and what exact message evokes emotions and makes them buy your products. If you don’t know WHAT to say, HOW to say it, and WHO to say it to, you’re just wasting valuable time and money. So, don’t believe the hype. Learn & apply tried, tested and proven marketing fundamentals and watch your bank account rise like yeast while you’re attracting customers to you. No more “cold calling”, “hard selling” and feeling stressed out about not knowing, where the next customer will come from. Good luck.

This job is given so much weight by PR and marketing departments of companies, especially so when the target demographic is web-savvy and highly social. There are many types of interactions that customers have with a company throughout their journey, and the reality is that majority of these will probably happen over Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Most of these will revolve around: Getting to know your brand – the introductory phase. Success in this stage will depend on the content they find on your social accounts.Supporting your brand – this is characterized by liking, retweeting, promoting, etc. At this point, the customer is providing you the best kind of marketing service: genuine and free endorsement.Complaining – this is the part we all dread. The reputational damage that a negative post on social media can do to your brand cannot be measured, and it will surely haunt you for a long time. We have too many case studies of social media disasters that warn us about the precariousness of public opinion on social channels.Maximizing social touchpoints requires the correct use of data for hyperpersonalization. This is what Tenfold advocates for and discusses in our free ebook, The Impact and Opportunities of Account-based Marketing. The concept of targeted advertising intersects at this point, where artificial intelligence (AI) will decide what, where, how, and when to show your ad to a target customer. Facebook and Google already use this, and they offer this kind of service to their business clients. Of course, AI will not work if you don’t have the right data.

With the rise of “trolling culture”, online nationalism, increased bot activity, increased environmental concerns, sustainability concerns, human rights, gender equality concerns, and other concerns that cannot be listed here, it is more important than ever to only say the correct things online. The social media market is bigger than ever before. Over 45 million people in the UK are on various social media platforms, that’s 66 percent of the population. With such a big audience, it’s important to have the best social media agency by your side. Rank with the best Social Media Agencies in the U.K : The list at  http://topseos.com  is divided into leaders, top performers, and contenders. The data used to classify companies is tabulated right there. The leaders are on top of the field, consistently scoring highly in every part examined. Top performers are missing one or two things to tie everything together and make an appearance on the leaderboard. Contenders lack a few things and need to upgrade several areas of their company. The question now is, why were they chosen? What makes them stand out from the rest? To answer these questions, here’s the criterion used: Timeliness: A good social media agency should have quick response times. Two-way communication between the client and the agency is absolutely essential for this to happen. Communications with live social media users should be done with a sense of agency. Brand management: The social media agency should respect the brand and work to maintain the image while creating and managing social media profiles. They should respect the strict standards most businesses have for the type of message and aesthetics attached to brand names. Consultation: A social media agency should bring in expert advice and insight into the complex world of social media. They should consult the client on ways to handle events and issues on social media. This is one of the multiple ways social media agencies provide value to their clients. Methodology: These are approaches taken by the social media agency to provide consistently effective social media campaigns. How the social media agency manages multiple clients also factors in their methodology. Reach: The main objective of social media marketing is to extend the brand as far as possible to relevant audiences. This analysis is done to ensure that the agencies ranked highly on the list are capable of consistently reaching large audiences with their message. With all this in mind, you can easily make your choice on who to pick. The UK has a large audience of savvy social media users. It is paramount that you make the best choice for your particular application. Social media campaigns can make or break the launch or long term future of a business. A good social media company will make your stand out to potential new customers. Knowing your customers on an intimate level but not coming off as creepy will add value to the business and the customer. Customers can even make recommendations on future improvements to products and services through social media. The possibilities of social media interaction are only limited by imagination.

The total number of Social Media users has been growing every year, and they are expected to keep increasing. Targeting this audience through Social Media has become one of the essential aspects of Digital Marketing. 90% of businesses that do Social Media Marketing have observed a marked increase in their business exposure.Let’s take an example of the automobile sector. The ‘The Drive to Decide 2018’ report by Google and Kantar TNS, which keeps track of customers’ car research and purchase journey, highlights a considerable shift in consumer behaviour.Almost 89 per cent of auto sales in India were digitally influenced in 2018, up from 74 per cent the previous year. Companies like Volkswagen, TATA, Maruti, Nissan, Toyota, Renault, Audi, and BMW have seen a significant increase in sales since they started leveraging the power of social media.We can also take a look at Swiggy. It was at the top of its social media game during IPL 2019. At the beginning of the T20 cricket season, it launched “Match Day Mania,” a 51-day long food festival that gave discounts across 13000+ restaurant partners. The campaign was promoted across all Social Media platforms.  The brand saw a significant increase in orders and new user acquisitions during the IPL season. Swiggy shared that with CSK winning the trophy, Chennai saw the highest growth in orders during IPL with a jump of 44% followed closely by Pune (40%) and Delhi (37%). Kings XI Punjab had a good season, and this increased the sales in the city of Chandigarh, with over 100% increase in orders for Punjabi dishes like Kadai Paneer, Dal Makhni and Butter Nan. What we can take away from these examples is that Social Media is a minefield for lead generation as well as customer acquisition and there are plenty of benefits of marketing on social media.

Loox is an easy to use Shopify app, that helps you collect product reviews with photos from your customers. These awesome reviews with photos, can be easily shared on social, so that other consumers see them. They are very persuasive, because they show real people, who were happy with your product. So you can even ask your family and friends to purchase something from your shop and be the first to create reviews, share those on Facebook and Pinterest with one click and watch it grow.

Fiverr is a marketplace for freelancers, doing gigs starting at $5. Most of the gigs are more expensive, but still very affordable.

The problem is, Amazon has opened up their platform allowing third parties to sell there, but they do not want to be used as a way of sending traffic to other websites (taking business away from them). It is against Amazon terms of service to include marketing materials such as brochures etc. when you ship a customer their order. Technically you can try doing this anyway, hoping no customer will complain or mention it in a review, hoping that Amazon will not do a test order (I am unsure if this happens but you never know), and hoping a competitor seller on Amazon does not find out and complain so that Amazon gives you the boot. You run the risk of having your account shut down by doing this, so it depends on your comfort level. What I would do is include an invoice with each order including your contact information and logo, and in that contact information include the URL. A small company I work with has not run into problems with that (yet.) If possible, I would suggest making your username on Amazon your website name. For example, if your username is “mystore”, if a customer wanted to find you they would probably try visiting mystore .com. In your about us, keep mentioning mystore so customers get to know your brand’s name. An email list for a newsletter is not a bad idea, but technically it should be opt-in (for spam laws). If you spam a customer and they get angry and complain to Amazon that could risk your account too. I would avoid doing this through Amazon’s messaging system but maybe after you ship their order you can email them saying did you get your order ok, how is everything, by the way do you want to join our newsletter for news, information, discounts, and contests. Disclaimer: I can’t remember offhand if this was addressed in Amazon’s TOS so you may want to check that! I understand why you would want to use Amazon as a way to send customers to your site, gaining site traffic and saving Amazon fees, but having sales in both places can be an advantage. If your Amazon account keeps running, it can be a continuous source of new customers since many people search for a product there first and many people trust Amazon’s system over a random website. It can also be good extra exposure for your brand if your Amazon store or listing comes up in a Google search (especially over anything negative). My advice is to not get greedy and obey Amazon’s TOS and once a customer is aware of you and has a good experience they may just go directly to your website next time.

You can use it for social customer care, social media monitoring, competitive analytics, reporting and publishing. The tool offers many features, I’ll elaborate on the 3 of them. 1. Social media inbox It’s where you can watch and answer all the content which flows through your social media accounts (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, Google+, LinkedIn). You can monitor and react to all the incoming mentions, messages, comments, etc. If you decide that some content is irrelevant, you can hide, archive or delete it - although it will never be truly gone and you can always come back to it. Having all of that content in one place is definitely a huge time saver. In case you need any help, you can also share the inbox with others and work as a team.  Moreover, you can flag the content, add a note to it or forward it to others to consult. 2. Automatic moderation If you want to answer your customers’ requests instantaneously, the tool offers automatic moderation. I know what you’re thinking - chatbots with irrelevant, repetitive answers. Well, it’s all about balance between a person and a chatbot - still, the tool can help you answer to anyone in need and solve their issues in a smart, authentic way. You can set up automated replies so that they address specific words or phrases, so that the real person can have some spare time to make more strategic decisions, and let the chatbot handle all the messages:  If you know the most frequently asked questions, you can set up “moderation rules” and define specific replies. You can redirect your customers to a relevant article, provide them with adequate information or even forward the customers’ messages directly to your team by turning on automatic email notifications.  3. Analytics The tool also offers in-depth analytics on any page or profile on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Google+ allowing you to track the effectiveness of your or your competitors’ marketing efforts. All of that can later be jammed into automatically generated reports.",2021-03-05T16:08:20.645Z,"Which social media tools every marketer should use in the year 2019? ",Quora
