You need to learn every part of the shopify and marketing channels. Some shopify experts show only their winning campaigns. They don't tell you the reality. Because finding good product and marketing it online is not like before. Here are my suggestions to become expert. First figure out your niche. If you can find a good niche and good product you can win easily. Finding niche is so easy. You can use Facebook Audience insights to figure out the audience size. And also be unique and different when figuring out the niche.Second I wanna tell you most is try to give more to the customer than expecting money from them. If you can give some quality stuff and better experience. You can easily get good amount of sale. Don't expect return first. You try to improve landing page experience. And also make them feel you're taking care of them so much. Reply to their email, comments and engage with them. Offer some discounts etc.,Most people struggling about Facebook ads and losing their money. But the actual thing is you need to understand Facebook is just a advertising platform. People come to Facebook entertain themselves not to buy. So you need to create a creative video or inage for your ad. Test multiple different types. And you should use the best working one. And also you should understand that you cannot spend 1000$ in a day and make 5000$ as you think. It takes lot pf time to figure out. Instead of finding winning product that sell 1000 product every day. You can find 10 product that sell 100 product each every day.Once you find the strategy that works for you. You can do it for long run and make some good amount of money. And I also again tell you. People expect some good amount of value from you. So you need to give them best. You can use email marketing or remarketing as others do and increase your presence. Branding your store instead of selling products give you high profit.You need to be updated with others , I mean you should spy them and find what they do for the success and also you should know their strategy and you need to do better than them.If you're getting started means. I suggest you to find a good mentor and learn from him. You should be clear finding your mentor because there's a lot of fake guru they haven't run a shopify before.",2021-03-05T12:31:36.573Z,"How can I join the Shopify Experts platform since all my clients come already with a store created?

Longer answer: First separate the platform from the business model. Many people equate Shopify with drop shipping due to Shopify’s low barrier to entry both in terms of cost and technical knowledge. It’s very easy to use. It is also easy to list products from AliExpress on Shopify (more on this later). There are other platforms however that would perform equally well as a base for a drop shipping business such as BigCommerce, Magento or Wordpress with WooCommerce. Now to using the drop shipping business model to generate enough net profit to provide a comfortable living wage. Let’s assume that your target living “wage” is $10K per month (that would be very comfortable for alot of people). I’m going to rough out how you would get to this amount using two different drop shipping methods that can work below. I’ve been lucky enough to one on one coach over 200 drop ship business owners, I make the following observations based on this; Here’s where people go wrong with drop shipping and ultimately why so many people don’t find success with drop shipping; They believe it’s easy (this myth is peddled by a number of less than scrupulous online courses)They believe that you don’t need capital to be successfulThey don’t understand that they are really running a marketing businessThey either don’t or can’t be bothered to learn how to apply and master the marketing techniques that are a best fit for the products they want to sellThey don’t know how to pick the right products to sell using a drop shipping modelBroadly speaking here is what you need to master to reach $10K per month in net profit using drop shipping; Product and niche (market) selectionIntermediate web design (could be outsourced)Basic sales copywritingCustomer service (could be outsourced)How to pick the right marketing channels for your products (e.g. Google Adwords, Facebook Ads, Instagram)How to generate profitable sales using which ever marketing channels you pick from number 5.If you are choosing to produce most of your initial website traffic using paid traffic sources like Google Adwords or Facebook Ads then you should have a small amount of start up capital (e.g $3K - $5K). It is possible to do it with none but I have seen that done successfully very rarely.I would have to stress points 5 and 6, this is where most people fall down. If you want to market your products using Facebook Ads for example you need to develop strong knowledge in how to successfully run Facebook Ads. If you don’t you will fail. Now here’s two models of drop shipping that can be used successfully in 2017. Here’s an overview; High Value Dropshipping using local suppliers This method involves identifying a specific niche market and set of products in the country you want to sell in. Generally you would aim for products that retail for $500 USD or more. My example could be that I want to sell wine fridges (also known as wine coolers) to wine lovers in the United States. Here’s an example of such a product  While there are cheap wine fridges the average is probably around $1000 USD. I would source my products from suppliers of wine fridges based in the US. My target market would only be wine lovers based in the US. I would market these products using a combination of Google Adwords, Facebook, organic traffic (SEO) and email. If I know what I am doing I should be able to generate sales at cost of $50 or less (this includes platform and transaction fees). The average gross profit margin for this type of drop shipping is 30%. So if I sell at $1000 I will be buying the product at $700. I then minus my $50 cost of sale and I am left with $250. This equation may vary depending on whether you are offering free shipping or not. So if I can make $250 per sale, to reach $10K per month I need to sell 40 wine fridges or about 1.3 per day. Not that hard. Keep in mind also that wine fridges can retail for up to $3K+ so if I sell a couple at that price point I need to sell even less per month. I personally use this model and I have seen many others do it successfully. I’ve also seen a lot of people fail at it. Low Value Dropshipping The second method of drop shipping that could generate $10K in your pocket per month is low value dropshipping. This is the method that most people are talking about at the moment and most people equate with Shopify and drop shipping. In this method you are selecting products in the impulse buy zone. Maybe $20 - $40 USD. A price point that people don’t need to think to hard about. The idea is to source those products at a very low price so that your profit margin is much higher. To achieve this most people turn to manufacturers in China via AliExpress. I mentioned earlier that Shopify is popular with people operating this model. This is because it is extremely easy to list products from AliExpress to your Shopify store using an app called Oberlo. In this model you might be buying a product for $4USD and selling it for $25USD with free shipping from China to your customer. So your goal here is to acquire customers at a price that leaves you a profit from the margin of $21USD.  I might sell something like these little hip bags. I would go through a similar process as with high value drop shipping. Identify a target audience and market products to them based on their interest. There are four things that are particularly crucial to making this model of drop shipping successful; Identifying your target audience and their interests.Picking the right product to suit your identified target audience. Many products are duds from a quality perspective and many are already being flogged to death.Being able to acquire traffic at the right price. It is most common to use Facebook/Instagram to market you products. You can only find success if you properly understand how to use these platforms. This takes time, practice and a little bit of money.Having upsells to squeeze more money out of each customer. This could be onsite or via email.In this example I should be able to walk away from each sale with at least $8 net profit. If I was selling just this one item I would have to sell 1250 per month to get to my $10K profit. Sounds like a lot but I wouldn’t just be selling this one product. I would have a range of upsells and other products to double or triple the value of many orders. What I’ve outlined above are very broad and limited explanations. A lot more goes into making either model of drop shipping successful. The crux is however that drop shipping can work and quite well. But like every business model more people will fail than succeed. Many people at the moment like to prattle on that “drop shipping is dead”. They are wrong. I will clarify that as well as coaching people who run drop shipping businesses I also have run and sold my own drop shipping businesses for the last 4 years. I hope this helps.",2021-03-05T12:33:00.507Z,"Would a Shopify expert or partner consider a bot builder company for partnership? ",Quora

The problem is, your competitors want to get a leg up on you too—if you want a better site than them, you need to hire shopify experts. Shopify’s own Experts Directory is a good place to start, but it gives a pretty limited window into the opportunities available. What do you do? Well, you know the old saying: you can have it fast, cheap or good but you can’t have all three. Start weighing up what’s more important to you: Fast: you need your site up yesterday. Your competitor already has the lead, and you need to get yourself moving as soon as possible. Often here, you want to look at teams with offices spread over multiple time zones: an international company can have its Shopify developers work in shifts, to get your storefront up as quickly as possible.Cheap: you’re on a budget. You’re a smart businessman, and you know smart business is about knowing where to spend and where to save. Again, it’s good to look internationally: outsourcing is a great way to save those extra pennies.Good: you’re willing to pay extra for quality. You want a boutique experience that will make your customers feel like kings. A quality UX is one of the hardest things to find, and requires real Shopify experts to pull off.Personally, when I need a Shopify developer, I go to CodeClouds. They’re a rare breed: fast, cheap and good. Most other developers wash their hands with a site as soon as they’re done with it, but their team of Shopify experts offered me support, maintenance and updates that keep my storefront on the bleeding edge.

Damien Defranco Well you can start a dropshipping business and turn it into a multi-million dollar business with just the cost of a domain ($15). Most dropshippers today build up their site with anywhere between $300–500 budget. So having a $2000 budget puts you at an advantage to others. But most people also fail. Dropshipping stores in general have a massive fail rate. 29/30 will not profit within 6 months. Most people quit. It’s very possible to make it in dropshipping, if you are willing to put in the time and passion needed for it.

Most dropshippers today build up their site with anywhere between $300–500 budget. So having a $2000 budget puts you at an advantage to others. But most people also fail. Dropshipping stores in general have a massive fail rate. 29/30 will not profit within 6 months. Most people quit. It’s very possible to make it in dropshipping, if you are willing to put in the time and passion needed for it. The advantage you get is that you have $2000 to put towards paid advertising which can make or break you. $2000 can go a long ways to advertising 3–4 products using Instagram Influencer Marketing and Facebook Re-Targeting ads. I would spend about 4–6 months learning about Instagram Influencer Marketing and Facebook Ads before jumping into it. I’ve seen people pay $2000 on ads and generate 0 sales. If you don’t know what you are doing, you are setting yourself up for failure. Another option is to use that money to teach yourself, first hand how to market. $2000 should be enough if spread thinly for you to get some experience in Ads and learn targeting, and the various methods of Facebook Advertising. But then you’ll need to come up with more money once you’re confident enough in your abilities to put it use. During all this, you can still start your store. There are many free methods of advertising you can do to start building up your content, SEO, and brand trust. Post on Facebok, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest of your own 2–3 times a day, each and every day consistently. You can write a blog post each and every day. This will slowly build up your brand while you figure out the paid advertising of things. The other option is hiring a marketing expert. But even some of them fail, and you’d be spending $800–900 in service costs and only have $1100–1200 left for actual Advertising content. And that’s for an amateur marketer. Professional marketers who have more experience and better chance of making you sales easily cost $3000–4000 a month or more in service fees. But you’ll want to be spending $12,000 or more in Ads to be worth it for them. Finally, you can hire a coach. Someone to teach you how to spend that $2000 on ads. Much better than learning it yourself. You’ll probably pay them $400–800 in coaching fees and use that $1200 on ads, but you’ll have learned more, learned faster than doing it by yourself, you probably will generate sales too using a coach where you might not doing it by yourself.

Just because you're excited about a hot new product doesn't necessarily mean that there will be other people out there in sufficient numbers who share your excitement. Second, you have to drive the right traffic. In other words, you have to know where people who are interested in your product hang out online and get their eyeballs to your shop. This is easier said than done. A lot of people think that you just need to slap on an ad at Facebook and that's that, No, You have to know their interests. You have to psychologically profile them, you have to understand how their minds work to get to where they are on Facebook. That's how it works. Finally, and most importantly, you need to have the right product descriptions. It breaks my heart to tell you this but a lot of people who are able to finally figure out how Facebook works and gets one penny clicks. from American consumers end up dropping the ball. Why? They master Facebook, but they screw up when it comes to their Shopify store. Now from the looks of it, it seems that they did everything right. They have the right pictures. The online store seems to be set up properly, everything's formatted well. There's something missing. The product descriptions are copied and pasted from the manufacturer. In other words, it says if they found a fishing spot where fish are just jumping out of the water and ready to bite anything, but they drop their line with a hook that has the wrong bait. It is no surprise that these Shopify store owners fail to make the kind of money they could be making. They drop the ball where it matters most. They screwed up their product descriptions. Thankfully, you don't have to commit this error. You can put in the time, effort and energy to write product descriptions to work. You need to get into the minds of your target audience members and really appeal to their needs. This takes months. If you're a lousy writer to begin with it can even take years. Thankfully, there is a shortcut. You can hire expert product description writers who have a track record of success like Gene Eugenio to write solid product descriptions for you. The few pennies that you pay expert writers are going to be pale in comparison to the profit you could be making because you figured out how to play the game the right way.",2021-03-05T12:42:49.674Z,"Why did Shopify stop accepting applications for experts?

Shopify has all of the structures you need to start your business. Shopify is packed with tools to launch a website in minutes, and you don't have to be concern about self-hosting or buying a domain name from a third party. In that regard, you could call it the flawless out-of-the-box solution built with pricing plans this applies to both small starter businesses and businesses that bring in millions of dollars in sales. Step 1: Register with Shopify The first step in creating your Shopify store, which is also the easiest. To use Shopify, you just need to register. Navigate to the Shopify website and click the 'Get Started Now' button. Enter your desired e-mail address, your password, and your shop name. Remember that you need to choose an available name for your shop; otherwise, Shopify won't allow you to buy the domain. After you click Next, let Shopify know about yourself by indicating how much you intend to sell and if you are already selling. Click the 'Go to My Shop' button when you're done. You will then be asked in which industry you want to operate your online shop. If you do not want to select an industry, click on 'Skip'. On the following page, you will be asked to enter personal information such as your name, address, and phone number, all of which are used to configure currencies and tax rates. Step 2: Add Items to your Shopify store. Once you've properly registered with Shopify, the software will take you straight to the administration screen of your new website. This is where you can start customizing your store and uploading products for your customers to flip through. If you go to your Shopify backend, it shows a nice step-by-step process on how to fully set up your shop. The first button asks you to add a product. It is recommended that you start with this. You can enter details such as title, description, price, and supplier and complete the product page as you wish. Make sure you save the product in the end. It makes sense to choose images that appeal to your target audience in order to increase sales opportunities. Don't make the mistake of underestimating the importance of the visual design of your website. You can also put together collections or product groups according to your individual needs. For example, if you run a clothing website, you could set up a page dedicated specifically to men's clothing or specifically to shoes and accessories. With Shopify, you can ensure that the same products appear in several different collections, making it easier than ever for your customers to find the items they want. When you add a collection to your Shopify store, you can choose how you want the products to appear on your page. For example, you can have products that meet certain criteria automatically added to your shop. Step 3: Customize your Shopify website. Go back to the administration screen and select the 'Customize Your Website' button. In this section, you will be asked to customize everything from logos to colors. This takes a little tinkering, but the main part that you want to focus on is the link that prompts you to visit the theme store. This is where you can browse through the hundreds of themes in Shopify to make your website look great. While free themes are great, premium themes can be very engaging. Premium themes come with additional modifications. So, if you want to dive into the smallest details of what your website looks like, then it might be a good idea to pay a little extra for a professional theme. You will find that you can make a ton of customizations to the look and feel of your website when you access the CSS and HTML aspects of the theme. Some of the things you can change about your Shopify theme: · Select fonts · Set the color scheme · Products that appear on the page · Related Element Functionality · Upload homepage slider slides · Upload logos There are plenty of Shopify experts out there who specialize in product descriptions, Shopify themes, email marketing, and much more. You can use the Shopify expert community for almost anything. Step 4: Set up your domain with Shopify. After you've chosen your template and designed your website the way you want, it's time to choose a domain to go live with your website. Go back to the dashboard and click 'Add Domain Now'. You will be asked whether you want to transfer a domain or register a new domain. Select the domain you want and follow the steps to purchase. You'll also need to specify which Shopify payment method you want to proceed with. You can either buy a domain from Shopify and have it added directly to your store, or you can buy your domain name elsewhere and add it to Shopify - it's entirely up to you. However, you will need to update your DNS records if you want to upload an existing name. After activation, your website can be accessed under your chosen domain. Step 5: Activate your payment methods. Click the tab to the left of the dashboard labeled Payments. In this section, you can choose from dozens of payment methods such as Stripe and Authorize..net. Shopify also has its own payment method - Shopify Payments, which is very easy to implement. Follow the steps to activate your payment method. This enables you to accept payments and deposit them into an account. Step 6: Check last shop information When you are in the main section of your Shopify website, make sure that the following information is complete: · General Information: Leave all of your information in the settings section completely filled in, including your billing information and legal details. · Taxes: Make sure the box next to “Calculate Taxes” is checked in the Variants section of your website to help you with your bookkeeping. · Shipping: You need to click the 'Shipping Required' option next to the products so you know which products require additional postage and packaging. Remember to either choose a weight-based shipping method or something that will help you sell as many products as possible. Creating a business with Shopify is relatively easy and inexpensive. In addition, there are verified Shopify partners who can help you with the setup, individual adjustments, and optimization of your Shopify business. Creating an online shop with Shopify is so simple that anyone can start their own online shop. In my opinion, Shopify is one of the best for a company that is just starting out with an online store.

So if you own a business and let us consider for the moment, a small business that has limited product variation and counts, it is one of the preferred ways in today's date to proceed with a simple Shopify store. The User-Interface and experience that this SaaS-based platform provides are very handy and you won't find too much trouble understanding the knick and tricks on how to basically use the platform and set up a good-to-go store. The core idea as on why this platform was built would clear the fact that it was meant to provide the various merchants and businesses with a place where they can build their online presence and sell their products and services online. Considering the merchants and business owners to be a part of their end users, they created a platform that is easy to setup and use. Thus, Shopify provides benefits to all its users alike. So if you are an amateur or newbie looking for ways to establish your store online, Shopify is one of the easiest possible ways on how to do it so. BUT, these are the facts that weigh up more for the asked question, where more emphasis is on the fact that whether one can USE Shopify for his/her store set up without any need of web developer skills. So why is there a need for web development skills to run a store on Shopify? Before we put up a valid answer to this, let us look at some related facts first! 1. Shopify has nearly 800,000+ merchants and this number is on a constant rise!  2. The best way to take advantage of technology is to use technology itself!  The very first factor puts up enough emphasis on the fact that if you really need to make a difference in the market, you will have to try something different. The only thing that exists here is to make good leverage of technology for doing so.  Fortunately, there are a variety of technological benefits that Shopify provides by itself such as custom themes, mobile application creation for your store and various other extensions to enhance your store applicability for users. And in order to make a feasible and workable impact of the use of Shopify, you will need to hire an expert Shopify developer to do make use of all these benefits. To create an online presence that replicated your business, you will need to have a proper store developed from an expert and for that, you would need to hire an expert. As a business owner, if you have this strong feeling that going online can be helpful for your business, the benefits of hiring an expert Shopify developer are endless. You can customize the look of your store - from the visual design to the back-end extensions. You can connect a variety of your brick and mortar store elements with your online store! Moreover, this all can come to you at a price that is cheaper than buying the actual elements from Shopify itself.   To conclude it all, if you are talking about 'using' Shopify for your store, you wouldn't be needing any high-end software development skills, but if you are seeking to make an impact with it, you might want to hire an expert Shopify developer in order to get your website developed.

You need to learn every part of the shopify and marketing channels. Some shopify experts show only their winning campaigns. They don't tell you the reality. Because finding good product and marketing it online is not like before. Here are my suggestions to become expert. First figure out your niche. If you can find a good niche and good product you can win easily. Finding niche is so easy. You can use Facebook Audience insights to figure out the audience size. And also be unique and different when figuring out the niche.Second I wanna tell you most is try to give more to the customer than expecting money from them. If you can give some quality stuff and better experience. You can easily get good amount of sale. Don't expect return first. You try to improve landing page experience. And also make them feel you're taking care of them so much. Reply to their email, comments and engage with them. Offer some discounts etc.,Most people struggling about Facebook ads and losing their money. But the actual thing is you need to understand Facebook is just a advertising platform. People come to Facebook entertain themselves not to buy. So you need to create a creative video or inage for your ad. Test multiple different types. And you should use the best working one. And also you should understand that you cannot spend 1000$ in a day and make 5000$ as you think. It takes lot pf time to figure out. Instead of finding winning product that sell 1000 product every day. You can find 10 product that sell 100 product each every day.Once you find the strategy that works for you. You can do it for long run and make some good amount of money. And I also again tell you. People expect some good amount of value from you. So you need to give them best. You can use email marketing or remarketing as others do and increase your presence. Branding your store instead of selling products give you high profit.You need to be updated with others , I mean you should spy them and find what they do for the success and also you should know their strategy and you need to do better than them.If you're getting started means. I suggest you to find a good mentor and learn from him. You should be clear finding your mentor because there's a lot of fake guru they haven't run a shopify before.

The problem is, your competitors want to get a leg up on you too—if you want a better site than them, you need to hire shopify experts. Shopify’s own Experts Directory is a good place to start, but it gives a pretty limited window into the opportunities available. What do you do? Well, you know the old saying: you can have it fast, cheap or good but you can’t have all three. Start weighing up what’s more important to you: Fast: you need your site up yesterday. Your competitor already has the lead, and you need to get yourself moving as soon as possible. Often here, you want to look at teams with offices spread over multiple time zones: an international company can have its Shopify developers work in shifts, to get your storefront up as quickly as possible.Cheap: you’re on a budget. You’re a smart businessman, and you know smart business is about knowing where to spend and where to save. Again, it’s good to look internationally: outsourcing is a great way to save those extra pennies.Good: you’re willing to pay extra for quality. You want a boutique experience that will make your customers feel like kings. A quality UX is one of the hardest things to find, and requires real Shopify experts to pull off.Personally, when I need a Shopify developer, I go to CodeClouds. They’re a rare breed: fast, cheap and good. Most other developers wash their hands with a site as soon as they’re done with it, but their team of Shopify experts offered me support, maintenance and updates that keep my storefront on the bleeding edge. Their subscription billing model let me choose the deal that was right for me. Their company is based in India but has offices in the US, Australia and New Zealand that let you get the best of both worlds. It took me a long time to find the Shopify developer that was right for me, but it was definitely worth it in the end.",2021-03-05T12:19:30.415Z,"Who is the best Shopify expert? ",Quora
