The ability to put a high-quality camera in the sky and capture stunning aerial photographs of the landscape below is extremely compelling, and the results can be out of this world. In this article, you’ll discover eight tips which will help you understand the practical, safety and legal considerations, which equipment you’ll need, where to go to get vital training and certification (if you plan to work commercially) and show you breathtaking examples of drone photography. drone photography 11 practice 1. Equipment: What You’ll Need For Drone Photography Drone photography equipment ranges from off-the-shelf solutions which have everything you need to take aerial photos and video footage, through to individual components you can purchase and assemble to create a very unique and personal solution. Now, let’s look at the most important components used in drone photography. The Drone A drone is a flying device with multiple propellors which allows it to fly around and hover in one spot. Drones vary greatly in size. There are tiny plastic toys for indoor use. You can buy larger, drones with integrated gimbals and cameras for outdoor use. There are also professional, large, carbon-fibre drones with retractable legs and longer flight times. These offer serious performance and the best drone photography results. A Learner Drone A good learner drone that won’t break the bank is the SYMA X5C-1 RC Quadcopter. Priced at just under $60 it comes with a proper transmitter rather than the smaller, toy-like transmitters found on other cheap models, and includes many spare parts. It can be used indoors, if you have enough room, but also outdoors in light winds. The camera isn’t its strong point, but as a cheap way to learn the basics of drone flight, this is a good option. drone photography 23 Syma Intermediate Drones If you want a drone with an integrated gimbal and camera which is capable of more professional results, then look at the range of drones from DJI. At the budget end of the spectrum you have the $549 DJI Spark which includes a camera capable of video and 12MP still images, GPS positioning, 16 minutes flight time, and an FPV headset which lets you see what the drone’s camera can see. drone photography 22 dji spark At the other end of the consumer-oriented product line, you have the DJI Phantom 4 PRO Drone Quadcopter, which costs around $1800, and includes a 20MP camera mounted on a proper 3-axis gimbal to keep the camera level at all times. drone photography 3 dji phantom 4 Advanced Drones If you’d prefer more camera options, perhaps using your own mirrorless camera or a small DSLR, then look to the DJI Spreading Wings S1000+. It’s an octocopter, with eight motors/propellors, retractable, carbon-fiber legs, and is compatible with Zenmuse gimbals and gimballed cameras, as well as other third-party gimbals. The gimballed cameras DJI offers include the Zenmuse X3 for $900 and the Zenmuse X5 for $1800. drone photography 7 octocopter Using the appropriate gimbal, you can attach any camera you like to the DJI Spreading Wings S1000+, so long as the total weight (including the drone, batteries, gimbal, and camera) doesn’t exceed 24 pounds. A Gimbal A gimbal is a stabilized harness or frame suspended beneath the drone. It’s designed to carry a camera, keeping it level, or allowing it to be pointed remotely in a specific direction. Like drones, gimbals vary in price and size and it’s important you choose a drone which can lift your choice of gimbal and camera, and a gimbal which can handle the weight and size of your chosen camera. drone photography 21 gimbal Zenmuse are a popular, reliable gimbal manufacturer, but there are literally hundreds of cheap, Chinese models available. Whichever you choose, be sure it fits your chosen camera, and preferably make sure you can find good reviews from reliable sources. A Camera Naturally, you’ll need a camera too. Drones are available to carry anything from a tiny, dedicated camera, GoPro action cameras, compact and mirrorless cameras, DSLR cameras through to high-end movie cameras. You may be tempted to build your drone photography system around your existing camera and lenses, but before you do that, consider the size and cost of a drone big enough and powerful enough to lift your relatively heavy DSLR. It might be more cost effective to look at a smaller, mirrorless camera as your drone camera. These are much lighter than a DSLR and therefore easier to lift with a more modest drone setup. A Transmitter To control your drone, you’ll need a transmitter or controller. These range from simple devices with very few communication channels, to extremely advanced transmitters with many extra channels for controlling additional drone and camera features. drone photography 15 transmitter FPV Goggles Or Screen While you can take great photos with your drone-mounted camera without the benefit of seeing what the camera can see, you’ll always get better results when you can. FPV, or First Person View, is the most popular way of seeing what your camera sees. It works by taking a video feed from your drone-mounted camera, and relaying it to a pair of FPV goggles or an FPV screen which you, the pilot, wears or uses. drone photography 8 fpv screen As you maneuver the drone, or change the camera gimbal’s position, your FPV view changes to reflect what the camera is now looking at. drone photography 13 fpv goggles When you’re happy with what you see, you can trigger the camera’s shutter remotely by pressing a dedicated button on the transmitter. Batteries, Battery Charger & Other Accessories Lastly, there are several accessories which will keep your drone powered up and airborne. These include spare batteries, a battery charger, spare propeller blades, tools for drone maintenance, spare parts and carry cases. The most important of these accessories are the batteries and battery charger. Drones typically use Lipo batteries. These are capable of being charged fairly quickly, and also have the ability to provide a lot of power output in a short space of time. Because of this, they are relatively volatile and, if handled incorrectly, potentially dangerous. While budget batteries and chargers are available, stick with the better-known brands, such as Gens Ace, Floureon, or Turnigy, as these will behave more predictably and should withstand more intense use without failure. Repeated charging and use of a battery in quick succession can cause the battery to overheat. Therefore, it’s sensible to have several batteries and use them in rotation, giving each battery a chance to recover and cool down before re-use. 2. Federal, State And Local Drone Regulations & No-Fly Zones Drones have become more and more popular over the past several years, not least because of media interest, falling prices and a proliferation of exciting after-market accessories. This popularity has meant drones easily fall into the hands of irresponsible owners, which has led to high-profile news stories which the press has been quick to jump on, stirring up hysteria about drones and their uses. Therefore, and not before time, the authorities have had to provide guidance and laws to protect the public – both in terms of their safety, but also in terms of their privacy and civil liberties. If you’re in the USA, your first port of call for everything related to the legality of flying drones can be found at the FAA / Federal Aviation Administration’s website. Registering Your Drone In the US, if you wish to fly a drone whose total weight exceeds 0.55 pounds you’ll need to have the drone registered. It’s not difficult to register and costs just $5. Bear in mind that if you don’t get your drone registered and are caught flying it you could be fined as much as $27,500. Register your drone here: https://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/ All registered drone users receive a unique identification number which has to be written on the registered drone. The national laws on drone use should be your first consideration, but note that some states have local regulations regarding drone use which take precedence over national laws. Therefore, the onus is on you to make yourself aware of all the prevailing laws relating to where you intend to use your drone. No-Fly Zones Strict no-fly zones exist, and again, it’s your responsibility to know where these no-fly zones are, so you can avoid flying in them and breaking the law. The drone manufacturer, DJI, has created a no-fly database which you can check here. DJI uses the database behind this tool to automatically prevent its customer’s drones from entering a no-fly zone. drone photography 1 no fly zone Commercial Drone Use If you intend to use your drone commercially in the US, you’ll need to apply for Section 333 Exemption, also from the FAA. It’s not straightforward to get this exemption and most applicants rely on legal representation to make a case. This all takes time and there’s no guarantee you’ll be successful. Lastly, because this industry is still in its infancy, and the authorities have been slow to put regulations and safeguards in place, you should assume that any existing laws are subject to change and improvement. Therefore, the responsibility for keeping up to date with the latest laws and best practice falls on you, not the authorities. 3. Learn To Fly A Drone Before You Attach A Camera Most drone pilots started out with a “toy” drone – something cheap that they can learn the basics on without risking expensive damage. These smaller drones can even be used indoors, which gives you more opportunities to practice, regardless of the weather, or time of day. The skills you’ll learn on a “toy” drone are totally transferable to a larger, more professional drone. drone photography 6 controls Before your very first flight, you’ll want to make sure you’ve taken some important precautions: Choose a wide, open area to fly in. Keep away from obstacles such as power lines, buildings, trees and bridges. Keep your drone well away from members of the public or their pets while you’re learning. Avoid flying on a windy day. An important reflex to learn is to let go of the throttle if you’re about to crash or lose control. Spinning propellers can cause a lot of damage, to anyone or anything they come into contact with, but also to the propellers themselves. So, stopping the propellers from spinning should be your priority in an emergency. There are several exercises you can practice to improve your flying skills, but before you start, always take off from a flat, level surface, and have your drone facing away from you. Exercise #1: Take off, hover and land This is where it all begins. Practicing take-off, hovering and landing, are the bare essentials of drone flight. Just increase the throttle gently until the drone lifts off the ground. drone photography 10 practice Once it’s in the air, back off the throttle a little to prevent the drone from rising further, and find a throttle balance that keeps the drone hovering in the air in front of you. When you’re ready to land, simply back off the throttle very gently, bringing the drone back down to the ground smoothly. Be careful not to back the throttle off too suddenly or the drone may simply drop to the ground heavily, possibly causing damage. Repeat this take-off and landing exercise over and over again until you’re able to take off and land smoothly every time. With this exercise, remember to keep the drone facing away from you at all times. Exercise #2: Lateral Movement Getting slightly more advanced now, you’re going to practice moving the drone from side to side, and forward and backward. Get your drone airborne, then, move the drone left and right by moving the right stick to the left or right respectively. Once you’ve moved it one way, bring it back the other way. Repeat this until you’re ready to stop, and land the drone safely. drone photography 26 exercises Next, with the drone airborne again, move the drone forward and backward by moving the right stick forward or backward respectively. Once you’ve moved the drone forward, bring it back toward you. Repeat this until you’re ready to stop, and land the drone safely. Again, with this exercise, keep the drone facing away from you at all times. Exercise #3: Square And Circles This exercise really tests the skills you’ve learned in the previous two exercises. Pick a fixed marker on the ground that you can use as a target. This could be a discolored patch of grass, an X marked in the dirt, a flat stone, or a plastic lid, for example. Next, with your drone airborne, fly the drone in a regular pattern around the target. Start with a square. Using the skills you practiced in Exercise #2, move the drone forward a little, left a little, back a little, then right a little, until it’s back where it started. Repeat this, while trying to keep the movement and distances consistent. drone photography 24 exercises It’s very easy to get carried away and pick up too much speed. If this happens, try smaller movements of the right stick, and make sure you complete a movement in one direction before attempting the next. Once you’ve mastered squares, try and fly your drone in circles around your marker, keeping your drone facing away from you at all times. This is a very dynamic and tricky exercise because you’re always doing more than one thing at a time. You’re moving the drone forward or backward at the same time as moving it sideways. drone photography 25 exercises To do this, simply move the right stick in a gentle circle. As with the square exercise above, it’s easy to get too carried away, so always use a gentle touch on the stick, and be ready to bring the drone safely back down to the ground. Exercise #4: Yaw (Rotation) When your drone is facing away from you, with its back towards you, flying it is fairly intuitive. Left is left, right is right, forward is forward, backward is backward, etc. However, with the drone pointing in any other direction, things get tricky quickly! It’s one of the hardest things to learn about flying a drone, but the most rewarding because it gives you the most amount of control and precision, which is especially useful for drone photography. With this exercise, you’re going to keep the drone fairly low, certainly no higher than you’re prepared to have your drone fall with some force. Four or five feet should be ok. With your drone airborne and in front of you, move the left stick gently to the left until the drone has turned 90 degrees to the left. Then bring the stick back to the right until the drone has returned to face away from you. Now, move the left stick to the right a little more, rotating the drone to the right 90 degrees. Then bring it back to face away from you. Repeat this 90-degree exercise over and over until you’ve nailed it. Then, repeat this exercise but go to 180 degrees, with the drone turning to face you. When you’re feeling confident with the above, go for the full 360 degrees. Exercise #5: Landing Practice This is a fun exercise, and as easy or challenging as you want to make it. Simply choose two take-off and landing points which are at ground level. This minimizes problems if you miss the landing. drone photography 9 practice Take off from the first one and fly to the other, landing as accurately and steadily as you can. Then take off again and fly back to the original point. Do this over and over again. Rather than sticking to these two take-off/landing points, choose different points, at different distances and different heights. Use the features you find around you, a tree stump, a picnic table, or a drainage inspection cover. Your goal is to take-off smoothly, fly neatly to the other point, and land gently and with as much accuracy as possible. FAA Guidelines The FAA has published a set of safety guidelines you should follow: Keep the flight height below 400 feet above ground level Don’t fly within three miles of an airport or a landing strip Keep your drone within the pilot’s sight at any given time during the flight Keep the drone away from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) zones, as well as from temporary flight restriction zones Adhere to flight safety rules (keeping the drone away from wildlife, buildings, and pedestrians) Respect all the no-fly zones 4. Understand The Drone Controls & Settings Available To You Before attempting to fly your drone for the first time, you’ll need to understand the controls and settings. These are so numerous that we’ll just cover the basics in this article. Arming & Disarming When you switch your drone on, it will be in a “disarmed” state. This means the drone won’t take off until it has been “armed”. To discover how to arm your drone, consult your user guide. Transmitter Modes There are two transmitter modes available to you. Both of these modes relate to how the drone behaves based on the transmitter’s stick positions. In both modes, the left stick’s sideways motion controls yaw (rotation), and the right stick’s sideways motion controls roll. With mode 1, the left stick’s forward and backward motion controls pitch, while the right stick forward and backward motion controls the throttle. In mode 2, the left stick’s forward and backward motion controls the throttle, while the right stick forward and backward motion controls pitch. Most drone pilots use mode 2, and since switching between modes is counterintuitive and difficult, it’s best to start out with the mode 2. Flight Modes There are several flight modes. The most basic drones may only offer one or two of these flight modes. More advanced drones provide most, if not all, of them. Standard: In this mode, the drone levels itself when the sticks are released. The amount of tilt the drone can achieve is limited to make it easier to fly. Advanced: This is the same as standard mode, but with a less restrictive maximum tilt. Manual: In this mode, all stabilization is turned off and no maximum tilt is applied. 3D Mode: Again, no stabilization is applied and the 50% throttle stick position cuts the power to the motors. Greater than 50% throttle stick position generates positive thrust, but less than 50% throttle stick position reverses the direction of the motors, allowing upside down flying! GPS Mode or P Mode: This mode is only available on drones with GPS fitted. It allows your drone to fly at a fixed altitude, hover in place, and automatically adjust for gusts of wind. Trim Most drone transmitters allow you to make small adjustments which correct imbalances in the drone’s motors and flight controller. A typical scenario might be where your drone wants to keep rotating anticlockwise – or yawing. A small adjustment to the yaw trim will cancel out this unwanted rotation. 5. Pre-Flight Checklist & Preparation Even if drone photography is something you intend to do purely as a hobby, it’s sensible to treat flying your drone seriously. Therefore, making pre-flight checks, and preparing for every eventuality, is a good idea. drone photography 12 pre-flight checks Here’s a suggested pre-flight checklist you can use, or adapt. Day Before Flight Weather. Permissions obtained? (e.g. from authorities and/or land-owner) Drone, transmitter and camera batteries charged? Camera SD card formatted? First-aid kit packed? Immediately Before Flight Inspect drone for faults, loose components or screws. Warn any nearby spectators. Set home point (if available, so you can bring drone home automatically later if required). Camera lens cover removed? Turn camera on. Propellors tight enough and can move freely? Correct flight mode selected? Wind-speed? Check for obstacles (trees, power lines, buildings) & people. Take-Off Turn transmitter/controller on first. Turn drone on. Hover at 15ft for 15 seconds to check drone behavior and sound is normal. Check all controls respond as expected. 6. Research & Plan Your Aerial Shots One of the hardest parts of drone photography is planning what to shoot. Unless you’re actually “up there”, how do you know what will be a good scene to shoot? We’ve already talked about FPV – or First Person View. This is a good way of checking your framing and composition while your drone and camera are airborne. But you still need to be in the right general area in order to capture great subjects and scenes with your drone. One trick the pros use is to scour Google Maps or Google Earth for likely subjects. Even better, use DJI’s No Fly Zone tool and you’ll save yourself the added effort of having to check if it’s ok to fly there. The photo below shows the circular fields of Kansas as found in Google Maps with satellite mode enabled. You could plan our your entire aerial shoot using tools like this. drone photography 2 google maps 7. Don’t Use Your Camera’s Zoom Even if your camera has awesome optical zoom, don’t use it for your drone photography. The tiny vibrations caused by the drone’s spinning propellers can cause the camera to shake. Any amount of zoom will amplify this unwanted shake, resulting in blurry photos. So, for best drone photography results, keep your camera focal length as wide as possible at all times. 8. Use Composition Techniques To Create Stunning Aerial Photos As with normal photography, drone photography benefits from careful composition. While it’s a little harder to do while the camera’s airborne, it’s still possible. drone photography 17 composition Remember to include a person (if it’s safe and legal to do so), to create a sense of scale. drone photography 4 composition Shoot when the sun’s low for harder shadows which add depth to the scene. drone photography 18 shadows Look for opportunities to include strong colors. drone photography 20 composition Seize the opportunity to capture textures and patterns in the landscape. drone photography 14 patterns Look for symmetry in your drone photography, even though this can be tricky with drone photography. It’s perfectly ok to complete your composition in post edit, using the rotate and crop tools. drone photography 19 symmetry Drone Photography: Summary In this article, you’ve discovered the first steps necessary for getting into drone photography.

Given that most agents earn on average $40,000 a year, budget for drone photography, let alone any photography, is largely lacking. Typical budgets for marketing, over the course of a year are under $1,000 with a decent portion of that still going to printed media. That said, it takes money to make money. Typical marketing will be 10 to 30% of one's income. Even if one was making $40,000 on average a year, marketing should still be at least 10% of this (minus taxes and whatnot). This would put the expected budget at around $3,500. Even at $300 and with a budget of $3,500 per year, it becomes clear why many choose not to invest around 10% of their income on a single shoot. Still, recent developments keep lowering the cost of drone photography making it possible to find those willing to shoot properties at costs below $100. At this rate, drone photography can be wholly worth it. After all, due to the novelty of aerial photography, such shots still make a huge impression regardless of the size of the property. The key, thus, is finding a vendor who can offer low cost drone shots consistently and reliably to make this whole equation work. It might take some time to figure out the right mix, but if the math works out, you should see a nice return on investment.

If you plan to travel, you'll need to carry on batteries. I recommend grabbing a set of battery bags. These are fireproofed bags that hold batteries. Not strictly necessary, but best practice. If you're going to work, you need to get a Part 107 license. I took the course from Remote Pilot 101 and I thought it was fantastic. I passed the FAA exam with a score of 93 out of 100. I also recommend both insurance for the hull, and drone liability insurance.

604351ceed76476feda2769f,https://www.quora.com/When-did-drone-photography-become-mainstream?-,"I’d say drones ‘became mainstream’ about 2013 when the DJI Phantom was released on the market. An article from the time says ‘Drones Go Mainstream’ and mentions the describes the new class of camera drones that used GPS and vision systems for stability, were relatively easy to fly and got good video and photos: Drones Go Mainstream. Prior to the Phantom, and others like Parrot and Yuneec that emerged in the mid 20-teens, the only camera drones available were flimsy, wicked hard to fly, and had very low resolution cameras. I was flying DraganFlyers for about five years in the early ‘20s, had to keep about five or six of them just to have a couple available. I used them to pop up over a property and get photos for landscaping projects, putting together a crude map to use in the background of AutoCAD to trace the property, building, and existing landscape to start the plans. They were no fun, were very hard to fly and too easy to crash, and they were so flimsy and lightweight that they came apart in the air. When I got my first Parrot Bebop in about 2015 it was amazing, got excellent photos and pretty good video. When I got a DJI Mavic in about 2016 it was even move amazing and I sold all the Bebops and started on a DJI fleet. The 3rd party apps for the DJI drones, like DroneDeploy and Litchi, sealed it for me. Where it was a tortured workflow to keep DraganFlyers ready to fly and piece together a very rough map of a property, DroneDeploy will fly a DJI drone over a property automagically, come back with hundreds of nadir shots per acre, add oblique images to get textures, and stitch them together into an accurate image of the property and 3d model of the structures. The FAA promulgated drone regulations and started to require registration of the heavier drones and certification of pilots for commercial operations a few years later, in 2016. That’s what we still have today, approaching 2021. Next in the mainstream are the autonomous drones for delivery, survey, mapping, first-responders, and all the things that drones can do on their own. There have been several prototypes of delivery drones operating successfully in the past year or so for outfits with the budget to demonstrate to the FAA that they have the infrastructure to do it safely. At the end of last year, the FAA released their notice of proposed rule-making about ‘Remote Id’ and a ‘drone traffic management system’ for drones operating routinely beyond visual line of sight. Recently the FAA released an NPRM about the technology and on-line systems they propose. We expect that some time in 2021 the new regs and tech will be settled and soon after the new drone traffic management system will be ready for those who get certified and pay into the system to operate drones beyond visual line of sight. Google on terms like ‘FAA NPRM Remote Id’ to see the notices and the intense debate about them. The FAA is revamping the ancient air traffic control systems and is integrating the new drone traffic management systems with it. Last year, the rolled out the LAANC-Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capacity system for commercial and recreational pilots to more or less automatically notify tower controllers they’re flying under their airspace or gain authorization to fly in it. Next in the mainstream will be the larger ‘logistics drones’ that can carry a pallet or pickup-sized load directly to or from UPS and other carriers’ facilities at airports, mixing in with piloted aircraft. The drone manufacturers are ready to produce drones compliant with the new system. DJI already puts ADS-B receivers on their commercial drones, and they and other manufacturers are waiting for the tech to be decided and will be building compliant drones. Skydio, Autel, Parrot, and other less-well-known manufacturers are ready and waiting. Google on terms like ‘UPS Flight Forward MatterNet’, ‘Amazon Prime Air’, ‘Flirtey Pizza Hut’ or ‘Google Wing’ to see examples of the smaller autonomous drones for delivery. Google on ‘cargo logistics drones’ and check the images to see some of those. Outfits like Kittyhawk and AirMap are getting ready to interface to the on-line traffic management systems with their customers’ drone fleets. In about ten years, the mainstream of drones has widened from camera drones operating in VLOS to delivery and cargo drones operating autonomously over our cities and around our airports.",2021-03-06T09:56:30.732Z,"When did drone photography become mainstream?

Or, if you can afford more, get a DJI Mini 2 or the older Mavic Mini with a Fly More kit with extra batteries for $449 to $499. Either of these little drones is very tame and easy to fly. I think we learn more with more successes than failure and either of these drones is ‘stabilized’ with a downward vision system so when you let go of the sticks, it will hover in place if there’s enough light for the drone to perceive objects or texture under it. Drones that aren’t stabilized drift and don’t stop when you let go of the sticks so it’s very challenging for a noob to control them. Don’t try learning with a ‘toy drone’ without stabilization, is my advice. None of the $39 to $99 toy drones I’ve tried was easy to fly, and from what I read and see, I think that lots of them don’t survive their first flights. The stabilization systems add some cost to the drones and no cheap toy can perform like a DJI or other real drone. The Tello is mostly an indoor drone that can be taken outside if there’s no wind. The Minis are mostly for outdoors. The Mavic Mini comes with propeller guards so you can start indoor, but are best flown outdoors. IMHO, you won’t need any more of a Beginner’s Guide than the pamphlet that comes with the drone. Read the manual, check out the forum for your drone. Start off in a safe place and begin practicing. It takes a while to get the skills or ‘muscle memory’ between eyes and fingertips to control the drone, especially when it’s headed at you. Don’t switch on the ‘headless’ or ‘smart’ mode, keep the controller set for Mode 2 unless you’re somewhere Mode 1 is customary. I advise people to start by following behind the drone so left and right is easy to figure out, then pick a point a fifty or a hundred feet away and practice flying the drone out and back, and keep that up until you can fly it around your head without klutzing or flinching. I used the same kinds of exercises I used when I was a flight instructor with students in a plane. Turns about a point, figure eights around a pair of stakes or chandeliers if you have them, or following the lines on a soccer field or parking lot with the camera pointed down are all good exercises. When you’re good with the Tello or Mini, decide what you want to fly next. FPV Racing Drones are totally immersive and while the big ones are lethal and can’t comfortably be flown on a residential lot, the little trainers are relatively safe and there are indoor and outdoor models. They are all wicked hard to fly, but are lots easier if you’ve developed skills with an easy-to-fly Tello or Mini. Most will let you fly in ‘horizon’ mode with a good gyro so they’ll keep themselves level if you let go of the sticks, but they are not vision or GPS stabilized, don’t know where they are, can’t Return to Home on their own, and they drift. Experienced racers and aerobats don’t use the gyros, they stabilize the drone between their eyes and their fingertips. They don’t want no stinkin gyro or stabilization system limit what their drone can do. Getting a kit together of compatible drone, batteries, controller, FPV monitor, and FPV goggles is a challenge. Some drones require tweaking at their firmware, so there’s an app to learn for a PC like BetaFlight or Team Black Sheep Agent-X. Everything about FPV drones has a steep learning curve, even configuring the remote controller and binding a drone to it. Camera drones are easy to fly so you can focus on the camera and frame photos and video. The _can_ drop into ATTI mode if there’s not enough light or GPS for stabilization, so practice with ATTI mode is important. It usually happens in close up spaces, like a residential lot or flying off a deck, where there are GPS shadows and reflections or shadows that confuse the drone, or at anytime at night. There’s no problem putting together the kit, they come certified as a UAS Unmanned Aircraft System with a dedicated controller that either has FPV with a nice touch screen built in or a clamp to hold a smartphone or tablet. Camera drones’ flight controllers, remote controllers, their cameras, and even their batteries have computers in them and they all need updates every now and then. I believe DJI does the best job of this, others believe they’re in cahoots with the ChiComs and are spying on us. Every business in China has the government as a partner, but I’m don’t believe they’re using my drone to spy. Camera drones pretty much come Ready To Fly after the batteries are charged and they’ve been registered and firmware updated. Not much is complex about them except the camera controls. My current suggestion for FPV drones is right tame since I don’t experiment a lot and buy BNF-Bind ’n Fly drones pre-built: Team Black Sheep Tango radio controller with built-in FPV and a FRSky transmitter model; or a Taranis QX7 with a small 4 inch FPV monitor on a phone holder; TBS Tiny Whoop Nano fly-weight, perfectly balanced brushed motors, ducted props, can survive most crashes, are only moderately hard to fly; EMAX Tiny Hawk II is a bit more powerful with brushless motors and are wicked hard to fly, can make any home into a DRL course; Fat Shark Attitude FPV Goggles for when you can fly OK line of sight and are ready to put them on; EMAX Tiny Hawk II Race is a few ounces of very powerful little drone for outdoors, not lethal, hard to fly; EMAX Baby Hawk is crazy powerful, wicked hard to fly, and lethal; EMAX Hawk Pro is way out of my league, but would help get you ready for a DRL Racer V or whatever’s next. All these drones are compatible with the FRSky transmitter in the Tango or the Taranis QX7. DJI builds the best drones at every pricing point, and the next drone up from a Mini or Mini 2 is the new Mavic Air 2 at $799 with kit. It’s getting good reviews. The Mavic 2 Pro with a Hasselblad and a full inch sensor is $1449 and worth it. They don’t really have any competition, with something like 85% of the prosumer and commercial drone market, but there are a few other companies that make excellent drones. Skydio 2 is the most advanced selfie drone at $1399, but you have to wait a year to get one. Autel EVO 2 competes with the Mavic 2 starting at about $1799. Parrot Anafi might be on sale for $799 and might be an OK little drone. I hope this get you thinking about which drones you want to fly? Drones weighing more than 250 grams are required to be registered. For the time-being all that’s required is to check of a list of safety rules, pay $5, and download a certificate of registration to carry with you and a number to put on your drones. All my encounters with law enforcement or park managers have been pleasant because my drones are registered. For more information and to get registered go to FAADroneZone. Any commercial activity with a drone requires an FAA Part107 Commercial Remote Pilot certificate, even a monetized social media account or video blog. The drone zone has information about that. Soon, the FAA will be releasing new rules and regulations for a new class of autonomous drones for delivery, mapping, inspection, surveys, emergency response, and all that drones can do on their own. Their operators must be certified, and we expect this to provide more careers with drones. I wouldn’t advise anybody to go in debt to get a fleet of drones, quit their day job, and expect to get rich with it. But, lots of us enjoy flying them, practicing at FPV or trying to get the best videos or photos, and some of us could expect to get a gig flying a drone every now and then, or might get busy. I’m a retired commercial pilot adding a remote pilot endorsement to a commercial certificate issued in 1968, the written test is similar to private and commercial airplane and helicopter exams. I like flying and answering questions about drones. I wish you the best with it.",2021-03-06T09:59:57.786Z,"What are good introductory guides to drone photography? ",Quora

It’s hard to pick compatible components, and when you do, you’ll crash a lot while learning to fly. Good camera drones with GPS and vision systems to stabilize them are easy to fly as long as everything’s working, so you can focus on the camera and photos or videos. They come as a kit with everything you need so there’s no problem getting compatible components. Most people can take them somewhere there’s plenty of room and figure out how to fly them pretty quickly. The big hurdle to get past is to fly the thing toward you, since the sticks on the controller, if you use Mode 2 and avoid ‘headless’ or ‘intelligent’ features, move the drone relative to the drone, not you. I suggest learning by following the drone for a while, then flying out and back until you get the hang of it, then flying circles and figure eights around posts. When you’re good at it, you can fly your drone at you and around your head without flinching. DJI makes the best camera drones at every pricing point. I’d suggest starting with either a DJI Mavic Mini or the newer DJI Mini 2. These are very stable little drones with an excellent little point-and-shoot camera that cost about $399 or $439, or add $100 to get a kit with extra batteries and a charger. If that’s steep, get a DJI Tello with a nice GameSir Bluetooth controller for $149 at Amazon and some extra batteries. The Tello is a very tame little drone with downward vision stabilization made for flying indoors. They can fly outdoors if there’s no wind. The new Mavic Air 2 is about $799 and gets excellent reviews. But, its camera doesn’t have an adjustable aperture so you can’t control the depth of focus. If you’re into photography you’ll want a better camera that has larger optics, a larger sensor, and a real, adjustable aperture. That’s a Mavic 2 Pro with a Hasselblad at $1599, or the big Phantom 4 Pro with real aperture and a real, mechanical shutter for about the same price. To get a better camera, the equivalent of a DSLR, would be $3000+ for an Inspire with a Zenmuse X5S or better. All of these drones are easy to fly and there’s no need to crash them as long as you don’t try crazy stuff or fly them like an FPV racer in tight spaces. DJI provides a CareRefresh policy that will replace a crashed drone, twice, for a small fee, and it’s worthwhile to get the policy before you fly your drone. What’s NOT easy to fly are the cheap camera drones without the sensitive vision systems, IMU-Inertial Measurement Units, gyro, compass, and altimeter that DJI, Parrot, Autel, Yuneec, and Skydio build into their drones. All these electronics are what makes a good camera drone easy to fly, and there’s no way they’re built into a toy drone for $239 or $329. Good camera drones have a good gimbal to get smooth video, cheap drones don’t. I’ve been disappointed with every cheap drone I’ve tried, and I try a couple a year hoping I’ll find one to recommend to somebody asking about them. Eachine, Holy Stone, and some other less expensive drones are good toys, but you asked about photography, and these toys don’t have cameras that would get imagery anybody would want to pay for, plus they’re hard to control in close quarters, easier to crash than to fly. If you’re interested in drones in the US, the FAADroneZone is the place to learn about the regulations and register your drones. The Mavic Mini, Mini 2, and Tello all weigh less than 250 grams so aren’t required to be registered, but all the other rules apply to them. Mavic Airs, Pros, Mavic 2, and the others do require registration. If by ‘aerial photography’ you mean to do commercial work, that requires a commercial remote pilot certificate, referred to as a Part 107 Commercial Remote Pilot Certificate, and the drone zone will advise you about that. Any kind of commercial work, furtherance of business without compensation, or monetized social media that uses drones requires. There are lots of resources on-line for the camera drone you pick, like MavicPilots.com, where you can read about what others are up to and see what they’re doing.

These put a camera body and big sensor like a DSLR on a gimbal and accept a range of Olympus lenses. If you want a specialized ‘low-light’ camera plus a thermal sensor to search for stuff at night a Yuneec Typhoon H, still available for $699 + a CGO-ET at $1800 might be the least expensive for a low-resolution thermal and higher-resolution low-light camera. Add a couple of Lume Cubes to it and there’s a rig that will highlight the warmest bodies within a few hundred feet and light up about three soccer fields on a dark night. A Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual is a more capable drone, has a low-resolution thermal and a low-light camera built in, plus strobes and headlights, for something like $3500. A thermal/low-light camera with higher resolution than 160 pixels starts at about $5000 and a drone to loft it is maybe $4000+.",2021-03-06T10:08:16.644Z,"What is aerial drone photography for events?

Or, the larger, most badass looking and sounding Inspire 1 V2 with a Zenmuse X5. The Mavic 2 Pro has a relatively large sensor and optics. The Zenmuse X5 is the equivalent of a DSLR built into a gimbal with a real shutter, and it takes a full range of Olympus lenses with real aperture and optical zoom. If you want to spend more, around $5,000 would get an Inspire 2 with a Zenmuse X7 that’s cinema-capable… If you’re not ready to shell out $1900 or $3500 for a camera drone and some kit, you might want to consider a Mavic Pro at $999 or a Mini with the Fly More kit for $499. The Mini’s a fine little camera drone, very capable, GPS and vision stabilized, weighs in at 249 grams so it’s not required to be registered. The Mavic Pro is all most people need. The Mavic 2 Pro is on sale for the holidays. In the US Florida Drone Supply has them in stock and ships the same day. They’ve also got the Mavic 2 Pro on sale for $400 off, and can get an Inspire to you if you want it. There are a lot of Inspire 2s on sale at eBay and at DJI Inspire Drone Forum if you want the best and don’t mind used. It looks like a lot of people got them and don’t need all that excess quality. The Mavic Mini’s might be a good starter, won’t break the bank, and you can move up from there if you want more. This answer is by an elder geek who is very brand-loyal to DJI. I’ve sold off all my other drones except a couple of Typhoon Hs with thermal sensors. I resisted DJI, for some reason, for a year and tried several others. After my first DJI I was hooked and flying the others was just not as good. DJI’s got something like 90% of the ‘pro-sumer’ market for good reasons… Skydio 2, a US manufacturer, may be challenging DJI’s share for pro-sumer camera drones, but they’ve just started shipping them and although I pre-ordered late in the day they were announced, mine won’t ship until late Spring.

Now, there are many free channels available to help learn English quickly, which may make you wonder where to start looking. Luckily we’ve put together a list of the best YouTube English channels so you can get started right away!  1.Speak English with MisterDuncan The thing that makes these videos great is Mister Duncan’s personality and sense of humour! He’s a very experienced English teacher who loves his job and makes every topic funny and fascinating. 2. BBC Learning English The BBC’s official EFL channel is a brilliant resource. It has short lessons about all aspects of English grammar and vocabulary, which are suitable for beginner, intermediate and advanced level learners. With around one million subscribers and more than 70 million views, this channel is definitely a fan-favorite in the English learning community. Created by the world-famous BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), the channel features videos in various formats - from real-life conversations to cartoons. They're mostly short videos but they feature a ton of useful information.  3. VOA Learn English This is a really cool idea from the famous news company Voice of America. Each lesson is like a normal TV news report, but they are presented by trained English teachers and they are slower, with subtitles and simpler language. This means you can learn about interesting topics and get used to watching English language news while improving your English skills at the same time! 4. Rachel’s English If your priority is pronunciation, this is one of the best places to learn! Rachel trained as a classical singer and she is an expert in showing people how to change the way they move their mouth and tongue to create sounds they are not used to. If you want to speak with a perfect American English accent, watch these videos! 5. Easy English This UK channel interviews English speaking people on the street about all different subjects. That means you can hear how everyday English is spoken by real people, outside of the classroom! Each video is around 3-5 minutes long, so they are a quick and easy way to improve your listening skills.  6. Real English This is a similar idea to Easy English, but it interviews American people. You can choose to watch the videos with or without subtitles and each one comes with some extra exercises to help you check your understanding and build up new vocabulary, too. 7. Business English Pod English used in the workplace or in a business context can be very different to informal English, but it is difficult to practise this by yourself! That’s why Business English Pod is so good. It has in-depth videos about all different situations and types of vocabulary that you might need to learn for your job.

Well, best is a pretty vague term but I’ll try and answer the question regarding many aspects of life. Also I am an American that hasn’t lived in any of these countries, so I will be able to give an unbiased answer. Aspects - Which country is the best? Population Out of the three countries, New Zealand is the least populous country. Australia’s estimated 2020 population is 25,679,100, Canada’s estimated 2020 population is 38,005,238, and New Zealand’s estimated 2020 population is 5,092,750. Having a small or large population has its ups and downs. Countries with a larger population tend to have more jobs and a well developed infrastructure, while countries with a smaller population tend to be more relaxed and feel spacious. Cities Out of the three countries, New Zealand has the least amount of cities. For this answer I have counted cities as large human settlements with over 1,000,000 people living in them. Australia has 5 cities with over 1,000,000 people living in them, Sydney in New South Wales being the most populated. Canada has 3 cities with over 1,000,000 people living in them, Toronto in Ontario being the most populated. New Zealand has 1 city with over 1,000,000 people living in them, Auckland being the only one. Economy Out of the three countries, New Zealand has the lowest unemployment rate. As of October 2020, Australia’s unemployment rate is 6.8%, Canada’s unemployment rate is 9%, and New Zealand’s unemployment rate is 4%. Unemployment rates don’t say everything about a country, but it could signal how hard it is to find employment in certain country, especially for immigrants. Politics and Government *Disclaimer - When I say left and right wing, I mean it in broad terms.* All three countries are similar when it comes to politics and government. Both Australia and Canada are Federal Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchies, while New Zealand is a Unitary Parliamentary Constitutional Monarchy. All three countries have a two-party dominant system. Australia has the Labor Party (left-wing) and Liberal Party (right-wing), Canada has the Liberal Party (left-wing) and Conservative Party (right-wing), and New Zealand has the Labour Party (left-wing) and National Party (right-wing). All three countries have Queen Elizabeth II as the Head of State and Monarch, and all three have Prime Ministers as the Head of Government. On the 2019 Democracy Index, which scores countries based electoral process, functioning of government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties, New Zealand ranked the highest. Australia received a 9.09/10 on the Democracy Index placing Australia 9th place out of 167 countries, Canada received a 9.24/10 on the Democracy Index placing Canada 7th place out of 167 countries, and New Zealand received a 9.26/10 on the Democracy Index placing New Zealand 4th place out of 167 countries. Language All three countries are dominantly English-speaking countries. Around 99% of Australia’s population speaks English, around 86.2% of Canada’s population speaks English, and around 95.4% of New Zealand’s population speaks English. Out of three countries, only Canada is an officially bilingual country, the Government of Canada stating that English and French are the country’s two official languages. However, only 17% of Canada’s population is fluently bilingual. People All three countries have a dominant European ancestry population. Around 76% of Australians are of European descent, around 73% of Canadians are of European descent, and around 74% of New Zealanders are of European descent. Weather and Climate Out of three countries, Canada is the coldest. Canada’s winters are the coldest. It is also much more rainy in Canada. Out of the twelve months, Canada can experience rain during ten months. Australia and New Zealand tend to be warmer on average, but Australian and New Zealand winters are also cold. Cost of Living Out of three countries, Australia has the highest cost of living. Compared to Toronto and Auckland, Sydney is the most expensive to live in costing $1,029 (USD) a month excluding rent. Auckland was in second place, costing $959 (USD) a month excluding rent. Toronto was the cheapest to live in out of the three, costing $934 (USD) a month excluding rent. I understand that Australia isn’t just Sydney, Canada isn’t just Toronto, and New Zealand isn’t just Auckland, but if you plan on living or immigrating to one of the countries, these are the cities you will most likely end up in. Quality of Life Out of three countries, Australia has the highest quality of life rating on the Quality of Life Index. The Quality of Life Index takes many factors into account such as safety, healthcare, pollution, climate, etc. Australia ranked the highest being in 4th place, Canada ranked 21st place, and New Zealand ranked 8th place. Conclusion Overall, Australia seemed to do the best in many aspects. However, here is my conclusion. If you want to live in a country where there is larger population and larger economy… Choose Canada If you want to live in a country where there is a moderate population, but more cities and places to explore… Choose Australia If you want to live in a country where there is more space for you and your family, and overall more relaxed… Choose New Zealand",2021-03-06T10:24:08.350Z,"Which is the best event drone photography in New Zealand?

It's just a matter of time before some nutjob uses drones for fomenting some nefarious end. In addition, drones are fantastic reconnaissance tools that could be used to recon the government. The government is aware of these threats and is moving to curtail drone use where Continue Reading",2021-03-06T10:27:41.696Z,"What measures are being taken to combat the over-aggressive bans on drone photography in state and national parks?

Many/most states have adopted legislation in the past few years making it unlawful for local councils and governments making restrictive drone ordinances and also authorizing local law enforcement to issue citations for drone violations, including flying unregistered drones. For the time-being, what you propose is very easy to do, only requires you to check off a list of safety rules, pay $5 to seal the deal, and download a certificate to print and carry with you with a number to post on your drones. Soon, any day now, there will be a test to pass, but that hasn’t come to pass quite yet. You’re a ‘recreational’ or ‘hobby’ remote pilot, similar to RC pilots since the ‘40s and represented by the AMA-Academy of Model Aeronautics, which sanctions hundreds and hundreds of fields for flying fixed-wing models, some of them co-located with airports. Multi-rotor drones don’t need a runway, but AMA represents us and offers liability insurance for its members. There are several routes to the rules and the FAA Drone Registry as another answer snidely suggests. One of them is FAADroneZone. I think you’ll find that you can fly your drone in practically all states except for where you can’t, like near airports, over prisons…. DJI GO4 and other apps for controlling drones update their ‘geofencing’ database a couple or few times a month and will show you where you can and can’t fly, are pretty much accurate. ‘Compensation’ and ‘commercial’ are broadly applied, so even a monetized social media blog, vlog, or dlog is considered commercial.

There is another category for government employees flying drones in their work, like a park manager or the poleece… Please don’t fly a drone weighing more than .55 pounds off your property without proper registration, is my best advice… I wouldn’t want to be the person operating an unregistered drone in our fair county, or be without my FAA certificate when trying to get the perfect fly by of a house.

This will be granted only to citizens of India, or a company or body that is registered and has its principal place of business in India, its chairman and 2/3rds of directors are citizens of India and its ownership and effective control is in the hands of Indian nationals. To own a drone: Documentation needed: address proof, statement of purpose of operation of UA, specification of the drone including (manufacturer name, type, model number, year of manufacture, weight and size, type of propulsion system, flying capabilities in terms of maximum endurance, range and height, equipment capabilities etc.), police clearance of character, permission for all frequencies used in drone operations from the Department of Telecommunications (it’s not clear if permission is required to operate using unlicensed spectrum like WiFi), copy of the flight manual, and manufacturer provided maintenance guidelines.Fireproof ID Plate on drone: Finally, users will also be required to make a fireproof identification plate and inscribe it with the UIN and an RFID tag, or put a SIM on the UA to for identification.Once all these steps are complete, a user is entitled only to own a drone To fly a drone: Permit: a user will require DGCA’s UA drone operator permit for flying above 200 feet, or a permit from the local administration for below 200 feet.2) Who requires an UA operator permit? All drone operators operating unmanned aircraft at or above 200 feet above ground level will required a UA Operator Permit (UAOP) from the DGCA. Users with drones that operate below that level out of restricted and danger areas as well as Temporary Segregated Areas (TSA) and Temporary Reserved Areas (TRA), will be required to obtain permission from the local administration. Model aircraft operating below 200 feet in uncontrolled airspace and indoor for recreational purposes will be permitted, including activities within the premises of educational institutions. 3) Procedure for issuance of UA operator permit (UAOP): For flying drones above 200 feet, users will have to submit an application for an UA operator permit with the DGCA with the following documents:– Permission from either a civil or defense Air Navigation Service (ANS) provider– Permission of the land or property owner to take off and land UA– Details of remote piloting and training records– Third party accidental insurance (if applicable)– Security clearance from the Bureau of civil Aviation Security of India This application should be submitted at least 90 days before actually flying the UA and will be valid for up to two years from the date of issue. Users will have to make sure that they follow all procedures and keep an up to date record of maintenance system. A copy of the UAOP will be forwarded to to MHA, BCAS, IAF, ANS Provider (AAI/ MoD),and Local Administration/ concerned state’s DGP/ Local ASP for information. Additional requirements can be imposed by the DGCA on a case to case basis. The UAOP license issues will contain the following information:– Name and location (main place of business) of the operator;– Date of issue and period of validity;– Scope and description of the type of operations authorized;– Area of operation;– Type(s) of UA authorized for use;– Unique Identification Number (UIN) of UA;– Special limitations, if any (e.g. not over populous areas, etc.);– List of approved personnel for operation of UAS (security clearance of personnel will be required);– Insurance validity with respect to all liabilities; 4) Classification of civil drones: Civil UA are classified in accordance to their weight, although this does not seem to matter directly in the issuance of licenses. However, the DGCA’s license is based on the drone’s overall capabilities. Note that drones that fly below 200 feet do not require DGCA’s license, rather only permission from the local administration.i) Micro : Less than two kg.ii) Mini : Greater than two kg and less than 20 kg.iii) Small : Greater than 20 kg and less than 150 kg.iv) Large : Greater than 150 kg. By this, it sounds like drones over 150kg flying under 200 feet will only require permission from the local administration, whereas drones under 2kg flying over this height will require a license. 5) Security & ownership conditions: The drone for which a UIN is issues cannot be sold or disposed off without permission from the DGCA. In case of loss, the operator will have to immediately notify the police, BCAS and DGCA. Any accidents will have to be reported to the Director of Air Safety, DGCA and BCAS within 24 hours as well. 6) Flying conditions: – Pilots will be required to be a minimum of 18 years old, and should have training equivalent to that undertaken by aircrew of manned aircraft or a private pilot’s license holder for aeroplanes or helicopters with FRTOL (Flight Radio Telephone Operator’s Licence). This is applicable only to drones flying above 200 feet, and not for pilots included in recreational flying. – Remote operators will also not fly an UA unless they are reasonably sure that all control systems of the UA including the radio link are in working condition. – Irrespective of weight category, the UAS operator shall inform Local Administration, ATS unit (for operations at or above 200ft in uncontrolled airspace), BCAS, Aerodrome operator (if applicable) before commencement and after termination of operation. In the event of cancellation of UA operations, the operator shall notify all appropriate authorities. – The flight plan will be required to provide information including the description of the intended operation, flight rules, visual line-of-sight operation, date of intended flight(s), point of departure, destination, cruising speed(s), cruising level(s), route to be followed and duration/frequency of flight among other details. – The UAS operator shall not launch the UA when rain/ thunderstorm warning is in force. – The operator shall ensure that the UA is flown within 500m Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) during the entire period of the flight (applicable only for micro and mini UAV). – UA shall not discharge or drop substances unless specially cleared and mentioned in UAOP. It will also be required to have a return home option in case of communication failure, and third party insurance in case of damage during accidents.

Know your UAV rules & regulations Most people think drones are kids stuff, but in reality it’s not. There are flying rules depending on your country. For example in US Federation of Aerial Administration (FAA) has listed certain rules regarding drone flights. So better know the flying rules before your drone is taken into custody for unauthorized flight. Fly simple first No matter how much you over estimate your talent, I should say, the one who starts from the basics wins the race. So better try out from a small budget drone & touch a professional one when you are confident of proper handling a drone. Choose your professional drone Now you are confident enough to go pro. Following a pre-flight checklist, fly your drone & shoot. Keep in mind to have a clear idea of what you’ll be shooting before you go air.

All those drone lovers can quote from all the law books in the land as to how they can do this or do that and have a whole bunch of rights and that might be fine but when some irate Bogan or Red-Neck wants to punch your lights out then no amount of knowledge of the law is going to make any difference as you are about to get beaten up and your drone destroyed. This was my experience with the average Joe here in Australia when as soon as the word “Drone” had passed my lips then someone was getting all fired up and angry as even my eldest Son had promised to blow the thing out of the sky with a shotgun if I ever fly it over his backyard. Now having mentioned that while there are those that love drones and those that hate drones and so for me it was more a case of Oh Kay if this is going to cause me hassles then leave the thing in the shop and just concentrate on getting the image with a normal camera. However if you have done your homework and you can utilise a drone at night in the area that you want to photograph then go for it but for me and my personal experience here in Australia I cannot see any point in upsetting the whole neighbourhood and get called a Pervert and a Paedophile and a Creep who is violating people’s right to their personal privacy in their own backyard. Yes we know that they are wrong but try telling them that. So in the interest of peace and tranquility in my life I did not bother with purchasing and trying to use a Drone.

The helicopter has the great advantage that it carries the photographer, not just his camera. That's a human who can see the great picture (pun intended) and focus on whatever details are needed. Another thing is that a helicopter can carry (together with one or more photographers) one or more cameras, many of which might be simply too heavy for a drone, especially for high altitude photography. Drones are perfect to get into tight, dangerous spots. Helicopters are good for everything else. To finally answer your question, I'm sure there's a dent in the industry, but I don't think it's a very sizable one. It's conceivable that somewhere, some helicopter operator is even going out of business if all they did was close aerial photography, but that's more of a case of bad management than drone competition.

The Mavic 2 is also about the quietest drone on the market so it isn’t going to offend the drone-haters that are always around. If I’ll be flying over things an the best I’ve got is an Inspire 1 with a Zenmuse X3 or X5 camera. With the X3 camera an Inspire can map an 80-acre site on one batteryThe X5 has real shutter and handles several lenses from Olympus’ DSLR lineup, is like $1999 through $3999. Inspire 2 is even better if I could afford it, starts at $3999 and goes way up for an X7 and some lenses. Either is the most badass looking and sounding drone on the market, IMHO, neither is particularly quiet, either is my favorite drone to fly when I can. The application software available might influence the ‘best’ decision. DJI’s drones run DroneDeploy, Litchi, lots of other mapping and mission planning software. If surveying and mapping to centimeter scale is better you’ll need something like a rig with a Phantom 4 RTK-Real Time Kinetic update drone and a GPS system at maybe $7999. LIDAR’s better than photography and becoming affordable for those who think it’s best… DJI’s regarded as the best at every price point between toys and enterprise, and will be coming out with new products most any day now, and I bet they’ll be the best. Lot’s of brand loyalty here… Intel Falcon-8, Yuneec’s big hexacopters, Autel, Parrot, Skydio, TinyHawk S, and lots of others all claim to be the best at something… Good luck finding the best for you. If you’re new at it and wondering what’s the best to get, I’d say find a refurbished Mavic Pro Platinum for $729 at the DJI.com store, under Discounts or a Pro at similar price if there’s no Platinum. The Platinum is significantly better/quieter than a plain Pro, but either might be best for you.

It takes good video also, just not quite as good as higher end models with larger “glass”. The second budget model I would suggest is a well-kept secret - The DJI Phantom 3 SE (Special Edition). This model will take better stills and video than the Spark (although many people will not be able to tell the difference). In the $800-$1000 Range you cannot go wrong with either of the compact models from DJI - the Mavic Pro or the Mavic Air. If you are truly looking for the “next step up” you need a larger sensor in the camera - in the case of consumer models, that means the DJI Phantom 4 Advanced or Professional. These can be purchased with a built-in screen on the R/C controller or they can use your smart device. The DJI consumer models mentioned above can be seen at: Consumer drones & camera gimbal - DJI As a summary, most of the budget drones use a sensor similar to a decent smartphone (Apple iphone, for example). The Phantom 4 Advanced and Pro use a larger (1″) sensor which is the same size as used in a higher end consumer camera like the Sony RX-100 series. Sony DSC-RX100/B 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 3.6x Zoom For most applications (online publishing, etc.) it will hard for the average viewer to tell the difference - but if you are a more serious “prosumer” photog, then the additional resolution and lighting performance of the 1″ sensors.

Learn the Basics This may seem obvious, but learning the basics about drones with cameras before starting your business can be helpful. Drones can be expensive. Investing a lot of money into something that may not work the way you expect it to may not be the best idea. 2. Experiment with Different Drone Genres to Find Your Favourite(s) This is one of the most important steps of your business plan. As mentioned before, drone photography comes with a lot of sub-genres. Here are just a few categories that drone photographers can get into: - Real estate - Surveillance - Agriculture - Weddings 3. Create a Checklist to Ensure a Smooth Operation Before you make your business official, you can make a list of everything you’d like to focus on. This can be a to-do list or simply a list of questions. The more prepared you are, the easier you’ll find it to keep your business strong, no matter what you experience. 4. Update Yourself on the Laws There are many places that have strict rules regarding drones, their flight patterns, and the types of images they can capture. This is especially true if you are near any private property, federal buildings, schools, or airports. 5. Build a Strong Portfolio to Highlight Your Skills Without an outstanding style, drone photos all look the same. You can naturally develop your style by taking lots of photos by drone photography. Experiment with different angles, heights, editing skills, and videography techniques. The more you do this, the closer you’ll get to discovering your unique preferences.",2021-03-06T11:01:27.634Z,"Where can I hire a wedding aerial photography drone pilot? ",Quora

Pilot wins case against FAA over commercial drone flight The FAA, in theory, has control over the airspace starting at the ground level - yes, even on your lawn and above your house. But they have failed to actually create the rules and regulations concerning this. As it stands, it's somewhat like the Wild West. That is, there is really little or nothing formal in legal limitations - rather there are some guidelines which are generally agreed upon and others which are common sense. The Academy of Model Aeronautics and the FAA have come to basic agreements about the safety of unmanned aerial hobby vehicles. These include:1. Flying within Line of Sight and under operator control - as opposed to complete autonomous control. In other words, flying miles away using GPS is not regarded as legal and/or common sense (insurable). 2. Staying under certain heights when within a few miles of an airport - 400 feet is suggested when within 3 miles of an airport. Lots of other regs - but these are not legal or illegal in the strictest sense, just that the FAA as well as other groups work closely with the AMA and they are in basic agreement. In fact, many FAA employees also fly model aircraft!

Keep track of the locations, weather, and which drones and batteries you’re using. Get several drones and lots of batteries and SD cards and find places to fly where you can practice, practice, practice, then review your videos and practice some more. Around here, a few parks and school yards were recommended to me by a police officer. They’re often empty and you can practice mundane stuff like tracing the infield or lines on the football field. Learn how to control the drone using the sticks, especially when it’s headed toward you. Start with cheaper drones like Parrot Bebop or DJI Spark so crashes aren’t so very expensive. Move up to Mavic Air or Pro to use for close in work, get an Inspire or two, or Yuneec Typhoon H, that can heft a really good camera over a large area. Think about getting a better camera with telephoto lens if you’re going to be doing inspections, maybe a thermal camera if you can swing it. Figure out how RTH - Return To Home works and keep it set appropriately for where you’re at. The default RTH under trees on a wooded lot is a sure way to self-destruct a drone, can be quick, or you can listen to it confused and chewing on leaves until the battery gives out. Investigate mapping apps like DroneDeploy. They do a good job of figuring out how many images they need to stitch together to make a detailed map, and can even make oblique passes and do a good job of detailing structures. You set up the mission on your tablet, do the checklist, push the button, and watch the app fly the mission, ready to take over manually if needed. They are no substitute for actually learning to fly the things, but they automate one of the most requested jobs. Airplane student pilots have a list of precision maneuvers like S turns across a road, turns about a point, pylon turns, a few kinds of take-offs and landings, and other ways to demonstrate flight skills for the practical exam. Commercial pilots add lazy 8s and chandelles to the list and get coached on exactly how the examiner wants them flown. I haven’t found a definitive list for drone pilots yet, but have spent a lot of time working to perfect things like scanning a roof, 8s around two light poles, reversing around a stake or tree, tracing lines on a soccer field. I also do a lot of zooming through the woods and following the creek bed, enough that I don’t crash much anymore. When you go for an insurance policy you might be asked for a demo video showing you can control the drone, or even the website you’ll use to show off your stuff. Practice working the camera and gimbal so you can fly scenes of a few or several minutes smoothly. Get Camtasia, Adobe Premiere or other video compositor so you can put video up that somebody would pay for. Photoshop or one of the specialized photo editors Start checking out study guides for FAA 107 Small UAS - Unmanned Aircraft Systems and plan to sit for the exam. When you’ve got the certificate, register each drone you’ll use commercially and find an insurance policy that suits what you’ll be doing. I think drones are harder to fly than sitting in a cockpit, even though the modern drones pretty much fly themselves. A private pilot certificate takes all of 30 to 40 hours to get proficient on the maneuvers and fly a few cross-country flights to work on navigation. Most students can be ready to fly solo in four or five hours, never pull a wrong lever, but it’s easier when you’re sitting in the thing you’re controlling. I learned to land in a couple hours when I was 9, barely able to see over the panel. Dad was a pilot that loved to see me operate his stuff. It took me more than eight hours before I could fly a figure eight with a drone without spazzing out and crashing into a shrub or tree. Enjoy it all, learn from the crashes. I hope this ramble helps you consider a commercial drone certificate? The other answers also bring up good points.

6043630ded76476feda29b56,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Typhoon-H3-drone-good-for-photography?-,"I’m not getting one, but there are a lot of Yuneec aficionados at Yuneec Drone Forum that can’t wait to get an H3 with its Leica camera. It was announced and hyped at a big drone convention last week and the mail piece they sent me as a registered Yuneec pilot looks really good. It is pitched into the market to compete with the Mavic 2 Pro and its Hassleblad 1″ sensor. And the prices I’ve seen bandied about look maybe a bit more than the Mavic 2 Pro. I keep a pair of Typhoon Hs for their relatively cheap CGO-ET Thermal cameras, and their stock CGO3 cameras were one of the first, best 4K video. There are a couple other Yuneec cameras on the later models of their nice hexacopters with retractable gear. I don’t regret having a pair of Typhoon Hs left, but I wouldn’t get another one. My experience with them is that they can be nice flying drones, but they’ve got their foibles. It can take twenty minutes or more for them to refresh their GPS dictionary and they can drop back to ATTI mode with no stabilization in a heartbeat if they lose a couple of GPS, really need to wait for more than 11 or 12 where my other drones are stable with 7 or 8. I won’t fly mine under trees or close to anything, but they do a good job for flying over things, and they were first with a moderately priced thermal camera. There have been a lot of complaints at the Yuneec Pilots Form about Yuneec’s service to customers and dealers posted since I got my Typhoons and there are also a lot of happy flyers. There are not a lot, or hardly any, sometimes none or one of 3rd party software for mission planning, mapping, flight authorization where there are lots of choices and exciting new features for most of the DJI models. DJI makes their APIs easily available to developers, sells a Tello with a programmers toolkit to kids, and provides easy access to developers for their DJI GO and GO4 apps. If you want to scan the facade of a building or or tower or make a map you’ll be flying it by hand with the Typhoon where an Inspire or Mavic have powerful apps like UgCS PC Mission Planning or DroneDeploy or Litchi to help with flying and photography. If a nice camera with a big sensor is what you’re after, make sure you check out a DJI Inspire 1 V2 with a Zenmuse X5 or one of the later models with an X5S or later. These are full-sized cameras, the equivalent of a DSLR with a gimbal. They’ve got real apertures and shutters, a full line of Olympus lenses that have big optics and real optical zoom. I hope this helps you decide where you’ll put a couple or few thousand dollars. It remains to be seen about the H3 and it may be worth the wait to see how it turns out. All the trade rags have now is news of the new product and I haven’t seen any reviews yet, can’t say for sure. My first camera was a Leica, inherited from my dad when I was 11. I had use of a Hassleblad, the big format variety, in school. Either of them is enough to tilt me toward a drone, and my experience with Yuneec hasn’t been too bad, I’d like to try Leica lofted Yuneecly if I had cash to spare.

I think most of them crash and destroy themselves, some on their first flight. A Holy Stone Predator, Eachine E58, or the DroneX Pro that’s advertised a lot are all good little toy drones. Camera drones like DJI come in all sizes from the Teollo at $99, a Mini at $399, Mavics from $999 through $3999, and a big Matrice or badass Inspire 2 from $3999 to $9999+, dependiong on the camera or other sensors. They are GPS stabilized and most have downward vision systems to stabilize them even better, so they’re very easy to fly if everything’s working, so the pilot can focus on the camera. These are what’s used for real estate photos and videos and other aerial photography, inspections, mapping or survey. The best example would be a Mavic 2 Pro with a nice Hasselblad camera, or a Mavic Air 2, or even a Mavic Mini or the new DJI Mini 2 can get salable imagery. DJI is the market leader with these drones, has something like 85% of commercial and ‘prosumer’ drones flying. Parrot, Yuneec, Skydio, Autel, and a couple others try to compete. FPV Racing drones are crazy powerful and wicked hard to fly. They are pure sport and when flown with FPV goggles its a totally immersive experience. EMAX Hawks and Baby Hawks are a good example, as are the DRL-Drone Racing League Racers. They are a couple or few hundred dollars, a remote controller to fly them is a couple hundred dollars, and good FPV goggles like Fat Shark range from $300. They are not stabilized, don’t have GPS or vision systems, and most of them have a good gyro that will keep them level, but the best pilots turn it off and fly without it. They don’t get good quality video, as would be suitable for real estate, but it can feature aerobatics, sometimes through structures like grain elevators or warehouses, and can be thoroughly entertaining. They can be lethal, can bounce off something and go flying off at 100 mph and do some real damage. FPV Racing trainers are lightweight, not so crazy powerful, and are also hard to fly. The ‘tiny’ and ‘nano’ class trainers are made to fly indoors, and most have ducted props and are almost indestructable, which is good since you will crash a lot until you get the hang of it, and then crash less and less with practice. They fly with the same controllers and goggles as the Racing drones, so when you’ve practiced enough indoors so you won’t embarrass yourself, you can move outdoors with a more powerful model like a Tiny Hawk II or Tiny Hawk II Racer and crash outdoors. As far as I’m concerned, these are all ‘regular drones’, built for different purposes. The ‘camera drones’ are the ones that are regularly used for real estate photography. In the US, if drones are used commercially, even for a monetized video blog or social media account, or by an agent or owner doing photos to advertise a property they represent or own, it requires passing an exam for a commercial remote pilot certificate, which is similar to the exam commercial airplane and helicopter pilots take, since a commercial operator will be sharing the air with them. Recreational pilots flying drone that weigh more than 250 grams are required to check off a list of safety rules, pay $5, and download a certificate of registration to carry with them, with a registration number to put on their drones. If you haven’t seen it yet, the FAADroneZone is a good place to look at the rules and regulations for flying drones and RC models.

The cost of the fixed wing aircraft along with commercial pilot (Just like you are not allowed to take photos with the drone without the Aviation Authority permission, with fixed wing or helicopters the pilot you were with had to be a commercial pilot, not a private one), well, the cost was expensive.

I started with a kite (Google kite aerial photography), then went onto a hybrid balloon kite (Helium was expensive, and it had to be dumped afterward). Drones are now capable of getting better footage than ever, really the only reason helicopters are used now in tv and film is for footage that is really, really high up and innaccessible (Drones have a limited distance from transmitter), and for really fast shots (My Inspire 2 is rapid, but a helicopter is much, much faster). So yes, drones have revolutionised the aerial photography business, however there is a growing market in the fixed wing uav market for mapping etc (their flight time is fabulous!), and helicopters can't be beaten yet in some respects, for aerial video filming anyway.

They get 12 MegaPixels or better and I’ve seen fine landscape photos and videos from drones across the whole line of DJI camera drones. Although any of them can make acceptable images that look good on a web page, the cameras with larger sensors and lenses, plus real shutter and aperture, get higher quality images. The Mavic 2 Pro at $1700 has a Hasselblad with a big sensor and a larger lens that the Mavic Pro line and gets rave reviews. It can get spectacular panoramas by taking multiple image and stitching them together seamlessly to make huge, very high resolution images. But, the camera is fixed and has no interchangeable lenses. Any of the Inspires from 1 Version 2 have a Zenmuse X5 or better gimbal that’s the equivalent of a DSLR with large sensors, real shutters and aperture, and can use a range of Olympus lenses from wide-angle through optical zoom. $3000+ gets a good one, $5000 gets better, $7000+ gets the best. If you’re putting everything on the web, all those extra pixels don’t make a lot of difference. Although my Mavic 2 can get fantastic 4K video, I seldom shoot with it because it makes _huge_ files that take a long time to work with when editing after the flight. I usually shoot in 2K or 1080p and put out a video that’s 720p or smaller so it’ll load quick on a smartphone. I can see the difference between a Zenmuse X5, Mavic 2, and a Mavic Pro if I’m looking at a full-sized image on a big 4K monitor. But they’re all pretty much the same when put out to a web-browser. If you’re going after best image quality and have the budget, go for an Inspire 2 with a kit of lenses. Otherwise, a Mavic Air or Pro might be all you need? DJI got a lot of things right with the Air, which is an obnoxiously loud little drone, and lots of people like the images from it’s tiny little camera. These are exciting times for drones, and we’re expecting to see a lot of new models from DJI and others. Skydio just announced their new drone at $999 and it looks like it’s got similar camera specs to a Mavic 2 at $1700. Yuneec’s just announced a Typhoon H3 with a Leica for $2100. There’s wild speculation that DJI will release something like a Mavic Mini in place of the Spark, will weigh less than 8.8 ounces so it doesn’t need registration, and have a better camera. If there’s no rush, you might want to wait and see what’s new as the year ends…",2021-03-06T11:14:38.262Z,"What are the best DJI alternatives for drone landscape photography? ",Quora

These are needed to control depth of focus and capture the details and texture that a ‘real photographer’ needs to get consistently professional results. A Mavic Mini has maybe the best point-and-shoot camera there is on an inexpensive drone with a really good gimbal. It’s stabilized with GPS and downward vision systems. There is no drone comparable with the Mini for anywhere near $399, or $499 with a kit of extra batteries, a charger, and prop guards. But the Mini’s camera has tiny optics, no real shutter, no adjustable focus, and a small sensor. It’s videos and photos can be spectacular if seen on a smartphone or in a browser, but they’ll start to show loss of detail and texture if they need to be seen on a big, high-resolution monitor. The Mini excels at selfies, aka dronies, and does as well as the best of the smartphone cameras, is better because it flies. The Mini has a few intelligent ‘quickshot’ modes and can track the subject while it’s zooming back or around to put the subject into the surrounding cityscape or landscape. If you don’t need the adjustable aperture, big optics, mechanical shutter, and big sensor found on the best of the camera drones, costing $1800 through several thousand, there’s probably no better entry level camera drone. If you want to get into fpv racing drones, the Mini is too tame for that, but I don’t know of a better drone for $399 than a Mavic Mini. Get it with the FlyMore kit from the DJI store, or in the US Florida Drone Supply is an excellent outfit, ships the same day. As you regiter it, buy the CareRefresh package for $139 and DJI will replace your drone twice for $49 per crash.

Be it Phantom or the Mavic series. So you need not worry about the quality they offer and after-sales services. If budget is not a constraint then I would suggest Mavic 2 zoom is the best. The only downside to the Mavic 2 is the choice you need to make between the pricier ‘Pro’ and the ‘Zoom’. The Pro has a 1-inch image sensor (20 megapixels) at a fixed 28mm EFL but with adjustable aperture, 10-bit (HDR) video, and up to 12,800 ISO – great for sunsets and stills. The Zoom retains the still very decent 12 megapixels of its predecessor but has a zoom lens (24-48mm EFL) which is more useful for cinematic effects. Sometime soon it’ll be possible to have DJI swap them for you, but for now, you need to know what kind of photographer or filmmaker you are. Another option is DJI Mavic Air. This is the foldable drone you want in 2019. Technical specifications: Weight: 430g | Dimensions (folded): 168×83×49mm | Dimensions (unfolded): 168×184×64mm | Controller: Yes | Video resolution: 4K 60fps | Camera resolution: 12MP | Battery life: 21 minutes (2375mAh) | Max Range: 10km / 6.2mi) | Max Speed: 68kph / 43mph. These two drones are the best as per my selection. There are still other drone makers but when it comes to the quality I would like to stick loyally with DJI.

Otherwise, on a phone, small monitor, or web page, the better camera makes little or no discernible difference. The Inspire 2 and ZenMuse may be the best for the price. But, very few people really need one unless they’re working on scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean or real cinema. They’re about $8,000, and the way less expensive Mavic Air 2 or Mini 2, or the Mavic 2, get photos and videos that can be spectacular. If you need a real aperture to control depth of focus to get that desirable bokeh, you can get that with a Mavic 2 of Phantom Pro. The forum at InspirePilots.com has as many ads in the classified section for Inspire 2s for sale as it does questions about the Inspires. There are always Inspire 2s for sale at eBay. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to buy a used Inspire because DJI’s CareRefresh and CareRefresh+ policies are only offered for new or refurbished drones, but you might want to consider them. A Mavic Pro Platinum, Air 2, or Mavic 2 is all that most commercial droners need. We’d all love to have an couple Inspire 2s with X7s, but can buy three or four very capable drones and a lot of batteries with $8000+.

A DJI Inspire 1 V2 with a Zenmuse X5 might be the best value. The X5 will take a full range of Olympus and DJI lenses, is like a DSLR on a drone. You can get one for a bit less than $2500. An Inspire 2 with a Zenmuse X7 and a nice lens comes in at less than $5000 and is even more capable. It goes beyond ‘photography’ to ‘cinematography’. Google around a bit and you’ll find lots of examples, including Pirates of the Caribbean and other blockbusters. If you’ve got a favorite camera, it might be compatible with one of the larger drones with a gimbal that can hold a full-sized camera. A DJI Matrice or Intel Falcon 8 can carry most any camera for something like $5000 to $9000. If you just want to get good landscape videos and don’t need to fill a big screen with 4K or better, a Mavic Mini at $399 is OK and will do 2K, a Mavic Pro at $999 does an OK 4K, or a Mavic 2 Pro with a Hasselblad and one inch sensor does 4K even better and is still on sale for about $1400. I think my Mavic 2 Pro does a fantastic job with 4K video, but when I put its video side-by-side with the same site shot with a Zenmuse X5 the X5 beats it for detail and texture. I can’t afford any of the higher-priced options, but if you can, get one and enjoy photographing landscapes. The Mavic 2 Pro can do seamless panoramas that get 48 megapixels, and it can get amazingly HD hyperlapse scenes. It’s got a real, adjustable aperture, big sensor, and excellent optics to satisfy a photographer. It might be today’s best value for a 4K capable camera drone. 1",2021-03-06T11:33:19.998Z,"What drone should I buy for landscape photography in 2020? ",Quora

The Mavic 2 is also about the quietest drone on the market so it isn’t going to offend the drone-haters that are always around. If I’ll be flying over things an the best I’ve got is an Inspire 1 with a Zenmuse X3 or X5 camera. With the X3 camera an Inspire can map an 80-acre site on one batteryThe X5 has real shutter and handles several lenses from Olympus’ DSLR lineup, is like $1999 through $3999. Inspire 2 is even better if I could afford it, starts at $3999 and goes way up for an X7 and some lenses. Either is the most badass looking and sounding drone on the market, IMHO, neither is particularly quiet, either is my favorite drone to fly when I can. The application software available might influence the ‘best’ decision. DJI’s drones run DroneDeploy, Litchi, lots of other mapping and mission planning software. If surveying and mapping to centimeter scale is better you’ll need something like a rig with a Phantom 4 RTK-Real Time Kinetic update drone and a GPS system at maybe $7999. LIDAR’s better than photography and becoming affordable for those who think it’s best… DJI’s regarded as the best at every price point between toys and enterprise, and will be coming out with new products most any day now, and I bet they’ll be the best. Lot’s of brand loyalty here… Intel Falcon-8, Yuneec’s big hexacopters, Autel, Parrot, Skydio, TinyHawk S, and lots of others all claim to be the best at something… Good luck finding the best for you. If you’re new at it and wondering what’s the best to get, I’d say find a refurbished Mavic Pro Platinum for $729 at the DJI.com store, under Discounts or a Pro at similar price if there’s no Platinum. The Platinum is significantly better/quieter than a plain Pro, but either might be best for you. Anything you buy from their refurbished list qualifies for DJI Care, and their care is the best…",2021-03-06T11:33:45.222Z,"Is there any company which can do aerial photography by drone in Cuttack?

A DJI Mavic Air is not quite a professional but it’s got an excellent little camera but is over your $400 limit, so is a Parrot Anafi.

The directorate general of civil aviation has come up with draft regulations on civil use of drones which will also enable commercial use of drones for tasks like photography, doorstep delivery and even passenger transport, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju announced on Wednesday. Under the draft rules, the drones are classified into five categories based on their maximum take-off weight: nano (upto 250 gm), micro (251 gm to two kg), mini (2 kg to 25 kg), small (25 kg to 150 kg) and large (greater than 150 kg). Addressing reporters here, the minister said that draft regulations, arrived at after prolonged discussions with various stakeholders, would be placed in the public domain for a month to seek comments and suggestions from the public, after which rules would be finalised. “By December 31, we will be in a position to come up with final regulatory framework for usage of drones,” civil aviation secretary RN Choubey added. “Except for nano category and those operated by government security agencies, all other commercial categories of drones will be registered by DGCA which will issue it a Unique Identification Number,” Choubey said. A statement from the civil aviation ministry said that mini and above categories will require Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit while model aircraft upto 2 kg flown below 200 feet inside educational institution premises will not require the permit or identification number. Remote pilots of the drones will have to undergo requisite training except in case of nano and micro categories, the statement added. The draft rules also imposed some restrictions on use of drones in terms of no-fly zones which include area within 5 km from an airport, within 50 km from international border, beyond 500 metres into the sea along the coastline, within 5 km radius from Vijay Chowk in Delhi and from mobile platform such as a moving vehicle, ship or aircraft. They would also not be permitted to fly over densely populated areas without prior approval and over areas affecting public safety or where emergency operations are underway, the statement added.

Many of them are not even considering the option of using a drone in such an operation so you just have to connect with the person in-charge. Don’t waste time on low-ranking officers. Search for the one who is authorised to sign the contract with you. Bring your drone along, explain the benefits and take them “for a ride.” Let them see the advantages. Heck, give the man a remote and let him “feel” the flight. Everyone — men in particular — gets really impressed by the experience, because it’s not only highly efficient but it also awakens the child within. A great combo when you think about it. In next step, think agriculture. Endless fields are easy to inspect from a single place and most of the folks who are making their living by cultivating vast acres of land are struggling to keep everything in their sight - especially during the harvesting season because having drones overseeing the workforce reduces the need for human controllers. Then, there are surveillance types of jobs. Photography and video of every kind. Each and every option is bringing money, but energy industry is your best option. Only, you’ll have to be in the move and have a precise plan of action to save on expenses. You may use cold email or a phone call but just to open the door. Live presentation and smart pitch are landing contracts. Thus, you’re on your own to market your business. The business which easily brings 5 figures a month.

This curved road runs for kilometres and gives us a great view of the beach and shores. With many pepole flocking here even in working days, the Marine drive has emerged to become one of the city's most visited tourist spots.  A view which simply looks breathtaking! This picture is of the Elphinstone circle area after the rains have dried up. This area is from South Mumbai and has a lot of banking branches and office complexes nearby.  A scenic view of both the Taj hotel and Oberoi hotel after the rains have dried up. Taj is one of the oldest hotels in India and is located around the banks of the Arabian Sea.  A view of the ‘City that never sleeps’ at night. This is what the city of Mumbai is known as and it proudly adheres to the name in many ways. It is always a treat to watch Mumbai at midnight during any season.  Mumbai is one of the few Indian cities that uses double decker buses as a means of public transport. This tradition has been followed for a long time and the double decker buses in the city have gained quite a cult status over the years.   The railway network of Mumbai remains one of the busiest in the country. During the monsoon, dark skies cover the city and occasionally brings about some lightning with it. Despite that, the trains receives many visitors and still operate, which is astonishing.  This is my favorite picture out of all. I like the view from where the picture was taken and also the beautiful sight of clouds starting to appear on the sky. Also notice the attractive lightnings and the busy surroundings around the building, which is typical of the city. These pictures were clicked during the monsoon of 2018 by a number of photographers.

For those who like to scrapbook their adventures or document their journeys online, a photo of yourself standing in front of a famous landmark is a necessity. However, very few travellers, new and seasoned alike, are aware that there is an array of countries where it is illegal to photograph famous tourist attractions. Taking photos of the below iconic sights is banned: 1. Planes over Mai Khao Beach (Phuket, Thailand) Thanks to the close proximity of the Phuket International Airport to Mai Khao beach, many tourists have been able to snap themselves with a low-flying plane. However, this practice has become illegal (punishable by death!) in order to reduce distractions for the pilots and improve tourist safety.  2. The Eiffel Tower at night (Paris, France) Thanks to European copyright law, works by artists, designers and architects are protected until 70 years after the death of the creator. The designer of the Eiffel Tower, Gustave Eiffel, died in 1923, so it’s perfectly legal to photograph the tower during the day. However, Pierre Bideau, the artists who added the lights to the tower is still alive, it’s technically illegal to photograph the tower when it’s all lit up.  3. The Atomic Sculpture (Brussels, Belgium) This tourist attraction is covered by the same copyright laws as the Eiffel Tower.  4. The Crown Jewels at the Tower of London (London, England) Protected by bombproof glass, more than 100 hidden CCTV cameras and guards stationed at every door, you’ll find that taking a photo of The Crown Jewels is banned.  5. Pandas (Sichuan Province, China) Photographing the pandas that live in Sichuan Province in China was made illegal in order to preserve the population of this endangered animal. The law was brought in to deter tourist from getting too close to get a panda with the pandas.  6. Emirates Palace Hotel (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates) In the United Arab Emirates copyright law enforces that the subject of photo has legal rights to the image, not the photographer. As such, many areas in the UAE banned photography, such as palaces, bridges, government areas and this hotel.  7. Shinjuku Golden Gai District (Tokyo, Japan) Known for being a popular drinking area of small streets packed with mini bars where only 4 to 6 people can fit in alongside the bartender, the Golden Gai District in Tokyo is heavily signed with ‘photography banned’ warnings.  8. Everything (North Korea) North Korea has only just started allowing state-approved tourist groups into the country, and photographing pretty much anything is illegal.  9. Uluru Kata-Tjuta National Park (Northern Territory, Australia) It’s illegal to photograph Uluru (or Ayer’s Rock) for commercial purposes, which includes social media.  10. Inside the Taj Mahal (Agra, India) Photography is prohibited within the main mausoleum of the Taj Mahal, as are drones. Furthermore, Mobile phones are also banned for night viewing of the Taj Mahal.  11. The Valley of the Kings (Luxor, Egypt) The famous walk forbids tourists from photographing the sights, with fines up to AU$161 handed out to offenders.  12.

Bob refers to your homeowner’s insurance, which has limitations for property used in your business. No, if you are a professional photog, then you do, or you should, have insurance covering that business. If you DON’T, then consider it. Now as to “drones.” First of all, there is no “drone insurance,” unless an ordinary property floater (such as a camera floater) has been styled as drone insurance purely for marketing purposes. You have styled yourself as a “drone photographer.” Which COULD mean you simply have a copter with a camera, and promote yourself as some kind of specialist. But, no matter, you are a photographer who specializes in architectural photography, as opposed, to, for example, portraiture (Olan Mills stuff). And your question about “drone insurance” portrays someone who is not well informed on insurance for your trade. Be aware that, before there was “drone photography,” there was “balloon photography,” in which a camera was mounted to a small, tethered, blimp which floated over someone’s house or business and snapped a picture. The photographer, picture in hand, would then knock on a homeowner’s door to sell the owner a picture of his own home, seen from above. But that is different from a professional photographer who is skilled and equipped to shoot many kinds of subjects, ranging from portraits, to weddings, to landscapes, to products for catalogs, and everything in between. And those professionals, in addition to their cameras and developing equipment (or computers), have many ancillary devices to assist them: tripods, risers, light sets and numerous other gadgets. Of which a “drone” or a balloon would be just one. So, your next move is to forget about “drone insurance,” and find an insurance agent who is qualified to recommend coverage for a photographer. And on the list of insured equipment will be your drone, just a tool of the trade, like any other. Together with covering your equipment, a photographer’s policy will pick up the special liability exposures for photographers. Hope that helps.",2021-03-06T12:26:46.939Z,"What sort of drone insurance would you recommend for a drone photographer? ",Quora

For $75, it is comparable to a GoPro while also looking way better and costing loads cheaper. However, for a beginner, the $400 price tag may be a bit steep. If you are looking for a really inexpensive and half decent drone, go for the Syma X5c. For $50, you get well, $50 worth of drone. However this is a quad where the Cam probably cost more than the actual thing, but, that's not all. It has low range as well as a terrible camera (watch youtube vids and decide for yourself). The battery life is OK, lasts about 10 min. Oh yeah, and it will last maybe 5 good months before you get bored with it. These are the two ends of the spectrum. I saved the best for last of course. For you I would recommend the Syma X8C. While the DJI asks for a hefty $400, and the Syma X5c will basically waste $50, the Syma X8c should be the perfect balance. It looks like a knock-off Phantom because it is one. With an asking price of just under $100, this one will definitely keep you happy for at least a year (at which point you should be shopping around for a Phantom or something comparable). It's battery life is decent though the biggest area of concern would be it's weight. It's significantly heavier than most drones and in turn also moves much slower. However, for a beginner like you, that can be advantageous. It has a good camera (maybe more than the drone, maybe less). If and when you do buy one of these three, never fly it inside. Vid footage won't be cool and you'd probably cost at least a little bit of damage. Of course if you do want an indoor drone. Take a look at the Hubsan line. These drones hover around $50(no pun intended), about the size of your hand and are small and sturdy enough for a beginner to fly it indoors.

Most if photography is composition and working with light (natural or artificial). I have also seen people take really bad pictures with a $40,000 medium format camera. If you meant a professional photographer, then maybe. It depends what you shoot. Cameras are tools we use to take pictures. Like with most other things, a better tool can aid you in doing something easier, faster, and better in certain cases. I'll try to explain this with some examples. Example 1: Let's say you really enjoy street photography. There are different styles of street photography so let's say you enjoy the proverbial “fly on the wall"" style, meaning you don't want people to notice you and go about their business. Sure you can buy an expensive medium format camera with 100 megapixels that will take amazing shots. But chances are you'll be able to capture much better pictures with a simple point an shoot camera. Obviously because the point and shoot is less noticeable than a hulking medium format camera. Example 2: Let's say you enjoy taking portrait, fashion, or even landscape pictures. You can take the exact image with any camera, but a medium format camera will give you a much better results than a point and shoot or even a DSLR. Of course that doesn't mean you can't use a regular DSLR, most people do because they don't have thousands of dollars to buy one camera. So, do you need an expensive camera to be a good photographer? No. Can an expensive camera help taking great pictures? Yes. But so can a cheap camera depending on the situation. I'm just gonna through in my 2cents eventhough there are good answers already.

Mavic Mini just got into reviewers’ hands last week so there will be lots of reviews and videos this week… The Mavic Mini is not released quite yet, won’t be shipping or ready for pickup until 11/11. The early reviewers got theirs last week and they love it. The Mavic Mini’s not going to be a replacement for a Mavic Pro or Mavic 2 but at $399 plus some kit it will be all some people want or need for casual video and photos. It’s got a good camera with a 1/2.3 sensor stabilized with a 3-axis gimbal. It doesn’t get 4K, but who needs it? It does HD at 2.7 and 1080 and 12 megapixel photos.

The drone is limited to 400 feet above the ground or away from tall object, but the ideal altitude for mapping is less than that for many applications. It used to take a pilot and a guy hunched over a camera aimed through a hatch in the floor of something like a Cessna 310 or an Aero Commander 580, or a helicopter to get images for mapping. The pilot had a grid marked on a sectional chart and tried to fly it while bumping around in a loud airplane at 500 feet. Nobody but the photographer saw anything until the film was developed at a lab like Galeski had for it here in River City, where all the frames were printed edge to edge on big paper, applying some ortho correction. The prints were assembled jigsaw fashion on a big table or floor, maybe a hangar, and there’s your map. Using a stereoscope on the slightly different angles of objects in the overlapping nadir images, an analyst can measure and estimate heights and volumes of structures pretty close.

Assuming that the use is ""okay"" under the 4th Amendment, it would be per se reasonable, and you'd have no 14th Amendment due process issues; the only possible problem would be the use of such technology in an illegally discriminatory manner - but that's independent of the technology itself. The same goes for the 5th Amendment, which isn't really implicated until or unless you are giving a custodial statement to police; again, if it's okay to use them as surveillance devices under the 4th Amendment, there's no violation of your 5th Amendment rights in their use.

I found lots of articles like these: 3 Reasons to Use Drones for Your Real Estate Advertising | Drones. And, ‘real estate photography’ is at the top of most articles about ‘how to make money with a drone’. There’s also mapping and surveying with mapping engines like DroneDeploy, UgCS, or OpenDroneMap but you’ve got to be a surveyor to call the result a ‘map’ or ‘survey’, which are protected terms. There’s inspection of construction sites, antennae, and towers, but some of those require a certified inspector. Lots of companies are outfitting their licensed surveyors and engineers with drones and getting them certified under FAA Part 107, so they don’t need to hire drone pilots any more. That leaves stuff like real estate photography, weddings, and outdoor events for those who don’t have other certifications than commercial remote pilot, which is required for any kind of commercial work. I recently paid $29 to an outfit in Canada for a short course on drones in real estate and the expert they interview and follow around on jobs keeps himself and a crew busy working for real estate agents in their metro area and they get excellent to spectacular results in the videos and photos they produce. People like to see the whole property, the neighborhood it’s in, and the roads, shops, and schools that are nearby. How much more successful drone shots flying over are vs. walking around with a camera, I can’t say for sure, but the drone sure makes a better show of it, IMHO.

Check out the FAA Drone Zone for more details: FAADroneZone The regulations are changing so that recreational pilots will be required to pass a test and earn a certificate before flying a drone. Meanwhile, recreational pilots check off a list of safety regulations at The Drone Zone, pay $5, and get a certificate of registration to carry with a number to put on their drones. If everybody actually _followed_ the rules they promised along with $5 tendered, there would be no reason for parks to forbid drones and nobody would be launching them inappropriately. But there are people who ignore or are ignorant of the rules. All National Parks are no-fly zones, btw, and some National Forests identify places not to launch and recommend safe places. If the airspace above the park is not otherwise restricted by the FAA the drone can fly over the park. The drone’s flying legally if it’s not not peeping into private spaces, or out of visual line of sight, or flying over a crowd, or too close to people. Parks and municipalities can and do restrict takeoff and landing within their boundaries, or may designate safe areas to take off and land. If they didn’t, there would always be some idiot who thinks it’s OK to launch his drone on a crowded walkway, discover he doesn’t know how to control it, and slice up somebody’s nose, or worse. Google video I watched a stoner who had set up a beach chair and a cooler on a soccer field on a hot summer day, had a camera on a tripod to get video of him flying his drones. He got video of more and more stupid things, flying around wildly and demonstrating no fine control of the aircraft. Then put on his FPV goggles and flew his Spark out a couple miles, let it return to home, and when he got it back into controller range, he attempted to make a dramatic pass in front of his video camera, and flew the drone into an elderly guy walking by. The Spark flying at about 40mph knocked the old man over, broke or sprained his ankle, and tore his shoulder. He got EMT and poleece response plus the park managers. The park still has posted no drone rules, and its 4 soccer fields are empty most of the time. It’s easy to fly there legally. Now, managers and the police who’re through the park a time or two an hour will watch a drone pilot and ask to see registration. I’m delighted I’ve got mine, and all the encounters have been pleasant. A park manager even offered me a job, tells me the best places to fly in our county parks… There are plenty of parks that do restrict takeoff and landing, so you need to check for signs, or check the internet before you go.

Both still and video photography have their separate market places but they come together on social media. I see this only as a positive contribution to the greater understanding of wildlife. As a wildlife photographer I’ve never gone down the video route but I’ve usually been happy to coexist with film crews. Drone photography is different. Whereas still and video photography is largely passive in the environment the drone can easily become an active influence. I’ve seen many drone videos where the animals are disturbed and frightened. If a photographer spooks an animal that’s the end of the opportunity. When a drone spooks an animal that’s not the end, it can so easily be chased and herded, often resulting in spectacular footage which only encourages more of the same. One of the first uses of drones in Namibia was by poachers looking for rhino, consequently they were immediately banned from our National Parks. I see this as a very good move.

William Meredith shot down a drone flying at, according to Meredith, about 100 feet above his property.

When Boggs and three other men arrived at Meredith’s home, Meredith said, If you cross my sidewalk, there will be another shooting. Thirty minutes after Boggs called 911, Meredith was arrested.
