My best advice would be to NOT go with the self learning path... here's why when you self learn there are many things that can make you lose interest... and im sure everyone would agree it is not the fastest option you have when it comes to learn something.. theoretically its possible to learn with just the same speed as someone would in an institution but everyone knows that in reality that's impossible. I'm gonna have to suggest you to save up some money and go to the nearest vfx institution you have in your city ASAP. The knowledge you'll gain there is and will be totally the same, but you won't have to put in the additional extra efforts one has to when he is self learning, and believe me those extra efforts aren't worth it when you don't have that much time, Because you're in your mid 20's you really have less time to get a kickstart in this field... and that kickstart is basically impossible to achieve while self learning. Now the institution you go to will offer you a number of different courses and prices could be sky high. They will explain you the specifics of each course if you don't yet know the difference between the software they'll teach you but do go in there with a bit of homework and research beforehand.",2021-03-05T13:45:41.682Z,"How can I make a career in 3D modeling and animation?

This pushes down salaries and working conditions. But the most talented people can still succeed.

There are plenty of jobs available in Archviz, Games, Product Viz and commercial type stuff. Not so many in studios that make feature length films or animated series for television. For games, there are more prop and environment modelling jobs than there are character modelling and animation. Games from large studios tend to have people that specialize as opposed to generalist who can do everything. For Architecture, Product Viz, and Commercials, you will be expected to be a 3d generalist who can render very well. Final image quality is more important than traditional modelling skills as a lot of premade assets are used. There are lots and lots of these smaller studios everywhere who tend to employee like 15 to 30 people. Without an “in” (usually from school or something) you will not be able to get a bare bones entry level position or internship. Your portfolio will need to be as good as people who are currently working in the industry. Starting from zero knowledge and working at it everyday it probably takes about 2–3 years to get your skills to the level they need to be to land an entry level job. I recommend going to a site like polycount and asking for a portfolio review if you are unsure of your current skill level.",2021-03-05T13:46:24.047Z,"How hard is it to make a career out of 3D modelling and animation?

Although we refer to it as “computer generated” the computer just computes the lighting and pixels. The 3d animation is done by-hand by real animators. The 3d models are built by-hand by artists. CGI is hugely labour intensive business. And the primary cost is manpower. Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia cost more than their cell-animated equivalents would have done. Huge effort has gone into designing the background world. Architecting individual buildings. Designing vehicles, crafting characters. Painting every pixel of every surface by hand. The garbage bag in this image might have taken more artist time than the entire background of the image from Dalmatians. Each individual car certainly would.  It’s not about availability of artists. If there were secure careers in hand-drawn animation, there would be plenty of animators happy for the work. The analytical and artistic skills needed to walk a rabbit on a computer-screen are actually very similar to the skills needed to do it by cell animation. I think the main reason for the transition is simply quality. The new process allows a studio to create a better-looking and a better performed movie with these tools. Great art needs iteration, and it’s easier to iterate in this digital space than in the hand-drawn space. A weak bit of digital animation can be refined. Some additional keyframes can be added, the performance can be sharpened, retimed, the lighting can be changed, the camera can be repositioned. With a hand-drawn solution, you simply can not move the camera, or shift a light. You literally have to go back to the drawing board. So, what is cheaper is not creation but iteration. More iteration can happen and that means that a better product is attainable at the end of the schedule. Pixar introduced a notion called “plussing”. That meant not stopping when the shot was adequate. The sequences, scripts and performances were improved and improved until they was as good as it could possible be. It’s the ability to create a product with such high quality that drives studios towards this form of animated film-making.",2021-03-05T13:50:15.404Z,"Why has Disney stopped doing hand drawn animated films?

I'd like to say that Maya is probably the most feature rich and animator friendly 3D package that I've used until recent years. The problem with picking a software is that there are software solutions geared towards particular use cases, meaning that some software will be better suited for certain types of animation or uses, not exclusively but none the less some software will be better for particular tasks. Cinema 4D is pretty easy to pick up, the rigging tools are great fun to work with if you need to do any TD work or just rig your own models for animation and it's really easy to pickup, you won't struggle with it very much and the interface isn't as clustered as some other solutions out there. The animation tools are great to work with too and if that wasn't enough you get the added bonus of the modeling and sculpting features which help in some cases. The software as a whole if you compare it to something like 'Maya' will appear to be lesser in some ways, but if you're looking for an easy jump-start to getting into the realm of 3D animation then Cinema 4D might be the best place to start. MODO is another software that I now use exclusively for all of my animation works, it took me a little tweaking of the navigational controls for the software to get used to things at first, the interface appears a little 'more' than the previous mentioned solution but its very easy to hide everything you don't need and customize anything and everything. The animation tools are very powerful, the modeling tools are extremely more compelling than that of Cinema 4D and Maya (in my opinion) and the rigging tools are easier to work with than Maya after some getting used to the workflow. With all of that being said there is a little learning curve when you get started so it might not be the best place to start for someone who is easily overwhelmed or doesn't want to fiddle with things to make the workflow simplified or easier to take in, however you will get more out of it in the long run than Cinema 4D. (but the price is higher) Lightwave is one of those software that I feel many people have just forgotten about, it was used a lot by industry artists (and still is by some) and the feature set is nice, the pricing is pretty awesome too. I haven't used the latest version of this software but from what I remember from using it in the past is that it wasn't hard to pick up at all, it's powerful and very easy to get up and running with. Maya is the all round best 3d animation package I've used it's not as easy to grasp right off the bat and there is a lot thrown at you, but its hands down the greatest animation workflow I've used for games and production based scenes. I've used Maya professionally and personally for approximately ten years maybe a little longer if you count my teen years of experimenting but I have recently switched away from it due to the change of business model to subscription only from perpetual licensing. Blender is something I've used on a few projects where it was a requirement, perhaps this is because I've worked with other premium solutions for so long but when using it I felt the animation tools were lacking, the rigging was buggy and the interface was heavily clustered with limiting customizable options for the interface without delving into python code and sometimes source code. That being said the tools are there, they are very capable of creating high quality animations but I felt the learning curve was slightly higher than the other options out there but where there financial constraints you really cannot go wrong with this one, it definitely has some extreme potential! and is already used by many upcoming indie game developers and studios.  While I've very briefly listed the software above you may need ot take into consideration the pricing attached to each one, while some are easier to use than others or require less of a learning curve the financial side of it is often a little oddly scaled in comparison to some and you may find yourself compromising to something that might have a higher learning curve but be financially sound compares to the convenient solution that would hurt the wallet a little more. My personally grudge against Autodesk for dropping standalone licensing in favour of an on-going monthly to yearly fee left me switching to a whole new software simply because of the nature of my business and how I'm managing things with my newly formed company. Something that may come into consideration when someone new is looking to learn something they can use as a hobby and then go professional with later (which is why Blender is such a widely used solution despite the learning curve)  My personal opinion is that Maya offers the most for animators, MODO gives you the best pricing scheme and OS support with the most features and a great upgrade pricing structure whereas Cinema4D offers the ease of use coupled with an extensive set of tools.  A small note, I am a Linux user and when switching from Maya I had to make sure that I could find a software solution that would work across windows and Linux, I use Windows for work and Zbrush as that doesn't yet support Linux but Lightwave doesn't offer Linux support so I didn't even consider it when I was personally looking for an alternative to Maya. Since switching from Maya to MODO I have to say I am more impressed than I thought that I'd be with the software and I love the companies dedication, so many great improvements came with the last update and the price of upgrading the license is so minor compared to the extreme prices Autodesk had been charging in the past, another factor for me switching from Maya was not the software itself nor because I found something 'better' as a whole but I've founded my own game development studio and I am personally funding the entire venture which is costly in both time and money, an on-going subscription based system for me would just result in wasted money, sometimes I don't use my 3d software for weeks to a month or two where I handle so much business and management stuff for the company and atop that I handle more than just the 3d works currently. I wanted to express this here because I've mentioned above about switching from the software that I listed to be the best solution for someone wanting to get into 3d animation.  So if money isn't an issue and the subscription doesn't bother your needs then Maya is the way to go, if you have money issues Blender is the best solution, if blender is too hard to grasp for you or too clumsy for whatever reason and Maya's subscription only system isn't to your taste then Cinema 4D will be the cheapest most easy to use solution out there for animating anything and everything.  I hope this helps in some way, it's not the most detailed answer but hopefully you will find the right solution for your needs, what I would suggest is using one or two of the most suggested software solutions and see which you feel most comfortable with. Whatever you choose to use I doubt that you will regret it, all of the above listed options are 'very' capable and will allow you to create high quality animations of any kind. Also consider where you want to go with it, if you want to use as an indie and make a career for yourself of if you want to learn something to use at a job with a big studio, chances are you'll have to pickup Maya or one of the larger software that are being used by the type of company you'd like to work for, many of the larger companies out there will not let you use what you know over what they know. However, some of the smaller companies will not mind but it will be hard to find such a company that will hire you, so keep this in mind when you're picking a software too!

With that said, remember that 2D skills will never hurt your 3D performance, though a lack of 2D skills will limit your abilities.

If you intend to make environments you will need to learn photography and composition as an artist. Whatever you plan to make, there are ways that 2D art will enhance your capabilities, and that lack of it may limit them. Unlike some of the posters here, I will not claim that you do not need 2D art skills to make good 3D art. You do not need to be a master, but if you wish to create 3D art from your own head, not simply from other people's designs, you will absolutely need the skills that 2D art gives you: * You will need the ability to measure proportions and shapes by sight and by some sense of touch (as you build shapes, it can be a tactile experience, though it's very abstract in most 3D packages). * You will need the ability to gesture and work from broad strokes with low detail towards high detail. Gesture images and sketches will allow you to get ideas in place and judge thee feel of them before you commit to details. * You will need the ability to break down objects into shapes, whether those shapes are perfect representations of the actual thing or not. This skill will allow you to compose forms in 3D more easily, especially for the purpose of blocking. These are just a few ways that 2D art skills will help you with 3D work. However, as you specifically mention animation, I would like to offer a very strong suggestion of another field you should study somewhat: Theatre and Acting. Once again, you don't need to become a masterful actor, but there is so much to learn from the study of theatre performance for the benefit of character animation, and how to make a character seem alive and intentional. If all you want is a short version: Learning more will never hurt your ability to produce good work, but it is not strictly necessary to learn other things _before_ you start to learn in the field you want.",2021-03-05T14:01:31.525Z,"I want to learn 3D modeling and animation Do I need to learn 2D art befor learning 3D?

Try to set clear and specific goals for yourself. This is something that you will have to do to begin with, since the field of 3D animation is quite vast, but you will have to get back to that often, since your preferences and interests might change, when you get deeper into the field. 3D animation is not a single skill, but a range of skills, and that range can get quite wide, from art skills like sketching and drawing to very technical skills like programming etc. At the beginning, it would help to get a basic grasp on most of the tasks and processes related to 3D animation, just to have an understanding of what each task is and what kind of skills it needs. After you have a general idea of how modelling, rigging, animation, lighting and rendering work, as well as how simulation and effects are created, it will be easier to decide, whether you would like to specialize in one specific area, or picking a more of a 3D generalist’s path to learning 3D. It is all about weighing out your strengths and weaknesses, but also finding the areas which you naturally enjoy. Since 3D animation production is usually quite time consuming, meaning you will be spending endless hours in front of your computer screen, you should think about what you would enjoy doing, for long periods of time, without getting sick of it. Understand the required skills and knowledge that you need. Many have struggled to reach a certain level of quality in their animation skillset, due to a wrong understanding of what is required to be good at certain tasks. It is very common, for people to dive really deep into the technical aspects of modelling, for example, learning all of the ins and outs of a 3D software package, endlessly learning new techniques and watching tutorials, while underestimating the more “traditional” art skills like drawing or sculpting and not paying attention to the essential principles of correct proportions, postures, expressions, composition etc. Producing good animations takes much more than just learning the tools you will be using, building good 3D models is only a small part of the production. You will need to be able to plan well, developing your characters visually, which is much more efficient on paper or by using digital drawing, organize your shots, by at least producing some basic storyboards, understand how lighting works, produce appropriate shaders and textures and much more. As I have explained many times here on quora, good pre-production is more often than not, what will make your animations and imagery stand-out from the rest, not just the technical skills. So understand the field you want to specialize in, and create a mind map of all the things that can help you grow creatively in that field. Learning photography, painting, Film-making, even physics and mathematics, can bring your art from an “amateurish” level to professional. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t start learning to produce 3D projects right away, but you shouldn’t be expecting AAA quality results, just because you know how to use the software tools in your arsenal. Just knowing how to hold a pencil and a piece of paper, doesn’t make you a good artist. So keep analyzing your strengths and weaknesses at all times, and find creative ways to improve your artistic perception and understanding. Practice, practice, practice and rest. Producing 3D art and animation is something that is learnt only by constant practice. No matter how many books you have read about it or how many tutorials you have watched, if you don’t practice your skills regularly, you will struggle to become a good 3D artist. This is true for most Creative fields, and that is what often makes them very hard to master. You need to develop a good perception of aesthetics, teach your instincts to understand what looks right and what doesn’t, what looks appealing and what does not. Because our conscious brain works in abstractions mostly, which tends to simplify things that we see with our eyes, it takes time for your brain to learn to perceive motion and forms correctly. Even producing a good walking cycle for a character, can be quite a daunting task for a beginner. You might have seen people walking millions of times in your life, but that doesn’t mean that you know how to animate someone walking, because your brain translates the walk into a “symbolic” motion, rather than analyzing how each part moves, the timing etc. So in order to be a good artist, you need to train your mind to see and perceive the world as an artist, and that only comes with active conscious practice. That’s why many professional artists in 3D and other fields, practice skills like life drawing, sculpting, photography etc. which can help you develop your artistic perception and the correct understanding of the essential principles , required for animation, much more efficiently than trying to learn all of them solely in a 3D environment of your software package. But, of course, you will have to practice your 3D skills just as much, to be able to bring your visions into the “digital reality” efficiently. Finally, whilst practicing a lot, helps someone master the craft, letting yourself rest, when required, is just as important. It will give you the freshness of mind, that will boost your creativity and organize your brain, so that you can continue further. So don’t underestimate a quality “rest-day” in your path to 3D mastery. Learn self-organization and self-motivation. This might not be something directly related to 3D animation only, but it is often the main reason why most people don’t succeed in the world of 3D art. We can’t expect our “passion” for any craft to be at its high constantly. There are days when you just can’t wait to get your hands dirty in 3D and the related tasks, but there will be days or even months, where you just can’t even double-click on your 3D program’s icon on your desktop, to make a start on something. But your art skills are not very merciful, and if you don’t practice regularly, your progress will slow down very quickly, or even reach a “plateau”. People in sports, understand this principle very well, that is why they train daily, to keep their minds and body in shape. It is unlikely that somebody can become a professional football or hockey player, by having one practice session per month. So in fields like music performance, painting, 3D animation and the like, the same logic applies, just like our body, our mind needs to be in a certain cycle of activity to be able to stay productive and flexible enough to learn new things. Also, since most of the time, when learning 3D animation we are accompanied with the comfort of our room, it takes discipline and good organizational skills to keep yourself growing and expanding your skillset. It is very easy to get distracted and lower the quality of your learning process, or just procrastinate from doing anything useful and start watching something on Youtube instead. Doing something regularly is what will keep your progress on fire. If you can’t start by sitting many hours working on your skills, it is usually better to allow smaller time periods for it, but do it daily, without skipping a single day. I work in the field as a freelancer for years now, running my own little business at the moment, and I can say that the area of self-organization and motivation, is something that can be much harder than learning the skills themselves, and it took me many years to learn different tricks and methods, to keep myself working when it is needed. It is especially difficult because every person is different and every mind is as well, so there isn’t one specific method for everyone to achieve a good working flow. It would be difficult to fit the possible solutions in this one answer, but you should put some effort towards understanding how “you” work and learn to discipline yourself, if you want to grow as a 3D animator. Take a course in 3D. Last, but not least, if you have the ability to study in this field or in a field related to it, it would be very beneficial. No course will, by itself, make you a good animator, but it can provide you with the resources and the focus that you need to become one. 95% of the skills I have acquired over the years, came from personal practice and work, but studying Computer Animation in a University, provided me with enough time to build a solid foundation in 3D, good understanding of the essentials that are often underestimated in the field, and an organized learning path to follow. So although it isn’t necessary to have a degree in the field, to become a good animator, an organized course might be a good “kick” to push you in the right direction. If you don’t have a course in 3D available near you, you could go for another art-related area, like fine-arts or even programming and find ways to combine the skills gained with 3D animation. Hope that helps a little bit. Depending on your age and current circumstances the steps may vary slightly, but I will try to describe the general approach, which will apply to most.

There are many many different disciplines in the visual effects industry. It is much easier to work out how to get where you want to go if you have an idea about which role you want to aim for. When I was studying multimedia it was easy to beleive that I could do everything: camera, editor, VFX, DVD authoring, but once I started to gain some work experience I learned that most people have specialized roles. The general rule is ""the bigger the project, the more deparmentalised the VFX become"".

Developing usually refers to being a developer which in turn is a special kind of programmer.  In case you meant it in a broader term, skip to the second part of this answer. 1) - Game Developer The Game Developer usually knows all about their target ecosystem. An ecosystem can be a game engine or a target platform such as a specific operating system. A Game Developer, being a programmer, needs to excel in the most relevant language(s) for their target ecosystem.  You say you want to develop for PC, then what you need to do in order to start is learning how to code PROPERLY in the platforms most relevant languages, namely the C family ( C, ObjC, C++, C#, BASIC, VBA ) For games you'll usually want to focus on object-oriented paradigm. Focus on maintainability, modularity and clear code documentation as those things are incredibly valuable when working with others.  apart from general programming, do study on the peculiarities of your target ecosystem, learn about hardware limitations and databases, shaders and parallel computing to round your skillset.  Also, being familiar with commonplace game development tools such as 3Ds Max, Maya, Blender, Photoshop, AfterEffects, GIMP and many many more makes you so much more able to implement artwork and external material such as textures, models, animations, sounds etc.  Also for games you'll want to brush up on 3D Math and Newtonian Physics. When I say 3D Math I'm talking matrix versor and vector math.   2) General ""Developer"" Many different faculties come together to ""develop"" a game, namely  - Concept Art- Texture Art- 3D Models- 2D Animations- 3D Animations- Particle VFX- Music Composition- Sound Design- Interface Design- Gameplay Design- Product Design- Production- Market Research- Business Intelligence- Quality Assurance- Backend Programming- Frontend Programming- Tools Programming- Graphics Engineering- Audio Engineering- Project Planning- Asset Coordination- Process Enforcement..... What they all have in common is that they are a specialized field each.If you want to pursue a career in either one of them, go ahead and research them thoroughly and it will become clear to you what you need to learn first ;) NOTE:  This answer was redirected here as was its topic, inappropriately so!

For too long unscrupulous schools teaching cgi bragged about high paying jobs in the exciting animation industry. The reality is there are some high paying jobs, but they come after years of experience and demonstrated artistic ability in the service of clients. This last point is often not obvious to entry level people. You are there to execute someone else’s vision, to make them look good. The danger of doing the job you love is it makes you ripe for exploitation. Young people entering the field are often used up and burned out by unscrupulous employers. The fact that there are now many more applicants than jobs means that you will likely have to move where the work is, repeatedly, and work long hours for stagnant pay and no overtime when crunch time happens, then endure getting laid off. It is the business model of many employers to throw cheap, relatively inexperienced people at jobs, knowing that two inexperienced people working 100 hours a week still costs less than one experienced person working 50. This often leads to disaster. I can’t count how many times I have had to come in on a job where all the time and money has been spent and the job has to be unwound back to near the start point and done again properly. This comes from the false economy of exploiting cheap inexperienced labor. Still, people love the possibility of doing it for a living. One must decide if the trade-offs are really worth it. There are serious health concerns for high stress, long hours and sedentary work. Many people my age are getting out, citing the health impacts as much as the permanent craziness of production work.

If you know about the different processes like storyboarding, character design, 3D modeling, texturing, rigging, etc. it will be easier for you to start learning. It will help you pick the right software. You can say you will know the path and direction. And same would apply for VFX. Animation, modeling, matt painting, and compositing are steps of VFX. If you are interested in VFX, try to know about them so you can pick the right one and work on it. Once you know what you are interested in, you can start learning the software. There are many several tutorials available on the internet. But if you are serious about animation and VFX, join a design academy. First, you will complete a certified course that will cover all the major aspects of production so you can understand the process. Once you complete that course, you will have better knowledge about the process. You will know what you like and what you are good at. You can apply for a job, or enroll yourself in a specialized course. These courses will cover all the required aspects which you might miss in the self-learning process. Ksitij Vivan, MAAC and arena animation are some popular design academies that provide certified courses.

The program itself is extremely modular, where you can opt for very advanced extension and customization. [Download: Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, Fedora] 5. OpenSCAD For those who want to work on the specifics, especially engineers, OpenSCAD is your ideal 3D modeling platform. It does not have interactive modeling for you to design your model, but instead relies more on what you defined in the parameters through the script files. If you’re looking to build a machine parts instead of designing your next game character, OpenSCAD is the best fit that purpose. [Download: Windows, Mac, Linux] 6. KiCAD Want to design your next Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and don’t know where to start? Check out KiCAD. KiCAD is a free and open source PCB design tool that includes a project manager and 4 main software such as schematic editor, printed circuit board editor, GERBER file viewer and footprint selector for component association.

Very often the modelers know and do this, since it can be a trial and error process between the 3D model and the textures, but in bigger studios you will have people specialized only in texturing\shading.Riggers will then take that 3D model (before, after or while the textures are being created) and apply a skeleton and ways to control the different parts (limbs, face, etc.) of the character, this is more technical but it also requires a good knowledge of anatomy and animation since ultimately the “rig” is an interface for the animators to move the character.Animators will then take that rigged character and animate it, they ONLY worry about the performance, they are actors working with digital puppets, they know about storytelling, acting, they figure out the psychology of the character and the physicality (is it heavy, light, fast,etc?), they do NOT worry about the model, the textures, the rig, the lighting, nothing else.. if something breaks they send it back to the department where it came from.Then you get lighting, rendering, etc.. but I will stop here since this is what you wanted to know.This is the way most specialized studios work, you pick one and work only on that, and became really good at it. With that said, nothing is stopping you from learning more than one thing, it is extremely common for modelers to be able to texture, rig and light their own characters, as well as animators can be very comfortable with rigging or lighting. People who do a bit of everything are called.. Generalists. They know a bit of every part of the pipeline, and usually work on smaller teams where one person needs to take more responsibilities, some generalists are extremely good are everything, but usually a specialized animator will be better at animation than a generalist, but depending on the projects you want to work on, you might not need extremely high details of animation.Also, you can pick one, let’s say animation, and create your own characters at home, rig them and animate them.. they are not areas exclusive from each other, when you animate you learn how rigging works and how models are made, when you model you learn about textures and how characters are made, so you get a sense of their physicality, don’t be afraid to learn anything that you are curious about, just consider your career options and see where you want to go. I hope that helps :) In a strict way yes modelers are the ones who actually create the character, but they don’t necessarily design it.. the pipeline goes like this: Concept art: Creates the visual style of the project, including colour, sets, mood, etc. Concept art expands into set and characters often but..Character designers will often specialize only in characters, although sometimes this category falls into concept art, it really depends on the studio and workflow, but more often than not you will have the concept artists creating characters, sets and all the paintings and art direction side of the project, thContinue Reading",2021-03-05T14:29:48.456Z,"What is the difference between Animator and 3D Modeler?

Once they realise it's too ambitious they ditch the project and start another one. This cycle of getting bored and not being able to finish a game is something that affects many new developers and I myself definitely fell victim to this. A potential employer will want to see that you know what it takes to execute on an idea and follow through the whole way until release. Now I don't know if you've ever released a game yourself but you didn't mention it in the question details so for parts of this I'll assume that you haven't. If you want to be a game developer, I'm sure you have many great ideas for games that you want to make. So first you'll need to list these out. Assuming that you'll be working on this entirely on your own, you're going to have to choose one of these ideas and simplify it down to one mechanic/part of the game. Then if you can just build the game the whole way through to release and get it on multiple platforms you've shown that not only do you have the development skills to make a game but you can set yourself targets, hit those targets and finally, deliver an end product. It's important to have a portfolio to show what you're capable of an what technology you can work with, but adding a fully functioning, released, finished game to that will really make a difference. Also, one last thing. In terms of what's in the game try to make sure that there's an online component of some form. Ideally something as simple as online scores where you have to detail with sending, storing, organising and retrieving the data. This is important because it will expand your skillset (albeit in a very small amount) into another area that is used in almost every commercial game and depending on the extent to which you've done this, can help you stand out from other graduates like yourself looking for similar jobs.

Since spinach is easy to grow, inexpensive and requires only a fraction of the resources, compared to the resources used to raise animals, the future of the relationship between animals and science can deteriorate with the rise of the fabrics of spinach. 2. Human beings con consent for controlled tests Human beings legally authorized to make their own decisions can give or reject consent at will, and withdraw consent at any time for medical examinations. Whether it is a test that involves eating plants to measure cholesterol reduction or administering tissue, there is still a wide range of invasive and non-invasive tests that contribute to medical research, which require a consenting human. On the other hand, animals (despite sensitivity) cannot give verbal or non-verbal consent, nor understand what is being done to them, nor why. What they can do, however, is feel pain. 3. The simulation of the computer can advance the biological understanding Computers can now simulate bodies accurately and perform 3D digital experiments. Experiments with live animals are costly, slow, risky and often impractical. Fortunately, the technological advances and the greater depth of biological understanding offered by this alternative animal research are enormous. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound already implemented and in practice extended, the medical industry is well aware of how computer technology provides meaningful data that is unique to each patient. Many believe it is imminent that technology will prevail over animals in science. 4. Human cells can be studied “In Vitro” Like “clean meat,” which is obtained by extracting animal stem cells from an animal and then growing them in a laboratory, human stem cells can also be extracted, studied and used effectively. The cells can be studied in cultures for the development of drugs, therapeutic proteins and drug filters. NAVS said: “Cultured cells are easier to manipulate molecularly, faster, cheaper and more reproducible than animal models.” It is important to note that human cells can be studied in vitro and offer the possibility of reducing the use of animals in several areas of study. “  Specifically, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are extracted from patients with a disease of interest, which can then be reprogrammed and manipulated; to study the cellular reaction.

Most 3-D animators don’t “do it all…” The craft has several processes, all of which require a high amount of skill. My son is just starting his career as a modeler . . . he does modeling and texturing, but when I asked him to do a short - 30 second - clip for a film I’m directing, his response was that for the modeling it takes just as long to do a 30 second clip as it does a 30 minute clip, if the number of characters is the same. The modeling and texturing for each character takes the time it takes, irrespective of how long the piece is they are used for. Before a piece is modeled, the concept artist creates the characters - which takes however long it takes, depending on how strong the ideas are, and how good the artist is at executing them. After modeling and texturing (which is often done by two different artists, but not always), the rigger places what I call the “strings on the marionettes” (but which is much more detailed than this, as facial muscles and hair are also rigged - everything that can move), the backgrounds are created, and the animator makes it all move. And this is just the technical stuff - the story stuff, the script, etc… is all another piece, sometimes written by one person, but always worked on by the entire team. The ONLY good thing about trying to do it by yourself would be that you don’t have to communicate with anyone else. The bad part is … you wouldn’t have input from anyone else… :-) So - in hours spent - the biggest questions are, “how fast is the artist?” and “How complex is the art?” And those questions can’t be answered in a forum like this one.

Currently I’m looking at the answer written by Ian Abbott, who has approached your question from a pragmatic tangent, doing an honest job of it, while also encouraging your flexibility. However, I haven’t yet seen the answer that comes to my mind: I make my art because I need to make art. I don’t make art because I need to make a living. I need to make art, and that making has always come first. As Kurt Vonnegut put it, “practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow”. There is another fairly famous (apparently anonymous) quotation that states that “artists and poets are the raw nerve ends of humanity. By themselves they can do little to save humanity. Without them there would be little worth saving.” Give that some serious consideration. As romanticizing a line as so many maintain this is, diminishing and discounting art as they do so, it still does apply positively to what we do, and to the place of art in society, and in history. To make art means essentially the act of hand-making any thing, you just make the thing that comes into your head to make, by whatever means, whatever medium best serves the purpose and meaning. The ancient Indo-European root of the word ‘art’ originally meant no more than ‘to make’. By your own hands, from your own head; add some heart or some love to it, and you have made art - however small, however well or badly. By so doing, you are contributing to our culture. This position of “I make art because I have to make art” might seem a piece of circular logic, but it is not a closed circle, I do not exclude the possibility of making an income from making my art; and I have, along the way, and sometimes a very good one. Experience has brought the recognition that I function within what is known as the “Gift Economy”, as does every artist of my acquaintance. We do this art-making thing by choice, or compulsion - on occasion we might claim that we can’t do anything else. The hours we put in are never compensated for by what sales bring us - if you break the monetary income down by the hours spent, we’re all doing our work for about 50 pennies an hour, be that half a dollar or half a pound sterling. I’ve lived and worked at my art in America, Scotland and England, and it works out about the same in each.But we benefit, profit, glory even, in ways which cannot be accounted for in mainstream economic terms. It is a useful state of exchange, this Gift Economy. While it may seem imperfect, it functions in a beautiful way, if one of only partial service: we have our gift for making art, we give that gift into our community and society, and society makes a place, both practical and psychological, for us to do so, and for the work of our hands - that is society’s gift to us in return. We don’t do it for free: besides what we may be paid for our work (when we are paid) we are supported, indirectly as well as directly, by society. I read a remark recently that claimed that 90 or 95% of what we artists make winds up, ultimately, in junk shops; I’d broaden that destination to include landfill, and bonfires. Part of what that shows us this: it takes an uncommon kind of person, out of the billions of our fellows, to place a monetary value on our efforts. And still we go on making our art. Our gift. (It is a sobering thought, one supported by archaeology: out of Britain’s material/physical culture of 2,000 or even 1,000 years ago, less than 5% has survived into our time - and most of that has been recovered from the ground, from excavations of ruins, burials and abandoned middens - but also, much of that material heritage is the product of Art). According to Quora, you’ve had 45 answers to this question. Currently I’m looking at the answer written by Ian Abbott, who has approached your question from a pragmatic tangent, doing an honest job of it, while also encouraging your flexibility. However, I haven’t yet seen the answer that comes to my mind: I make my art because I need to make art. I don’t make art because I need to make a living. I need to make art, and that making has always come first. As Kurt Vonnegut put it, “practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow”. There is another fairly famous (app Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:35:25.894Z,"How do you make a living being an artist? ",Quora

That's a bigger question than you may realize. *cracks knuckles* For starters, there's high competition for applying to Disney's animation studio. They're one of the six biggest entertainment companies in America (and probably the world), and they only take the best of the best. First, do some research. Why do you want to work for Disney? What do they do there? Like, actually, what do they do there? What do you want to do for them? Storyboarding? 3D animation? Sound design? (The list could go on). If you want a job at Disney (or anywhere in general) you've got to make yourself valuable. What can you do for them? What can you do to make yourself valuable, someone that they can't pass up? One way to get in is to specialize: do something most people can't (or don't want to). Many times, this means getting into the nitty-gritty of 3D animation: Rigging, Lighting/Shading, Technical Art, even Scripting/Programming or Software development. Mid you want to animate, 2D or 3D, you have to be the best of the best. Disney doesn't do much 2D anymore, so perhaps you might want to storyboard. Perhaps you want to write the stories that make it to the big scree. In that case, I'm going to tell you something that you need to hear, something that I was told early in my college animation career: ""there's no such thing as an 'idea man.' "" Or, rather, people won't hire you just for your ideas. Having an idea is a great start, being able to draw it is even better, but think of how many people can already do that? Again, think of what you can do to stand out among other applicants. Do some research on CalArts. It takes a lot to get in. I don't go there, but the application includes a sketchbook *full* of your best work. It's insane. Again, the best of the best. How this relates to your classes: figure out what you want to do first. Learn about the industry (which isn't really that great; apparently there are some jobs that will skim your paycheck or skip it all together and keep feeding you false hopes for weeks (this happened to someone I know)). The industry is tricky, and there are a greater variety of jobs than you may realize. Watch the credits of your favorite, modern, 3D-animated film, and write down the animation jobs that appear at the end. Learn what each of those is. Read about the industry on sites like Cartoon Brew. Watch every behind-the-scenes video that you can. Read/watch interviews with creators. Follow them on social media. Diving head-first into all of this may seem overwhelming, but if you're anything like me, you find it fascinating, and there's nothing else you'd want to do with your life. Courses you could take: Any drawing courses, especially Life-Drawing, anything on color theory, story boarding, sound design, 3D-modeling/animation (learn about poly's, UV-mapping (which is the actual worst), texturing, lighting/shadows, rigging, animating), any class focused on digital art and exporting videos, photography, even an acting class can help (animators often act out their characters' lines to get a better feel for how to animate them). That's all just a start. Finally, don't think that Disney is everything. I am pursuing an animation degree at a liberal arts college, and I can't tell you how much it irks me when people say ""oh, so you're going to work at Disney?"" There are TONS of places hiring animators: big companies, special effects studios, my friend even got a job at an architectural firm for pre-visualization work for their clients. Don't ever lose your passion. There's so much you can do out there. Find what you love, and do the heck out of it. And above all else, keep making things. Keep making things. Keep. Making. Things. Oh boy. That's a bigger question than you may realize. *cracks knuckles* For starters, there's high competition for applying to Disney's animation studio.

Research for VFX because VFX has so many department and its time consuming, you will need high amount of patience level to be there. 2. Try out software, every software has free trail, so you can try for it and see if you are suitable for which software, it is because every software has different workflow to be used, example, Adobe After Effects (Layer Based Software), Nuke (Node Bases Software), etc, I prefer After Effects because I am more familiar with layer based software such as Adobe Photoshop, and henceforth you can try other software, I am mentioning the list for the software you can try and for which purpose: Graphic Designing: Adobe Photoshop (Raster), Adobe Illustrator (Vector), Corel Draw (Vector), etc. 2D Animation: Adobe Flash (this is the best one so far) Video Editing: Adobe Premiere, Hitfilms 3D Animation & Modelling: Blender (Best and free to start with), Autodesk Maya There are plethora of tutorial available for every software, tips and tricks you can just try and see, the motto for doing this is to know are suitable for this editing stuffs because I have seen people who just take admission in high end institute and after a month they get bored and all the money flows away. So better you go for this test, the time you decide you can do this job and loving to do it, find the best institute, in Mumbai according to me its FX School, others are such a mess (Seriously), because certificate makes difference while finding job. (on a important note, to make career in any of this category you need to have a strong showreel, if you don’t know what showreel is, its contains for you best work in a short duration video, you search for the showreel on Youtube) And as for which degree you want to pursue, I will suggest to go for Bachelor in Mass Media (BMM), as this course contain all about Media Psychology, Advertising, Journalism, Understanding Cinema, Photography subjects, I am sure you will enjoy. About Me: I was in the same boat just like you but the difference is there was no one whom I could ask for guidance so I thought to go in institute for counselling, instead of counselling they just brainwash me, as I ended taking admission in and for the first two module its was all going good but later it became worse and I discontinued but later I started learning software from my own and with the help of Youtube, and I am sure now I am that capable that I am teach those faculty in the institute, because it seems they were script if you ask something tricky question they would rather take you out of the class instead getting you out of the box and I finished my BMM studies right this year. And I hope you understand what I exactly wants to say and sorry for my bad english and have a great future ahead and research as much as you can, this will make your decision more firm rather than being in confusion.

Animation and VFx is different and interlinked at the same time. Let's firstly talk about animation. Animation can be divided into the following : a) Classical Animation Classical animation is basically creating animation through sketches. The most famous example is old cartoons like Tom & Jerry. This technique is not used too much now days and jobs in this department are almost none. Classical animation is now replaced by 2D and 3D digital animation. b) Digital 2D animation Most Indian cartoons that we see on TV no Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:42:12.890Z,"What is the scope of VFX in India?

No experience is required for entry-level jobs; however, 2 to 5 years of experience may be required for more advanced roles. Voluntary certification from software developers is available. Key skills include artistic ability; creativity; communication, coordination, critical thinking and time-management skills; and the ability to visualize artistic concepts and use computer imaging and editing software. Step 1: Learn to Draw Carry a sketchbook. Drawing practice outside the classroom is an opportunity to work with diverse subjects and learn observation skills. Having a sketchbook available also provides the means to practice drawing as often and as much as possible.Step 2: Earn a Bachelor's Degree Earning a bachelor's degree in animation can prepare students for a career in media arts, illustration, Web design, film and television. Students take fundamental courses in drawing, graphics, storyboarding, character motion and art design. Students build on these skills with practice in conceptualization, texturing and digital cinematography. Advanced training includes the use of animation computer software programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, After Effects and Maya. Step 3: Put Together a Demo Reel While in school, students usually create a portfolio, DVD or website to showcase their best work. Some educational programs feature a senior project for students to demonstrate their creativity, artistry and proficiency in various software programs. A portfolio or demo reel can also incorporate independent work done outside of school. When looking for employment opportunities, recent graduates will submit their demo reel for open positions. Success Tip: Focus on a main interest. An animation designer can work in many different industries, so it's best to gear demo reels and portfolios to the career of choice. For example, a demo reel for cartoon animation could contain entertaining characters and creative stories.Step 4: Consider Industry Certification Earning a certification can be a good way to stand out, as only a bachelor's degree is required for senior animator positions, according to job postings. Certifications in this career field are typically offered by software publishers, such as Adobe. Professionals can validate their proficiency in using animation technology by becoming an Adobe Certified Expert. Applicable software programs that animation designers can become certified in include Adobe Flash, Illustrator and After Effects. Animation designers should have a bachelor's degree in animation, must learn to draw and put together a demo reel in order to find employment.

During this period I worked for Devanney and Mandelbrot on the research that became what we call fractals today, and I wrote an animation language as an independent study. The second thing that helped me get into VFX was working on the first 3D game consoles; I was on the original Sony PSX launch team, helping to finalize their OS and developer tools, plus I worked on several high profile game titles. When I got into the VFX industry, I was not really “in the industry” yet, but founding the games division for multi-Academy award winning Rhythm & Hues Studios. The games division at R&H is a separate story, but that lasted about 4 years before I returned to a proper established game studio. However, I never really wanted to work in games, I originally had an ambition for VFX before the industry existed. I could see computers gaining VFX capabilities back in the 70’s and started changing my education during late grade school. I was sorta a computer geek as a kid, taking programming classes at my local university at age 11. While I was working on games at R&H, I was absorbing their software pipeline, how it worked, and contributing very little bits. After I left them, about 2 years later, I wanted to go back to school for an MBA, and through friends I still had at R&H I got hired as a VFX Tracker and trainer of other trackers at a drastically reduced salary - but with a deal that I would only have a strict 40 hours a week. Back when I worked at R&H doing games, we created a game engine that required training to use, and at that time people saw I was a decent trainer. So that is how I got into VFX, officially: I accepted a salary at less than half what I’d been making as a lead game engineer, but I had a guarantee I would only have 40 hours a week - allowing me time to study for my MBA. Such a situation was only possible because the studio management knew me personally. It was during the course of my 2 year MBA program that I advanced through the studio, transferring out of production and into management and then finance as I was forecasting shot deliverables and the number of servers and CPUs required to deliver a film job on time. After my MBA I left R&H to create the 3D Avatar Store. The Avatar Store has not been the success I hoped, and I primarily work as a software scientist in facial recognition now, answering to people from 3-lettered government agencies. VFX is a career for younger people than I, as my friends still there are either very senior now, or have become global nomads chasing the VFX jobs as film tax credits change where VFX is produced.

Video games have also trained you not to notice certain graphical issues, for example objects suddenly appearing in the distance (commonly out of artificial distance fog), or shadows having blocky edges. Finally they use rendering techniques that give an approxmiation of real life, but actually takes shortcuts to make it more performant. For feature animation on the other hand, the focus is quite different (and took me a long time to get used to after changing careers from video games to vfx. Film studios are not limited to real time eendering. That means they can have more realistic lighting calculations, like multiple light bounces, and sub-surface scattering (where light actually penetrates surfaces). They also have to consider what the output would look like on an enormous cinema screen, not just a comouter monitor, so the lecel of detail is much higher. I have seen textures for a human eye that came in at hundreds of mb, just for the eye. With model geometry scaled up to match. When you increase the complexity of meshes, textures, shaders and lighting calculations the time to render ramps up quickly. Even the time it takes just to load the files from disk (in fact usually from a network drive) can be many minutes (maybe even hours depending on the project).

Consider all along that this is the experience of one guy, now in his fifties, but that has had the great opportunity of working for a prominent computer graphics company. I worked as an engineer on Pixar's RenderMan product extensively from 1991 to about 2003.   Like you, I loved learning about rendering, meshing, geometric processing, and sampling theory.   I thought it was a great job, but it must be said that a significant amount of time that I spent was not reading papers on physics and implementing new lighting models, but was spent in the thankless task of debugging software and the slightly more thanked job of helping other people understand why the renderer didn't work as expected, or took too long to give them the pictures that they wanted.   Eventually, I'd shift over to doing that as my main task, and only recently have I gotten back to working on rendering software again. Re: your comments about needing a B.S. in physics to do computer graphics, I think it depends on what your focus is and what you actually work on.   In the old days, I felt like computer graphics was all about geometry.  Then I thought it was all about algebra and root finding.   Then I thought it was all about sampling and filtering.   Then I thought it was all about physics.   And then I thought it was all about numerical methods and optimization.    Of course, it is about all of those things, and more.    Each time I had an epiphany like that, I'd have to learn some new skills, knowledge and techniques that I had not tried before.  It does make it challenging, but it also makes it exciting. Times have definitely changed.   People emerging from graduate school are standing on the shoulders of giants. They are being taught algorithms and techniques that I only could have dreamed of back in the mid 1980s.   When I began working on RenderMan, there may have been less than a thousand (guessing) people who had the knowledge and experience to write significant rendering code.   Now, I suspect there are tens of thousands, if not more.  Many of the larger studios have their own teams writing rendering software and associated tools.  It's very competitive, and not as glamorous as people think, but it still can be a good career.   Can you make more money doing something else that is also easier?  I have no doubt you can.  But that has always seemed like an odd way to pick a career. I don't know how to advise you on the relative merits of the two fields, since I've only been seriously involved in one (computer graphics), but I'll at least give you some perspective.   Consider all along that this is the experience of one guy, now in his fifties, but that has had the great opportunity of working for a prominent computer graphics company. I worked as an engineer on Pixar's RenderMan product extensively from 1991 to about 2003.   Like you, I loved learning about rendering, meshing, geometric processing, and sampling theory.   I thought it was a great job, but it must be said t Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:49:25.566Z,"Is computer graphics programming a bad career?

If you were to go back in time twenty years, and someone asked you what they should study to have a career involving the Internet, what would you tell them? That they should learn programming and HTML? Marketing? Communications? Graphics design? Law? Business? What HASN'T been affected by the Internet? Virtual reality is going to go the same way. Instead of eliminating data and communication bottlenecks, as the Web has done, virtual reality will allow people to share experiences, eliminating bottlenecks of geographical and social distance. And temporal distance. And that annoying bottleneck that is reality. Take any random industry. Books, say. You can have a virtual reality book store where authors come as their avatars to do readings, customers gather for book clubs, and you can browse through an infinite number of bookshelves, go into movie theaters to watch movies based on the books, play games based on the books, even go into virtual recreations of the books and experience them from the inside, as one of the characters, or as yourself interacting with characters in the book.  Virtual reality applications can be distributed to help market the book. Virtual meetings can bring authors, agents and publishers closer together -- or allow authors located far apart from one another to collaborate on projects more effectively.  So if you wanted to work in this industry, what skills would you need? If you wanted to create immersive experiences based on books, you might learn about immersive story telling and game design from any of a number of different perspectives -- story planning, project management, programming, graphics design, sound design, 3D modeling, character design, etc... etc...  Also, when do you plan to enter the workforce? The earlier, the more fundamental the skills you need. For example, on the Web, early Web developers needed to know HTML. Today, HTML helps, and so does Javascript, but the majority of websites are put up with just Wordpress, which requires a lot less technical skill. As time goes on, more and more industries will be pulled in. Law, for example, often lags behind technology. So, if you want to become a lawyer specializing in virtual reality law, you might focus on the law aspects first, with a concentration in cyberlaw, and just try to stay current on virtual reality news until the industry is mature enough for things to start happening. Unless you specialize in patent law. Virtual reality patents are already being filed right and left, and have been for a while.",2021-03-05T14:51:31.787Z,"What should one study for a career in fully immersive virtual reality? ",Quora

The first job students flock to is animation since they are unfamiliar with the pipelines of production, and are most familiar with this profession. That being said, the failure rate is also extremely high, to work in a career of 3D animation requires extreme dedication and discipline. The field is discouragingly competitive, so if you are not in love with the craft, and are not prepared to dedicate your life to the art, forget it! I have been able to work as a 3D animator for over 15year at some of the biggest game studios in the world, and teach at an accredited university for over 5 years, and have seen the industry grow, and the competition increase with each and every year. The lesser known jobs are the way to go, technical animation (best of both art and programming), visual effects (also a great mix of technical and artistic touches) are really the best and least competitive fields in this industry. They are typically more challenging, slightly less “glamorous” and that typically is why they are not highlighted as much as animation, character modeling, or environment asset creation. If you want to see if computer animation is for you, download Maya start to do some tutorials that are out there on multiple platforms and start to see how much you love the craft, if you cant see yourself doing animation for 14–18hrs a day 7 days a week, the profession is not for you, this is typically the work schedules for studios in features, games, and television, all of which I have worked in and seen that this is actually the bare minimum, those that excel at this art, do more than that on a regular basis not just per project when it is required.
