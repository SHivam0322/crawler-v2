Some say Analytics Translator is a skillset, McKinsey say it’s a function. In my opinion it will start as a function, will mature in the coming 3–5 years and grow into a family of functions (/skillset/role). And a large family it will be, as businesses will depend more and more on (analytics based) technology, while the underlying math and coding will not become any simpler - on the contrary. Hence, there will be huge demand for people who can translate the analytics into profitable business solutions. Today, a number of functions already can be put under the umbrella of Analytics Translator, such as Data Scientists with good understanding of their industry and organization, Product Owners and Product Managers of data-driven products or services, Chief Data and many Chief Digital Officers and Data Visualization Experts. So how to find a job as Analytics Translator? Look for job postings for the existing jobs mentioned above - at the seniority level and in the industry sector that fits you.Join a peer community of Analytics Translators, such as the global, online Aiandus Analytics Translators Community.

If the genome (thus the proteome, too) is known for your organism, there are programs that will hypothetically degrade your proteome based upon your protease of choice. This will give theoretical molecular weights for all the fragments. Using a technique like liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) the peptide fragments can be separated to a desirable resolution and analyzed. Comparisons can be drawn between theoretical and observed molecular weights. Theoretical weights for post-translational modifications (like palmitoylation) are known and a good MS software package could identify the modifications and the peptides they are on. This type of technique is used a lot for things like examination of plant cell wall phenotypes of mutants for lower recalcitrance.",2021-03-06T09:29:05.531Z,"How do you use analytical chemistry techniques to characterize the set of post-translational modifications in the cell?

The data collected and processed between the two systems varies because of variations that occur at various points in the data supply chain. Here are 3 common reasons: Collection - data collection occurs at different locations (because they are distinct companies their collection servers for any particular visitor aren’t necessarily in the same location) This can, due to server load, internet congestion and various other connectivity factors cause data to be lost between the visitor browsing the site and the point of collection.Page code position & environment - how the code (that collects the data from the web browser) is positioned and how it interacts with other elements on the page and indeed in the browser itself will affect the quality of data that makes it from the browser to the collection point. (e.g. putting the code at various points on the page, asynchronous implementation of data transmission and code interaction all can cause variation in the data collected)Processing once collected - Once the data which (for reasons above) is collected there are variations in how the data is treated once it is stored and this will affect the numbers. For instance when does the session “end” for a visitor. Taking a simple rule like all sessions end at midnight and then a new session is started at 00:00:01 seems simple enough but what happens when “midnight” is a different time based on the sites time, the visitors time or on the time at the location of point of collection? Depending on traffic levels and the number of spanning sessions this drives differences in reporting. (just one example)There are other less obvious reasons the data can vary. In general while the data isn’t the same the systems should report generally in line with each other, in other words, they should trend together. Having myself worked in analytics for about 15 years, generally you look for a variance of no more than 10% and the difference should remain relatively stable so long as the deployment of code, configuration on the vendors side and mix of visitors remains stable. If the difference has been 7% and spikes up to 12% that might be reason to have a look at your implementation, review changes and determine if there are implementation considerations you can undertake to narrow the margin. All said and done my feeling is that too much attention is paid to the difference and not enough to the direction and meaning of either of the data trends. For a whole host of reasons both of the sets of data are “inaccurate” and comparing them to each other is very often a big waste of time that could be spent on driving the overall trends and data in the right direction.",2021-03-06T09:34:01.047Z,"What are 10 ways to Translate Native Analytics Into Better Content?

Here, I am not talking about the best experts in machine learning. Definitely, such people are sought-after, hot and very well paid. But that is the case with experts in every other field. An expert java programmer or a great mechanical engineer is also extremely well paid. I meet many new aspirants who have this notion of ‘quick rewards’ and haven’t even checked if they have any interest in such work. That was possible long back like in 2013–14 when even basic machine learning could have fetched you a high paying job and maybe could still be possible now in some other newer fields but not in data science. At this stage, data science/machine learning is fairly advanced, wide and matured (if not completely). So, to do well, you need to work as hard as you would do in any other area. With a good adoption or attempts of adoption of data science in industry, there are 2 ways one can excel in this field and you can pick one of them if not both (‘both’ will be the best case but usually not feasible for most): Technical path: Be on the edge and update yourself with the most recent developments in the field. Learn newer paradigms of AI like:Reinforcement learning (it does not have many ‘practical’ use cases in businesses but I am sure it will start having very soon),Explainable AI (many are not aware of it and it is not most matured but it may play a key role in businesses as it claims to solve the challenge of inability to understand what is going on in black box machine learning models like neural networks)Cloud-based ML services (for quick ML developments),Putting ML codes in production and practices around it,Needless to say, using big data platforms for data science on big data if you are not doing it already.Learn how to communicate your results to non-technical people. This is a usual problem people face when they start working as data scientists.All this while, make sure you have a firm grasp of underlying mathematics in the algorithms you learned as it will be very important in taking you ahead in this journey.Domain/Functional path: This is the place where the largest gap currently is. So, pick up a domain and learn about it whichever way you prefer - preferably by doing projects or taking employment with businesses in that industry. While doing so, try to understand the key business challenges that industry faces and either try to solve them or keep in mind what all can be solved using machine learning (as everything cannot be solved by data science alone). This is the knowledge that many industries seek nowadays as they are able to hire data scientists and they have functional experts in teams but there is nothing that bridges a data scientist’s and a functional expert’s knowledge and this often inhibits the conceptualization of right problem as functional people do not completely know what data science can do and data scientists do not understand what the industrial processes/preferences/challenges in that business are. Organizations are, though, managing somehow with this problem by both sides extending their knowledge and efforts to understand the other side but it is still not as efficient as it would be in case of availability of someone who would understand both worlds and act like a bridge between 2 groups. This is that path that will take you to senior caders and good for those seeking positional/management growth in organizations. Not that the other path is less good, just that, you will find the best rewards for your expertise in places involved in cutting-edge or research work like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. and many more specific AI/tech startups.This is just a high-level roadmap. I am very sure that a variant of these approaches can be used according to the environment you are operating in.

I'll go over a few of the more critical sales analytics to track here. If you'd like to go deeper into the issue, I'd highly recommend this blog post. Here are some highlight sales metrics to track in your business: Revenues. It's essential to know what exactly your sales are before you figure out how you can increase them. Everyone in your sales team needs to understand how much money the company makes to know the right numbers to hit. Examine how much your company made over yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily periods. Along with your revenue, be sure to track earnings (the amount you make after expenses).Sales by product or service type. For sales analytics, it's crucial to know how much money you make on each product or service provided. From there, you can understand what products are selling and what products are not. Break this number down by sales by product or total sales for a class of products or services. You may also want to look at net earnings by product or service and division or segment.Sales growth. This piece of sales analytics will let you see how much your ability to produce revenue has improved or declined over a set period. The equation for this sales metric is easy. Simply subtract your sales over one set period from another of the same set periods. Take that sum, divide it by the sales of a previous comparison period, and multiply that result by 100. That will deliver a percentage increase or decrease.Sales to date. This valuable sales analytics metric totals up all of your sales from the first day of the fiscal year. It is a helpful statistic because it gives a more comprehensive overview of the peaks and valleys that may occur throughout the year. This is helpful for future planning purposes.Average purchase. This sales analysis metric delivers the average size of your sales transactions. It's straightforward to calculate. Just divide your total sales in one period by the number of transactions made in the same period.There are plenty more sales analytics metrics to take a look at.

It never is like “here is some data, here is a neural network and bam !”. I would suggest understanding the business context and problem inside out before even getting to data. Spend quality time here.The exercise doesn’t make sense if you don’t have enough data. More than enough data the thing that you want to look out for is “quality data”. Always have a data shopping list when discussing/understanding the business problem. Track both quantity and quality.Before beginning the ML process, check if it is at all required ? Most times a simple rule based engine would perform better than a sophisticated ML model. Always select problem where the outcome can not be implicitly derived through rules.Before data preparation spend some time with descriptive statistics. Exploring and understanding the data is crucial to do proper feature engineering. I suggest running rigorous hypothesis tests on the data on hand as the data you have on hand is always a sample and will never match the population.If you have good budget, try running simulations to understand how different data components interact between each other. Most times it will explain more than your understanding of the problem at hand.Features should be derived mostly from a business context, a descriptive statistics context and not from a ML context. Make features that are relate able from the business context. If you have run simulations make sure to feature engineer with that interaction in mind.Cleanse you data as much as possible to reduce the effort from the ML model. Re-centring, re-scaling, imputing are things that reduces the heat of the ML model and would help it converge better.When it comes to training *always* split your data homogeneously into training, test and validation. Focus on homogeneously.Selecting a ML model is never the act of throwing spaghetti at the wall and checking what sticks. It will always pay to select a model with the appropriate Bias & Variance trade off. The model will be sustainable and will only continue to evolve.For ML model Hyper parameter tuning, always rely on cross validation than rules of thumb.Test not only for accuracy but also from sensitivity and specificity.Hope this helps !

These apply modeling, analysis, programming, and evaluation in the math related subjects. You can achieve this with a major in a mathematical discipline. Any related fields gives you material from the domain. It is in analogy to a business, the material you work with during your job. You need to understand the business, organization, and particular product and services assigned to you. In the same way, you study the science, methods, history, literature, or topics in the other domain. A data scientist has a new professional position, and some research positions. The market has accepted this position in their companies, but they might not have developed the team, systems, and positions in the company to facilitate an easy application. This means that compared to longer standing positions at a company, such as business units, technical staff, or primary producers and service people, a data scientist has a new role. You then have uncertainty to your studies, though a study in a mathematical subject though not directly applicable to the job at a company, serves the most conservative and reliable study. Any applied subjects such as statistics, applied math, or computer science provide you a body of learning, and the core skill set to stand out in applications. You need to study the quality of life, public opinion on the job, company expectations for work, and the academics and experiences required to make a successful application. This balances out issues with your family life, friends and relationships, and lifestyle alongside a professional attitude. Your career probably stands high among your list of goals and achievements. This remains true for the larger part of a career at any company. But the career though interesting as its own work, also serves ends. It serves as a financial income, insurance stability, professional relationships, applying your academic studies, serving at a company with an interesting purpose, contributing to society, or doing the work you like. In this sense, you need a higher analytical study of the offered academic curriculum, professional positions now open, companies that hire data scientists, who works with data scientists, the applications of the work of a data scientist, and many more interrelations that encourage you to invest your work. This crucially stands on a general theme for any professional commitment and endeavor. You treat it like an investment, with some risk for failure, stability, or compounded success. How you decide your time to study, work, and plan long term effects all your time - past, present, to future. You need to continually balance decisions to make the best decisions for your lifetime, and achieve goals. This means that how you identify goals also takes highest precedence, as it balances out the major factors. I have offered some considerations in lifestyle, academic interest, professional interest, finances, or personal relationships. These all factor into the decision to commit life and time, to make a career, which really only positions how you will live. I recommend data science as a viable field, upcoming and still undergoing investment. Several academic departments with longer history, curriculum, professors, students, and applications have come about. They can see the usefulness of data science both academically and professionally. This issue ties closer to data science as a discipline at any institution, but still factors into a smaller career decision. You should want to know if the discipline will continue to grow, thrive, and provide high return on investment in the future. The answer to this question is yes, because data science has both a research direction, professional application, and utility for people in general. Most companies understand the analytical value, intellectual rigor, professional pragmatism, and contribution back to people simply making their living. It provides a solution to a pain point with data, analysis, management, computers and networks, and a professional attitude at companies.",2021-03-06T09:52:08.621Z,"Is data scientist a good career path for freshers?

I don’t regret my decision at all. I continued on to take three years of Latin in high school: Latin II, Latin III, and AP Latin, and I am now able to translate text proficiently and have basic knowledge of Roman history and culture. Here’s how I see it: You will not use the skills you learn in a high school Latin class directly. Since Latin is only spoken in the Vatican city, speaking is not taught or tested in most classes. As a result, almost none of the actual content learned in class has practical application. That being said, I have found many of the skills that are indirectly taught in Latin classes very useful. Here are a few things I gained as a result of taking Latin in high school: Better English grammar skills. In order to be able to translate Latin text, you must have a strong background in English grammar. Conjugating verbs and declining nouns regularly forces you to understand grammar better. I didn’t realize how much Latin helped my grammar until I had to take standardized tests. I earned a perfect score on the writing sections of both the SAT and the PSAT without needing to study grammar outside of what I had already learned in school.Problem solving skills. Translating Latin text is like solving a puzzle. Although elementary Latin textbooks contain sentences that strictly follow the rules of Latin grammar, texts like Virgil’s Aeneid and Caesar’s Gallic Wars are less straightforward. As a result of all the translating I did for Latin classes, I’ve become better at analyzing and working through challenging problems. This is a skill that I have been able to apply to math and science classes.The ability to learn other languages more quickly. All Romance languages (including Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, etc.) stem from Latin. If you learn Latin, you will be able to pick up all of those languages more quickly.Learning for the sake of learning. Very few classes taught in high school deliver content that is useful in the real world. However, every class is a vehicle to learn how to learn. Latin is no different. Just as you’ll probably never use differential equations during your adult life unless you’re an engineer or physicist, you’ll probably never use Latin verb conjugation rules during your adult life unless you’re a priest in Vatican city. Learning for the sake of learning is something that all students should strive to do.If you are looking for a language to take in high school that will help you in the future, do not underestimate Latin. Although the content isn’t necessarily directly useful, you will implicitly pick up many skills as a result of choosing Latin.",2021-03-06T09:53:58.303Z,"What will I gain from taking Latin in high school?

Chinese is a very fine example of why forcing Indo-European languages to shed the grammar gender to become “gender-neutral” is stupid and pointless: during thousands of years, none of the Sino-Tibetan languages (Chinese in its myriad local, ancient and modern forms plus Tibetan, Burmese, Asamese and a few others) nor the Turko-Mongolic languages (which may or may not include Manchu, which also fits in this pattern) have had grammar gender — and yet none of these societies has been precisely a feminist utopia. Yes, THOUSANDS of years. So, how many thousands of years should we force Western languages to abolish gender distinctions for it to have any meaningful impact on the status of women? 3000 years? 6000 years??? This line of thinking simply ignores the point of why grammar gender, grammar number, grammar agreement and other features of the language first emerge: Classical Chinese is the closest mankind has come to a perfectly monosyllabic language, and the closest also to a perfectly analytical language (its sister language Classical Tibetan coming as a close runner-up). Hence a very long paragraph from any other language can be translated into just a few words in these languages, but this same ultra-analytical-ness means that should there be a lot of noise in the environment, if you mis-pronounce a tone, or if they had had telephones back then and the lines were wrongly filtering some frequencies, the meaning may get from changed to completely lost. Even in the modern versions of Chinese (which are not as monosyllabical nor as analytical) the same happens: should you mispronounce a tone and your intention not totally clear from context, you may end up saying something totally different or plain destroying the whole phrase. Grammar gender, agreement between noun and verb, or verb and object, etc. came to be in languages to add a level of redundancy in speech, which safeguards the meaning if pronunciation or environment noise destroy a part of the speech, that’s all there is to be. Not oppression of women, or minorities, or what not. The other extreme to “gender-neutralness” is represented by the Bantu languages and their 10 to 13 genders, including the gender for “rounded stuff”, “long and pointy stuff”, “small/child/abstract stuff” and some others equally evocative.

For example, logarithms can easy the multiplication by reducing it to addition: using logarithmic tables, one may transform large factors to logarithm terms, add them and reverse again obtaining the multiplication result. (Not in use anymore since hand-held computers...) With complex numbers the same is possible for transforming differential equations in algebraic ones. Algebraic equation are a lot easier to solve then differential, while differential calculus governs a lot of dynamic processes as electricity, mechanic, acoustic, aero and hydro- dynamics etc. Even more, simple conventions may reduce the dynamics of variable process (as alternate currents, or even signals of any sort) to static-like behaviors.  For example, in an electric circuit there are resistors, capacitors and inductances. It is easy to solve a circuit with only resistors, but adding capacitors, inductances and AC makes the life a lot more difficult for the electric engineer. Yet, as an application of complex numbers theories, the capacitor may be represented as a resistance of -j/wC, and the inductance as jwL (where w stands for omega - related to AC, j is sqrt(-1) conveniently noted as such for not confusing with i - intensity of the current.)  With these conventions, now the circuit can be solved as in DC (algebraic, linear equations.) The roots (currents and/or node potentials in the circuit) are functions of w, so giving values to w for the frequency of interest we get frequency-determined roots whose real parts represent the amplitude of AC, while the factor of the exponent in the polar representation of the complex roots represent the phase of the signal. But wait - there is no need to convert or solve the algebraic equation!  The complex theory of electric circuits tells us (and we should relay on the interpretation of those theories' theorems) that the equation of a circuit (passive or not!) reduces itself to a fraction of polynomials, and the polynomials can be reduced to some products of 1 or two order polynomials. We call the roots of the upper poly - zeros, and the other one (denominator) - poles. Knowing the zeros and poles of the equation, the electric engineer can depict directly the behavior of the circuit on logarithmic graphs with straight lines which would be the asymptotic behavior (amplitude/phase) on frequency in dB (decibels - units for physiologic response of human senses to signals' intensity (as in acoustic sounds.)) And this is not all: by combining in a Cartesian graph the real and imaginary parts of the circuit's function (by eliminating w in the process,) we obtain a curve which tells easily the stability of an active circuit: if this curve goes behind the point (-1, 0) - the circuit is not stable! (do you know that high-pitch sound produced sometimes by microphones?) This example was about electronics, but in mechanics, mass (inertia) is like inductance, elasticity is like capacitance and friction - like resistance, so same theory applies in evaluating the response of a mechanical system to vibrations (like in to a car or airplane that should not vibrate (too much) because of its engine to any speed.) And also in aerodynamics (an airplane should not vibrate or go unstable because of air flow around it.) To make the story interesting, almost half century ago, I was student in CS University.  One day, in the afternoon the teacher-assistant came in class with a magazine he wanted to read. He has put a circuit schema on the blackboard asking us for the next 2 hours to figure out what it was.  By the time he went back to his desk, I said - ""I know what it is!"" I gave the functionality of the circuit (active tone corrector) and picture the graphs.on the board. He was amazed - how could I have done so fast! - I have had learned in the morning the theory from the head professor of Automation ans System Theory!  ""Yes - can be done this way, but I was not aware you have assimilated that theory yet! This is how I wanted you to do! (differential calculus)""  And he has spent the next two hours solving on the board the circuit using the old-fashion method and integrating partial differential equations...

Otherwise, Swedish morphology is as analytical as English morphology. Swedish exhibits another feature that is not typical of agglutinatuve language: synthectosemia. This is in contrast to an agglutinative language, in which the morphology is based on the principle of haplosemia, one sememe being mapped onto one invariant morpheme shape, as in Finnish taloissani ’in my houses = HOUSE + plural + inessive + 1st person singular possessive’, Swedish has words such as husen ’the houses’. Swedish hus ’house’ ia a neuter word. Its form with a suffixed article in the singular is huset, in the plural husen . So, the coun hus is unmarked for number, while -en means ’plural + definite´if it is suffixed to a neuter noun of this declension. For dag ’day’, a noun of the common gender and a different declension, the same suffix -en means ’definite singular’, ’definite plural’ being indicated by -arna for nouns of this declension.

And, associating some sort of noteworthy character trait to your personal brand makes you more memorable in social media. The fact that you run a PR firm? Meh. The fact that run a PR firm, but also grow prize-winning roses? People will remember that.

One and the same. I know that’s often uncomfortable. But it’s the truth. More details: Customer Facing Employees ... 10 Secrets to Selecting Them Great storyteller The point that I like to make is that how you say something is just as important as what you are saying. Storytelling is a great means for sharing and interpreting experiences, and great experiences have this innate ability to change the way in which we view our world. Stories, when properly practiced, pull people into a dialogue. It’s about engagement and interaction. The audience is just as active a participant as the storyteller. And it has a great deal to do with how you tell the story. Born a collaborator It takes a great entrepreneur with vision to start a business, but it requires strong leadership collaboration skills and a collaboration of many people to make it a success. Collaboration is working together to achieve a goal. It is a recursive process where two or more people or organizations work together to realize shared goals. Note that collaboration is NOT cooperation … it is more than the intersection of common goals, but a collective determination to reach an identical objective by sharing knowledge, learning, and building consensus. Here are three important traits of a great collaborator: Don’t try to be the smartest person in the group – even if there’s a chance you are. Offer your ideas as just that – an idea – not THE idea. Never outwardly attack an idea or suggestion. Listener Some people are very good at speaking, telling their stories and being able to inspire others. But being a good listener is often more important than speaking. It gives a deeper level of understanding about someone’s situation, and helps to know what words are best to use and what words should be avoided. As simple as listening may seem, doing it well, particularly when disagreements arise, takes sincere effort and lots of practice. Listening is the key to having good empathy. Tim Brown, CEO and President of IDEO, the global innovation and design firm, describes empathy as making an effort to “see the world through the eyes of others, understand the world through their experiences, and feel the world through their emotions.” Customer centered Customer-centric, in its simplest and most pure sense, means making the customer's life easy; designing processes that are focused on delivering a positive experience to the customer; making it extremely easy for the customer to learn about you, buy from you, and get support from you when they need it. There are always situations where the designed process doesn't flow as smoothly as intended. And those situations are the ones where your customer centered trait is really tested. When a process goes off the tracks, customer centric businesses don't let the customer feel the bumps. They stay focused on delivering a positive customer experience, while they absorb the bumps through alternative or ad-hoc procedures.

If your question actually requires more than prediction (like in this case where you want the optimum number of staff, not the predicted number of customers), you will have to use the predicted result and continue working until you reach an answer.Operations research methods on the other hand cover a broader space, but are more clear cut and use-case specific. These include problems such as routing, facility location, critical path analysis, and many more. In short, predictive analytics in practice can be thought as using primarily statistical forecasting and machine learning to do one task - prediction.

It's the ""kitchen sink"" approach where you just dump everything into a bucket, and then the engineering team leaves the marketing team sort out what's what and deal with it. Segment's core is an API, which allows us to automatically translate/implement every ""tag"" as soon as an engineer has implemented Segment tracking once.

The net effect is that a marketer can just push an ""on"" button to enable a new tool:  Raw Data Access and ReplaySince Segment has a real API, we actually hold a raw copy of the data for you. The key here is that we can ""replay"" your historical data into many new tools, setting you up in hours rather than weeks. This dramatically shortens the time to test out a new potential tool, and makes it much less taxing to evaluate a new tool pre-contract. GTM has no such feature because they don't record the data, they don't have any connections to server-side APIs, and they don't know how to automatically translate/replay the data into a new service, since every GTM customer has to manually define that translation. ""Drop an ad conversion pixel""A common request from the marketing department to the engineering department is to drop an ad conversion pixel like Facebook or Adwords, so that the marketing department can measure the Return on Investment of their ad spend. These pixels report back to Facebook/Adwords, etc. that a visitor purchased something or signed up, and helps attribute that value back to ad spend. In Google Tag Manager, you'll set up custom rules for the pages where you want to trigger the pixel, and then you'll write the javascript to trigger that page. That javascript and rule will need to be maintained outside your normal codebase. With Segment, you just paste in your Pixel ID, and type in the name of the event (e.g. ""Completed Order"") that you want to cause the pixel to fire. Then you press ""on"" and you're done:  There is one specific feature that I've heard GTM users love: the ability to limit which page a script loads on.

604353e1ed76476feda27b22,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-Google-Analytics-GA4-upgrade-contain-goals?-,"No!!! Google Analytics 4 properties don't have goals. To track conversions, you mark an event type as a conversion. Google Analytics is the most used website analytics tool in the world. It has helped millions of businesses and website owners all over the world. Throughout the years, Google Analytics has received significant upgrades that also helped marketers develop new ways to read and analyze data. Google recently announced a new version of Analytics – describing it as the new default version of its famous data collection and web traffic analysis software. The new Google Analytics 4 comes with a bunch of key features that make it very different from the old version. One of the biggest differences is the new data modeling feature that uses AI to fill in gaps in data where traditional Analytics may be blocked by cookie-consent rules, blocked JavaScript and a focus on privacy. Additionally the user-interface for the new default Google Analytics is very different. Google Analytics 4 is built on the same platform for the “App + Web” system that they released in 2019. The App + Web version of Analytics was mainly focused on cross-channel data, meaning that it gave marketers a way to track users across apps, software, and a website. Google’s new update to the platform was built on the foundations of the App+Web Property that was introduced last year. It allowed users to track website and app data in one property that gives users a bigger picture of their data. Google Analytics 4 is a more expansive version of this so let’s discuss all the new features of it. All this means that its main goal is to shift the way data is shown to focus on users – mainly the user journey from first visit to final conversion. Plus GA4 is all about “events.” These events are the main way that data is presented in the new Google Analytics. Setting up Google Analytics 4 Now that you’re up to date with the new features, let’s head over to set up your new Google Analytics 4 account. For existing Google Analytics properties, go to Admin and under Property, you should be able to see the button “Upgrade to GA4”. Click on “Get Started” under “I need to Create a New Google Analytics 4 Property”. If you’re using the existing tracking tag on your website: go to the old Google Analytics property, click “Tracking Info” and then “Tracking Code”. Go to “Connected Site Tags” and if you see the new GA4 measurement ID there, this means you’re good to go. If you want to install the new tracking tag: go to Admin under the new GA4 property you created and click on “Setup Assistant” and click “Tag Installation”. You will be redirected to the “Data Streams” menu. This is where you let Google know where your data will come from. Your website should be there, click on it, and you should be able to see your measurement ID and your new gtag.js tracking code that you can now install on your website. If you’re using Google Tag Manager: go to your Google Tag Manager account, create a new tag, and select “Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration”. Copy and paste your measurement ID which could be found under “Data Streams”. Set the trigger to “All pages”, publish your tag, save your changes, and you’re done! This is just the basic setup. This just makes sure that your new GA4 property is able to track traffic across your website. If you want to dig in deeper, simply go to Admin, click on “Setup Assistant” and there you’ll see where you link your Google Ads account, set user IDs, define your audiences, and more. The biggest difference between traditional Universal Analytics and the new Google Analytics 4 is the user-interface.  There are also many differences in data collection between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4 properties – particularly in how data is defined and what data elements are called. Here is a bit of an introduction to concepts in GA4: Events: these are user interactions with a website or app – like page views, button clicks, user actions, etc. Unlike before, events do not require adding customized code into the on-site Analytics tracking code, some events are measured by default.Parameters: additional bits of information that give context to each event. For example, parameters can be used to describe the value of a purchase, or to provide context into where, how, and why the event was logged. These can include page titles, article IDs, etc. – these are most analogous to many of the “dimensions” that were available before.User property: attributes or demographic information about the user.User ID: which is used for cross-platform user tracking.In addition to these key terms there a few other key concepts that differ from the data marketers will remember from the old version of Analytics. Understanding how to use the new version of Analytics will require adapting to new concepts and understanding how to use them for your business’s KPIs. “Page views” from traditional Analytics translate to the “page_view” event in GA4. Remember that for events, a Universal Analytics event has a Category, Action, and Label and is its own hit type. In GA4, however, every “hit” is an event; there is no longer a distinction between hit types. They are all treated equally by the processing platform. According to Google, “it’s better to rethink your data collection in terms of the Google Analytics 4 model rather than port your existing event structure to Google Analytics 4.” For sessions: many marketers and businesses might wonder, why are sessions lower in GA4? Differences in the way that hits are processed timewise can make sessions appear as lower (see the above link for info). Marketers should not expect that their data will match up exactly. Google also explains why that is by saying, “some aspects of session counting differ between the two platforms. For instance, in Universal Analytics, a new campaign will start a new session regardless of activity, however, a new campaign does not begin a new session in Google Analytics 4. This may lead to lower session counts in your Google Analytics 4 reports.” Differences in the way delayed data is handled can also cause differences in your data. In traditional Analytics, hits are processed if they arrive within 4 hours of the end of the day, but Google Analytics 4 processes events which arrive up to 72 hours later. For parameters, one key difference is that page URLs or URIs are not display prominently like they were in old Google Analytics as dimensions. These are treated now as parameters like “page_location.” It seems like Google doesn’t want marketers or businesses to think of these events in terms of “URL” or “web site” page (at least not as the primary parameter) instead identifying “screens” or “page title” means much easier cross over between mobile sites, desktop sites, apps, etc. Google Analytics 4 New Features Smarter Marketing Insights using Machine LearningDeeper Integration with Google AdsCustomer-Centric Measurements and Better Understanding of Customer Life CycleNew Data Controls",2021-03-06T10:05:21.385Z,"Does the Google Analytics GA4 upgrade contain goals?

For me, personally, Analytics exists solely as a method to measure and optimize progress towards business objectives. For a SaaS product, your business objectives may include profitability, cashflow, userbase growth and marketshare. These objectives are exceeded, met or missed based on how efficiently you can acquire, maintain and monetize customers. Ultimately, your Analytics set-up needs to provide you the most actionable insight possible into the product features, site content and marketing strategies that drive your business forward.  Which Web Analytics Tools are best for a start-up SaaS Business? For a start-up, budget is always a concern; so I wouldn't recommend a tool like Adobe SiteCatalyst or NetInsight. Outside of the cost barrier, these tools require a lot of bandwidth to implement, configure and maintain, and as a start-up, you don't have a lot of time extra time to spare. You should look for tools that give you accurate, actionable data that you can use to quickly pivot without complex implementation or maintenance requirements.  If your userbase is small to mid-size, or you just want track your public domain, your best bet is Google Analytics (Free/Standard); just keep your monthly hit volume (e.g., page views, events) under 10 million. If you start sending more than 10 million hits per month, there's no guarantee that addiitonal hits will be processed, and data processing could be delayed for up to 36 hours.  If user activity explodes, and you start catching the eye of VC, I'd recommend upgrading to a paid tool like Google Analytics Premium or WebTrends, which both provide increased data collection limits, service level agreements, and increased customization options.  Free and paid web analytics tools are data-deficient in a couple key areas, so I recommend supplementing your tool of choice with a secondary platform in each of the following categories:  Real-time Qualitative Feedback Tools: http://www.google.com/insights/c...,http://usabilla.com, http://www.uservoice.com, http://www.qualaroo.com, http://www.Intercom.io Session Recording Tools:  http://www.Inspectlet.com, http://www.sessioncam.comCohort Analysis Tools: http://rjmetrics.com/, http://www.kissmetrics.com,  https://www.woopra.com/, http://www.totango.comBefore purchasing any software, however, I'd recommend you first invest in hiring a great Analyst or retaining a great agency to manage Analytics for you. You're not going to get much value from an Analytics implementation if your data output is not properly maintained, trusted by the organization or actively utilized to make product improvements.  What is the best way to set-up Analytics tracking to avoid latency due to multiple calls? If you'd like to avoid multiple calls per page load, don't implement tracking that fires based on an impression of a page element, mouse movement, hovers, or page scrolling. If you avoid tracking these types of ""passive"" user activities, then you can expect that no more than 1-3 tracking requests will be sent per page load.  You'll also want to consolidate tracking requests per event, where possible. For example, let's say you'd like to track submissions of an sign-up form by sending a virtual page view (website.com/sign-up-confirmation) to measure the success event, and fire a custom variable to identify the user as a new account. You could send two seperate tracking requests in Google Analytics to accomplish this [ ga('send', 'pageview', '/sign-up-confirmation'); ga('set', 'dimension4', 'active-user'); ] or you could consolidate the tracking requests into one [ ga('send', 'pageview', '/sign-up-confirmation', { 'dimension4': 'active-user'}); ]. Choose the latter option.  Otherwise, JavaScript optimization best practices apply for implementation of code customizations including:  Use a well-tested event system like JQuery for attaching event handlers Use an expires header for all analytics customization JS files Consolidate JS files into as few as possible, and implement them in an asynchronous fashion Finally, don't stress if the number of requests per page increases slightly with a robust Analytics implementation. For search engines (SEO), time to first byte, the duration of time between when the initial request is made to loading the first byte of page content, is what matters most. Because tracking scripts aren't generally the first byte to load on a page, they won't negatively impact your organic search traffic. Considering user experience, Analytics tracking also shouldn't impact the time it takes a document to appear visually complete.  What are important factors to consider in planning Analytics for a SaaS Start-up? Ensure your analytics implementation is as comprehensive as possible from the very beginning, as you won't be able to re-process historical data later to include additional information.    At a minimum, you should implement tracking to measure: Marketing Source Effectiveness - The paid and earned Media that drives traffic, acquisition, activation and retention. Set-up a marketing campaign hierarchy to allow you to identify marketing channels, individual sources within that channel and individual emails/ads/keywords from each source. Bonus Points: Set-up tracking for multi-touchpoint attribution, and use rules-based or algorithmic modeling to measure cost per acquisition and activationAcquisition - Unknown user becomes a known user with valid contact information. You should be able to tell what marketing sources and site content the user interacted with prior to signing up for an account. Bonus Points: Create acquisition funnels to identify key dropoff points. Activation - Known user becomes an active user. Depending on how you define activation, this could be when a user adds information to their profile, invites friends, or makes a payment. You should to be able to track the marketing sources and content that led to this, as well. Bonus Points: Track activation using more granular account lifecycle stages (e.g., completed profile, used feature(s), loyal user, inactive user etc.)Positive Usage Behavior - Active users performing activities which indicate that the user is satisfied with the product. You need to be able to measure the identify ""high value"" users, and track the positive activities that contribute to that definition. These activities depend on your type of software, but could include purchases, creating user generated content, referring friends/colleagues, etc. Bonus Points: Link a single user's activities across multiple sessions using a globally unique identifier (GUID) that de-duplicates user accounts identified based on email address or usernameChurn - The count of users inactive users who unsubscribed, did not renew or did not use the product for a given period of time. Your Analytics set-up should enable you to identify user attrition and the activities that indicate a user is likely to churn. The best way to do this is to set-up a cohort analysis, identifying users based on their relative join date.  Bonus Points: Use qualitiative feedback tools to ask outgoing customers to why they cancelled  [Image Sources:http://www.happybootstrapper.com,http://blog.kissmetrics.com] As an Analytics-focused digital agency, this is the type of challenge we regularly solve for clients across industries...

Instead of trying to explain why, I’ll discuss an esoteric message I believe I have discovered in one of his better-known lectures,""The Will to Believe,"" which he gave first as a guest lecturer, a guest of the combined ""Philosophical Clubs"" of Yale and Brown University in 1896. That's important to remember because it gives one a sense of who is the ""we"" is when James talks about what ""we"" believe. Ivy League students almost all (possibly all) white men from well-off families. I will contend in what follows that there was an esoteric message in this essay, a message that was likely very clear to many if not most of those in the hall, but the salience of which faded with the passage of time. The pertinence of a key contemporary reference came to seem quaint. So the esoteric meaning has become utterly inaccessible until recovered by -- well, by me. Just now. In the passage below, James is making the point that we take a wide range of our beliefs on authority - we believe a lot on no evidence or personal consideration of our own. That's the surface level point. The esoterica of it we will discover by-and-by. James tells the assembled young men: ""Here in this room, we all of us believe in molecules and the conservation of energy, in democracy and necessary progress, in Protestant Christianity and the duty of fighting for 'the doctrine of the immortal Monroe,' all for no reasons worthy of the name."" Wow. He really turns up the temperature on the frog in the pot there! Let's take these items that everybody in that room supposedly believed one by one. What 'We' Believe The first example of what ""we"" believe is the simplest. We believe in molecules. A Berkeleyan would be a skeptic about molecules since in the days before the electron microscope 'we' couldn't see them. But ... otherwise? It might have seemed odd to this audience even to speak of ""belief' in connection with molecules. I suspect James deliberately refrained from saying ""atoms,"" here, since atoms have carried philosophical weight since Democritus's day. But ""molecules""? What is there even to argue about? So let's pass on. ""Conservation of energy""? This is a reference to the principle that energy can change form but is neither created nor destroyed. A little trickier than ""molecules"", though only a little. Helmholtz famously expounded this as a principle in 1847. It was quite widely accepted by the late 1890s. By coincidence, around the time James gave this lecture two French scientists, Marie and Pierre Curie, began a series of experiments on radium that would throw the law -- in the sense in which Helmholtz meant it and James referenced it -- into some doubt. Energy seems to be created from within chunks of radium somehow. But it would have been an unusual Brown or Yale undergrad indeed who would have known anything about such work so early on. James himself likely had no idea who the Curies were in 1896. What he did know was that the law of conservation of energy was well established among physicists, yet that it was a concept or a generalization, not part of the furniture of the world, so it suggests speculation in a way the word 'molecules' does not. Then we come to the next phrase, ""democracy and necessary progress"" and we scratch our heads. Where is this headed? The word ""democracy"" had a variety of different and contentious meanings, then as now. The phrase ""necessary progress"" may be meant to suggest ""inevitable progress,"" that is, an optimistic view of the human condition as moving upward toward something Utopian. But ""necessary"" carries another possible meaning -- we can't stay still, so progress is necessary in order to avoid regress. Which of these is what we ""all of us"" believe? Then ""Protestant Christianity"". Really? James himself was raised by a Swedenborgian mystic, his native idea of religion frankly had but little connection to what ""Protestant Christianity"" historically means. Further, Brown and Yale surely had their share of ""free thinkers"" in the Philosophical Clubs of the late 1890s, the era of such renowned atheists as Charles Bradlaugh and Robert Ingersoll, (indeed, the rest of the lecture shows that WJ is very aware of this), and likely that room had as well a sprinkling of Catholics. So what does it mean to say that ""we all of us believe"" in Protestant Christianity""? Surely by this point James expects some of his listeners to be wondering if the lecturer is in the wrong room! This progression within the above italicized sentence from least to most controversial postulate, from ""molecules"" through Protestant Christianity, culminates with the duty of fighting for the doctrine of the immortal Monroe. One is reminded of Hearst's campaign at this time for war with Spain over Cuba. In this context I don't think it is too fanciful to suggest, and even to hope, that the placement of this phrase (and the use of scare quotes) may have been a plea to the young men in front of him to resist, and not so easily to allow themselves to be taken in and sent to die for the 'doctrine of the immortal Monroe' after all. It is right after this reference to the Monroe Doctrine that we're told we have ""no reasons worthy of the name"" for believing in any of it, just authority. Was it all a plea for the will to believe in the possibility of anti-colonialism and peace? Just a thought.

Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, particularly in their groundbreaking ""Principia Mathematica"" (1910-1913) and their development of Symbolic Logic, attempted to show that mathematics is reducible to fundamental logical principles. From about 1910 to 1930, Analytic Philosophers like Russell and Wittgenstein focused on creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis (known as Ideal Language Analysis or Formalism), which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language that, in their view, often got philosophers into trouble. In his ""Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"" of 1921, Wittgenstein suggested that the world is merely the existence of certain states of affairs which can be expressed in the language of first-order predicate logic, so that a picture of the world can be built up by expressing atomic facts in atomic propositions, and linking them using logical operators, a theory sometimes referred to as Logical Atomism. G. E. Moore, who along with Bertrand Russell had been a pioneer in his opposition to the dominant Hegelianism (and its belief in Hegel's Absolute Idealism) in the British universities of the early 20th Century, developed his epistemological Commonsense Philosophy, attempting to defend the ""commonsense"" view of the world against both Skepticism and Idealism. In the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, Russell and Wittgenstein's Formalism was picked up by the Vienna Circle and Berlin Circle which developed into the Logical Positivism movement, which focused on universal logical terms, supposedly separate from contingent factors such as culture, language, historical conditions. In the late 1940s and 1950s, following Wittgenstein's later philosophy, Analytic Philosophy took a turn toward Ordinary Language Philosophy, which emphasized the use of ordinary language by ordinary people. Following heavy attacks on Analytic Philosophy in the 1950s and 1960s, both Logical Positivism and Ordinary Language Philosophy rapidly fell out of fashion. However, many philosophers in Britain and America after the 1970's still considered themselves to be ""analytic"" philosophers, (generally characterized by precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic), although less emphasis on linguistics and an increased eclecticism or pluralism characteristic of Post-Modernism is also evident.

You might get your windbox crushed” Don't ever ask a programmer “hey can you explain the code to me? “ This will cause a reaction in a programmer to karate chop you in the forehead and activate his/her super laser vision cooking you from the inside till you explode!!! Code is very complex there's no way somebody can explain it to someone with and inferior understanding of it and schematic, or data represintation of the application in question! Don't ever say, “ Do you know how to make stuff bounce and spin around on the screen!” That is like one of the most useless things any programmer knows. And is usually met with a smug under breath reply on top of “sure I can”…while then you will see the keyboard fly straight to the side of your face ( Ninja attack) !! Do NOT ever, ever, ever, ever, ask a programmer “hey you can fix my computer right!!!! “ listen Im sure he/she can!!! but Fixing your computer is totally unrelated to programming!!! programming is taking code in designing logic making the things you see work with the things you don't see within the microchips!!!!! Usually met with an up up down down Konami code, where the programmer in question we'll come across with fiery blazing fist uppercut and will dismantling you with a giant fireball!!! DONT DO IT… Programmers are smart they have excellent reflexes. Do not ever say you know a “bit of code” there's no such thing knowing a bit of code!!!!!! You either know programming or you dont!! Its not the same is how to speak and know a little Spanish or german or somthing etc…he/she will laugh at you so hard that you will catch on fire inside of his/her mind scrambling his/her data base. Don't say it!!! And finally just answer this question, so it doesn't get asked… Not all programmers love coffee so much they need it to program.and that is not why we name every programming language after it! Like Java and JavaScript. Actually JavaScript was actually just copied from java because it was a popular name used to help it catch on. It's kind of just been an inside joke ever since then Now that I just told you some of our deepest ninja secrets. Reality is some programmers really like coffee some don't! some like tea some like soda some like water, beer etc. Programmers are people just like you. A programmer is not some geek squad agent, or guy who wears a pocket protector.( protectors are cool though FYI) The Reality Programming ex; software engineering is a very complex skill that requires years of practice and years of education learning complex data structures and algorithms Frameworks platforms implications. Knowing how to work with databases how to use data sets linear regression there is a lot of different things to it. A programmers responsible for understanding how to work with the view you see on the screen (UI) and make it work and core last with the databases will providing logic that can talk to the internet and multiple devices, application interfaces, talking to the net and many other variables that define specific applications on the web for mobile devices or on machine. There are literally hundreds of languages! a developer must know alot of them in order to make one application work! Things are not coded in just one language.Programmers spend a lot of time developing and honing their skills! is not something that just comes to you because you have secret ninja powers (Ninja powers are real though!) In the real world applications, one developer is not responsible for creating everything. They're usually teams people divided up who are specifically skilled in multiple skills to design the interfaces that users see to creating a logic for databases and wiring everything up in between! Programming is a rigorous process. software engineer /programmers must know multiple processes, Frameworks, platforms, ideologies, Technologies… And if it where something that was so easy that everybody could do! Programmers wouldn't start out getting paid $45 $250 dollars an hour!!! And Tech startups wouldn't be worth millions sometimes billions of dollars on launch day!!! Programming and software engineering is a very complex skill to master. The ideologies that take years of study and mastery. There are many major differences between some high school kids learning how to code and a programmer who has worked with some of the major Tech Giants and or equivalent company who has biult full stack applications and deployed them to the real world. So please have some respect for programmers they're not just “Tech guys” they solve very complex problems!! there are many different aspects of computers, the fields of study in the computer science in engineering industry have growing exponentially requiring Bachelor, Master's, or Ph.D level Training. Is is very complex and very fun and we always encouraging people to learn more about it because it does you no good not knowing anything. so please show a little respect! We all thank you for it!! I never stop learning! Here's a list of things you should definitely never ever ever ever say to a developer & the reactions you could expect. If I developer walks up to you and you don't remember his/ her name. Do not say “hello world” bad idea!!! Actually that would be pretty funny go ahead and do that… cheers! Don't ever, ever tell a programmer “ hey a website should be easy for you to make right? “ it's only pictures and words? … You might get your legs broke in 17-3/4 different places!!!

What she did was write the world’s first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper. Of course, someone had to be the first, but Lovelace was a woman, and this was in the 1840s. Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician, thanks in part to opportunities that were denied most women of the time.  Ada Byron was a teenager when she met Cambridge mathematics professor Charles Babbage, who had invented the Difference Engine, a mechanical computer designed to produce mathematical tables automatically and error-free. Babbage never built the actual machine due to personal setbacks and financing difficulty. By 1834 he had moved on to design his Analytical Engine, the first general purpose computer, which used punch cards for input and output. This machine also lacked financing and was never built. (Babbage's Difference Engine was finally constructed in 1985–2002, and it worked.)  An original model of part of the Analytical Engine. Photograph by Bruno Barral (ByB) Babbage was impressed with the brilliant young woman, and they corresponded for years, discussing math and computing as he developed the Analytical Engine. In 1842, Babbage gave a lecture on the engine at the University of Turin. Luigi Menabrea, a mathematician (and future Italian prime minister), transcribed the lecture in French. Ada, now in her late 20s and known as Countess of Lovelace, was commissioned to translate the transcript into English. Lovelace added her own notes to the lecture, which ended up being three times as long as the actual transcript. It was published in 1843. Lovelace's notes made it clear that she understood the Analytical Engine as well as Babbage himself, and furthermore, she understood how to make it do the things computers do. She suggested the data input that would program the machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, which is now considered the first computer program. But more than that, Lovelace was a visionary: she understood that numbers could be used to represent more than just quantities, and a machine that could manipulate numbers could be made to manipulate any data represented by numbers. She predicted that machines like the Analytical Engine could be used to compose music, produce graphics, and be useful to science. Of course, all that came true—in another 100 years.  Babbage was so impressed with Lovelace's contributions, he dubbed her ""The Enchantress of Numbers."" How did a young woman get the opportunity to show the world her talents in the 19th century? Mathematical intelligence was not the only thing Ada Lovelace had going for her. Her potential for intelligence probably came genetically, as she was the daughter of the poet Lord Byronand his first wife Anne Isabella Noel Byron. Both were privileged members of the aristocracy, and both were gifted and well educated. The marriage broke up shortly after Ada was born.  Lady Byron, who studied literature, science, philosophy, and, most unusual for a woman, mathematics, was determined that Ada not follow in her father's footsteps. Instead of art and literature, Ada was tutored in mathematics and science. Ada excelled in all her studies, and her interests were wide ranging. Ada became a baroness in 1835 when she married William King, 8th Baron King; the two had three children. In 1838, she became Countess of Lovelace when her husband was elevated to Earl of Lovelace. Her pedigree and peerage alone would have landed Lovelace in the history books, but her accomplishments in mathematics made her a pioneer of not only computing, but of women in science.  Lovelace died of cancer in 1852, when she was only 36. More than 150 years later, we remember her contributions to science and engineering in the celebration of Ada Lovelace Day on October 13. First celebrated in 2009 (in March), it is a day set aside to learn about women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics Ada Lovelace has been called the world's first computer programmer.

In the last two decades or so, NLP has made significant progress on a number of them through the emergence of various statistical methods that leverage data corpora. The community has come together and offered shared tasks where groups from around the world compete to achieve the best-performing system on some predetermined dataset. This has significantly improved the state-of-the-art in things such as parsing, named entity recognition, coreference resolution, etc. However, while we have made substantial progress, there are a few subproblems that are completely different beasts to tackle. I will refer to these as NLP-complete tasks. They build off a number of the other tasks, and if we can solve these problems, we will have caught the big fish in the NLP space. These problems include question answering, natural language summarization, and dialogue systems. I spent several years doing research in dialogue systems, applying many of the cutting-edge techniques out there such as deep learning. And the honest truth is deep learning has not given us the same blow-your-mind improvements with NLP tasks as we have seen with computer vision. I would argue this is because getting machines to understand and generate natural language is significantly harder, and we don’t have great models just yet. It turns out the black-box nature of deep learning makes it especially difficult to understand what certain models are doing, and why they are learning what they are learning. It turns out, when you are trying to build a model that is supposed to effectively talk with you about something, this is a pretty tough limitation for conducting scientific experiments :) Outside of the limitations of deep learning, problems such as dialogue also have some more fundamental unanswered questions, like how do we actually evaluate dialogue models? If we can’t answer this question, how can we possibly hope to make progress on the problem? NLP has its work cut out for it over the next few years. I am confident that we will make significant progress over the next 5–10 years, but we also must ask ourselves where the goal line is. If the goal is to have fully-fledged systems that we can converse with as we converse with other humans, it will require us to rethink many of the methods we are piggy-backing off of right now. We will have to think beyond deep learning and go back to the drawing board. I am confident no problem is unsolvable, but we will certainly have to explore different approaches!

For the first one, we know few teahers teaches Chinese characters with explanation of the orinigal meanings. Students just memorize them because the teachers have not much time to spend on explanation for each character, or they just don’t know the original meanings, or both. For example, character for Family is  in clerical script, which is very similar to current standard printing script 家. Most students just memorize the character without knowing what the original meaning and why it should be written in this way. To know the original meaning, we have to go back to its shell bone script (3000+ years ago)  in which there is a Door-alike, which means a door or a house. Under the door, it is a pig, a vertical picture of pig.  Well, you may ask why it was written vertically. Because more than 3000 years ago, there was no paper, people wrote chacters on bamboo splits, which is very narrow, only about 7 mm to 10 mm (one third inch) wide, it is difficult to write (draw) a pig horizontally, people just wrote the pig vertically. Which is true for characters Dog, Elephant, Horse, Tiger, etcs, all were written vertically. Right now, you may ask why “A house or a door plus a pig = Family”? Ancient Chinese were nomads, hunting wild animals for food. They didn’t have a fixed residence. Later, they learnt how to raise animals, they didn’t need to move consistently for food, they had settled down with a fixed residence. So a house with a pig is Family. You may ask why it is pig, not other animals? The ancient Chinese found that pigs were quiet, omnivorous, easy to raise in comparison with other animals. So pig was the most important animal they raised. Current character  the top part means a house, and the bottom 豕 means pig. We still can see some similarity to the shell bone script. The character is an ideogram. People used metaphor to express the meaning. In comparison, English word Family is just defined to express the same meaning. Its meaning is certain, you just memeorize F, a, m, i, l, y, the 6 letters in this order. Every English word is just defined, and everyone agrees. Nothing to do with the original meaning, actually there is no origianl meaning for most of words. But their meanings are very certain. Chinese words are different. Single characters could be words, but many cases, Chinese words are formed by two characters (sometimes more). For example, Chinese word for Parent is 家长 长 means “long”, or “old”. Here is “old”. The older or oldest ones normally are parents, or leader of the family. But it is unclear why it is 家长，not 家老? 老 means old. English word Parents has clear meaning, even though you don’t know where it is from. People just defined Parents as the father or mother of kids. Learn Chinese characters by memorizing is easy to start, but get more confused late on because there are ideogram, if you don’t know the original meanings of the each character, you don’t know the word formed by two characters. You have to memorize them too. You will find that you are overloaded as to much memorizing, difficult to continue. Learn Chinese characters by understanding the original meanings could be slow at the beginning, but you could find the most interesting part of the characters, you could figure out the words formed by two characters by yourself. You have fun from learning Chinese. You can continue if you need. Even if you only learnt a few characters, you will remember them forever because you understood them not memorized them. However, it is difficult to find someone who teaches Chinese in this way.

Here's the top 5 reasons: http://www.quantivo.com/blog/top-5-reasons-not-use-hadoop-analytics As a former diehard fan of Hadoop, I LOVED the fact that you can work on up to Petabytes of data.  I loved the ability to scale to thousands of nodes to process a large computation job.  I loved the ability to store and load data in a very flexible format.  In many ways, I loved Hadoop, until I tried to deploy it for analytics.   That’s when I became disillusioned with Hadoop (it just ""ain't all that""). At the end of the day, it became an exercise much like trying to build a house with just a hammer - Conceivably, it’s possible, but it’s unnecessarily painful and ridiculously cost-inefficient to do. Let me share with you my top reasons why Hadoop should not be used for Analytics. 1 - Hadoop is a framework, not a solution – For many reasons, people have an expectation that Hadoop answers Big Data analytics questions right out of the box. For simple queries, this works.  For harder analytics problems, Hadoop quickly falls flat and requires you to directly develop Map/Reduce code directly.  For that reason, Hadoop is more like J2EE programming environment than a business analytics solution. 2 - Hive and Pig are good, but do not overcome architectural limitations – Both Hive and Pig are very well thought-out tools that enable the lay engineer to quickly being productive with Hadoop.  After all, Hive and Pig are two tools that are used to translate analytics queries in common SQL or text into Java Map/Reduce jobs that can be deployed in a Hadoop environment.  However, there are limitations in the Map/Reduce framework of Hadoop that prohibit efficient operation, especially when you require inter-node communications (as is the case with sorts and joins). 3 - Deployment is easy, fast and free, but very costly to maintain and develop – Hadoop is very popular because within an hour, an engineer can download, install, and issue a simple query.  It’s also an open source project, so there are no software costs, which makes it a very attractive alternative to Oracle and Teradata.  The true costs of Hadoop become obvious when you enter maintenance and development phase.  Since Hadoop is mostly a development framework, Hadoop-proficient engineers are required to develop an application as well as optimize it to execute efficiently in a Hadoop cluster.  Again, it’s possible but very hard to do. 4 - Great for data pipelining and summarization, horrible for AdHoc Analysis – Hadoop is great at analyzing large amounts of data and summarizing or “data pipelining” to transform the raw data into something more useful for another application (like search or text mining) – that’s what’s it’s built for.  However, if you don’t know the analytics question you want to ask or if you want to explore the data for patterns, Hadoop becomes unmanageable very quickly.  Hadoop is very flexible at answering many types of questions, as long as you spend the cycles to program and execute MapReduce code. 5 - Performance is great, except when it’s not – By all measures, if you wanted speed and you are required to analyze large quantities of data, Hadoop allows you to parallelize your computation to thousands of nodes.  The potential is definitely there.  But not all analytics jobs can easily be parallelized, especially when user interaction drives the analytics.  So, unless the Hadoop application is designed and optimized for the question that you want to ask, performance can quickly become very slow – as each map/reduce job has to wait until the previous jobs are completed.  Hadoop is always as slow as the slowest compute MapReduce job.That said, Hadoop is a phenomenal framework for doing some very sophisticated data analysis.  Ironically, it’s also a framework that requires a lot of programming effort to get those questions answered. Hadoop is not good for analytics.

Here, the stains are Holi colours and the marketers projected a young girl attracting all the stains to herself to help her friend to be stain-free. Why she doesn’t need to worry about the stains? Because she uses SURF Excel, thus for her, its good. Surf Excel used the same concept before  It was in the year 2005 they introduced this concept that the stains are good. In the award-winning ad, they showed a young sister happened to fall down with small stains in her uniform and her brother beating the ground to punish the earth who made her fall down. In that process, he gets stained but brings cheers to his sister’s face. Do you see any controversy in that ad? Did it means, the boy was beating Goddess Earth (Bhoomi Devi)?  In 2016, there was another ad where kids of an affluent house deciding to spoil the rangoli laid in their house to have an imprint of it on their clothes and cheer up the spirits of a poor man next door. No one in that time said, it was unholy and disgraceful to spoil Rangoli of one’s house as it means Lakshmi Devi won’t enter into the house… Rather it was heavily appreciated ad, as it underlines the spirit of Diwali and again effectively communicated the brand idea- If stains can bring cheers to someone, let your clothes be stained, we are there to help it out.  The concept of Surf Brand Idea is that if stains help someone else, let it be there, we are there to help out. In Holi, its common to be stained and if you want to help someone not be stained, take it yourself and we are there to help you out… It's a very simple message and a noble message. I don’t understand how you find LOVE JIHAD in the faces to two small cute kids? It's so inhuman to find religion and love in such innocent faces of two kids who don’t know the meaning of sex or romance as well as Jihad  The problem lies in the eyes of those whose mind is filled with hatrance and ego. And let me say openly, the name of that disease is Hindutva which has infected minds of many in our nation whose culture deeply rooted in harmony, acceptance, mutual affection. Hindutva which is NOT TRUE HINDUISM, has the ignorance of medieval Christianity, the violence of Jihadi Islam, the ugliness of Nazi Germany, carries all the trappings of feudal casteism and heavily funded by crony capitalism. It's this disease that spoils the mind of many, so as even a noble ad like this Surf Excel which highlights the thought of enjoying communal harmony as a social evil. How come a young girl (whose religion itself is not known in the ad) who protects a young Muslim from being stained, so as he could attend his prayers become WRONG? Forget Muslims, will anyone of us enter into temple or even sit in our sofas at home when the entire clothes completely stained? What's wrong if a Muslim body is protected from staining? Again in the climax of the ad, you see that boy promising the girl that he will return back from prayers to play Holi. So where is the issue of exclusiveness of any religion?  I strongly believe this is not an issue of mere religious hatrance too. Yes, Hindutvawadis hates Muslims as much as Nazis hated Jews. It's not a secret, so they don’t wish to see anything Islam/Muslim in any creative content or even anything visible in society. But in this case, I strongly believe, its a handy work of strong corporate interest. Someone actually wants to break the upper hand of Hindustan Unilever (the Indian unit of Global Conglomerate- Unilever) among consumers. Probably some capitalists who are closely associated with wholesalers of Hindutva wanted to launch their own range of detergents and toiletries in the Indian market, just like many Nazi Germans highlighted Anti-Jews as a way to push their favourite brands… Why do I think so? If we recollect THE MAGGI BAN episode that has happened a few years back, I won’t be surprised if any similar ulterior motive exists today. Maggi was red flagged in India in 2015 over the charges of having Lead and MSG content. This issue has resulted in the banning of Maggi in India for a brief period. But surprisingly those who red-flagged Maggi couldn’t prove that their noodles had a higher lead and MSG content beyond the permissible limits. The worse case was many countries to where Maggi India Noodles were exported certified that it's safe to eat, especially countries like Singapore, UK, Canada, US and UAE which has stringent quality control standards. However, the banning of Maggi for a brief 7 month period had a huge effect. In this period, Patanjali unveiled its huge array of Noodles brand into the market. Interestingly, FSSAI (Food Standards and Safety Authority of India) who wanted India Govt to file a case against Maggi in Supreme Court as well as slap a 640 Crore penalty over Nestle, didn’t even bother to check whether Pantanjali Noodles have a basic FSSAI certification or approval. Maggi ban to Patanjali launch: Here’s what happened so far Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Instant Noodles Roped into a Controversy on FSSAI Approval If we look, Maggi had nearly 73% of market share which fell to Zero in 2015 June. And after its relaunched, it could only reach around 57%. So it means there was a sharp decline of 16% + in market share which is actually booming with more and more options. So who could be beneficiary? Well, the biggest beneficiary was ITC’s Sunfeast Yippe Noodles which captured that excess 20% share of the market and interestingly a newly launched Patanjali brand taking nearly 3% of market share which is too surprising. And interestingly, we see there was a strong connection between RSS and ITC. One of the subsidiary arms of RSS- SJM was strongly supporting ITC citing as a Desi Brand (when in reality, its a Foreign owned company) Newslaundry | Sabki Dhulai  So doesn’t it ring any bell this time too? We see an organized attempt against HUL, especially two days back, the same people criticizing Brooke Bond Tea’s ad related to Kumbh Mela. Brooke Bond is also an HUL company.  The ad is cited as ANTI-HINDU mostly by those who subscribe to Hindutva ideology. Why so? Whats Anti-Hindu in this ad? A selfish son trying to throw away his old dad in a crowded place like Kumbh Mela is not something imaginary. However, the message of the ad is NEVER DO THAT in such a sacred place and how that man realizes the value of bonds and returns back to his lost father. In a normal context, it should be seen as sacred enlightenment that the place offers. Any normal person who sees that ad feels, ohh, the place is so spiritual enlightening that it could make a cruel person into virtuous. But a section of Hindutvawadis took as something offensive, something ANTI-HINDU. First of all, when did Hinduism had the concept of Blasphemy in it? We don’t the concept of anti-Hindu as seen in Abrahamic Religions. And could it be so blasphemous to be ENLIGHTENED with the values? Maybe for them, as enlightened minds won’t accept a bigotrious concept like Hindutva, they fear it so much… After all, darkness need to fear the light. Infact it's indeed official that several elderly, as well as mentally disturbed people, are abandoned at places like Kumbh Mela which has huge crowds. In 2013 Kumbh, approx 2.25 Lakh people were reported as MISSING. 'I have lost my wallet and brother': reuniting at Kumbh Mela, the world's largest festival Getting lost in the world's biggest crowd So how can we close our eyes and say such things DON’T exist.

Another important capability of Anodot is the fact that it can correlate between anomalies in several different KPIs. For example, it can detect that the spike on the application crashes correlates with an anomaly drop in logins and a drop in revenue - it means that there is one incident that affecting different aspects of the business. You don’t need to be a data scientist to use it.

But neither Kant, nor anyone else, could state clearly what the concept of “5” or “2+3” is, and attempts to determine whether one concept contained another were often based on introspection - as though if you observe your own mind carefully when you think about “5”, the concept of “5” will become clearer. Instead of inviting mathematicians to engage in introspection, Frege invented a new language, and showed how it was possible to define concepts like “5” and “2+3” from more basic concepts. His goal was to demonstrate that all truths of arithmetic could be derived from purely logical axioms. Russell demonstrated that Frege’s axioms could not be used to reach this goal, because they implied a contradiction, but he and Whitehead tried to achieve that Fregead goal using different axioms. Then Gödel demonstrated that no consistent system could be used to derive all truths of arithmetic. But by that time, many philosophers had already drawn the lesson that Kant was wrong to say that arithmetic was synthetic, and they thought that this insight had been revealed by the use of a new method - translating statements like “2+3=5” into the language of predicate calculus, that is analysing statements, revealed that arithmetic was analytic. (For the record, Frege always maintained that geometry was synthetic). Theories like Logical Positivism were based on this supposed discovery about the nature of arithmetic. Even philosophers who had doubts about this new method and wanted to point out its limitations - for example philosophers who thought that ordinary language is of interest because it is more subtle than any artificial language, were called “analytical philosophers.” So, originally, it was not about applying an existing scientific method to philosophical questions, but using a newly invented method to turn philosophy into a science. But very quickly, analytical philosophy expanded to include all kinds of approaches that were given a single name - analytical philosophy - because they were part of a single conversation.

Marcus was a master of prose style in both languages, as his correspondence with Fronto in Latin shows. He was also a professional-grade student of Stoic philosophy, which is full of technical terms and idioms in Greek that have to be literally and not very comfortably translated into purpose-created Latin words that sound alien to the language: αδιαφορα = indifferentia, οικείωϲιϲ=conciliatio. Every writer about Stoicism in Latin, like Cicero and Seneca, apologizes for the uncomfortable necessity of making up these equivalents and hopes their coined words will become standards, but they didn’t, at least not to the degree necessary. Since Aurelius uses this full technical vocabulary, he would always be making up words in Latin or forking in earlier coinages from Cicero or Seneca, where, writing in Greek, everything is already there for him and part of a system. Greek was the language for fine philosophical discriminations. A language without a definite or indefinite article, without neuter substantives for ideal things (το αγαθον the Good, το αδιαφορον the Indifferent), and without systematic aspect-markers across the whole conjugation of verbs, is crippling by comparison to use as a vehicle for analytic philosophy.

In simple words, Data Science is an umbrella term and Data Analytics is a sub-part of it. So here I am gonna tell you the differences between the two terms in the simplest of words based on my experience.  Let’s start with the basic meaning DATA SCIENCE According to Wikipedia’s definition, Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that uses various scientific methods, processes, algorithms & systems to extract insights from structured & unstructured data. A Data Scientist gathers data from multiple sources & complies it together. After that, he/she applies ML, predictive analytics & sentiment analysis to extract critical information from the collected data sets. The goal of Data Scientists is to obtain meaningful information from large sets of data. DATA ANALYTICS Data Analytics is the most basic field of Data Science. A Data Analyst process the existing datasets by performing statistical analysis. Analysts uncover meaningful insights for current problems by various methods of capturing, processing & organizing data. KEY DIFFERENCES Data Scientist identifies the problems & then provide solutions for them. A Data Analyst, on the other hand, is hired by the company to solve their business problems. An Analyst only deals with solving the problems.A Data Scientist & Data Analyst also differs in the manner of handling data. A Data Analyst mostly manages structured data & use SQL queries for such purpose. On the contrary, a Data Scientist is responsible for handling unstructured data also & uses NoSQL.It is very important for a Data Scientist to have strong communication & management skills to deliver insights & make efficient decisions. However, Data Analyst is not required to possess communication skills & Business acumen.

This translates into a lot of roles at the company being constantly redefined, and the company focus itself, in terms of the types of projects, transforming ever so little everyday.

Not to mention the fact that the team of scientists are already decently well-known in the field because of the Netflix and the Heritage Health Prize competitions. That being said, the analytics specialist role is an entry level role for recent graduates without any master degrees. The job description for this role pretty much stays consistent across projects. The work is highly data intensive. Basic technical requirements are a knowledge of basic statistics (an introductory course in probability and stats is just fine), Unix tools and some predictive modelling (regression, etc.). If you want to be really good at the job, you will be expected to know algorithms and computational complexity since you can end up working with pretty large datasets and have to know off-hand which algorithms can work. Knowledge of either Python or R will help but you can learn these languages on the job. It helps if you are good at picking up new stuff as you may be required to learn new languages and technologies in each project. Being data intensive in nature, a good part of the job is understanding and cleaning up the data you receive from the clients. This part requires both curiosity and creativity. All these skills ultimately work towards having good predictive models. Based on the requirements, you can figure out what the learning curve will look like for you. As for the career trajectory, if you are good at the job, you will get due recognition and rise up to a senior analytics specialist position and further to the analytics lead position. Scope for promotions and bonus is something that your skill level and the organisation's current health will decide.

Today it’s recommended that museums only acquire antiquities that can be traced back to their original excavation, or ones that have been out of the ground for at least a hundred years. The 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transport of Ownership of Cultural Property is a treaty that UN countries signed agreeing to crack down on looting. Therefore, to acquire an antiquity, you should at least have knowledge of its provenance from 1970 onward. However, now there are countries that are claiming antiquities that have been out of the country of origin for very long stretches of time (for example, the Elgin Marbles at the British Museum), so repatriation nowadays has a lot to do with good will, not just international law. The Nazis and WWII created another crisis of provenance, as the Nazi regime confiscated what they considered “degenerate art” (for censorship and/or destruction) and what they considered to be great art. Hitler wanted to build a giant museum in Linz that would hold all the world’s great masterpieces, and he had a specific unit of the government whose job it was to gather these masterpieces (such as the Mona Lisa, the Ghent Altarpiece, and the Bruges Madonna). After the war some effort was made to return these artworks to their original owners, both public institutions and private individuals, but not every country made a strong effort. So now museums must establish provenance for any artwork created prior to 1945 which entered the collection after 1933. Since the museum where I work was established in 1949, this means we should establish provenance for any artwork in our collection that dates to 1945 or before. The biggest problem with provenance research is that museums don’t put a lot of resources towards it. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston has a curator whose sole job is provenance research, but that is the only museum in the United States with a position of that kind. In all other museums it falls to registrars or curators to do in their spare time (ha!). I’m hoping, as time goes on and provenance becomes more of a hot topic in museums, more positions will be established dedicated to this research.",2021-03-06T10:36:11.066Z,"What is a fascinating aspect of your job that nobody ever asks you about?

You need information that’s going to allow you to take action. For instance, take a look at your annual giving donor retention data -- usually these rates are quite low. Their behavioural information can tell you how to improve it. It’s as simple as understanding that past behaviour can and usually is used to predict future behaviour, and the means of doing that are generally through communication with these individuals. Tracking your communications with donors as well as their responses can give you great insights on important KPIs such as engagement, and from there, you’re better prepared to provide the stories that are most appealing to your most engaged donors. There are many software services at your disposal (assuming you’re ready to pay for one), such as visualization tools like Tableau, data augmentation tools like WealthEngine, or any variety of scoring tools that are on the market such as Bloomerang, Fundmetric, or Target Analytics. The core thing missing from these platforms is the behavioural component I mentioned earlier. Products like Fundmetric use machine learning and data analytics to track the behaviour of your donors and continuously segment and re-segment them so nonprofits have the best, most tailored lists to communicate with. It’s also important to note that you need to have the data to work with. The more in-depth the data is, the more accurate the machine learning will be. Tools like Fundmetric can help capture data and insights that you can’t on your own, such metrics as average gift amount changes, the time since the last gift, and 1-3 year donor retention rates. It captures the kind of data that sets organizations up for success that is missed by other CRM’s. If you’re interested in learning more, I encourage you to check out the Fundmetric blog or website!

I will add my citations later. The division between the analytic and Continental stems from early in the life of Martin Heidegger and centres around a difference in their conceptions of how philosophy relates to science. Heidegger's teacher, Edmund Husserl, is now mostly read in the Continental tradition, but he was first a mathematician whose foray into philosophy was in regard to the ""foundations of mathematics"". This refers to answering the question of the nature of math and other formal sciences. His first major splash came from debating the it with Gottlob Frege, who is widely regarded at the first analytic thinker. Now the method and content of this debate is far more typical of analytic philosophy than Continental. Hussars defended the ""psychologism"" of J.S. Mill, while Frege defended a sort of semi-Platonic mathematical realism. After this debate Husserl soon changed his mind and decided to create a now theory of mathematical foundations using the method of ""phenomenology"".  Notice that this was simply to answer the question of the nature of ideal objects and knowledge; it was meant to fulfill the dreams of Plato and Descartes by reinterpreting their ideas in a new form and make sense of science.  Very soon, a young man named Martin Heidegger got a scholarship for the study and restatement of neo-Thomism for the defence of Catholic belief. Very soon though (according to his statement of  interests in his graduate school application) he got sidetracked into learning about the philosophy of science; not just the epistemology, but even the metaphysics and value theory behind it. With this in mind he decided that Husserl was the advisor he wanted. Without going into detail about what happened while he was with Husserl, notice that he was there to study philosophical aspects of science (especially metaphysics) with someone whose training was originally in mathematics, who's concerns stemmed  from debates among mathematicians and other scientists about the foundations of science. But within a decade Heidegger took a new tack that set the tone for Continental philosophy until today. He took a very antagonistic view of science as something radically separate from philosophy. From his perspective, philosophy is as close to poetry as it is the science. This view is the opposite of most thinkers from Thales to Husserl, and most analytic philosophers including myself. But inspire of this ""turn"" away from the classic conception of philosophy as Science, his work still draws for its roots in his early engagement with science. This is especially clear in the ""Basic Writings"" and in much of the Nietzsche lectures. But it just so happens that my philosophy owes a LOT to Heidegger, and not just the early but just as much the later work. But most people who take their cue from him maintain an antagonism to science that shows a conception of its missing that Newton or Aristotle would not accept. Some Heidegger scholars are ""analytic"" in the sense that  they use Heidegger IN and FOR science: the best example is Hubert Dreyfus' contribution to cognitive science and AI. I have also written an essay where the relationship of Latent Semantic Analysis (a form of natural language processing) is a counter argument to Seattle's ""Chinese Room"". In writing this essay I felt the need to refrain from using Heidegger's work explicitly, but the entire idea would not have occurred to me without his philosophy of language.   So while I am crucial informed by the whole of Heidegger's work, so that literally nothing I write can escape his influence, I am analytic because I see my work as PART OF science. For me, science and philosophy are different in emphasis, which is ultimately why I chose to rebrand myself as analytic. When I talk to people who focus on Continental thought, I am very comfortable talking about Heidegger, Marx, Nietzsche, Sartre, Foucault, Husserl, etc., but where we differ the most is when I bring in information theory, cognitive science, AI, evolution, economics,  and other scientific approaches to the same things we are talking about. It seems to me that they draw arbitrary boundaries around philosophy so that science cannot come near. This is actually a rather amazing question. Due to time constraints, I will skimp on my answer, but I think i can still say something useful. I will add my citations later.

Although sharing a large number of Chinese character words, Japanese and Chinese are completely different languages.  (This picture is from 「❀✿」/「抹茶Aoi」[pixiv] )  From the perspective of historical linguistics, Japanese belongs to Ural–Altaic languages.  And further, Japanese has the same proto-language as all Nostratic languages.  Sino-Tibetan languages, Tai–Kadai languages, Austroasiatic languages and Austronesian languages ​​have a common proto-language. And they do not belong to Nostratic languages.   In addition, in all Ural-Altaic languages, the particle system and verb suffix in Japanese are more complicated. Therefore, Japanese is a typical Agglutinative language, which is quite different from the Chinese as an analytic language.  In ancient times, a large number of Chinese characters and ancient Chinese words were introduced into Japan. The introduction of Chinese characters and ancient Chinese words makes it possible for Japanese to superimpose two nouns directly as a new words without having to find the roots of the two words or to change one of them into a modifier or suffix. This is almost the only effect of the ancient Chinese, which is as an Analytic language, on Japanese grammar. This makes Japanese, on the one hand, as a typical Agglutinative language, can be rigorously understood independently of word order, and on the other hand, like analytic language, has a great vocabulary with only a few stems.  After the Industrial Revolution, Japanese scholars became the first East Asians to start translating European philosophical and scientific literature on a large scale. For the reasons stated above, most of words in those literatures were not translated directly according to pronunciation but were translated into Chinese character words according to their meaning. The Chinese character words translated by Japanese scholars were spread to China and Korea. Although some Chinese and Korean scholars have also done some translation work, at least 50% of modern Chinese words come from Japanese because large-scale translations begin later than Japanese scholars. It is probably why you think Chinese and Japanese are very similar. However, in Chinese and Japanese, the same Chinese characters have different pronunciation. In Japanese, Japanese maps Chinese characters to words inherent in ancient Japanese or retains the pronunciation of ancient Chinese. And Chinese has lost most of consonant at the end of syllables, in history. As a result, although Chinese and Japanese can partially understand each other's literature, but we can not read it without learning each other's language.",2021-03-06T10:45:22.681Z,"Is Japanese and Chinese the same languge?

Hardly 1 hour.” Fast forward to next Saturday. Sir demanded for the copies and guess what, Out of a batch of 40, there were hardly 6–7 who had actually done 70 MCQs with the solution in the copy. Rest all were ready with the excuses (Including me). And that was the time when Sir laughed. “Where are 70 MCQs/ hour students ?” was his 1st question. And then we realized, the difference between setting up a target and achieveing it. The point being, it doesn't matter whether you solve 100 MCQs in 1 hour or the reverse. The chapter which you read before solving the questions should be well within your grasp. The theories, concepts, formulas and method of approach to problems should be in your reach.

As a Catholic priest and theologian with a science doctorate from Cambridge, I have no difficulty in reconciling Genesis with Mgr Georges Lemaitre's Big Bang Theory (BBT) Genesis 1–3 is a symbolic account of Creation. It is very beautiful and has many important religious truths. But it is not a scientific account of the development of the Universe. Six or more centuries before Christ, the Jews simply did not have the scientific knowledge we have today. Genesis says that God created all things and ordered them. The Hebrew verb bara', to create, only appears in the Bible with God as subject. God's time is not our time. In fact God is outside of time, and everything to Him is simultaneous. That's what eternal means. 13.8 billion years or six days - it's all the same to God. Genesis teaches us that God made human beings, male and female, in his own image, and that we are stewards of our planet. The origins of the human race are mysterious, but something went wrong very early on, with humans disobeying God and bringing a cartload of woes upon ourselves. Genesis 3 is a psychological masterpiece. Lemaitre's 1929 theory - he originally called it the Primeval Atom -was accepted by Einstein, though not at first, and correlated with Erwin Hubble's observations of the red shift of receding galaxies, showing an expanding and not a Steady State Universe. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson, as predicted by the BBT, was a convincing proof of the theory to many. The abundance of light elements in the Universe is another fact which fits in with the theory. There is much more to be discovered. Dark matter and dark energy make up over 90% of the Universe, yet we're not sure what they are. Catholic theology holds that God made all things ex nihilo, out of nothing. This fits well with the BBT and with the fine tuning of the Universe. Over 300 physical and chemical constants are fixed to within 1–2% to make a life-bearing planet possible. Creation is precisely and wonderfully designed. At the Big Bang, it seems that all matter, energy, space and time came into existence in a singularity, an infinitesimal point. I'm quite happy to see this as the moment of divine creation, but that is metaphysics, not physics. Of course, an omnipotent eternal Creator may well have made an infinity of other universes. Why not? Multiverses to the power of infinity. Just that it all becomes a bit too much for us to take in! And when astrophysicists start talking about other universes, which are by definition non -observable and non-contactable, they have crossed the line from empirical science into metaphysics.",2021-03-06T10:50:21.123Z,"Is the Genesis creation account consistent with the Big Bang theory according to Catholic theology?

As a young graduate fresh out of university, I took a job which attracted bonus payments for being able to speak other languages. I already spoke French, Spanish and Italian, having studied them to degree level at university, and I decided to teach myself Romanian to boost my language allowance. Using a Teach Yourself book, I studied intensively for 5–6 months, but had no contact with any native Romanian speakers or any Romanian literature to read (this was over 50 years ago before the internet). As a result, my youthful arrogance and over-confidence in my linguistic ability exceeded my expertise in Romanian by about 13½ to one and I was singularly ill-prepared for the exam I had to sit to qualify for the allowance. The oral exam came first; that was a rather uncomfortable experience and I really struggled. Fortunately for me, because no one from my job had ever taken the exam before, they had no examiners “on tap” and they engaged a rather elderly Romanian scholar who happened to live in the UK to be the oral examiner. His expertise as an examiner matched my dominion of Romanian - i.e. it was non-existent - and whenever I failed to understand a question (which was frequently!), he repeated it in French. By the end of the examination, the conversation was entirely in French - but he passed me anyway, and with an embarrassingly high mark. When it came to the written examination, however, which consisted of translating two passages of Romanian into English, I found that I was able to sail through it based entirely on my knowledge of Italian - there was only one word I didn’t know, (glonţ = bullet, and its plural form, gloanțe, which also occurred) but it was glaringly obvious from the context what the meaning was. So the answer to the question is that, in the written form, Romanian and Italian are not too far apart - but in the spoken language, a knowledge of Italian or any other language, even at degree level, was of no help whatsoever to me. I had to resit the exam every 5 years, and I made jolly sure I learned more of the language by the time I had to take it again. However, passing that exam though I really did not deserve to, was not my only stroke of good luck with Romanian exams. When I retook the exam for the last time, about 10 years before I retired. the oral examiner (by now, they had proper, professionals to do the job), asked me how I had learned Romanian.

I struggled with most of my classes. I couldn't understand it. I was confused. My parents were confused. My teachers thought I was “defective.” RESULT? I grew up asking myself: “Am I good enough?” “Is it possible that something good will ever come out of me?” — Throughout my childhood, my brain was HACKED! I was deeply damaged by the 150+ year old Industrial Age educational system. My self-esteem was destroyed. I lost ALL hope and eventually stopped believing in myself! This is a “hacked” brain. It was not until college that I started to follow my heart and found the strength to accept that I’m different; I am a contrarian, an out-of-the-box thinking person. Soon, I discovered the power of going against the crowd and embracing who I really am. I have accepted that I'm a creator. I'm analytical. I'm visionary. I’m creative. I'm a dreamer. I'm an entrepreneur. There’s power in this freedom! Our culture and our school system wants us to conform to the masses, to fit in with the crowd. School grades actually evaluate how well we fit into the “standards.” Which standards? Theirs, NOT mine! Our beliefs create our reality. Napoleon Hill wrote, “If you can conceive it and believe it, you can achieve it.” This is a powerful truth. Our words and thoughts form our beliefs. There are several books about the subject. I was recently impacted by a fantastic book that my son shared with me called “The AWAKENING in Tennis: The Best Mental Book for Tennis Players, Athletes, Coaches and Parents,[1] ” by Coach Jose Antonio Casares-Falconi. I learned that in sports, winning starts in the mind, believing and trusting in your skills and abilities. In his thesis, author Casares-Falconi’s writes about how both in tennis and in life, we become what we think. He gives the example of tennis champion Novak Djokovic, since he was 7, believed he would become number one.  Watch (From second 0:58). If the translation of this video is right, he says that tennis is his duty and that his goal is to be number one in the world. Djokovic became who he thought he would! — So, to answer your question, how do I think like a winner? To think like a winner you need to believe that whatever makes you different and not like everyone else, is what will actually make you stand out and successful. If our brain is hacked thinking that we need to conform to someone else’s standards, we risk being trapped forever trying to change ourselves and shaping our life to meet OTHER people's standards, not ours!

Such a thing would probably be of value. Lately, this software looks less like a Mr. Potatohead and becomes more anatomical. The software is built around the underling anatomy of bone, muscle, and cartilage and so when you say ""the bridge of the nose is a bit thinner"" it knows what that means. Those biological origins may be even more effective than a typological classification of matching features to ethnic groups since it's more directly connected to the biology.

To say one is greater than the other, you have to bring them to the same plane, have the same unit, the same benchmarks, and the same scale to compare them. They are in different dimensions. Knowledge is the stuff of mind;Intelligence is the sublimation of mind. Knowledge is the whole movement of mind;Intelligence is the settlement of mind. Both have their respective places. But obviously, if you want to ask which of these is more fundamental—it is intelligence. Intelligence is not intellect. Intelligence is not how clever you are. Intelligence is that which enables you to simply see. See the simple even in the complex.See the straightforward and the obvious even in that which is totally complicated. That is intelligence. Intelligence is that which reduces the whole clutter and wipes away the dirt. In that sense, intelligence is a kind of emptiness. A lack of corruption. Something that is very intrinsic to you. An innate ability, a characteristic which has not been obfuscated or covered by conditioning. Intelligence is not something acquired. Intelligence is not something that books can give you. Books can give you knowledge. Intelligence is your fundamental nature, very fundamental nature. They are incomparable. But if you want an advice, then live in intelligence rather than knowledge. Be seated in intelligence. Knowledge can be available as a resource. As something to be used. Use knowledge and be used by Intelligence. Knowledge will be your slave, but you have to be a slave of intelligence. Surrender to Intelligence. To be surrendered to Intelligence means to be surrendered to the pure Self, for the nature of pure Self is Intelligence (bodh). About that the Upanishads say, Prajñānam Brahman—Brahman is Truth, Prajñānam is intelligence or awareness. So, intelligence itself is Truth. And also, just as intelligence is not intellect, intelligence is also not even intuition. Intelligence is that which operates when you do not take yourself to be very clever. Intelligence is that which comes into action when you do not have a grand belief that your action will deliver the goods for you.You just make way for it. You do not create it. You just make way for it. You surrender to it. Respectfully, you bow down to it. That does not mean that one will not have knowledge. In the little matters of life, knowledge is useful.

Software already started taking the jobs of translators since 20 years ago. Machine translation is probably the best case study of automation stealing jobs, for real. Those who read my posts know that I am very sceptical about the hyperbolic automation claims. These claims and reports were plentiful 5–6 years ago, and have now gone silent. The future did not arrive. I think now I can correct both myself and the other side. The automation job loss has a bell curve distribution, and takes decades. But it’s there. I have been both a user and a developer of machine translation for a while, and the drama has been unfolding before my own eyes. Stage 1: Late 1990s - early 2000s Machine translation was perceived as seriously as astrology, and employed far less people. The early MT developers were a curious bunch with often esoteric motivations, with insiders telling each other legends about Dr. Toma, founders of Logos, and L&H. When LinkedIn already had single millions of users and I had my first MT gig, I could only find 60 people working with machine translation. For most people the exposure to MT was via Babel Fish, a wrapper around the Systran MT, hosted by Altavista and then Yahoo!. I played with it and more obscure tools; while the quality was poor, if you were really eager to figure out, generally, you were able to, if the translation was between two European languages. In one of my old answers I tell a story about how even these early attempts took a bite from the patent translation market: In 2008, I had a conversation with a patent translator, who was telling me that his traditional marketplace has been shrinking since the introduction of Babelfish in Excite (at that time I needed him to certify a translation of a document). He was quick to explain it: the bulk of his customers only needed translation of foreign patents to make sure there is no overlap. They don't need to go into the particulars, and a gist is enough. MT is good enough for a gist; on the other hand, it costs a fortune to translate search results using a human translator. More and more MT companies were emerging; most of them didn’t survive. The human translators started noticing. Some MT providers tried selling MT as translation aids, with mixed results and mixed reaction. On the other hand, the MT companies themselves kept dropping like flies. The exchange on the net was going like this: MT: Guys, you won’t survive much longer. MT will win soon, and you’ll have no jobs. Human translators (HT): Hahaha! You are delusional! Look at these errors! Your software is stupid! No software can replace humans! EVER!!! MT: goes belly up after running out of money. HT: loses another chunk of market. The status quo for a while was, “MT is good for a quick-and-dirty peek. Human translation for everything else”. Stage 2: Early 2010s. Google Translate stopped using Systran, and instead released an experimental proprietary engine providing quality never seen before, and without limitations. True, it had a lot of issues, and whenever it made mistakes, it was not immediately obvious. But it was more than enough to make the MT go mainstream; for many or even most netizens, it was the first exposure to MT. Google Translate was followed by Bing Translator and a couple more engines. More smaller MT companies went out of business, and my own company shifted toward text analytics. For human translators, it was a major disaster. Where the quality mattered (which means, in most applications), they still had jobs, but the market shrank some more. On the plus side, MT was used to increase the productivity of the human translators. On the down side, many were delegated to the role of “post-editing monkeys”: find and correct errors in the machine translation output. That was a major blow, and wasn’t always productive. Sometimes postediting was not trivial when the MT output was either completely garbled, or “swept the errors under the carpet”. Some less honest translation agencies would use MT and sell it as human translation. The translation agencies were forced to regroup. They were now organising human translators into so-called “translation cloud” companies. You pay some pennies, and an anonymous human unit does translation for you. Stage 3: Late 2010s But even that didn’t last. With the combination of new improvements, and the user education about how and when to use MT, the post-editing required even less expert knowledge. Today, you generally need a human to translate a document properly. But the MT for most language pairs is good enough for even an untrained human to post-edit it properly. The MT is less usable for: Speech-to-speech translationTranslation between languages with very different structureMinority (“low-data”) languagesPoor punctuation, lingo, misspellingsPoetry and fictionApart from the last one, I don’t believe these obstacles will remain longer than 5-10 years. I had two illuminating encounters over the last few weeks. In one case, a developer from an Eastern European country known as an outsourcing destination, with not much experience but a lot of grit, embarked on a quest to build a company around MT, armed with open-source tools and a lot of patience. I was amazed how far he advanced, having started as an integrator of Google engines. He experimented with several approaches, and kept edging forward by playing with different bits and pieces. In the other case, I was contacted by a former translation agency, which then became human/machine translation agency. I was surprised to discover that they now handle a far bigger range of services. They now use their translators as trainers of AI datasets and content moderators (which attracted my attention since my current venture is in this space). The dominant mantra of the American big business is to “focus”; I thought, maybe it’s an anomaly? Looks like it’s not. A quick check of their peers revealed that many translation agencies now offer the same range of services. What if we suddenly invent a God AI, and it will do everything perfectly? “We” won’t. The tech is not omnipotent; it takes trial and error, and multiple iterations. When it takes jobs, it’s a death by a thousand cuts, that lasts decades. The good news is, foreign language skills will be in demand for decades to come. But the old-style human translation jobs will go the way of the scribes very soon.",2021-03-06T10:58:06.717Z,"Are AI going to replace translators? ",Quora

One must master it if one wants to work their. 3.Quality Books?? Highly Analytical & concept building books are available in English only. State Boards deprive their students of Books like Resnick Halliday & HC Verma. Students too can’t pursue on their own because they have to write board exams in their native language & questions asked mostly belong to prescribed stupid books like Kumar Mittal (Physics). That’s the reason why droppers after 12th are mostly from state boards. 4.Change/Update: Every education system needs change with time. There have been massive changes in question paper pattern, marking scheme, syllabus, teaching methodology etc. in CBSE/ICSE boards. State boards of BIMARU states have undergone negligible changes. They live in pre-independence era. One stark example is that these boards teach Pustak Kala ( in which students learn book binding, how to make glue, Seriously?) where as CBSE/ICSE teach C/C++/Java. 5. Online Resources: It is on rise. All quality contents are available in English. Research papers are published in English. Quality and analytical news content & editorials are available in English. Good quality literature, films, TV series are in English. Shall we wait for someone to translate these for us with his/her prejudices? 6. Cycle of poverty & deprivation: One was poor, so opted for state boards, state boards made sure one becomes literate but not good enough to be hired by MNCs or possesses analytical brain to get a job in private sector with decent package. Education is supposed to be a ladder, an opportunity for the poor to break the shackles of poverty & unemployment. Is situation so worse?

There’s no need to live if you’re not learning That’s what he said when they were talking about learning in that training camp interview segment. Even the anchor in that panel went “Woooah..” in the background. Maybe I’m just being over analytical. But given his tone in the interview, it did alarm me a bit. But I suppose when you go from a bonafide stud, an automatic All-Star, 1st Team All NBA player. To a NBA journeyman plagued with injuries, while you’re still only in your early 30’s. It forces you to contemplate about a lot of things from a much heavier perspective. But then again, will his change in tone, and attitude translate into being a good teammate in the locker room? IDK.. But you can’t deny the change. Personally, I think Dwight is someone whose personality has overshadowed what he has achieved as a player; some of it being his own doing.

Some recommend particular events and then leave a ""slot"" open for custom events. The former leaves some of the organizing work to the developer. The latter makes the analytics package do the thinking, so I prefer it (and put it in our package). The events are going to show up as ""calls"" within an API. Translation: when something happens in the game, the analytics software is going to send the record of it to the package, typically up in the cloud somewhere. The package then collects, organizes, and performs any algorithms on the data. Therefore, the calls are going to show up in the analytics company's documentation. Here is ours as an example: Ninja Metrics "" Docs , but these are mostly common. After all, analytics packages don't innovate in the collection of data, but rather in the later use of it. Some have fewer call types with broad definitions, while others have more types with narrower ones. On the user interaction side specifically, it comes down again to the questions you want to answer. Do you need to construct a social graph? Do you need to understand gifting? Is the content of their communication important? I think of three categories interaction types:Transactions, Communications, Actions Put more colloquially, that's buying, trading and selling; talking; and doing stuff together. From there you think about what your game has in those types. For example, if it allows trading, you'll want to instrument the trading event with the item, some description or classification of it (this allows analytics by category, e.g. ""weapons""), a time stamp, the giver, the receiver, and possibly the location and value. For communications, you should instrument messages by person, channel, etc., and think carefully about whether to record the content of the chat. You have privacy implications, and also the potential to collect data for semantic mining. For interactions, you want to record when players form, invite, kick, ban, leave, etc. from groups, guilds, clans, joint sessions, etc. It's valuable to know that player A was in the same <match/guild/group/whatever> with player B at time X through time Y.

Just behind my workstation is shelving with my remaining dead tree books. I culled ferociously before returning to New Zealand a few years ago when I went through a decluttering phase. The closest book turned out to be Judith Sheine's RM Schindler, a series of academic essays about the architecture of Rudolph Schindler, 1887—1953, an Austrian architect who trained with Otto Wagner. He was influenced by Adolf Loos and the idea that architecture should provide a background to life, support the users, rather than everything needed to be designed meticulously, including cutlery, and towelling. After graduation he eventually moved to Los Angeles to become the site architect for one of Frank Lloyd Wright's projects, the Hollyhock House. FLW once described him as ""the most charming man I know"". I opened this book for the first time since forever. It seems like a different life to be rethinking this guy's work. At the time of my infatuation, that I confess is ongoing, I collected all the books in print about him, to work out how he ticked. I don't have anywhere near the talent or charisma of Schindler, but I guess we share the idea that meaningful creation comes through the analysis of the context through the prism of our own life, organically, rather than landing fully formed as if from outer space.  Initially I stumbled over his own house built in 1922, a duplex for his wife and another married couple, on a visit to Los Angeles, and later spent five weeks visiting a few of his houses, and his archive held at UCSB, thanks to an academic scholarship. His Kings Road House was added to the National Register of Historic Place Inventory in 1971.

Web analytics software solutions often do not understand the specific business logic that is needed to translate raw clickstream data into the entities and events that matter to real businesses - things like: customers, customer intent, products, articles, movies, TV programs, radio shows, revenue, profit, costs, business processes and customer journeys. Instead, they deal with page views, clicks, conversions, transactions and funnels. One of the reasons that setting up high-end web analytics tools is so time consuming and expensive is that that ""translation layer"" needs to be properly set up in the advanced tools. (The other reason in the case of SiteCatalyst in particular is that this translation layer needs to be done at the Javascript level, before the data is fed into SiteCatalyst, when it would be better done further down the data pipeline.) 2. It is very hard to use data to answer open questions like ""How do my users interact with my web app?"" or ""How does this vary by user intent?"" That is a problem with data analysis in general - it is not specific to web analytics.  It is the features that address the above two barriers will add most value to businesses. However, it is likely that new approaches to web analytics, rather than just new features, are required to properly address the above two barriers.

One, he/she analyzes the organisation or business domain and helps with documentation of business processes. Two, he/she is a ‘translator’ who communicates the requirements of the business clients to the technical specialists in the company and explain the output from the technical specialists in layman terms understandable to the business clients. It requires the business analyst to have good domain knowledge from both ends — the business and the technical aspect. Hence, in my opinion, a good Business Analyst in a Reporting and Analytics Team is required to assess a business requirement and translate it into an analytics problem for the Analytics Team. After the Analytics Team has delivered an output, business analysts are then responsible for generating insights that provide real and relevant value for the business and translate it back to the business in an understandable manner. In the case where outputs from Analytics Team are required to go into production, Business Analyst should also advise business on the recommended technology to employ and take charge of the documentation of such processes.",2021-03-06T11:02:32.922Z,"What should be the role of a business analyst in reporting and analytics team?

Doing well demonstrates that you are strong in both theory and practice of CS fundamentals. Coding interviews are one of many data points in determining if the company has confidence that you’ll succeed there. These companies expect that you will spend some time diligently preparing for interviews, and they explicitly tell you what to study, how to prepare, and how to practice. They expect you to perform well, and they give you a ton of data and context on how to go about doing well. If you don’t perform well with the guidance provided, they are going to instead hire people who did perform well, as they’re able to make a more confident hypothesis that individuals who perform well are more likely to succeed once hired. No engineer is perfect, no company is perfect. Engineers will write bugs once hired, companies will ship products with bugs in them. Because you wrote zero bugs in an interview, it’s completely irrational to then believe you will write zero bugs during their tenure as an engineer. Rather, you’ve demonstrated that you can prepare and execute to the level of expertise expected of you. If you can display expertise and meet the expectations set for you in an interview, and you have career experience that is relevant, it is reasonable to hypothesize that you have a good chance of meeting the much larger expectations that you’ll be under once hired.

Step 1: Develop a strategy 1) Decide whether you need international SEO or not. If you do not see a lot of traffic coming from other countries or regions, you may want to wait. On the other hand, if you have done your research and know that you have a market for your product/service in another country or region, then international SEO should be considered. 2) Identify the countries from which segments of your customers come from, other than your own. You may have been selling on Amazon, and you can get that data there. Or, if not, check out Google analytics – go to the “audience” link on the main dashboard, then on “Geo” from the drop-down menu. This will give you the languages your audience uses, as well as the countries and regions they are from. 3) Decide whether you need international SEO or not. If you do not see a lot of traffic coming from other countries or regions, you may want to wait. On the other hand, if you have done your research and know that you have a market for your product/service in another country or region, then international SEO should be considered. Step 2: Decide to target countries, languages, or both Understand that you really cannot target regions, such as Southeast Asia or Europe. There are simply too many languages involved. It’s either countries or languages or both. 1) Targeting countries Some companies target specific countries because they have reason to. Consider a hotel chain like Marriott or a travel site like Expedia. It makes sense for them to have global sites in numerous countries, because they have so many customers with different needs in each of these. And it also makes sense for them to offer multiple languages on their main sites as well. 2) Targeting languages But for most companies whose products or services are the same no matter where they are, the language option only is a better choice. Consider that Facebook, which offers the same services to users around the world, offers languages rather then separate sites by country. 3) Targeting both Sometimes, it makes sense for a company to target both countries and languages. Stripe, an online payment venue, has a need to target both because it serves only certain countries and yet wants to serve all languages in those countries. So, a user can choose a country and then can select from languages as well. So, in the United States, for example, where there are multiple languages, the country and then several language options can be selected.  This works well for Stripe and also for online banking enterprises that are spreading their presences into developing countries in which a growing middle class is still unbanked. Thus, users can use their country page and have it in their own language as well. Step 3: Select domain and URL structure This may sound a bit simple at first, but, in fact, it is not, and you have choices to make. You can use Country Code Top Domains (ccTLD’s), such as .ca or .http://co.uk if you are targeting countries as opposed to languages, or subdirectories, such as Porno Videos on XXX.comIf you are targeting languages, then you will want to use SubDirectories, such as Porno Videos on XXX.com or SubDomains, such as de/XXX.com/Again, if your site is large and your offerings are different based upon country, then you will want to target specific countries with ccTLD’s. If, however, your targets are consumers based upon their languages anywhere they might be, then you will want to use SubDirectories, as shown above. Step 4: Set up languages for SEO This is a critical factor in SEO – if the translations and localizations are not done well, you will confuse and possibly offend. 1) Use only human translators. If you can find a native speaker in your target language, who can also advise you on appropriate cultural considerations, great. You can find individual translators on freelance sites like Upwork. If you intend to translate into more than one language, though, then go to a reputable, large translation agency, such as The Word Point, as they will have native-speaking translators in almost any language you choose. Google Translate is another option because it is free; however, you will get literal translations, no localization, and your target audiences will be reading a poor translation, not to mention the fact that your images may be offensive, and your keywords may be meaningless in those languages. 2) Consider creating a sitemap in the target language for the translated website. It helps users navigate and keeps them happier. Happy users = more time spent on your site, important for SEO purposes. And it helps search engines correctly index your pages. 3) Use hreflang. This attribute tells search engines that you actually have the same content, images, etc. in different languages so that they are not picking this all up as duplicate content on the same website (something they don’t like). Hreflang tags will tell search engines that you have actually created different versions of the same content for different languages. It will help that search engine serve up the right language for searchers and, as well, recognize that you are not just providing duplicate content. If your site is in WordPress, you can achieve this easily through Yoast. 4) Provide language menus on your website. Don’t use countries as options. In India, for example, there are 41 languages; in China, there are four that are officially recognized. And as you provide those language options, use the recognized spelling of that language. For example, instead of “Spanish,” use “Espanol.” 5) A word about keywords: as you translate to target languages, a key factor will be the use of the right keywords/keyword phrases that are popular for searches in those languages. Again, here is where a human native translator can be invaluable. Otherwise, you will find yourself doing a large amount of research, and the results may be defective. Step 5: Keep housekeeping issues in mind 1) Setting up different currencies for whoever you are using as a payment processor is not difficult. But you need to select the right currencies for an audience that may be accessing your site from many different countries. This requires a bit of research. For example, there may be French-speaking consumers accessing your site from Canada, France, or Algiers. They should be able to select their native currency. 2) The same goes for shipping. Choose an international shipper that will deliver in all of the countries/regions that use the target language. 3) Be thoughtful about images. Obviously, you will not be using women in scantily-clad bikinis for languages that are commonly found in Muslim countries. And you may not want to use pictures of people wearing white in China – it is a color of mourning, not for brides and purity. Here’s where a localization expert comes into play. Common mistakes to avoid This guide is meant to give you the basics of setting up multilingual sites that will enhance your SEO for searchers in foreign languages. As you go through this process, keep in mind that mistakes can thwart all of your efforts: 1) Before you target a language that is common in certain countries and/or regions, make certain that you are not violating any local laws or regulations. For example, new regulations in European countries require notification of the use of cookies. If your target language is French, you must comply with this regulation, because a lot of your customer will reside in France. 2) Don’t assume anything regarding language nuances, cultural values, keywords, etc. Get a native expert to review everything. The American Dairy Association loved its slogan, “Got milk?” But when it was translated into Spanish, it meant, “Are you lactating?” 3) Don’t confuse search engines by making them think you are duplicating content. Use those hreflang tags to inform them that your pages are separate for languages. 4) Don’t target countries when you should be targeting languages instead. Unless you are offering different products/services to consumers in different countries, you should be targeting languages instead. 5) Do your homework regarding keywords/phrases. Get professional help or be willing to do the research yourself. Simply translating keywords from your native site is a huge mistake. Nightwatch is a search visibility tool of the next generation.

While one could take the shelter of judgement involved in the accounting profession, in a matter of some years, probably the accounting profession could evolve in such a manner that most of the these areas are quantified in ink and the standard setting body also deliberates on how to programme an accounting software which scans documents and interprets them on its own. To give an example, US GAAP gives most of the thresholds very specifically in a detailed manner. With Google Translate translating pictures into other languages, with Google Lens able to see what is kept in front of it, these possibilities do not seem too far in the future. Coming back to reality from fiction, technology has already substituted a lot of manual accounting work. While auditing a technology client a couple of years back, I saw a software which scans the invoice and also gives the vendor details, invoice date, payment terms and amount in the system. So recording is bound to get automated very soon. Similar is the case of audit. The field of Forensic Data Analytics has already caught up. While forensic accountants of the previous era took pride in their ability to go through piles of paper and discover the fraud, the accountants of today probably need maximum an hour to go through the entire ledger dump and find the fraudulent entry. This allows the entire profession to focus on the core issue of judgement and leave the data processing work behind. To conclude, if a chartered accountant wants to secure his job, it is imperative for him to learn the technology aspect and update himself on Cybersecurity and Forensic Data Analytics. It would be a great journey to travel into the next era of artificial intelligence. The instantaneous answer for this question would be a firm No. To draw a parallel, if someone had asked in the 1980s whether a driverless car is possible, people would have thought that you are talking sheer nonsense. To continue on to this topic, accounting can be divided into two parts:a) Book Keeping/ Tax Return Preparation/ Verification of Invoicesb) Taking Views on statutes and applying them - this is where judgement is involved While the first one is bound to get automated in the near future, the second one seems doubtful.

That should clarify the meaning of an otherwise opaque statement. However, if you’re looking to argue with a philosopher about this, it fails horribly. People need to put significant time and effort into term-defining and scoping to make an argument about analytical and continental styles coherent. For example, Quine (and then Kripke) changed the overall landscape of analytical philosophy such that one may justly feel that time affects the meaning of any particular quotations. I could also let them speak for themselves... Hilary Putnam: Harvard's philosophy department seems little concerned with modern continental philosophy. Why is this so?  Putnam: I know that that is how it seems to many undergraduates, but in fact in our graduate teaching we are much more involved with continental philosophy than are most mainline philosophy departments. I have taught Habermas's philosophy more than once, and also dealt with some of Derrida's views, Stanley Cave11 has taught the work of Heidegger and Lacan, among other continental thinkers, and Fred Neuhouser and Charles Parsons both teach German philosophy, including that of Marx and Husserl.  It is, however, very difficult to do justice to this work at the under-graduate level. Remember that European students have three years of philosophy at the lycie (high school) level. A continental philosopher takes this background completely for granted. One cannot discuss his work responsibly unless one can assume a substantial preparation in the history of Western philosophy. I know that there are people who parrot Derrida's words without having studied what Derrida has studied, but that is not the kind of student this department wants to produce. —Harvard Review of Philosophy, 1992 Putnam’s candid, casual foil, Jerry Fodor: Royalties aside, what have [continental philosophers] got that we haven’t? It’s not the texture of their prose I shouldn’t think, since most of us write better than most of them. (I don’t include Kierkegaard. He was a master and way out of the league that the rest of us play in.) Similarly, though many of the questions that Continental philosophy discusses are recognisably continuous with ones that philosophers have always cared about, so too, by and large, are many of the questions that we work on… Anyhow, our arguments are better than theirs.   — LRB · Jerry Fodor · Water’s water everywhere I second the link in Emily's answer too.",2021-03-06T11:12:23.769Z,"What do analytical philosophers think of continental philosophy?

The first reason is that engineers have a significant responsibility for human safety that they are ethically and legally obligated to protect as part of their everyday work. Think how much you should value the work of an engineer when you cross a bridge, fly in an airplane, or drive at highway speed in a car all which are designed by an engineer to function safely. Most take it for granted that these should just work. I will preempt rebuttals that are based on examples like the New Orleans levee failure in 2005 and the Minnesota I-35 bridge collapse in 2007. These failures were a result of business decision failures not engineering failures. The decision to design a levee system to withstand only a medium strength hurricane or to not fund proper bridge maintenance is a business person decision not an engineer's decision. Engineers have to work within constraints given to them by people with lower levels of understanding of the impact of those decisions. A second reason engineers earn these salaries is because of the job multiplier effect. The work of one engineer on average creates more than 4 jobs. Engineers design things, but a lot of people are needed to build and operate it. That's the four job multiplier. To have that skill a typically engineer applied themselves academically from K through 12 to earn admittance to 4+ difficult years of college followed by 4+ years of being an engineering apprentice, and then must pass two tough exams before an engineer can practice engineering on their own. After becoming a professional engineer practicing engineering requires a lot of hours of continuing education to remain current. Engineers earn the salaries that they are paid. Our society should be thankful that people want to dedicate their lives to being an engineer. The number of American citizens graduating from engineering programs is significantly lower than the demand. Many engineers are close to retirement age. There are not enough new engineers to replace these positions if the need for engineers stays the same, but the demand is growing. The bigger danger is that little of that experience is not transferred to young engineers through working together for years. Paying engineers more is not the solution. Inspiring students very early is the solution. By 3rd grade most students have decided if they are good or bad at science and math which determines if they become engineers or not. Most engineers did not become an engineer to make a lot of money. They did because of the passion to create solutions and to help society. When questioning excessive salaries the attention should be on highly paid professionals that lead directly to the bank bail out as the result of the 2008 economic crash. The entire budget of NASA throughout its entire history is less than 1% of the bank bailout. Engineers are not responsible for economic failures. Engineers help us dig our way out of one.

But there is wide divergence between Hegel and British Idealism though in a way the school of thought was Hegelian. In the beginning of this century Hegel was seen through the eyes of British Idealism and since the latter were subject to criticism so was Hegel. Hegel was unanimously denounced and he was studied by lone philosophers like G.R.G. Mure and Errol Harris both of whom have written important books on Hegel. But lately a there has been a revival of Hegel scholarship and the study of his philosophy is becoming popular in analytic philosophy.

Traditional web analytics tools have attempted to respond to this challenge of understanding the visitor. They add visitor tracking as a feeble add-on feature - it’s not at all the principle foundation upon which their tracking is built. All of the visitors' behavior must be tracked and associated with a single identified visitor, and web analytics systems were not designed to do so without significant after-market customization.

So reach out to them if you need further details. phraseapp.com is a Hamburg based company led by Wolfram Grätz who pioneered online TMS in Germany. One of their first clients was XING a leading business social network. Today the company has its customer base in the US and all over Europe. Phraseapp has a pretty developer-driven approach and developers used to like it a lot ;-). You can expect a wealth of features to integrate and synchronize your content with the platform. Pricing information can be found here. The user interface is intuitive and loading time is most of the time ok. There are suggestions from the translation memory but no fuzzy match breakdown to discount on them. String statuses are Untranslated, Unverified and completed. Communication runs to their local comment box on a string or job level using Twitter-like tagging. User management is split into the following roles: Manager, Translator, Developer. Translators can either work online or download the content in different formats to work offline. Phraseapp has now over 30 people. Smartling.com is a NY based company, founded by Jack Welde, its CEO. It can be considered a top-notch online TMS with a very robust and tech-driven offering that meets the highest demands of global corporates. The translation workflows are highly customizable and you can work with more than one LSP on a project (e.g. translation and peer review of support center content). The company offers managed services for their clients on the platform like content preparation or string assignments. Data analytics is another important move from Smartling to increase efficiency. Pricing was removed from their website with the latest update but it used to be for financially strong companies with large localization budgets. The user interface is intuitive. A working translation memory gives out traditional fuzzy matches for already translated content that can, later on, be used for billing with discounts. Communication between parties run through the issue system which offers a LISA like the categorization of issues (typo of issue, Severity). A great feature of Smartling is their in-context preview where translators can see the translation in-context right above the translation interface. This feature works with their GDN solution that publishes local sites through Smartling servers or with their Chrome extension and screen captures. Connectors to leading CMS are all in place. Around 2014 Smartling acquired the mobile app localization platform Jargon and incorporated an in-context mobile localization suite to their offering. Crowdin.com is a company based in Ukraine led by Sergey Dmytryshyn. The company started off as a crowd-translation tool for community-driven translation processes like Twitter or Facebook. Gaming companies and open source developments where their early users. Today the company has switched over to the more traditional software localization workflows with professional translators and LSPs. It is easy to use and convinces with a solid range of supported file formats and integration tools. Pricing is great to get started and to set up a professional translation process even for companies or projects with small budgets. A javascript will let you capture content from your website for in-context translation. Translators and managers can track their progress in the dashboard and an automated quality control feature let you check if everything is in order. A translation memory with fuzzy match breakdown statistics is available as well. Many of these features are either not available or come with a price tag in other editors. webtranslateit.com was founded by Edouard Brière in early 2007 after having programmed an internal translation management system at Last.fm (one of Beluga’s clients). He is a highly skilled programmer with a deep understanding of software development and translation. WTI as we call it at Beluga is a very straight forward tool for any size of company. Their support solves any questions in no time and gets the pain out of any translation process management. The interface is clean and offers useful tools for translators and managers like batch operations, a very potent search and a great commenting tool. Discussions on a string level throughout all languages or for a certain local only make this service a real online translation collaboration tool. Small projects of up to 500 strings can use a free mirco plan. Paid plans depend on the number of segments your project has without limitations on the number of languages or word counts. There are suggestions from the TM but no fuzzy match break down in the stats. Features like show string in all languages or the admin view are great for localization managers to efficiently control the localization output.

Another example would be the Classification of Finite Simple Groups, which is the longest proof in the history of Mathematics. According to Wikipedia, the proof that existed as of 1985 is known as the “first generation proof,” and is distributed throughout something like a hundred journal articles and thousands of pages of hard Mathematics. Understandably there is an ongoing effort (undertaken by Gorenstein, Lyons, and Solomon) to write a “second generation” proof. With the benefit of hindsight, they are rewriting the proof into a self-contained collection of volumes in a “more relaxed style.” The great Paul Erdos would speak of “The Book,” an imaginary “transfinite” volume containing the shortest, best, proof of every possible theorem. The highest possible compliment any proof could be given was to say “it's straight from The Book.” Barring that, mathematicians are always on the lookout for opportunities to make their proofs a little shorter, clearer, etc.",2021-03-06T11:28:28.319Z,"Do mathematicians appreciate novel proofs of old theorems?

I started out learning cancer-related biochemistry, in particular, how oncogenesis alters and influences bioenergetics and how cells feed (amino acid transport during G1 phase of the cell cycle, if you are curious). Studying biochemistry helped me pick up diverse clinical areas very quickly. Biochemistry is extremely analytical and looks at many foundational decision-making processes within a living system. When I took a job that required me to learn endocrinology and diabetes, I picked up this new therapeutic area very quickly. I quickly learned to talk about the mechanisms of action of anti-diabetics and the progression from insulin resistance to the train wreck of serious cardiovascular events... I had to do this in front of people who make decisions around drug utilization a.k.a. managed care organizations. Then I took up a job that required me to understand clinical trials around cancer research, not just the preclinical cellular information but how this translates to clinical trials and treatment of human beings and my work was driven by data and clinical trial design. My analytical training helped me pick up this competency very quickly.... I had to be able to talk both scientific theory and application to oncologists who want to propose new studies using certain drug combos for refractory cancers. At various points in my healthcare career I had to study infectious diseases (anti-infectives: I'll admit, my microbiology undergraduate degree made me intimately familiar with such ""bugs"") and psychiatry.

I have also read books about highly sensitive people, especially high-sensation seeking highly sensitive people. These have opened a window for me on some of the special challenges I face. Over the years, armed with better self-knowledge as well as a deeper understanding of how others see and operate in the world, I have learned to have more compassion for both myself and others. INFPs are a rather rare personality type and are frequently misunderstood by others who are not like them. It becomes crucial at times for an INFP to understand and champion themselves, therefor. I find its a good idea to combat my tendency to be too self critical by reminding myself of my many true virtues and assets. I also analyze how I am benefited by others and strive to give them emotional feedback that is positive and affirming for them. I have also grown by exploring my many interests. Currently, I am active in creative writing, watercolor painting and clay sculpting. I also have a high interest in science, scientific theory and new innovations and discoveries. I find local and internet groups to share my passions with and this helps off set my INFP tendency to become socially isolated and lonely. It can be helpful to me, too, to remind myself of my tendency to be ultra sensitive to criticism and to take a step back and apply critical thinking skills to analyze what the other person is really meaning or saying as well as noting the positive potentials in honest feedback and criticism. If you run into a roadblock in life, try spending some time alone to brainstorm about how best to solve the problem. Do you need to acquire some new skill sets. You might consider taking some classes, or if its an intractable personal problem, seeking some counseling. At times of difficulty, it’s important for the INFP to keep open their intuitive and feeling sides which are their strongest problem-solving traits. Otherwise, their shadow side has a tendency to take over and block effective problem solving. Being consciously aware of this potential pitfall definitely helps me.",2021-03-06T11:37:41.853Z,"How do I better myself as an INFP? ",Quora

English is a fascinating language due to its multiple layers. Because of its Saxon core, colloquial English looks like any regular germanic language, but it is not so if you read procedural documents, for example treaties, which look very much like French (luckily for us translators). This may explain Georges Clemenceau's quip: “L'anglais, ce n'est que du français mal prononcé” (English is nothing but mispronounced French).  George Clémenceau, Prime Minister of France during World War I In a way it is, but don't rely on that, because, whenever a word is borrowed from language A to language B, it may undergo a slight to moderate shift of meaning in the process, most of the time due to the new context in which it is used. For example, “record” in English kept its old French meaning of “written account”, which was lost in that language. Now, most of the time, it means “superior result” in French. Any fine distinction of that kind is likely to suffer from variable collateral damages in most Google translations (GT). GT may be good enough for simple technical documents using mainly univocal terms (technical words with only one meaning) in both English and French, like weather bulletins. But for literary or even commercial translation, GT is risky buisiness. In Quebec where I live, a favorite game is collecting wacky GT translations found in commercial signs and advertising, for instance: “pressure-applied preservative” becomes “préservatif appliqué sous pression”, which means “pressure-applied condom” in French. A good French translation would be: “agent de conservation appliqué sous pression”. But my purpose is not blasting GT, this has already has been done, you can find a lot of funny (or sad) references on the Web. In a nutshell: most of the time, Google translation is “goofy translation”, so, except in case of emergency, don't use it, especially if you don't have a clue about the target language... Knowing a second language is a plus because it gives you a different grasp on reality if you know enough about both languages to draw interesting relations between them. This is because most of the time, human mind works by analogy. This unconscious process surfaces during the translation process because the translator has to evaluate different analogies used by different languages to select the right (equivalent) meaning. But I will spare you a long lecture about a not-so-hot topic on Quora. Let's get down to practical translation buisiness. I have a blog relating my bicycle trips on three continents from 1995 to 2015. Naturally, I chose a bilingual format to increase its visibility. But because I'm used to translate documents from English to French, I had a lot of trouble writing a good English translation from my own French texts. The end product looked like a boring didactic description of an arcane process in a textbook. So, I tried the other way around, writing the original text in English. The main drawback for me is that, because English is not my native tongue, I have to check a lot of things, mainly about the use of some expressions. The good news is that this can be easily done on Internet, and the more you do, the better you get. The most fascinating thing I observed is a shift in the mind process used to write in English, compared to writing in French. When I write in native French, my mind is in an analytical mode, looking for the right word or expression. However, whenever I write in English, my mind works is in a somewhat more assertive way: I tend to push raw ideas in front of me, like a public speaker does. The end product is a fun to read, punchy text. Then, I have to translate my own ravings in French. This shouldn't be a problem, because this is what I do to earn a living. But it is: French is a very precise language, and brilliant English rhetorics don't look so good when pinned down in French. So I have to run my French translation into a French to English retranslation process to polish off the rough edges, and the end product is a better, more accurate “original” text, which in turn may require a new English to French translation... Of course, this back-and-fourth process eventually has to come to an end, ideally when both English and French versions look good enough to me. Which doesn't mean that my English text is perfect, but it certainly is more accurate thanks to the French step. As a bonus, I also get a better French text, because it got more assertive (punchy) in the process. Delivering a document in two (or more languages) is called coredaction, and let me tell you that it is not for the faint of heart. If you want a concrete example, have a look on my blog: Riding to Cape Canaveral for the Final Shuttle Flight (7-11 July 2011) last-shuttle-flight - Randonnées de vélo en Amérique, en Europe et en Asie Then, you may click on Page vélo (upper left corner) for the French translation if you wish. This is an original English answer. I have yet to translate it in French.",2021-03-06T11:40:43.971Z,"What gets lost in translation between French and English? ",Quora
60436ac5ed76476feda2a8df,https://www.quora.com/Are-operators-algebras-part-of-functional-analysis?-,"Tomáš Káňa Technically yes, as the theory of operator algebras is concerned about studying properties of closed (usually involutive) algebras of operators on a Hilbert space, hence very functional-analytic objects in their spirit. The first principles of the theory are also functional-analytic: heavy use of the Hahn-Banach theorem, dual spaces, compactness arguments, etc. So could that be the end of the story? Modern trends in operator algebras focus the area towards geometric group theory (respresentations of groups on Hilbert spaces, amenability/soficity questions, translating certain properties of infinite groups to operator algebras), K-theory, coarse geometry (Roe algebras), and dimension theory (nuclear dimension). For those reasons, many operator algebraists I know are very reluctant to call themselves functional analysts. There are even two separate tags on arXiv: mathFA and mathOA for the respective areas. It is interesting to see that people usually tag their papers using both of them. There is also a marketing factor around. Functional analysis (unless PDE-oriented) is usually considered outdated and unfashionable by some maths celebrities and this viewpoint is gradually adapted by more and more people in the maths community. So better not be a part of it, they think. I that those who think like that are quite mistaken, though.",2021-03-06T11:43:01.356Z,"Are operators algebras part of functional analysis? ",Quora

I feel like I know less philosophy than I did when I entered college.  The philosophy courses I took were,  Introduction to PhilosophyLogicModern PhilosophyAncient and Medieval PhilosophyPhilosophy of MathematicsChinese Ways of ThoughtEpistemologyMetaphysicsNietzscheSo those were the courses that constituted my major.  Before I took these courses, I thought I knew a lot about philosophy.  As I continued my coursework, I was challenged.  Every time I started a paper I was at a complete loss of words of what to say. That is until senior year.  In courses 7-9, I just wrote about whatever came to my mind.  Looking back on those essays, I think I had some good ideas but they were underdeveloped by the time I turned them in.  I had a problem with revising my papers because I did not completely believe in what I was writing. If philosophy has taught me one thing, it taught me how to argue a point of view I created from the ground up.  That goal, however, was not my intention when I enrolled in the philosophy program.  I wanted to learn something more grand and something with more substance.  I was enamored with the questions of existence.  What is life?  Why does it exist?  What is death?  What is happiness?  How can I prove the existence of God?  What is my own purpose? When I enrolled in philosophy, I felt like I had the answers to all of these questions.  I remembered that I would engage in countless ‘philosophical’ debates throughout freshman year.  I paid special attention to the rules of logic and modes of inference.  Some people listened to my ideas.  Thinking back on it, I think people listened either out of kindness or because it was the first time they had discourse in such a manner. As the years went by, I found that I partook in discourse less and less.  I studied thousands of years of recorded human thought.  Thought spanning many subjects, composed by some of the greatest thinkers of all time.  The more that I studied, the more I realized that the issues that have not been resolved in philosophy date back to the beginning of philosophy.  It all goes back to different people interpreting different phenomena in different ways.  The day I felt defeated was when I realized there would be no end to the argumentation between the different philosophical schools of thought. Across different subjects and around different peers, I began hearing all the same arguments over and over again.  Sometimes some students would pretentiously clamor that their own view was the correct way to interpret the the world.  I went into philosophy looking for peace and purpose, but ended up finding more argumentation and more strife.  The kind of argumentation that I took most offense to was when students would state that ideas developed by a certain philosopher were completely inane. The argumentation saddened me so I stopped arguing in classes and stayed silent.  That is the day that I expressed myself as an analytic philosopher.  When I opened my mouth in classes, I tried to just connect dots.  My purpose was to explain a philosopher’s thought process and nothing more.  This way, I could avoid the crossfire of my peers.  It was the only way that I felt that the classroom could be about learning about a different way of thought. Philosophy translates to “love of knowledge.”  Sadly, I find that many people who are drawn into philosophy are drawn into it because of their own ego.  Instead of going into class to learn about philosophers, these “ego-sophers” go into classes parading their own self-righteousness. They berate the smallest lapse in any philosopher’s system and use that isolated piece to launch a full force attack on the academic integrity of the said philosopher.  To me, this kind of battle seems so one-sided.  The philosopher cannot defend himself.  He is left open to attack by another person’s interpretation of their text.  To large a degree, this kind of behavior is permissible.  It is what spurs academic growth, but when you have students aggressively claim that “I refuted philosopher (X) with the argument (A) I created” -- something has gone astray. I guess some students walked out of the philosophy program with something that I did not.  Definitive answers and the unquenching drive to express them.  Who knows, maybe it is a mask for insecurity. That is not to say that the philosophy classroom is not a crazy unique experience.  It really is.  how often do students have time to just think about what they want to think about and express their views on it?  Just one thing that I am ashamed about is that I never felt like I could express my views fully.  There was always a distinction between what I was feeling and thinking compared to what I was communicating.  Most of my beliefs and reactions to writing are emotional in nature. When I expressed these views in the classroom, however, I turned them into analytic and logical statements. Communicating logically and analytically is important, but is it the most important thing?  If your argument was not valid and you said it out loud in class-- you can bet a vulture would shred it seconds after you said it.  I wish I could have studied the relationships between thoughts, emotions, and words while in college.  The fact that I do not have an adequate way of describing those relationships makes it difficult to believe that I have a degree in philosophy. Maybe that’s just part of the cost of knowing more.  You feel like you know so much less?  You see the gaps of your knowledge.  I feel like if you are a lover of knowledge, you should take solace in what you do not know. That is what makes knowledge so beautiful, the unknowns. I wrote this little piece right after I graduated college a little over two years ago.  I still believe in what I wrote.  I was wrong about one thing.  I didn’t realize it at the time, but my philosophy studies really allowed me to find out what I believe in.  I thought philosophy was all about proving what you believe in when I first started studying it.  Now I really think its about not doubting or questioning  your core beliefs.  I was only able to achieve that by spending years questioning everything.",2021-03-06T11:44:22.467Z,"What is it like to major in philosophy? ",Quora

Innovative ideas are increasing exponentially each year and to give you a peak into what changes we will have seen by the year 2020, here is a list of 10 amazing innovations that will change different sectors of our lives in a huge way; 1. A plane that can fly anywhere in the world in 4 hours   The British aerospace firm Reaction Engines is working on a plane that can fly anywhere in the world for just four hours. The plane will also to fly in outer space. In the video, chief Engineer Alan Bond explained that air entering the new “Sabre” engine system could be cooled by more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in .01 seconds. The cooling rate will be at 400 megawatts and will allow the plane to “breathe” oxygen. That ability would allow a jet engine to run at higher power than what is possible today. More power equals more speed and therefore the plane will be able to fly at 5 times the speed of sound very easily. (Source) Alan Bond Interview - (Reaction Engines Ltd)  2.

One can play the piano, pick a cup and sip coffee with it. It gives back natural hand movement and weighs as much as a normal arm. It also looks pretty close to the real arm except for the fact that it’s made of metal. The arm is directed by the brain just like a human arm. (Source) 4. Interaction change  Our interaction with people and things has changed over the years due to the internet, smart phones etc. But that’s not all; in the near future a huge change will be made in the way we interact with surroundings. You will be able to look at a building or place and get the information on the subject using just your eyes. Goggles by Google have an early concept of this idea which is an app that allows you to take a picture of an object and immediately receive information about it on your android phone. According to Ray Kurzweil, a top futurist, “by 2020 we’ll routinely have pop ups in our visual field of view that give us background about the people and places that we’re looking at. In other words, your memory will be constantly, instantaneously aided by the information available on the Internet. The two will begin to become indistinguishable.” As the technology improves, you may be able to suggest a move in the chess game and more! (Source) 5. Jetpack technology  Jet pack international has made great strides in their jet pack technology H202 and H202-Z jet packs. This hydrogen peroxide fueled jet packs will allow users to fly at 77 miles per hour and at a maximum height of 250 ft for the H202-Z while the H202 will allow users to fly at a speed of 70 miles per hour at a maximum height of 250ft. (Source) 6. Energy  anotechnology is currently being used to design renewable energy technologies like solar energy. According to Kurzweil, “the cost per watt of solar energy is coming down rapidly and the total amount of solar energy is growing exponentially. It has in fact been doubling every two years for the past 20 years and is now only eight doublings away from meeting all of the world’s energy needs.” Sandia Solar Cells have come close to achieving this since they are made of 100 times less material than that of the current solar cells, operating at the same efficiency. Current panels are heavy and massive and require large motors to track them when tracking the sun. Sandia’s cell on the other hand only needs to be moved a fraction of a millimeter for it to track the sun efficiently and it weighs close to nothing. (Source) 7. Estimote beacons  Estimote Beacons are small beautifully designed sensors that can be placed anywhere in the world. When you install them, either on a product shelf or next to a door, they start broadcasting tiny radio signals that can be picked up by smart phones. The app then triggers different actions like welcoming customers to a store, helping customers navigate the store and displaying coupons. (Source) 8. Health  Invetech, an Australian engineering firm, has teamed up with Organovo, a medical company, to produce a 3-D bio-printer that can fabricate organs to order. The device builds up organs a layer of cells at a time and uses the different cells based on the recipients own body. This significantly lowers the chances of organ rejection. For the more complex organs, the printer lays the cells over a pre-made scaffold. The printer is still in its early testing phase but the companies believe that within five years, they will be able to print out veins and arteries for bypass surgery and within 10 years for complex organs like the liver and heart.

Though we are yet to make them help around the house or do our construction, there have been big strides that point towards a better future. The University of California, San Diego, used the self guided learning process to make a hyper-realistic Einstein robot smile and make facial expressions. Boston Dynamics have a biped robot that dynamically balances using a human-like walking motion. (Source) Also see: Watch As The Most Massive Robotic Swarm Work Together To Form Complex Shapes 10.

The drones will deliver your package 30 minutes after you hit “buy” on Amazon.com. (Source 1, 2) 11. Clothing  Nano technologists are working on making clothes more comfortable to wear. According to Prof Ashwini Agarwal of Delhi IIT, “fibres and filaments are one-dimensional structural materials for textiles. Through nanotechnolgy we can decrease its module value and increase its strength. Not only nanotechnology can be deployed for fibres and filaments and for creating composite nano fibres, but it can also be deployed for surface modifications and finishes of yarns and cloth. By this process the textile products can be made more attractive, strong and responsive to customers’ choice.” (Source) Fiber based nanotechnology is also being used to harvest energy from physical movement.

Computers   According to a prediction by Kurzweil computers will have the same intellectual capacity as humans. “People are looking to nanotechnology to carry on Moore’s Law, which allows chips to be smaller, faster and consume less energy,” says Jim Tully, the vice president and chief of research at Gartner. “To this end, semiconductor giants such as Intel, IBM, HP and others are looking to build ever-smaller silicon circuits for use on processors and communications interfaces, paving the way for smaller, faster, more power-efficient computer systems and other devices.” (Source) Intel corp researchers also predict that by the year 2020, you won’t need a keyboard or mouse to control the computer. Users will use brain waves to open documents and surf the Web. “We’re trying to prove you can do interesting things with brain waves,” said Dean Pomerleau, an Intel research scientiest. “Eventually people may be willing to be more committed … to brain implants. Imagine being able to surf the Web with the power of your thoughts.” (Source) 14. Scanner Cinema Experience  Manchester based animator, Richard Ramchum is the founder of the #Scanners Cinema experience that will allow everyone to watch a film differently. Viewers are supposed to wear a headset that reads brainwaves. The headset then manipulates images one sees according to their subconscious mind. In this way, edit points will be created and the narrative changed when one blinks. It will give people a glimpse into their dream world since the film one sees will be a visual record of your subconscious mind.

They also have a firm grip on their fundamentals as the topics taught are very much what we see around us. For instance, a cup of hot coffee getting cold over a period of time is nothing but laws of thermodynamics coming into picture. In short a person who has the best stories from his engineering days and the one who never cribs about his engineering days can most certainly be a mechanical engineer. Hope this helps :) Jai Hind.

A very interesting question with regard to communication systems and signal processing. For every bandpass signal, there is a corresponding low pass signal. It is possible to generate a band pass signal just by frequency translating the low pass signal. Let us consider an analytic version of bandpass signal.A complex signal whose imaginary part is Hilbert transform of its real part is called an analytic signal.Analytic version of the bandpass signal can now be expressed as a product of complex valued low pass signal and a complex exponential(exponential term arises due to frequency translation of low pass signal) y(t) = x1(t) e^j2πft y(t) represents the analytic version of the bandpass signal. y(t)= x(t) + j ( Hilbert transform of x(t)) x1(t) represents the low pass signal which is actually a frequency translated version of y(t).The exponential term arises due to frequency translation. x(t) =Re( y(t)) Here, x(t) represents the original bandpass signal.(Non-analytic version) x1(t)= x1R(t) + j x1I(t) x(t) = x1R(t) coswt - x1I (t) sinwt x1(t) represents the low pass signal. Hence,any arbitrary bandpass signal can be represented in terms of two low pass signals each of which is multiplied with quadrature components of the carrier. cos2πft is the in-phase carrier and sin2πft is the quadrature phase carrier. In other words,Bandpass signal can be resolved into two low pass signals one of which is the in-phase component and the other is the quadrature phase component. If x(t) is a band pass signal then, x(t)= xI(t) coswt - xQ(t) sinwt Where xI(t) is the in-phase component and xQ(t) is the quadrature phase component.We can also take the amplitude modulated wave as an example. For instance, let us assume the output of modulator. m(t) cos (wt+ theta) represents a band pass signal where m(t) is a band limited low pass message signal. In general,the frequency components of low pass signals are centred around zero in the spectrum plot.The multiplication of the low pass signal m(t) with the carrier coswt converts the signal to bandpass.The bandpass nature arises out of the fact that there is a sinusoid present at a frequency f.

And I suspect the lack of this skill is the cause of many failures in data science investments. Having senior executives hire a team of data scientists to declare with much fanfare ‘go forth and do AI and machine learning!’ is neither necessary nor sufficient. Having gone through this use case hunting and data acquisition dozens of times with my team, here are five things that I have found helpful in getting access to data: Don’t show off tech - show off the potential to solve problems. A supply chain executive is not particularly interested in your extreme gradient boosted tree. But his/her eyes may light up when you show a bit of optimization code to fix his inventory overstocking problem.Attractive data visualizations are your friend. There is analytics that is statistically sound, analytically robust and innovative in implementing cutting edge machine learning libraries. But sometimes none of that matters to many senior executives - and (sorry to say) pretty charts and nice user interfaces will take you where the most elegant python code cannot.Align every project to business strategy. There are multiple possible projects in every business department. But the one that will ultimately get support are usually the ones that most directly and significantly impact business metrics.Run open learning sessions using data generated to approximate real data sets. There is a lot of interest in data science, machine learning and AI at the moment. It represents an opportunity to educate and de-hype, while ‘fishing’ for projects. I’ve found the most useful demonstrations and learning sessions are the ones built on data sets that are similar to what is used by the audience - the desired outcome is that ‘aha’ moment where the audience goes from ‘this is interesting’ to ‘hey, could you do that for me?’And most importantly: Communicate with empathy to your audience. Understand that many concepts that data scientists use in their daily work may still be foreign to the majority of your colleagues. Leave academic speak behind, abstract away any technical jargon and be simple and succinct.

Some recommend particular events and then leave a ""slot"" open for custom  events. The former leaves some of the organizing work to the developer.  The latter makes the analytics package do the thinking, so I prefer it  (and put it in our package). The events are going to show up as  ""calls"" within an API. Translation: when something happens in the game,  the analytics software is going to send the record of it to the package,  typically up in the cloud somewhere. The package then collects,  organizes, and performs any algorithms on the data. Therefore, the calls are going to show up in the analytics company's documentation. Here is ours as an example: Ninja Metrics "" Docs , but these are mostly common. After all, analytics packages don't  innovate in the collection of data, but rather in the later use of it.  Some have fewer call types with broad definitions, while others have  more types with narrower ones. What specifically should you instrument to track growth and drop-offs? You'll need the basics like DAU, MAU and retention, so having login/logout and timestamps allow for most of these. If you want to connect them with questions like ""is this quest causing churn?"" then you'll have to instrument the quest. Change that question to ""is this 'blank' causing . . ."" and you need to instrument 'blank,', etc.  You should also track invitations so you can have virality statistics. And track all account-related events so you can have more robust definitions of subscription, retention and ""active user"". One last note: you may want to instrument everything, but are you going to store it somewhere? If so, you may have space considerations. Some large-scale games only fully instrument some versions/shards with an extended set of logs while keeping the rest more minimally. Of course this restricts the depth of what you can say across the whole user base, but if your goal is sampling and generalizing, that may be OK.

These messaging apps and bots can also help answer questions, search through inventory, check order status, and augment human interactions with high degrees of efficiency. The shift to conversational commerce is already here and destined for another evolution. Here’s why. Consumers are already more reliant on messaging apps for their daily communications (personal, business, commerce). In fact, instant messages sent through chat apps have already surpassed emails in 2016.

With each passing year, these technologies are enabling brands to offer more customized experiences that meet the demands of the consumer.Outbound is the new inbound. Customer interactions with businesses no longer happen in a vacuum. Tools like chatbots and automated messaging based on behavioral detection allow businesses to turn static chat apps into engagement machines that offer personalized experiences that funnel window shoppers into active buyers.Consumers are already expecting personalized shopping experiences because consumer experiences have already been reconditioned by new technologies such as mobile checkouts, cardless payments such as Apple Pay, YouTube, Alexa, Google Home, and more.Customer service has already gone through many evolutions that enable conversational commerce to be much more of a reality than ever before.

I did my MBA with about 2–3 years experience and throughout the course I had the sense that I would have benefited more if I had just a bit more managerial experience when I took it. The MBA is about (surprise!) managing businesses - and it is hard to make the jump from working in a business from the perspective of an individual contributor, to thinking of working on a business from the perspective of an owner or professional manager. The missing piece is leading a department, or at least a small team. At that level, you are able to appreciate the tension of both perspectives. And it is at that point that an MBA can best accelerate your growth.  With that said, if done at the right time, doing an MBA after an MS is a great idea! I also come from a technical background in IT and Analytics, and what I observe is that technical people are most comfortable with… other technical people. We have our own jargon, our own private jokes, and we secretly - or not so secretly - make fun of ‘dumb business people’. Unfortunately, what that translates to is that we are good at our own function, but struggle to emphatise and understand when we reach the point (which always comes) of having to actually work with and manage ‘those people’. Enter the MBA, that mixes you with a bunch of savvy business people, gives you enough frameworks and ways of thinking to say something reasonable in the case of most of the problems you’ll face, and usually some hands on experience managing teams and doing public speaking. Yes, you can find a lot of the content online or in books that cost a couple of bucks, but there is still a case for the interaction, the intangibles and the relationships that make up most of the value of an MBA. And for many MS students, it is just what is needed for domain specialists and technical managers moving up to broader roles.",2021-03-06T11:56:32.573Z,"Is doing MBA after MS a good idea?

There is an umpteenth number of opportunities that span across multiple industries for you to explore since making a career in analytics is promising for people of all backgrounds. Let's find out why one should pursue a Career in Data Analytics? High salary at entry-level and excellent perks - Data analysts are paid very well in the industry even at entry-level since there are limited data analysts in the market. Data analysis is one of the most sought after jobs in the market and there is no denying that. The salary of a data analyst also depends upon the skills, certifications, education level the industry that they work in, and a candidate’s experience. Diverse roles - Data analyst professionals are always exposed to versatile roles and responsibilities based on years of skills or experience. You need to do is identify your strength and what exactly you want to do and what you are good at since there are numerous roles that you can choose from. High demand – Until it is put to the right use there is no use of data companies are continuously recruiting professionals who have the right knowledge of using advanced tools and good command over the programming language to translate raw and unstructured data into meaningful insights and to design software that can process a large volume of datasets. The shortfall of Data Analyst Professionals - Professionals who possess the right skill set and knowledge to perform the task are very limited however the demand for a data analyst is very strong. This opens up an extreme number of opportunities to kick start your career in this field. What skills do I need to become a Data Analyst? Communication Skills it is of utmost importance for a data analyst to convey their findings in a manner that is easy to understand for a vast audience since insights that are gathered from data analysis are consumed by several departments within the company to aid decision-making. Communication skills and Strong presentation are keys to success. Programming Language You must have a solid understanding of at least one programming language to become an expert in data analysis. But to be more versatile having command over more than one language increases your chances of getting a good salary. Python, R, Excel, and SQL are some of the languages used by data analysts. The logic remains the same even though the trend keeps changing hence to stay up to date It would be best if you focused on algorithms and fundamentals. Database Knowledge Since you being a data analyst you may have to work at the backend wherein you design a data warehouse to store a huge chunk of data from multiple sources in one place. To pull information from different tables to perform the further analysis you must possess a strong database and database query language knowledge to query the database. Problem-solving approach and Analytical thinking The key attributes of a good analyst are keeping a creative mind, having a problem-solving approach, and thinking out of the box. It will help you build good repo among key stakeholders of the company and helps you ask relevant and interesting research questions. Data cleaning and interpreting One should possess a strong knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and data mining to clean and extract unstructured data.

In courses such as these, working on real datasets is important and my guess is that students will be having an opportunity to work with some good sized Government datasets.Placements wise, the institute can get good companies. It can give the students visibility to corporate world.Post bifurcation, the state of Andhra Pradesh is stripped of IIIT Hyderabad, ISB Hyderabad, NIT Warangal. There are really no institutes of national repute. State universities such as Andhra University have their limitations despite having very good student quality. The Chief Minister Mr. Naidu has brought IIIT, ISB to Hyderabad during his previous tenure recognising the importance of world class institutions in contributing to the profile of a modern city. Hyderabad benefitted immensely from this. He is trying to get similar institutes in the new State. IIT Tirupati, AIIMS Mangalagiri and IIM Vizag are result of this. Private universities like Amity, VIT, SRM are also in pipeline. IIDT is one more attempt by the State government in setting up top institutes in the State. Against this background, IIDT will enjoy total support from the Government, which will translate into concrete benefits to students till placementsFee at Rs. 4.75 lakh is very attractive since it is inclusive of accomodation and food. For the content that the students will be taught, this is a good return on investmentThe content is very well thought of. Software focus seems to be on R (though I would have to add here that Python is the language you need to learn if you are looking for a career in data science. R is very good too). There are wide array of domains in which analytics applications are taught including retail, web, HR,financial analytics, text, marketing.Negatives : New institutes are risky. They start with lot of hype but usually fail to live up to the promise. Until a couple of batches pass out or atleast the first batch graduates, it is going to be a risk joining a new instituteThe faculty and course content is from Praxis. I would say it is an ok faculty profile,maybe just above average but definitely nothing great about themAccommodation and food is at Venkateswara University. Better visit the place once and see for yourself. State universities are very peculiar in different ways. I know the things here at Andhra University. I do not expect anything different at SVU. Don’t expect air-conditioned, single accommodation rooms with all facilities and great food. State university experience is to be had first hand and cannot be explainedThis is a 11 month course comprising of three terms. The curriculum is of 7–8 courses per term. A term may be 3 or max 4 months. Covering 8 subjects in 3–4 months is enough indication that the focus is more on breadth rather than depth. You may be exposed to a lot of areas but you need to work on your own to dig a bit deeper in order to get the level of knowledge expected by industryA majority of those who are interested in analytics realise after sometime that their real interest is machine learning/ data science. For those, this is not a good course. There are a lot of wonderful alternate courses if your goal is to get into machine learningAnalytics is a broad area. It is applied in almost every domain ranging from health, retail, finance, education, HR, etc. What this course does is that it touches all areas superficially. That is why it is ok to do this course if you are a fresher and do not know which area you want to ultimately get into. This is more like a foundation course. For those with significant workex, I would not recommend thisEverything is not analytics subject. There are some subjects like accounting, communication, econometrics, etc. that make this course like a mini-MBA course. Ofcourse they are important to be taught to young fresh students but the real learning in such areas happen on the jobSubjects such as SAS are not required. The definite trend in analytics is in open source software such as R and Python. I am really surprised they are teaching SAS which is a proprietary software with heavy license fee and used maybe used primarily only in drug companies.This is not as comprehensive as the joint program offered by IIM-Kolkata, IIT-Kharagpurand ISI Kolkata. That is a two year course and is a very good option.But fee is very highI would say IIDT is a decent choice but not in the league of IIMs or ISB. It needs to establish itself first. But the analytics industry is having lot of openings so even a decent profile institute like IIDT can get you good placements. Take out Government of Andhra Pradesh from this equation and I would not recommend this but with that single factor, I would recommend it for fresh engineering graduates only who are yet undecided whether their real area of interest is machine learning/ data science or plain data analytics. If you can afford high fees and two years time, joint program offered by IIM-Kolkata, IIT-Kharagpurand ISI Kolkata is suggested. If not and if possible, wait for one more year. The field of analytics is very rapid with lot of new tools, applications, domain areas and courses coming up. Many top notch institutes are continuously coming up with new programs in analytics. A course more suited to you may be coming up in this year.

Let me tell you about someone I know. To protect his privacy, I will give him a pseudonym — let’s call him Fabrizio because that’s very not like his real name — and conceal the country involved and exactly what he is currently doing, but everything else is true. Fabrizio and I met at a school for gifted children. Where even among gifted children, his grades were among the top of his class. He was creative, musical, talented at acting and public speaking, and on multiple school sports teams representing our middle school province-wide. In high school, he continued to be near the top of our cohort academically. As well, he was very popular and had many friends, and was among the few of us who had excellent relations with his family even during the most tempestuous of teenage years. There were many times I envied him during our school years, can’t you tell? (I was a very solid A- student, but not straight A or A+. A bit lazy and inattentive for that, honestly; I didn’t care about some subjects, and wouldn’t work hard for teachers I didn’t respect. And I certainly was neither the most popular, nor the most athletic, nor the best-adjusted.) He was the son of a professor at a local university, so he went to that local university because tuition would be free. Still, he got a highly competitive research scholarship. He started out double-majoring in math and physics, and realized he wanted to do medicine. He switched to double-majoring in math and biology. Fabrizio graduated with honours and research experience, and applied to an array of med schools across Canada and the United States. None of them took him. Some replied saying that he didn’t have enough extracurricular medical experience showing his motivation. So Fabrizio got a part-time job with the local hospital. To pass the years until he could try again, he finished up the physics major he started, and the requirements for a classics major. Basically, this guy had four majors by the end of this story (and majors in Canada have more requirements than they do in the US: as a double major, I had no electives whatsoever, and when I hear of triple majors, I stare in befuddlement). But medical schools kept passing him over, this guy who not only looked amazingly intelligent on paper (and is, when you talk to him), but now had direct experience in the medical field. After a couple of years trying, during which time he completed his two-major post-bac, Fabrizio ended up going to medical school in a different country that he had ties to, which didn’t actually require a bachelor’s degree first, so he was far more educated than his classmates. He excelled at diagnosis. Diagnosis exams you had two hours to solve, he would solve in literally barely more time than it took to read the problem, and get them right. He did pretty darned good at everything else. After all, he was fully capable of studying. And he got jaded as he realized that not only all the aspiring doctors around him, but the doctors who were teaching him were all doing things by the book, not scientifically, but the way they had always been done, that they were reluctant to adopt the latest research in biology and medicine, that they simply could not think as well as he did, and his talents had no advantage there. He imagined spending the rest of his life working with such people, and grew depressed. After all this time and effort, with the equivalent of four bachelor’s degrees — my friend Fabrizio dropped out of medical school. Currently he is working on a master’s degree in yet a different field and being a part-time sports coach while he figures out what to do with his life. I still call him up when I encounter, say, a weird medical claim or weird symptoms, to bullshit-detect, as he is still excellent at diagnosis. So another answer to your question is — sometimes succeeding in medicine is not a matter of being able to study, or even not wanting to. Sometimes it’s medicine that’s not a good fit for them. Besides the answers that other people give, that sometimes they don’t want to or are not motivated by high pay — even if the gifted students do choose medicine and are fully capable of studying it, it’s not that simple.

Another sacrifice is to lose some soundness or completeness to make things work. There's also the problem of knowledge engineering, which can be very difficult or even impossible in some domains.

Ostensibly, the dictionary definition is straightforward: a programmer is someone who writes computer programs. Simply creating algorithms is clearly not enough: Euclid may have invented Euclid's algorithm, and Gauss the (essence of the) Fast Fourier transform, but both developed them for humans not machines. Arguably they may be considered computer scientists, but certainly not programmers. The fact that both algorithms are now run on computers is neither here not there Similarly, the inventors of algorithms for the abacus, slide rule or Pascal's calculator were not programmers either, as while these were mechanical computational devices, they weren't general purpose enough to be described as computers. Babbage's Analytical Engine was general enough to be described as a computer. Algorithms written for it may therefore plausibly be described as computer programs. The fact that the computer was never built and the programs were never run does in my opinion make their creation less like normal programming, though perhaps not excessively so. (We don't consider Turing a programmer despite him writing programs for the Turing machine but in that case the programs were never intended to be run.). A far more serious issue is that Lovelace was not the first person to write programs for the Analytic Engine: Babbage was. She was not even the second: Menabrea, whose work Lovelace translated, also wrote some simple programs. In fact, most of the programs in Lovelace's notes had been completed by Babbage years earlier. The one original program was also based on Babbage's work, though Lovelace did find and fix a 'bug' in it. The work was published under Lovelace's (and Menabrea's) name, but that doesn't counteract Babbage's priority. Perhaps the way in which Lovelace comes closest to being the 'first programmer' is that unlike Babbage, her original work was purely concerned with software, while he also dealt with hardware; and unlike Menabrea, her programs were not trivial. Still, her contribution was too much of a one off in my opinion to satisfy this restricted 'habitual' definition of programmer as someone who regularly writes programs.  The reason that I think describing Lovelace as the first programmer is counterproductive is that it overshadows the far more important work of other female computing pioneers, including those who I believe genuinely were the first programmers. In my opinion, these women are far better role models for girls (and boys) in STEM, as they worked in a less 'exotic' environment that is easier to relate to, and achieved much more tangible (and undisputed) results. Just as Emmy Noether and Maryam Mirzakhani are better role models than the oft misrepresented Hypatia, pioneers such as Grace Hopper and Betty Holberton are, I feel, better role models than the steampunk myth that Lovelace has become. So who were the first programmers? The first program that was run on an electronic computer was probably written by Konrad Zuse in 1941. However, the first regularly working programmers, who worked using an archaic interface and (unsurprisingly) no manuals, were the original ENIAC team: Kathleen Antonelli, Jean Bartik, Betty Holberton, Marlyn Meltzer, Frances Spence and Ruth Teitelbaum. The first technical author was Adele Goldstine, who wrote ENIAC's technical description. Of these, Holberton had the most influlential post-ENIAC career (amongs other things, she was responsible for the first mainframe sort merge). She was soon joined by the likes of Grace Hopper, Jean Sammet and many others. For more information about the ENIAC programmers see the ENIAC Programmers Project website.   ​​​  ​​ While in popular culture Ada Lovelace is indeed often viewed as the 'first programmer', personally I think this is both misleading and possibly counterproductive.

Ostensibly, the dictionary definition is straightforward: a programmer is someone who writes computer programs. Simply creating algorithms is clearly not enough: Euclid may have invented Euclid's algorithm, and Gauss the (essence of the) Fast Fourier transform, but both developed them for humans not machines.

Yes, a content marketer has to be data-oriented. As a content marketer, a lot many factors come into play when you are determining your success going ahead with your content marketing campaigns. Everything ends well with a wealthy ROI, but yes, reaching it is a staged process.

These include the SEO strategy, web traffic, no and quality of leads nurtured, sales generated, on-site engagement, etc. Thus leading to the establishment of an authority for your brand. With so many factors including the traffic earned, the sessions made, the pageviews, the visitors, and so on, money alone cannot be a determining factor for your content marketing efforts. There are various other metrics accompanying the same. These include... 1) Web traffic is the first thing to be focused on Website traffic is the number of web users visiting your website. This is the first and foremost step acting as a determining factor to be taken into account while measuring the success of your content marketing efforts. Also termed as ""sessions"", the traffic measures the business's effectiveness for attracting an audience. Without traffic, there is no working ahead, no leads, no sales, and eventually no revenue. The tool Google Analytics helps you seek for traffic that lands on different pages on your website. Now with the pillar being made, you could mold your marketing strategy for generating quality leads, sales, and higher returns on investments in the future. 2)The quality of leads generated matters a lot The funnel visualization for the leads getting nurtured is very important. The path the acquired prospects travel within the content marketing funnel determines the chances for potential conversions. Lead quality differentiates the visitors in quality depends upon the actions they take with them landing upon the different pages and seeking further actions thereby. As a content marketer, you need to have your goals set up, thereby tracking the movement of the qualified leads, for maximum conversions. If in case the bounce rate goes high and the conversion rate goes too low, there is an indication of the acquisition of fairly low quality of leads through your content marketing campaigns. 3)Onsite engagement gives detailed information on a visitor's website interaction It’s not about just attracting the visitors, the time to retain the same visitors matters too. You have to push for greater dwell time for purposeful interaction and beneficial reaction from the visitors. The visitor has to consume your content and so the engagement metrics matter a lot. They should like spending time on your website, consumer content through different resources, so as to make sure that they are interested in your offerings. Some important metrics to look for in this case include page per session, average session duration, the bounce rate, and so on. 4)Sales take you to an approximate ROI calculation Sales define the exact number acquired for an approximate ROI calculation. If the movement of the prospect within the funnel is smooth and you are nurturing quality leads with the right content at the right time, there is a possible sale out of it. Your set Goal Pages or the Pages that define the possibility of an eCommerce transaction are measured by a metric called Page Value. By giving an average value of the page, this metric gives you a general idea pre-determining whether there could be a possible sale denoting the pages that are of the most importance on your site for the maximum revenue. 5)SEO success is also very crucial Does your content show up on the first page of the search results? If yes, you are bound to get higher website traffic and that with a higher conversion intent, but if it's below that, you have to work upon the different forms of the content present on your website so that you are in the race to rank higher for the targeted queries. Any of your content pieces especially those defining industrial research should be optimized in and out for appearing higher on search results for a greater trigger at the acquisition stages. And it is when the On-page and Off-page SEO, are being taken care of, it results in the overall success of your content marketing campaigns. 6) Social media shares The social media marketing strategy as a part of your content marketing strategy acts as an important role player in determining success in terms of ROI. The social media presence for any brand acts as a great influencer for purchase decision making. The social media engagement as a part of the referral traffic becomes vital when it comes to getting potential customers who have purchase oriented decision making. The social shares in addition can also be a valuable tool here so as to share enlightening, entertaining, and inspiring content. This builds a higher website traffic base and furthers the marketing performance goals. Thank you!

Being good at numbers helps you to better analyze raw data, business impact, competitive and market conditions, pricing models, etc. Having qualitative strengths helps you with messaging, positioning, and communication of your ideas to others. This last point is important because product marketers almost always need to work with and through other teams, so the ability to communicate is critical. You may be asking this question is because you don’t feel confident enough about your numbers game. If so, here is what I would say: Make sense of the numbers. The most important quantitative skill for a product marketer is to be able to understand what the numbers mean, and to provide context. You don’t necessarily have to do heavy duty number crunching yourself. Depending on the size of the company and the makeup of the team, there may be other team members such as data analysts and financial analysts who can help. Or if you need to do substantial modeling in Excel, use some of your budget to hire a contractor who specializes in this. Your job is to find meaning in the numbers so you can plan a better launch, segment your audience, enable the sales team, create competitor battlecards, etc.Play to your strengths. It’s rare that a single person is superhuman enough to be exceptional at everything. Mortals like us are bound to be better at some things than others, so go with it. Leverage your strengths and use them to shine. Do you love crafting messaging or coming up with creative campaigns? Great! Do you prefer to work with sales and partners? Great! Are you more technical/product oriented? Also great! Think of it as a formula where a+b+c+d+e+f= Total PM Value (sorry for the math reference). You can be exceptional in some areas and only pretty good at others, but what matters is the total value you deliver. What’s most important here is to be aware of what other people value you for most , and deliver the heck out of that.Always keep growing and learning new skills. With enough effort and practice, you can get better at anything. If you discover that the ability to build Excel models, perform regression analysis, or slice and dice data will make you a better product marketer, then get practicing! While kicking ass playing to your strengths in #2 above of course. I consider grit, attitude, and resourcefulness to be more important traits of a great product marketer than any individual skillset. These traits allow you to build any skillset you need, and adapt to any situation you encounter.Best of luck!",2021-03-06T12:06:01.263Z,"Do you have to be good at numbers to be a great product marketing manager?

A business analyst is one who understands the specific business domain (ex. retail, merchandising to be specific, supply chain etc.). His/her role is to understand the business problem, analyse the current business state and then provide recommendations to solve the business problem. The business analyst does this by capturing business requirements using various tools like surveys, interviews, group discussions and then getting management to approve (sign off) on it. The business analyst typically works under a line of business manager(s) overseeing specific business function(s). A business systems analyst is an extension of the business analyst role, but with a focus on technical solutions. These analysts often act like liaison between technical experts/administrators and the business. Sometimes they are experts themselves (solution architects). The person typically needs some technical knowledge in the area he/she is in working in order to perform detailed analysis of the technical solutions and test them to make sure they meet business requirements (user acceptance/user experience/integration/unit tests are examples). Most business systems analysts focus on systems that augment a business units capabilities (sales enablement..etc). Example technical knowledge: you will need to know SQL while working on implementing a new product to check if data is setup correctly etc. A data analysts role works with data to derive meaningful insights to address business problems or discover hidden trends/patterns that can be leveraged to meet the business objectives. Data Analysts typically have a focus on data exploration and visualization with more advanced positions trying to explain phenomena with statistical models. It's also not uncommon for data analysts to create reports or develop metrics to measure the performance of a business (key performance indicators), though this is traditionally more of a business intelligence task. A data scientist role involves data analysis and pattern detection using advanced statistical modeling, machine learning and artificial intelligence. They are often versed in designing studies/experiments to tease out data signals or to validate models. Data Scientists often have a significant role in designing data-driven business tools, proprietary math algorithms or predicting consumer behavior based on historical data (improving revenue/costs/profits). Business Intelligence(BI) Analyst works in Business Intelligence, a field associated with business reporting/data analysis on (hopefully) consolidated cross-departmental business data. They are typically the stewards of and business-facing representatives of a 3rd party (IBM/Tableau...) reporting platform, which often employs database specialists and business intelligence developers. Business Intelligence analysts may act as data subject matter experts and support other business units data needs. A common responsibility of this unit is to develop standardized business reports and metrics. Common tools include data extract-transform-load (ETL) tools like Informatica and reporting tools like MicroStrategy. With the advent of Big Data, the tool set has significantly expanded. Product Manager supports and coordinates the development or implementation of a specific technology or technical solution. He/She may not fully understand the technology or domain, but is required to know enough to provide guidance to the team, steer them in the right direction and eradicate obstacles that arise. Product Managers may follow a specific project management methodology like Agile/PMP and manage deadlines/expectations/risks of product development. An MBA will only help you get your foot in the door for any of these roles. You need to have specific knowledge about the domain/technology based on the area of work. MBA with focus on analytics can help prepare you for these roles, it is a good skill to have, however, it is the application that will help you succeed. That said, MBA is often preferred for Business Analyst, Business Systems Analyst, BI Analyst and Product Manager roles. 150",2021-03-06T12:11:20.046Z,"How should data teams be structured to deliver on the promise of AI-driven business intelligence?

In truth, there are really no career paths open to you if you do not have any other skills (soft skills or otherwise) or qualifications to go with your knowledge of languages. There are a number of very, veeeery limited things you can do with your languages if you have few employable skills (note: I didn’t say no skills at all). These are: Internet polyglotteryPretty much the most basic thing you can do. All you really need as capital is a working internet connection and a webcam. This career path usually involves polyglots setting up a YouTube account where they talk about learning different languages, alongside a blog of some sort where they elaborate on their thoughts, reach out to their followers and come up with new marketable ideas. An example:  Successful internet polyglots can create an entire career out of their own brand name alone. The clearest example of that would be Benny Lewis with his extremely successful Fluentin3months blog. In fact, his blog was absolutely monumental in galvanising a new generation of polyglots. Even if it isn’t strictly through brand marketing, other successful internet polyglots go on to do a lot of incredible things: Richard Simcott and Alex Rawlings started organising polyglot conferences a few years ago, connecting polyglots from all over the world (mostly from Europe and North America) and providing interesting networking opportunities and new business connections. I got to talk to the founder of iTalki for example. Brian Kwong has launched a pretty successful Facebook-based language-learning business called the Add1Challenge, and David Mansaray has a series of extremely interesting podcasts as well. Conor Clyne has kick-started an advertising requests for additional revenue. Polyglots also create courses: Judith Meyer has created a top-notch website called LearnYu; Olly Richards has come up with his own really cool courses as well; Dima Gurbatov has created Spanish podcasts and audio courses; I’ve just helped Vladimir Skultety edit his ebook on Chinese characters; as well as Jan van der Aa with his VocaBooster courses. But here’s the thing. To really succeed in this career path you have to have a lot of valuable soft skills. You need to have an entrepreneurial, self-starter attitude. You need to be able to communicate and network. You need to be personable and memorable. You need to be disciplined. You may also need to have other skills such as coding, web design and marketing. Languages alone don’t cut it. Even so, very few of these polyglots live off their blog/YouTube/course revenues alone. Many of them have other jobs as their main source of income with their polyglottery serving as additional revenue. I believe Richard works as an ambassador at a company and Olly worked at the British Council. Conor is a lawyer and so was Dima. It can be extremely difficult to sustain a decent quality of life on just internet revenue alone. It can be done, but it is not a stable career path by any means. Oh, and if you want to embark on this career path, you’d better get right on it. The market is getting more and more saturated every day. Tour guidesThis may seem like a natural route for multilingual speakers, but it also isn’t really as simple as it looks. Without any form of certification you won’t be employed. And even if you do end up working as a tour guide, you need to have incredible communication and organisational skills, be an engaging and outgoing public speaker, and be prepared to be on your feet a lot. Ad-hoc translationI know a few polyglot friends doing this right now, basically accepting translation requests from friends and acquaintances. This can be fairly well-paid … provided you have enough friends and acquaintances to provide you with work. It can be a pretty hard to sustain without getting some form of certification that would provide greater legitimacy to your translation work — particularly when it comes to more specific areas such as technical translation. WritingBenny Lewis has arguably forged this path for all polyglots looking to rely solely on polyglottery as a career path. Writing best-selling books can be an excellent way to gain income. Again … being a writer is far from easy, language learning is a limited market and Benny is arguably an anomaly, as one of the main reasons why his book was so successful was because of how much traction his blog and his brand gets. Writing a book can be incredibly arduous and demotivating work — just ask anyone who’s ever had to do it :)     ESL teaching and online tutoringAgain, ESL (or any other second language teaching if you speak a ‘major’ language like French or Spanish) teaching is probably the most stable career path out of all the ones I’ve listed above. However, you will need a CELTA or TEFL certificate and those can get quite expensive. The world of ESL teaching can also be rather cruel in certain parts of the world, especially if you are an English speaker who does not conform to a certain Anglo-Saxon aesthetic. But it can be well-paid, you get opportunities to travel, you get set hours, a set salary and the opportunity to use your languages. Online tutoring is slightly more tenuous, but it can be a great way to supplement your income. I would recommend signing up as a tutor on iTalki. This is mainly for retired folk, students looking for extra income or stay-at-home husbands or wives looking for something to do. But it can be well-paid especially if you offer help with exam prep.  As for slightly more viable career paths that you need specific skills for in addition to your language skills: Professional translation and interpretingDon’t bother applying for professional translation jobs in places like the UN/EU, major translation companies etc if you don’t have any formal certification and years of experience. They won’t be amused. Again, very difficult work, but it can be rewarding. Make sure you get certified, else you won’t be able to find much to do. Also, specialised interpreting (medical interpreting, court interpreting) can be well-paid. But it is very difficult work, you have exams to sit for and a clientele to build. If you are interested in the translation/interpreting path, I would suggest you go to Facebook groups and start reading, connecting and learning. Log into Facebook | Facebook Log into Facebook | Facebook Log into Facebook | Facebook Linguistics/academiaOkay, you technically don’t have to be multilingual to be a linguist, but it does tend to help. This is a very academic route though. Plenty of polyglots who are research-inclined, like André Müller, find this an attractive route to pursue. This is hard work. You have to slog through your Bachelor’s, then your Master’s, then your PhD, get research grants, teach, do fieldwork and/or produce original research. And attend conferences and network with other academics, should that be necessary. You need to be extremely disciplined and have a huge love for language. And have excellent critical thinking, analytical and written/oral communication skills. Also, depending on where you are, this can be very poorly-paid, as humanities and social science disciplines don’t tend to be well-funded outside of the West. Which is a shame, but academia can be a thankless job in itself… Regional/international organisationsWe’re talking about UN and EU bodies here, as well as other international NGOs and charities. The good news is that they often value (and often require) multilingual speakers. I don’t believe that it is possible to get a job in any EU or UN organisation unless you are fluent in at least two official languages. Also, this is a very desired career path because of its stability and (where possible) international opportunities. The bad news is that … you’ll need other skills. A lot of other skills. They won’t hire you willy-nilly. Be prepared to have at the very least a postgraduate degree and several years of relevant experience in that specific sector (development, human rights, cultural preservation, economics etc.) to apply, and then some. If you are interested in this route, have a look at these websites below and prepare accordingly: Jobs at Unicef UK - Unicef UK Careers UN Careers Other professional/vocational trades: medicine, law, journalism etc.This may not be what you want to hear, but multilingual skills will probably be most useful as a supplement to other more traditional career paths. Knowing multiple languages can be very helpful when working as an analyst or lawyer in international corporations, for instance. Or as a doctor in multilingual societies. Or as a journalist covering important global events. I don’t want to sound like a broken record by saying this, but it goes without saying that if you want to embark on these particular career paths, you’ll need to have the education and experience to show for it. Your languages here would serve as an added bonus, the additional seasoning on the plate, but it won’t be the main dish.  In conclusion, the paths open to you just for being a polyglot are pretty much zero. Even for paths with very low barriers to entry (ie. internet polyglottery) you will need to rely on and develop a range of soft-skills — from networking to entrepreneurial skills — to be truly successful. Good luck, and I hope this has helped somewhat. Just for being a polyglot? As in, just for knowing several languages?

If Continue ReadingComplex analysis can be quite useful in solving Laplace’s equation in two dimensions. From a physics point of view, one of the subjects where this is very applicable is electrostatics. Mainly — there are configurations where complex analysis can make your life infinitely easier. What I’ll do in this answer is do a quick revision on the relevant maths and then give a couple of applications too.  Mathematical prelude. What we will try to exploit to our advantage is a certain property of analytic (or holomorphic) functions on the complex plane. A function is called analytic if df/dzdf/dz well defined. If you write the function as f(x,y)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)f(x,y)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y) then it is analytic if and only if uu and vv satisfy what is called, the Cauchy-Riemann conditions. What this also implies is that if ff is analytic then both uu and vv are harmonic functions. That is — they are solutions to Laplace’s equation in 2D: ∇2u=∇2v=0(1)(1)∇2u=∇2v=0 Furthermore an analytic map w:(x,y)→(u,v)w:(x,y)→(u,v) can be seen as a transformation of coordinates. The other crucial bit is that given a harmonic function Φ(x,y)Φ(x,y), it remains harmonic in the transformed coordinates so that ∇2Φ(u,v)=0∇2Φ(u,v)=0. It should also be noted that again, given an analytic map, the curves defined by u(x,y)=c1u(x,y)=c1 and v(x,y)=c2v(x,y)=c2 are orthogonal at the points where they cross for any constants c1c1 and c2c2.  Now on to electrostatics. Consider the two dimensional problem in electrostatics where you have been given a conducting surface which is maintained at some voltage and you are then asked to find the potential Φ(x,y)Φ(x,y) in the space around that surface. If that space is free of charges, then ΦΦ is harmonic. The conducting surface imposes a restriction on the potential. This restriction takes the form of a boundary condition, meaning Φ(surface)=Φ0Φ(surface)=Φ0. Solving Laplace’s equation is no easy task, but given what we’ve seen about analytic functions, you might recognise that there could be a connection. What if we found a complex function f(z)f(z) whose either real or imaginary part obeyed the boundary condition? Naturally it will also be harmonic, thus our problem would be solved! Baby exampleConsider the case where we have an infinite sheet, meaning our boundary condition is Φ(x,0)=Φ0Φ(x,0)=Φ0. A complex function which satisfies the boundary condition is f(z)=a+bzf(z)=a+bz. You can fit the constants aa and bb to get a function whose real part is the potential we are looking for: f(z)=Φ0+iEzf(z)=Φ0+iEz. Φ(x,y)=Ref=Φ0−Ey.(2)(2)Φ(x,y)=Ref=Φ0−Ey. Note that this approach is not bulletproof. The boundary condition is also satisfied by any polynomial in zz whose free term is Φ0Φ0. It is up to us to check if lines of constant u,vu,v look as we would expect from the configuration. Getting slightly more involvedNow let’s take a look at the edge of an infinite sheet. The boundary condition is now Φ(0,x>0)=Φ0Φ(0,x>0)=Φ0. Using the properties of analytic transformations, we can apply the map w=z2w=z2 to the infinite sheet from the problem above. The infinite sheet gets folded in half resulting in the situation we are currently interested in. Therefore: Φ(r,θ)=Re(Φ0+iEz√)=Φ0−Er√sin(θ2).(3)(3)Φ(r,θ)=Re(Φ0+iEz)=Φ0−Ersin⁡(θ2). If you plot the lines of constant ImfImf you get the electric field lines (in green):  Edge effects in a capacitorThis is where things get interesting. Consider the relationship: z=w+ew.(4)(4)z=w+ew. We are going a bit backwards but let’s expand zz and ww in terms of x,yx,y and u,vu,v: x=u+eucosv,x=u+eucos⁡v, y=v+eusinv.(5)(5)y=v+eusin⁡v. If you demand that the map is invertible (meaning — given a point in space, the potential is well defined) you restrict the range of vv to be [−π,π][−π,π]. Plotting lines of constant uu and vv you get:  Oh hello there, I wonder what you might be! The black surfaces are lines of v=±πv=±π. Playing around with the scaling a little bit, you can get the map with the appropriate units — the distance between the plate is dd and the potential difference between the plates is Φ0Φ0: z=dΦ0w+d2πe2πw/Φ0.(6)(6)z=dΦ0w+d2πe2πw/Φ0. Although you cannot get a nice expression for the potential, you can solve numerically for it. The system of equations (5) is non-linear and a bit tricky to deal with but nothing too problematic. If you decided to solve for the potential here is the plot you should get:  As we can see it matches with the equipotentials we should expect.  So we have seen how complex analysis can help us solve problems in electrostatics. You may also be interested to know that this stuff is also applicable to fluid dynamics. For example the flow around a funny looking air-foil can be translated to the problem of airflow around a cylinder by the use of an analytic map (look up Joukowsky transform for more details). This problem also has an electrostatic twin sibling in the face of the conducting cylinder immersed in a homogeneous electric field, soo — pretty cool stuff.",2021-03-06T12:14:56.990Z,"What are some applications of complex analysis?

He sent telegrams to Kennedy and Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis, receiving a reply from Kennedy. That is a mark of how seriously he was taken as an intellectual. Academic Philosopher: As a boy, Russell became interested in studying the foundations of mathematics. He wanted to know where Euclid’s axioms come from. As an undergraduate he studied mathematics in Cambridge before turning to philosophy. He was one of the first people to recognize the importance of Gottlob Frege’s work, but he also recognized that Frege’s logical system contained a fatal error which Russell tried to fix. Working with Alfred North Whitehead he tried to find a way to complete the task that Frege had set for himself - that of developing an axiomatic system in which it would be possible to prove all truths of arithmetic - but without repeating Frege’s error. Kurt Gödel proved that it is impossible to derive all truths of arithmetic from a single set of axioms, and in so doing, showed that Russell and Whitehead has set themselves an impossible task. But Gödel paid tribute to the importance of Russell’s contribution to mathematical logic; he had recognized Frege’s error, explored possible solution, and Gödel’s own theorems would not have been possible without the work of Russell and Whitehead. Since he was both a mathematician and a philosopher, Russell was able to see how his work in mathematical logic provided philosophers with a useful toolkit. In particular, he realized that the kind of logical analysis that was so important for Frege’s work could be used to show that the surface form of sentences gives a false idea about their logical form. A simple example - which predates Russell - will illustrate the point. Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) has a lot of fun with the idea that “Nobody” is the name of a person. If Nobody is faster than the King’s messenger, doesn’t that mean the King should fire the messenger and hire Nobody instead? To suppose that Nobody is the name of a person (or that Nothing is the name of a thing) is to make a mistake about logical form, a mistake that can lead to all kinds of absurd conclusions. The absurdity of taking “Nobody” to be the name of a person is obvious to a child. Russell was concerned with less obvious errors - he considered, for example, the possibility that “the universe” is not the name of a thing, and that there is no way to talk meaningfully about “everything.” This work continues to be of great interest to philosophers, not because there are many philosophers who think that Russell provided the right answers, but because he drew attention to questions that are still of great interest, and he was one of the inventors of a technique - translating statements into an artificial logical language - that is still used today - albeit with have a wider range of logical languages to choose from. Russell’s student, Wittgenstein, realized that philosophers did not have to proceed piecemeal, translating bits of natural language into an artificial language one at a time. Perhaps, by considering the limits of any possible language, we could discover the limits of thought itself. This idea too has proven to be very fruitful. So the work of Russell, along with that of Frege, Whitehead, Wittgenstein and Gödel, led to the start of a new form of philosophy, analytical philosophy, which continues to be practiced by many academic philosophers today. One can hardly hope to have an informed opinion on whether analytical philosophy is a legitimate approach to philosophical problems or a complete waste of time without having some understanding of the goals and methods of its founders, including Russell. This is why, both in his lifetime and today, many academic philosophers consider it important to have some knowledge of Russell’s hardcore contributions to analytical philosophy. Popular Figure: Russell’s intense work on mathematical logic left him feeling burned out. He turned his attention to dealing with social, political and religious issues, and reaching out to a popular audience. He had a brilliant wit and was capable of writing in a way that would catch the attention of the general public. He argued in favour of pacifism and against the existence of God and established sexual mores. In 1940, he was hired to be a Professor by the City College of New York. Prompted by Thomas Manning, Episcopalian Bishop, a group of concerned citizens campaigned against this appointment. As a result, Russell didn’t get the job, but the controversy helped to generate the system of academic tenure that we know and love in the USA today. For professional philosophers and mathematicians, it was outrageous that Bertrand Russell, one of Cambridge’s leading intellectual figures, co-author of the Principia Mathematica, should be treated in such a fashion. This is why the case became a cause celebre, and it helps to explain Russell’s fame with the general public in the USA. Consequently, he was hired by the Barnes Foundation to teach classes on the history of western philosophy to a general audience. He soon returned to Cambridge, but as a result of those lectures he published his History of Western Philosophy, probably his best known work as far as the general public is concerned. I think it is admirable that, having lost one job, Russell landed on his feet and turned his hand to teaching the history of philosophy, trying to cram in as much study of the history of philosophy as he could in a short time. He wasn’t an expert on the history of philosophy by any means, he was an expert on philosophical logic, but he produced an entertaining guide, and it is interesting to read what one great philosopher has to say about his predecessors. From an academic perspective, the book is the equivalent of Michael Jordan becoming a professional baseball player. I certainly don’t regard it as his most important work, but it did make a lot of money for Russell, and introduced many readers to the history of western philosophy. Cuban Missile Crisis In 1962, the world came very close to a nuclear war as Kennedy faced off with Khrushchev. Russell had long been an advocate of peace and a campaigner against atomic weapons. He sent telegrams to newspapers, U Thant (Secretary General of the UN), Kennedy and Khrushchev. He rebuked Kennedy as a warmonger, and begged Khrushchev to act in the interests of peace. He received replies from both Kennedy and Khrushchev, and some people think that Russell deserves some credit for averting nuclear catastrophe. (Of course, nobody who studies the crisis can overlook the role of Vasily Arkhipov, who prevented Russian submarines from firing). Others, I know would see this as a gross exaggeration. (For more information see here: Russell and the Cuban Missile Crisis) Still this ranks as a striking example of an academic philosopher making his intellectual presence felt on the world stage. Such was Russell’s reputation that, whatever their impact may have been, his telegrams to Kennedy and Khrushchev were certainly not ignored. So, I guess there was something special about Bertrand Russell. TLDR: Russell managed to be one of the foremost philosophers of his generation, respected by his fellow academics, and a celebrity whose ideas about politics and religion reached a wide audience. He sent telegrams to Kennedy and Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis, receiving a reply from Kennedy. That is a mark of how seriously he was taken as an intellectual.

In the event that you need to pick up a following and rank your recordings higher in YouTube seek, transferring new substance is critical. Clients love new recordings! What's more, that crisp, recently transferred substance (just as the most recent moves made by the clients) is mulled over by YouTube when positioning recordings. ""Watch time"" is an imperative positioning element also. YouTube needs to surface recordings that watchers will discover agreeable, so high client commitment is an extraordinary flag for the calculation in distinguishing such recordings. Notwithstanding client signals, YouTube additionally depends on contribution from the video proprietor to nourish their calculation. That implies YouTube is relying on you to reveal to it what your video is about. What you do to upgrade your video in the initial 48 to 72 hours is basic to the accomplishment of your video and how it positions. In the event that you hit the nail on the head, your video could shoot to the best when individuals look for your video point. Fail to understand the situation, and you'll sink like a stone. Metadata is imperative As indicated by YouTube, metadata incorporates data about a video, for example, the title, depiction, labels and comments. Metadata can enable your video to emerge and get found by the calculation, so content makers should try to advance metadata to augment perceivability. Here are a few hints for making powerful metadata that can enable your recordings to get found. Presently, this first tip may sound unreasonable, yet you need to examine what sorts of recordings your rivals are doing before you make your video. The truth is out — the best time to improve your video for SEO and get more perspectives is before you even record it. When you have a vibe for what your rivals are doing — the kind of recordings they're delivering, how captivating they are, what number of perspectives they have, what metadata they're utilizing, etc — it'll make it simpler for you to make a video that ""one-ups"" them, both as far as having better substance and being better advanced for YouTube's calculation. After you've made your video, it's an ideal opportunity to consider transferring and upgrading. Once more, the best time to advance your metadata is before you transfer your video — have your watchwords, labels, title, depiction and custom thumbnail prepared to go before you press the transfer catch. YouTube labels: Doing the watchword look into While doing catchphrase explore on YouTube, you need to endeavor to discover watchwords that will direct people to your video. The best spot to search for catchphrases is on YouTube, yet you ought to likewise utilize progressively customary watchword explore apparatuses (like Google Search Console, SEMrush, SEOProfiler, Moz or others.) YouTube enables you to incorporate ""labels"" to help sort your video by watchword, however it restrains the quantity of labels you can incorporate. You'll need to search for multiword labels (i.e., long-tail catchphrases) that explicitly identify with your video's subject. You ought to likewise utilize single-word labels and expansive term labels that identify with your video's more extensive subject. (Note: Do not utilize trademarks or copyrighted material in your metadata except if you have express authorization from the proprietor to utilize it.) YouTube is powerful at semantically understanding your labels. So here's a case of certain labels for a video about ""how to ask a kid out on the town"": Different word labels Step by step instructions to ask a kid out on the town What to state when you ask a kid out on the town The most effective method to ask a kid you like out on the town Asking out a kid you like Single-word labels: How What Inquire Kid You Like Date Wide term labels: Dating Dates Being a tease Meet young men Meeting young men Converse with young men One incredible approach to get label thoughts is to take a gander at the best positioning YouTube recordings that straightforwardly rival your video.

Fortunately, there are apparatuses that enable you to get heaps of experiences into what your rivals are doing — including giving you a chance to see the labels contenders are utilizing to get their recordings to rank high.

How YouTube apparatuses like vidIQ and TubeBuddy can enable you to get more eyeballs Both vidIQ and TubeBuddy give you data on contenders' YouTube recordings. One of the cool things they show is the labels.

In the event that you have room, additionally incorporate the single-word labels and more extensive term labels. You need to attempt to get the same number of perspectives from the same number of various (pertinent) indexed lists as could reasonably be expected — which is a less demanding system than endeavoring to rank #1 for a solitary watchword state. By having a metadata methodology set up, you can expand the odds of your recordings appearing in YouTube's indexed lists.

This question pops up time and again because people look for ways to avoid having to  study the ""grammar"" part of the language. The direct method and communicative approaches have a great appeal because people think that learning while talking means ""not learning grammar"". However, the presence of the L1 is the inescapable difference in L2 learning (Cook, 2008). It's not really a question of whether you can avoid it, but how. The catch with inductive methods is that the less you understand, the more you have to turn to your verbal analytical abilities, which are skills that vary from person to person.

If you are a hobbyist with a data set in hand, jump right in and get your hands dirty with data exploration to understand the data, and specify very precisely what you want to predict.  In a commercial environment, there is a lot of context that wraps around a predictive project. I'll try to illustrate with a small example from a recent proof of concept predictive analytics project. 1) Problem definition and translation: Talk to stakeholders, find out how they operate - especially what decisions they make and what information would be useful in that decision. At the back of your mind look for how those decisions can be improved by a prediction. E.g. Ben wants to set prices for a product, and would benefit from knowing what his competitor Tom will set for a competing product.  2) Find a stakeholder who can consume your output and sponsor the project: There is no worthwhile predictive analytics project without someone actually understanding and using the output of your model. 3) Grab a data set and see how much data prep needs to be done: Unlike Kaggle, in real life you define your own data set. Building a model takes up a relatively short amount of time compared with all the wrestling with the data to get it in a format suitable for your model to ingest. The 'data set' will likely be a few data sets which you need to stitch together yourself, or get someone in IT to run a few queries for you. It is probably not a question of SQL skill - it is likely because processes need to be followed or you won't get your data. You are now free to scope your project. 4) From then on, now you can Kaggle: Model to your hearts content, do feature selection, score your results, evaluate your model etc. This has been covered in great detail elsewhere so I won't elaborate here. For further reading, you can google data mining methodologies. A few popular ones are CRISP-DM or SEMMA.

There are three main reasons behind it; Saturation: When MBA was in demand there were huge number of colleges established with MBA faculty. Many independent institutions set only for MBA. Almost every college started the MBA faculty and add to that many of them started BBA. With that due to autonomous status many of them started very niche courses in management. These courses were with the glamour in a name but when students came out with the degrees there were nothing very different they were doing. In short there were huge gap between expectation and ground reality. Due to this over the 5–10 Years after 2000 there were tremendous MBA guys were in the field.

A sales representative who was graduate of any stream, has some duties through out the day and month like closing, targets, promotion etc. The same things were doing by an MBA with sales and marketing specialization. Here the way of working was different as MBA guy has some other technique whereas other guys have some other. Finally they were doing the same job. When looking at this, few people thought and took it in a different way. I personally know many of them. So it matters. As per the grade of the institutions people got placements but again there were many differences. Due to this people started loosing the interest in doing MBA. Transition In many organizations mainly IT, ITes, KPO etc, their staff from technical fields started changing the shift to non technical and that is into management sector.

People use the word just to call INTJs criminal masterminds, when the truth is anyone could be a bad person regardless of MBTI. INTJs have a tendency to be highly intellectual and intuitive people (introverted intuiton) who could thrive in any technical system. INTJs can be too independent in their work, sometimes to the point where they won't ask for help even if they truly need assistance. INTJs are often viewed as arrogant people and this can be found within their demeanor. An immature INTJ can use their vigorous intellect to tear others to shreds with blunt and intimidating words. INTJs have been known to view almost everyone they come across as intellectually inferior than they are. Their extroverted thinking makes them honest and direct with other people because they value efficiency. Their tertiary introverted feeling is a function they don't show to the world because they want to be seen as logical, not emotional. The reality is that they have a huge depth of emotions and feelings underneath their hard-core and stoic external appearance. They are quite emotional and sensitive on the inside, which is on of the reasons why they become defensive if someone dares to question their logic. When INTJs are stressed out they fall into they grip of their Extraverted sensing. They may have sesnory overindulges or impulses that they spontaneously act upon. At this point, they begin to resemble an unhealthy ESFP turning more artisian and bold. INTJs also struggle with socializing which is why they seem so awkward and unfriendly in social settings. INTJs have strong tendencies to be narcissistic, advoidant of others, and depressive. People are afraid of INTJs because they are super-brainy and naturally ingenious. INTJs are just as capable of using their sheer brain power for being an overload as they could be a world class activist. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T12:24:26.448Z,"What is the INTJ dark side like?

I think AI in CRM is one of those things that many people are counting on to change the industry in a couple of years—and for good reasons. too. The two core functions of AI, which are automation and machine learning, hold a lot of promise for improving CRM use in the future. With automation, maintaining the quality of data in CRM would be much easier and CRM adoption by the workforce would be smoother. Machine learning, meanwhile, will help CRM users understand unstructured data accumulated in the CRM through tools like NLP. It’s no surprise then that many CRM providers are adopting AI technologies to improve their service and differentiate their CRM from the rest of the competition. Some of the CRM companies going in that direction are: Salesforce - This CRM powerhouse is leading the pack with Salesforce Einstein. Einstein is available for various SF solutions, from Cloud Services to Finance, Marketing, etc. This AI platform does predictive analytics, predictive lead scoring, and data capture of customer interactions.SugarCRM - Sugar is busy perfecting a new intelligence platform and a virtual assistant called Candace. These innovations will eliminate the need for manual modification of contact data in the CRM and will also allow Sugar to aid users by recommending follow-up actions based on insights generated via NLP.Zendesk - Predictive capabilities are the focus of the AI integration in Zendesk. One thing this can do is the prediction of good or bad satisfaction ratings with customer support based on a host of factors that might affect the outcome of the interaction.Dynamics 365 - Cortana is Microsoft’s virtual assistant and this intelligent creation is capable of sentiment analysis, translation, and keyword identification. Microsoft has also built the Azure Machine Learning Studio to enable organizations to create data-based predictive models.Transitioning to the AI future requires companies to have a strong data management system that will feed the AI with accurate, up-to-date data.

Below are the common problems of online teachers: 1. Psychological barrier: Everyone is so well-tuned with the classroom style of education that this change creates a lot of psychological challenges for students and teachers. We have to unlearn the old style of education and get in tune with online teaching. Due to online class (without live streaming), there is a sense of disconnection between student and teacher. The very first psychological barrier that both teacher and student has to overcome is this sense of disconnectedness. This can be done from the teacher’s side by being a more enthusiastic, engaging, friendly, and conversational style of teaching, rather than having a one way delivery of knowledge. 2. Technological barriers: For online teaching, we need suitable online software. Even there are many online applications that are available for online teaching but low computer literacy rate among non-IT or Science teachers/students is the biggest hurdle. Due to this teacher,’s/students would not be able to use many applications available in the market, since they require a sound knowledge of the application. Therefore teachers, instructors, and students prefer PowerPoint, word, and video have become a popular medium. But there is a significant lack of human touch or interpersonal-interaction missing in this medium of education. To reduce these technological barriers many companies in the industry are trying their best to create something that could make online learning interactive. The very first step is by making these applications easy to use for both content/course creator and easy to access by learners. Tools like cahoots and Raptivity helps teachers to make content interactive and easy to use. These tools have ready-made templates in which the creator could bring in the media files like audio, video, images, and text by a single click. The next steps include save and publish. voila! The interactive content is ready to use. Online meeting applications, Video recorder, Video editors (like Animoto, wevideo, kinemaster, and Exaltive) can accentuate in interactive learning. 3. Resource crunch: The main problem with online learning is resources. Many underprivileged students do not have a laptop/desktop, proper internet connection to opt for online learning. In India, many organizations like Pratham Infotech Foundation, Hole-in-the-Wall education limited by NIIT limited, are still trying to increase the reach of computer literacy. The middle class and lower middle class may also face the same issue as the underprivileged due to the non-availability of fast internet connection at their homes. The students from small towns and rural India can’t think of online classes due to resource crunch and no internet services. But thanks to Jio and the “Digital India program” initiated by the Modi Government of India, we may see students/teachers from small towns and rural India, will be joining online learning. 4. Honour system: Except online meeting tool or live video streaming and test-based assessment interactive templates (like in Kahoot and Raptivity win coordination with LMS), every other system is an honor system. A teacher will face difficulty to know if every student has acquired the knowledge or the student is properly getting the knowledge. Giving assessment to the students and then collecting their results via email can be the best solution for those teachers who do not have LMS. This will ensure students are paying attention in the class. But still, even this system remains an Honour system as the student has complete assignments honestly. 5. Disruption due to student and their surrounding interference: The teacher should select a place where there is a minimum disturbance. The teacher often sees disruption during the online live classes by surrounding noise from the student’s side. It is always advised to students to attend the online class from silent places. But still, the disturbance is very common while taking an online class with a large group of students. This issue manifolds especially if we are taking online classes for a very large group of people.to avoid such a scenario, teacher should ask all students to sit at silent places and keep themselves on mute. 6. Technical disruptions: Often there is disruption occurs due to some technical issues like application malfunction, slow internet, or no internet, disruption in infrastructure due to adverse climate, power cuts, etc. But online learning can be easily delivered in an engaging manner by out of the box thinking, interactive applications(like Cahoot, Raptivity, live streaming) by enthusiastic teachers/trainers.

Islam, which talks of nothing else but the sword, still enforces upon people the same destructive spirit in which it was founded.”Alexis de Tocqueville - 19th-century French philosopher: “I have carefully studied the Koran. I ended the study with the conviction that there are few religions in the world as deadly as that of Muhammad.”Arthur Schopenhauer - 19th-century German philosopher: “Consider the Koran, for example this wretched book was sufficient to start a world-religion, to satisfy the metaphysical need of countless millions for twelve hundred years, to become the basis of their morality and of a remarkable contempt for death, and also to inspire them to bloody wars and the most extensive conquests. […] Much may be lost in translation, but I have not been able to discover in it one single idea of value.”Bertrand Russell - 20th-century British philosopher: “Mohammedanism and Bolshevism are practical, social, unspiritual, concerned to win the empire of this world. Their founders would not have resisted the third of the temptations in the wilderness. What Mohammedanism did for the Arabs, Bolshevism may do for the Russians.”Carl Jung - 20th-century Swiss psychiatrist and founder of analytical psychiatry: “We do not know whether Hitler is going to found a new Islam.

Write down in abbreviated form what you can't memorize well, such as numbers, date, etc. At this stage, learn to balance between note taking and the first stage.3. Start to interpret completely new stuff, listen to your output afterwards and correct your mistakes. When interpreting for clients, the interpreter should constantly think:* what is he talking about* how should I deliver it in the foreign language* did my listeners understand me(which starts with can I understand myself-I bet a lot of times you just blurt out stuff, YOU don't even know what you're talking about) ABOVE ALL, THINK.

Curiosity I think is best described as seeking what is beyond.  In my eyes, over the past two centuries, there are relatively few philosophers who exhibit curiosity as well as others. I have in mind the rise of analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is much less concerned about solving the 'big problems' of existence: sex, love, and death. Many academic philosophers today obsess over logical analysis to the point of abdicating a responsibility to form refined questions about sex, love, and death.  Some who I think do have a high level of curiosity over the past two centuries: Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and Nietzsche.

Some are Thinkers (ST) and enjoy putting this information together in simple, clear ways – like baking. Others are Feelers (SF), denying logic in favor of emotions and feelings.    Divergent Intuitives Fewer people think with divergent logic, meaning they find connections and patterns in all things. They ask questions and find answers. They are individual and constantly curious. They are INtuitives (N): Those who think deeply and analytically. You can spot INtuitives by observing those who talk, dress, and think individually and authentically. Even fewer are Thinkers (NT) who enjoy objectivity - playing ‘devil’s advocate’ in order to understand all perspectives. They put logic before emotion, knowing emotion is irrational. Others are Feelers (NF) and enjoy focusing on human connection.   Humanity evolved using hierarchies – a natural placement of any group of people for a well-functioning society. The top of the pyramid is ruled by INtuitives (INFJ, ENTJ, INTJ, ENFJ, INTP). These will be the innovators and leaders, making up only 14.4 percent of the population. The bottom of the pyramid is dominated by Sensors (ISFJ, ESFJ, ISTJ, ISFP, ESFP, ESTJ, ESFP), making up 63 percent of the population. These are humanity’s worker bees, and there are a lot of them as they currently serve real purpose. They are the majority. The world’s religions and philosophers have advised knowing thyself, to seek and find, to look within. You know by learning. You learn by asking questions. Most people don’t ask questions. Most people are not Ideal. Does society really require Sensors to serve as simple workers? Many neuroscientists and psychologists believe our personality is biologically wired from birth, unchangeable, as if to serve some evolutionary purpose. However, studies now show that environment is truly stronger than nature. What would a society of INtuitives look like? What if everyone asked questions and searched for answers? What if everyone broke from the herd? Marketing advertisements and materialism would cease as we know it. Pop-culture would plummet. Pollution would decrease. Football would fall from on-high. People would live healthier lives, knowing and respecting this importance. Relationships would deepen and wars would end. The family unit would be balanced and children would be raised valuing truth and logic. It would be a very different world indeed. An Ideal world. EDIT To those who think I am claiming that Sensors are inferior: I’m not. My argument, based off this theory, is that being a Sensor is largely a result of environmental causes with serious negative implications. I really do know that Sensors are good people. I married one and love him to death. But, thats not the argument. My *question* (remember, Devil's Advocate) is if Intuition really is a “sacred gift”, ignored by society, that can be learned. As I mentioned to another upset commenter, I am hoping someone can use logic to disprove this observation. Instead, I only get harrassment or am told I'm wrong without reason, which, unfortunately, only further proves the theory.

It took me a while to learn how to use the various resources available, but as I did the richness of the Scripture became more and more apparent. There are some best books to study bible which are as follows  1. Genesis  Although I fell asleep reading Genesis as a teen, I now marvel at how it sets the foundation for understanding who God is and how He relates to man: “God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” This book tells us dramatic stories: Abraham and Sarah having a child in their old age, the miraculous provision of a wife for Isaac, and Jacob’s two wives battling for his favor. We read about Jacob’s jealous sons selling their brother Joseph, their father’s favorite, into slavery, and how God ironically used Joseph to save them from famine later.  2. John John helps us get to know Jesus better. Many of us love this book for its beautiful, inspiring language and for the picture it paints of Jesus and the relationship we can have with Him. We find hope and inspiration from Jesus’ “I am” statements: “I am the Bread of Life” (John 6:35), “I am the Light of the World” (John 8:12), “I am the Good Shepherd” (John 10:11), “I am the Resurrection and the Life” (John 11:25), and “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life” (John 14:6).More mystical and philosophical than the other three gospels, John gives the most convincing argument in favor of the supernatural identity of Jesus as the Son of God. John alone calls Jesus the Word of God: “The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us”   3. Romans  One of my favorite memories is studying Romans with local brothers and sisters in our home in the Middle East over a period of six months. I’d never really understood it before, but as we discussed its deep theological truths week after week, I gained a new appreciation and understanding. Masterfully written by the apostle Paul, Romans presents a convincing argument of why we need a Savior. We often quote verses from Romans to share the gospel: “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). 4. Psalms If you want a simple handbook on prayer, turn to the Psalms. They teach us how to relate to God in all circumstances. They express lament, praise, joy, and despair. We can find Psalms that meet our need to grieve, confess sin, ask God for guidance, or express joy and thanks.  5. Ephesians During a low point in my life, I memorized the opening verses of this book to remind myself of the many reasons I had to be grateful. Paul’s letter to the Ephesians begins with an inspiring description of the blessings and grace that are ours in Christ, and I always return to it when I need reassurance. Ephesians reminds us we are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. It contains a powerful reminder of our identity and purpose: “For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10).  6. Proverbs If you need wisdom or just a general “How-to-Do-Life” manual, read Proverbs. Solomon’s book of short, pithy statements gives us timeless truth for effective living. This is why many of our grandparents grew up hearing Proverbs read at the breakfast table. The opening chapters of the book explain the importance of wisdom for living, and describe both the benefits of wisdom and how to attain it. The most important message of the book is this: the foundation of all wisdom is to honor and obey God. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but fools despise wisdom and discipline” (Proverbs 1:7).",2021-03-06T12:35:08.663Z,"What is a good book to help study the bible?

(As an aside, I believe the impartiality is responsible for the enduring success of Anglophone cultures in forging alliances: fewer possibilities for nasty undertones means less interpersonal friction.) Russian has sneaky ways to express attitude to the subject just by adding a suffix. Words человечек, человек, and wrong-sounding but still recognisable человечище all mean person in English, but one means tiny and cute, another neutral, and third something enormous and awe-inspiring. The translations tend to either dismiss these or clumsily add adjectives, but neither conveys exactly the same meaning. Some other European languages also have diminutives, but the range is smaller. But that is nothing compared to the arsenal of Russian particles, expressing mood and attitude of the speaker. There is never a one-to-one way to translate a Russian particle to a European language. Take a look at the Wiktionary page for же: there are no two sentences that use the same word to translate this particle. And then there is the peculiarity of Russian obscenities. Of course, there is the usual genitalia-inspired stuff, but what makes Russian fairly unique is the existence of obscene synonyms to neutral and common words and phrases like “why”, “so what”.

Just a different code of expresson than in Europe.Americans tend to be quite arrogant, often repeating that they have the best country in the world, most freedom, etc.American culture is really too money-oriented. Almost everything is about money, that’s how you measure people’s success, often only by that. Financial success drives people much more than in Europe.While Americans have a lot of amazing artists, musicians, writers, etc, they also have a lot of shitty pop-culture, which they export to the whole world. If there’s a buyer, there will be a seller, I know…A lot of Americans are pretty anti-intellectual. Knowledge seems to not be respected or desired by many, if it can’t be turned directly into money.American gun laws are bizzarre and the crime rates are quite shocking to us. Europe is much safer. There is quite a lot of aggression in the American society and it seems to be more popular and appreciated to be somewhat aggressive.America is really divided racially. It’s changing, I guess, but a lot of people in the US still think in terms of race. You can see it clearly by how Americans vote - the different races vote quite distinctly, which means that somehow they perceive their interests differently.America has a really harsh legal system with very high sentences, a private jail industry, the death penalty which together with some quite puritan laws makes for quite a creepy combination to many Europeans.The obesity!

The official definition of big data is “extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions.” But the part that I really want to key in on is the role that data brings to us as marketers! It shows us those trends and or patterns based around how we market and even how we engage on social media. Bottom line, data gives us much needed information that helps us to make better decisions in our businesses. Why do we need to understand data and how to use it? I thought perhaps the best way to showcase the importance of data is simply to share my own experience with you. I have been blessed to be named by Forbes as one of the Top 10 Social Media Power Influencers and am considered one of the world’s leading social selling pros. I have spent the last 5 years building not just a large, but a highly engaged digital community. I have 125,000+ fans on Facebook and my posts reach an average of almost 10 million people per week. I have had 6.54 million “tweet impressions” on Twitter over the last 28 days, had my profile visited 62,000 times and had my community grows by over 14,000 people during that time period to 338,000+ followers overall.  Altogether, across all my social media sites, website and blog, I generate north of 500 million impressions a year. THAT is pretty big data! It is all right there, telling me a story! What do people want from me? What will they buy? Does traffic matter? Where are my community members most active? What are the demographics of the people who follow me? The questions go on and on! So to get back to the point…why is big data important? 1. Big data can answer high-level questions about your digital community Let’s take a look at a few specific questions… Is all traffic the same on social media? There are two ways to get traffic on social media, you can buy it with paid advertising or you can acquire it for free by building out your social media sites and working for it. By “working” I mean developing a content strategy and engaging with your community members. Traffic is one thing, but conversions are another. I did not know if being big on social media was important, but I bet I could find it by listening to the data. What does the data say in reference to this? First, we know this. Buying traffic on social media can be a huge expense. If you wanted to use Facebook advertising to reach the same number of people I reach on the site for free every week you would pay in the neighborhood of $50,000, or $2.6 MILLION per year.  Twitter is a little cheaper, but still no bargain. To reach the same 6.54 million people I reach for free each month would cost you a little over $27,000. Taking Facebook and Twitter together, let’s just call it an even $3 million a year to make 400 million or so impressions. That works out to around $1 for every 133 impressions. Still, you have no guarantee of selling anything. Question #2…Does Paid Traffic Convert Better? Let’s have the data answer the question! Here is one test…ONE! I paid $100 to Twitter to show the following ad to just over 21,000 people.  I paid $0 and tweeted the same exact e-book to my followers.  Sure, it had 1/6 th the number of impressions, but almost one-half the number of engagements…for FREE! This is just ONE data point that led me to a conclusion. Now, what if I had MILLIONS of data points that could give me the answer? That answer would be a lot more credible, right? 2. Big data can answer very specific questions about my business practices How do you do this? My first piece of advice is to use big data to tell the story. Sometimes you can do it yourself and sometimes you need to bring in a pro, like the folks over at TeraData. The bigger the data and the more important the questions that need to be answered, the more likely you are going to need some help. 3. Numbers do not lie They simply tell the story. Big data analysis is a science that extracts the solutions from the numbers. Business solutions are a big deal, and that is why big data is a big deal!
