Let’s have a look! 1. Integration of the Devnagri “Ra” and Roman “R”: The design of Rupee symbol seamlessly integrates the traditional script rooted in Indian culture, as well as the Latin script which is used in a common parlance. This amalgamation traverses boundaries across cultures giving it a universal identity, at the same time symbolizing our cultural values and ethos at a global platform.  2.

This amalgamation traverses boundaries across cultures giving it a universal identity, at the same time symbolizing our cultural values and ethos at a global platform.  2. Shrio Rekha: The use of Shiro Rekha (the horizontal top line) in Devanagari script is unique to India. Devanagari script is the only script where letters hang from the top line and does not sit on a baseline. The symbol preserves this unique and essential feature of our Indian script which is not seen in any other scripts in the world. It also clearly distinguishes itself from other symbols and establishes a sign of Indian origin.  3. Tricolor: The two horizontal lines with an equal negative white space (imaginary space) between them create a foreground and background effect of three strips (tricolor). The strips subtly represent the tricolor of our Indian national flag flying at the top.  4. Equality Sign: The horizontal lines also denote the arithmetic sign ‘equal to’. For a common man, a quick indicator of his/her countries economy is the comparison of currency values. In other words, a countries economy is defined with respect to the currency value. The equality sign also signifies a balanced economy, our economy should be secured and stable forever.  5. Simple Form: The symbol is designed with minimal of three strokes. The simple and clean form gives it a high recall value and strengthens its legibility. It also makes it very easy to write, construct, reproduce and design.  6. For the residual part, its still quite possible that I might have missed a few more points. But that’s that.

The first and most important feature of an effective logo design is that it should be eye-catching so that it can easily grab the viewers’ attention. However, many organizations are not able to do it and ended up making funny logo designs. Here is the list of the worst 10 among them. 1. NYC Taxi:  New York City is considered as a hub for people from all around the people and taxi is the best mode of transportation for them. But look how miserably the government fails to design its logo. 2. Pepsi:  At first it might look like a joke to you when you see the logo of Pepsi, but things become funnier when you look at the Pepsi max logo. 3. A-Style:  A-Style is a clothing company which was started in the year 1999 in Italy. It begun with a very funny logo that very soon newspaper and television start trolling with strange and funny appearances. 4. London Olympics:  It was designed by Wolff Olins at an expenditure of 8 million dollars. However, despite spending too much money, it failed miserably. 5. Mon-Sat Antenna:  This is the most funniest logo found by us. We were confused that what exactly the marketer was trying to do with the antenna. 6. Lenovo:  After seeing the logo the only word that came out is boring. I mean seriously the company would have spent a hefty amount of money to design its logo, and what did they design. 7. Paytm:  Don’t know what to say about this logo as it has been already trolled by many. Thank god it has changed its logo before turning into a brand. 8. Uber:  Most of the peeps found the new logo of Uber disgusting and meaningless. Some have even tweeted that the company spent huge amount of money just to rotate the logo of the State Bank of India by 90 degree and replaced the inner circle with a square. 9. Bureau of Health Promotion:  This is from the country Taiwan. It’s the logo of country’s health department. Still confused, why the govt put a snake shaped person in it? 10. Safe Home:  Last but not least, safe home has managed to win this battle of worst logo designs. With the name, you all would expect something that represents safety, but in reality the logo looks like it is promoting kidnapping. So, which one did you find the funniest? Did we miss anything more funnier?

You could go on Facebook, Pinterest or Instagram and search for the logos you like. Find and choose designer or studio whose designs have high quality and which you personally like. Freelance platforms. Some of the popular platforms: Upwork Freelancer Fiverr 99designs Peopleperhour A few words about Fiverr: as you know, their prices starts at 5$. But don't get it wrong: it's almost impossible to get a really good logo with vector files for this amount (I say ""almost impossible"", because nothing is impossible in this world, in my opinion). Many people may think that there are no good designers on Fiverr because of its cheap prices. And I think they are wrong - there are really awesome works and designers there, but the price for logos they create is 30-100$ on average. 5$ is just a marketing course, the Fiverr's feature. And Fiverr it's not the chiepest one - there is 199jobs.com ;- ) Strategy remains the same: simply look for the works you like with professional signs. By ""high quality"" and ""professional signs"" I mean things like: a) logo should be ""Einsteined"" (i.e. ""as simple as possible, but not simpler""); b) it's desirable that the logo looked good in only two colours (for example, black-white). There are a lot of situations when your logo has to be placed or printed that way and if it's bound to the colors, it may cause some problems; c) created by using negative space when it's possible; d) logo should looks good and be readable both in small and big sizes. It's undesirable when some important part(s) of the logo are lost by reducing its size. A few of great examples: McDonalds, Nike, Hewlett-Packard. However, of course there are situations when it's not possible to achieve because of the company/logo's requirements. e) the logo should easily deliver the main idea/history of the company or project. If you can get the meaning in a second without even reading its text (in case of text+icon type of logo) - it's just great. Most of the good designers or services offer money-back guarantee, therefore there is no much risk for customer apart from the time spent. My advice also is, when you found a designer/studio whose works you like, spend a few minutes to check their uniqueness via Google Image Search. Unfortunately, some designers just copy other ideas/designs in a very inappropriate way. So, it's always better to make sure you're going to deal with a right one. You can also check our works on AHA! Logo. We provide high quality services at reasonable prices with money-back guarantee.

The world of icons is the most prominent amongst these, with the alterations being evident over time. Companies were seen shifting to 3D designs, years back, when the wave of glossy, shadowy logos hit the brand world. The Volkswagen logo took a swing from a flat logo design to a 3D logo design in 2000 while obliging with the trends of the market. Later, the 3D design trend died out while bringing in the age of flat designs that have been ruling the design world since the past few years. Companies have re-branded their logos to flat, minimal designs making them appear more clean and simple. Why are companies changing their logos to flat designs? Three dimensional designs, as we know, are created in such a way that they have a live 3D effect to it. Flat logo designs on the other hand, as its name suggests, are the designs that are flat in nature with no gradients, shadows, or texture. These designs are simple and minimal with no three dimensional effects added to the design.  FLAT DESIGN VS THREE DIMENSIONAL DESIGN  FLAT DESIGN VS THREE DIMENSIONAL DESIGN There are a lot of reasons for which companies have shifted from 3D logo designs to flat ones, a few of which are as below: • BRANDS/COMPANIES ARE TREND FOLLOWERS A very obvious reason to the shift is the fact that the market is doing so. Companies and brands wish to appear updated and fresh and hence, the change is vital to be made. If not given due attention, in this regard, the brand would be whipped out from the market.  • FLAT DESIGNS ARE MINIMAL Brands are not making the change only for the sake of following the recent trends; rather there is more of a technical reason to it. Flat designs are simpler and minimal, making them appear as distinct on flashy banners and showy ads. Since, the design industry is trapped in a clutter where the ads and banners need to be loud for the sake of leaving a mark; there is a dire chance of the brand’s logo to be lost in the glitter. Hence, in order to prevent this from happening, the logo designs have shifted towards minimalism; for the sake of ensuring maximum focus.  • FLAT DESIGNS ARE EASY TO USE ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS Another reason for the shift to flat design is the fact that 3D company logos have a lot of gradients, shadows, and gloss making them almost impossible to match with the different platforms, on which they have to be placed, without alterations. On the other hand, flat designs are simple yet colorful which allows them to look good on all platforms with no or less alteration required. • FLAT DESIGNS ARE BATTERY SAVERS Also, since, the flat designs encompass lesser colors and details; they are good at saving battery. The space saved hence, can be utilized for the showcase of relevant and more attractive items. • FLAT DESIGNS ARE EASY TO DESIGN Finally, in this world of ease and comfort, designers too wish for a task that gives them room for relaxation. Hence, designs that are high in quality and low in efforts are the most cherished ones. Flat designs, precisely accommodate these features while being easy to make and attractive enough to steal the show. The Final VerdictThese were a few reasons pointing towards the shift of designs from 3D to flat. The design world, however; is not steady and the trends are expected to change sooner or later. Brands can enjoy flat designs till a new wave hits the shore while bringing with it a trend that would call for change.",2021-03-06T13:42:39.876Z,"Why are so many companies changing their logos to flat designs?

If you can't make it work in one color, it's a crappy logo. Then invert the colors (black/white > white/black) and see how it looks in reverse.  2) Use vectors.

If you can't make it work in one color, it's a crappy logo. Then invert the colors (black/white > white/black) and see how it looks in reverse.  2) Use vectors. A logo could theoretically be small enough to fit on a pen, or large enough to fill the side of a hot air balloon. Make sure your document will scale without getting blurry or pixelated! 3) Design for different sizes. A logo should look good when it is tiny and when it is big. Small spaces and fine lines between shapes can disappear at small sizes, for example. For some logos you may need a few different versions so it looks good in all sizes, but ideally one logo should work universally. 4) Simplicity wins, usually. Companies like Apple & Nike are great examples of how versatile and beautiful simple shapes can be. If a logo is complicated, it must be extremely unique and well-crafted, like Coca-Cola. Go for simple until you're very experienced.  5) Imagine it in other contexts. Does the logo work when it is frosted into glass? Can it be a lapel pin? A tattoo? 3D lettering on a sign? On the side of a car or airplane? Bad logos often fail these tests, and good logos always pass. 6) Make it work without the concept. Many great logos are a visual play-on-words about the company name, or they are based on an advanced concept that runs through the branding. Make sure the logo is nice even when people don't understand that concept; many designers fall in love with the idea and protect shitty logos so the idea survives. 7) Think about negative space! Sometimes the emptiness is the best part of a clever logo. Look at the space between letters, shapes, etc. And remember that the colors might be reversed! 8) Learn typography basics. You don't have to be a type genius to make nice logos, but knowing the basics will ensure that you make smart type choices. Some of the best logos are only text (a ""wordmark"")! That being said, being a type genius is a hell of a plus. ;) 9) Experiment. You never know until you try. All designers say that ""happy accidents"" play a role in their greatest designs. Many of the logos I have designed have gone through hundreds of tiny tweaks on the way to being ""good enough"". Try the ideas you don't think are good too; you might surprise yourself. 10) Look at logos every day. You should make a habit of seeing as many logos as you can, as often as you can. Dribbble, Pinterest, Behance, LogoPond, whatever. You should see thousands of logos per year, and then your brain will have a lot to work with when you sit down to come up with your own.

Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign are easily the most widely used of the available software, however, what the general public might not understand is that each of these design programs is uniquely specialized for a niche set of tasks. In short, not all programs are created equal. Illustrator Vs Photoshop Vs InDesign Sure, while one program may be able to loosely achieve the feats of the others, there are inherent strengths and weaknesses within these software programs that cause for one to be a more appropriate tool than the other, for any given task. It’s really a matter of evaluating the breadth of your project and your desired design deliverables, and then identifying the best tool for the job. Specifically referring to logo design, it’s extremely common for clients to request that designers use Adobe Photoshop for the project, so that they may be able to edit the logo themselves in the future. While this makes sense in the fact that Photoshop is a more accessible and user-friendly program, thus preferred by novice designers, it simply isn’t the appropriate tool for professional logo design. The question then becomes why not? Though the answer may not be simple, it is distinct. With that, we’ve decided to elaborate on the debate; discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the three design programs, their limitations and most importantly, the major differences between them that ultimately determines their correct uses. Adobe Illustrator – Built for Logo Design: The most distinct characteristic of Illustrator is that it is a vector drawing tool, meaning, the output file is a vector graphic that can be resized to any degree, without losing any quality. As you may have guessed, this is absolutely essential for logo design because of the dynamic diversity of its applications – you need the logo to function in spaces as small as a business card but also as big as a billboard. Conveniently, vector files allow for you to shrink or grow the finished design without any deterioration of graphic integrity. Adobe Illustrator Image More About Vector Files: For a more in-depth explanation of how exactly vector files work, the software essentially uses a mathematical solution to plot paths and strokes on an X and Y axis, within the given work area, to establish “control points” that universally control the shapes during the design process. When the design is complete, it is saved to a vector format such as Adobe AI or EPS. These file formats can be considered the master files, which are fully editable in the software in which they were created. If that wasn’t enough, a further and reasonable explanation of vector graphics can be found here→ Vector graphics - Wikipedia Illustrator is also equipped with excellent drawing capabilities that make it the supreme method for crafting more organic, free-flowing forms that are beyond the basic presets of circles and squares. Although clients might be intimidated by these advanced features, the program’s unique ability to draw next-level shapes and then save them as a vector file that can be liberally resized, without the loss of quality, makes Illustrator the most apt tool and the clear software of choice for professional logo design. are then laid out within Photoshop to form a greater, more collective document. While Illustrator works mainly with vector files, Photoshop is primarily a raster-based program that produces bitmaps. More About Raster Graphics: Raster graphics are synonymous with bitmap graphics, as both essentially refer to computer images that are formed by way of a rectangular grid of pixels or individual points of color.Rater ImageSource:printcnx.com If that wasn’t enough, a further and reasonable explanation of raster graphics can be found here→ Raster graphics - Wikipedia While Photoshop is not the best for creating professional logos, primarily because of its lack of vector drawing abilities, it is still a potent program. It’s a fantastic application for photographers because of the amazing editing controls that are available for manipulating photographs, as well as, it’s a popular program for untrained designers because of the built-in creative filters that allow even a novice user to make something look good with very little effort.Vector Bitmap ImageSource: wikipedia Further, because of its bitmap base, Photoshop is great for web designers because it allows you to optimize graphics for use online, resulting in smaller file sizes and subsequently quicker page loading. Web designers can also appreciate that Photoshop provides a relatively easy forum for slicing graphics to form individual online elements, such as backgrounds and buttons, for laying out web pages and wire frames. It’s safe to say the learning curve for Photoshop is ultimately quite flat and because it’s generally cheaper to acquire than Illustrator, it tends to invite less experienced hobbyists than it does seasoned logo design professionals. Yes, for all of Photoshop’s many strengths in general design, when it comes to logo design, it has some weaknesses to be addressed. Above all, the glaring difference here is that when bitmap files are enlarged, they lose quality. As the individual bits get larger, at a certain point in the enlarging process you begin to see a ragged edge (the result of the individual squares that make up the bitmap design, as opposed to a smooth edge formed by a vector image). Obviously, this perceived pixilation becomes a substantial problem when growing an image to the size of a billboard. Knowing this, when it comes to the application of logo design, Photoshop simply isn’t a suitable software. Logos need to be versatile by nature but because Photoshop does not allow you to make a vector file, you would either need to create the original file to be the size of a billboard (and shrink it down from there) or you would literally need to remake the logo each time in a new size, which are both, of course, ridiculous practices.

Ms. Scher created the logo and visual brand for The Public Theatre (1994-present)...   ...and the iconic Citibank logo (1994), and Jazz at Lincoln Center identity. Steff Geisbuhler, who designed the iconic NBC, Time Warner and Crane Business Papers logos.   Raymond Loewy, who designed the Shell Oil and Exxon logos (among other great logos.

Logos either have a symbol or text only. Both these types of logos create a powerful visual identities of a company and its business in the minds of target customers. However, as your business evolves and you enter new markets, your logo design must also be redesigned or tweaked. You need to make constant investment or the logo will turn into a visual crutch. People will be seeing the same logo design of your company for decades after decades. They will ultimately get bored of it, which will have some adverse impact on your business as well. This is the reason that most of the global companies give new twist to their old logos from time to time. That keeps the customers interested in the company’s offerings. Business owners lay more importance on logos than other graphic designs such as brochure design and stationery design. This is because a brochure and other marketing material is not everywhere. Right from products to advertisements and different marketing campaigns, a business logo is practically everywhere. That is not the case with other graphic designs like a website, brochure, business card etc. But even a professional logo designer finds it harder to come out with a logo that stands out as a unique design concept. A logo that pleases everyone is even more difficult to design. The fact is that graphic designers do not design logos for self-admiration or to please a set of people. Instead, a logo is primarily created for giving a glimpse into what the business is all about. A logo is thus a visual clue about a company’s business and brand. This means that every viewer can emotionally response to a business by looking at its logo. That is the sole purpose of a creative logo design. That is how a logo helps in establishing your credentials of business. It would be impractical and unrealistic to expect quick results from a logo. In reality, even a global company’s logo took many years to get recognition from the audience. It took decades to achieve the status of an iconic logo. This is because a logo takes a long time of many years before it establishes a solid relationship with its target audience. People take time to experience the brand. In fact, if simple logo designs such as that of Nike’s swoosh and Google logo were created today, they would have been rejected by many companies today. These are too simple logos to be accepted right away. These logo were not accepted that very well initially as they are today. One of the reasons of the success of a globally recognized logo design is that they all were a part of an entire gamut of visual brand building expertise of these companies. These are the logos that left their impact on viewers after many years. What we mean to say here is that we should not lay burden of expectation on the performance of a logo. We should be realistic in our expectations. Here are some points to consider: When assessing a logo for its performance, see if it reflects the brand’s promise.The logo should stand out as a unique design from the competitors logos.The logo design should be such that people can recognize it easily.Your logo should be based on a creative idea that is strong enough to capture the audience’s attention.Another quality of a good logo is that you should be able to use it in a variety of ways. So, you can use it in color, black and white, and in different sizes.All the above qualities are present in a simple logo without being a trendy and cliched design. So, it should provide some information about the values of the organization it represents.Here Are Some Tips To Get A Logo Design For Your Business 01. Logo Builds Faith And Trust One of the advantages of having a professionally created logo design is that it helps build faith in products or services of your company. When consumers have a good experience with your company, the logo itself becomes a badge. After that, it starts reflecting the consumers expectations. A company makes efforts to make customers have some specific perception about its brand. This, in turn, helps logo to become a symbol of trust. Later, such a logo gives the company a competitive edge over competitors.  So, if your business is of small scale, give priority to your logo design. It is as important to have a marketing strategy in place. Small businesses including startups should carefully plan their logo for its impact on the potential customers. It will help enhance your reach in your niche market and among customers. 02. Stand Out From Your Business Rivals There are hundreds of companies offering the products or services you want to deliver. They all are your competitors. A logo can help you stand out from your competitors in your target market. So, you should research your competitors business and logo designs. Then, create a logo that is unique in its shape, colors, typeface and other elements. It is important that your logo design is memorable so that it does not blend with many other logos.  In fact, knowing more about your competitors is also important when creating business card design and other such marketing materials. 03. Build Relationship With Customers For substantial growth of a business, it is essential that it constantly builds solid relationship with its customers. Customers should have some positive feelings evoked when they see a logo of a company.  Those emotions help build the relationship with the company. It is when this relationship is cemented that customers start believing in a brand and its products or services offered. 04. Create Customer Loyalty One of the main purpose of your logo design is to win customers’ loyalty. A nice logo design draws the attention of people. If it is a memorable design, the logo will be itched in the memory of people for a long time.  Since a professionally designed logo is appreciated by everyone, it wins the heart and minds of potential customers. They subconsciously become loyal to your brand due to your amazing logo design. Looking for a graphic design? We have helped thousands of business owners from all around the world with their graphic design needs such as a logo design, website design, social media posts, banner and much more. 05.

Surely, creating other graphic design materials such as your brochure design is important to marketing your business effectively. But your logo will be imprinted on the top of your brochure, and also on business card, stationery, and many others. So, your logo is crucial to make a lasting impact on your audience that uses your other graphic design materials.

LOL Ok, being serious - graphic design companies nowadays are a dime a dozen. You can find them everywhere on the planet, and they are used to work for less and less. But this is not how that should work. A graphic designer is not someone who creates a logo, mechanically. It is someone who offers to his client a personal take of his needs, and puts them in a graphic format. It is not that distant from a performer playing a Beethoven sonata. The notes are there - and they are all the same for everyone. What it is different is how the performer interprets them and gives them his personal style. A style that you - the client - could find agreeable, or not of your liking. But the notes played are exactly the same. This is the job of the graphic designer. It is not mechanical. It requires technique and tools, but the core of the job is based on personal experience and feelings. It borders the level of the art - because it is focused and (in a way) selfish, while art is unfocused and selfless. A graphic designer has to fulfill a request by others. A painter has just to fulfill his inner impulse. This is why I call it a craft, and not a work. Not art, too, but definitely not a work. It is like writing. It can be done through a computer, but also with a pencil and a sheet of paper. How to translate it in reality, that is another question. So, coming back to your question, my answer is that there is no best agency for a startup. There is a best agency for THAT startup. And the only way to ascertain what it is, is getting to know it by doing some work together. I have talked at length about that process of choosing the right agency to create a graphic image in some other answers, like in this one: How do I get an affordable logo and web design? In a nutshell, and even if I DO work to/from remote areas of the world, I alwys advise clients to choose (or at least check) their graphic design companies locally, because most probably you will find the good “vibe” with someone right this way.

Through a singular combination of colors, fonts, and graphics, you'll easily create a memorable design that creates an enduring impression on a good range of individual and company buyers, separating your firm from competitors, no matter its size. Selling land is about much more than simply providing the quality MLS listings. Although the proper property is important, you’re also selling A level of specialization which will enable the customer to urge the simplest price within their range. As a result, there are a couple of subtle differences that make land logos unique among other businesses, especially the extent of ritual that's often used. The most successful land firms are traditionally those with a diary of success and an expansive collection of resources and expertise that, together, ease the acquisition process for the customer. For this reason, many land companies shape their brand around a proper approach and are increasingly counting on a robust logo because the anchor for his or her brand identity. Five Ideas for Designing Strong land Logos With the concepts of specialization and ritual in mind, here are a couple of ideas for shaping a memorable land logo for your business: 1. Remember that it’s mostly NOT about you When scouring the online for listings, buyers are primarily trying to find one thing: property. Few are literally trying to find an agent (a figure that’s as low as 5 percent consistent with some reports). So when crafting your land logo, confine mind that imagery and slogans associated with property and therefore the steps toward acquisition will always convert something that’s focused solely on your company. 2. Select images that coincide together with your services: When land logos are mentioned, it’s almost impossible to not believe buildings, rooftops and therefore the outline of a home or ‘For Sale’ sign. And permanently reason. These images are simple thanks to quickly impart the precise nature of the services you provide. additionally, most home buyers and sellers are now seeking land professionals who go the additional mile, including assistance with comparable listings, paperwork and price negotiation. These factors can all be wont to shape a singular logo that accurately represents the entirety of your service offerings. for instance, does one assist with financing and mortgage? does one concentrate on contingency negotiation? By combining images and text from different disciplines, you'll create a comprehensive logo that quickly sets you aside from other firms. 3. Design to characterize your area and niche: Design is one of the first factors which will get you noticed within the marketplace. land logos will often highlight the name of the corporation with a complementary combination that coincides with the graphics. confirm to not use anything too bold unless you plan that element to face out above the remainder. additionally, many firms select images that reflect the geographical features of their area, with desert imagery, rolling hills, and symbols of the ocean being common in reference to those locales. Other popular niche themes include: purchasable by the owner, second homes and vacation properties, condominiums, baby boomers, unmarried individuals, luxury properties and therefore the Hispanic market. If you cater to at least one or more of those, confirm your logo represents that fact. 4. Choose colors and text that impart knowledge and knowledge: Color is usually the primary thing someone will notice about your logo. And during a land logo, these colors should adhere to the sort of property sold. If you’re selling land near the beach, bright blues, yellows and similar colors would be appropriate. But if you deal primarily in corporate or industrial properties, darker reminder gray, dark blue and conservative tones will probably work best. When picking fonts, accompany something that’s clean, easy to read and representative of your services. generally, Helvetica fonts, like Arial, are considered trendier while serif fonts, like Times New Roman, impart a more traditionally conservative image. 5. Fun but professional From specific images to the fonts you decide on, confirm each element in your realtor logo is an accurate representation of your business. After all, you're providing professional services. So think ‘business casual’. You don’t want to seem too stuffy. But at an equivalent time, you don’t want your realtor logo to offer the impression that you’re someone who shows up to a business meeting in board shorts and flip-flops.

As its vehicles run in all the three environments. It was registered as a trademark, and one year on it was taken as the logo for cars For over a century Mercedes’s three-pointed star encircled into an orbit masterminds conservatism, reliability, first-class performance and breakthrough engineering.  I like the stories behind cars logos, and why Mercedes is so special for me will share that too. Mercedes logo history.  The first edition of the logo, the word “Mercedes” surrounded by an ellipse, appeared on cars manufactured by Daimler, its predecessor, in 1902. After a while, the company introduced a new brand logo in 1909 — the glorious star of three points. Technical Director of Deutz, Gottlieb Daimler, designed it. He drew this badge on a postcard, which he mailed to his wife as far back as in 1872, vowing that one day this image would become the symbol of a car giant. The emblem was put into a circle with four little stars above the circumscription “Mercedes” on its bordure in 1916. In 1926, after the merging of Benz and Daimler, which resulted in the inception of a new German automobile brand– Mercedes-Benz, the actual trademark was finally developed. It is a star of three pikes embosomed with a bordering with laureate wreath and the brand name on it, which still designates Mercedes cars. Since then the logo has experienced insignificant amendments, the bordering of laurel wreath morphed into an unpretentious circle  However, the life journey of the brand started in 1926, when Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft merged with Benz & Cie, thus competition turned into a partnership, and the brand of Mercedes-Benz was born. It took its name after the daughter of an Austrian car-seller and racer Emil Jellinek.  By the end of the 1960s, the brand gained the worldwide recognition. In 1973, Mercedes-Benz was subjected to a test, as due to the oil crisis car sales keenly went down. But in response to such a situation the producer succeeded in the designing of the most reliable model series in the history of the brand — W123.  At the beginning of the 1980s, the company enters a new niche — the market of off-highway trucks, with its offroader Gelandewagen, which earned fame for its all-terrain and reliability. In 1999 another groundbreaking event for Mercedes took place: it bought AMG that had been its official tuning company. That permitted them to produce luxury modifications of some Mercedes series and to produce their own racing car — Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR. This car manufacturer keeps producing flagship models of cars, tirelessly improving its advanced technology and stylish outside appearance, as “The Best or Nothing” is its slogan. This unrivalled miracle worker rules the world of automobile manufacturing turning the heads of other car makers and setting the high standard for them.

It’ll be interesting to see whether or not flat designs will remain dominant. And, if not then what is the future of logo design in 2019? Explore: The Truth About Logo Design Trends According to an article in Canva about logo design trends 2019, Nicole Singh shares that the flat design trend will get a revamp: “This year, we will see logos that appear to be lifted off the page.” These, she calls “semi-flat logos” and it’ll be interesting to see how startups and small businesses create logo designs that are flat but appear to be three-dimensional. In the coming years, I’d like to see how unconventional and experimental branding agencies and brands become. Did you see what happened to the Apple logo in October for its event? So it’ll be exciting to see how the biggest logo design trends that’ve kicked off in 2018 will shape next year.  I really want to see something exciting and surprising rather than the usual, conventional designs. It’ll be interesting to see how the vintage/modern design trends will look in the next decade, for instance or the gradient effect. So fingers crossed. By the way here are some out-of-the-ordinary brand identity designs: Redot Branding by Germany-based graphic designer Anna Iva. The coming years are all about digital and how logo animations redefine brand identities online. 2. We’ve seen minimal text taking over many visual identity designs, but it’ll be fascinating to see how size, shape and direction help designers create something “different” from the same.  3. How will the icons in logo designs evolve? This one is mashup of a flag and a speech bubble. It’ll be fun to see how simple shapes and objects will be used to create meaning.  Cheers!

LOGO DESIGN SOFTWARE FOR SCALABLE LOGOS  Ideally, logos should be created first in a drawing program. Illustration or drawing software produces scalable vector artwork making them ideal as the all-around logo design graphics software. For commercial printing, scalable EPS graphics are the format of choice and import easily into most major page layout programs for creating letterhead, business cards, and other documents. Having the original logo in any kind of scalable vector format allows for easy resizing without loss of quality even if the final logo is needed in a bitmap format. Some examples of vector-based graphics software for logo design include Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Inkscape. Of these options, Inkscape is a free and open-source vector graphics editor; it can be used to create or edit vector graphics such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts, charts, logos, and complex paintings.  LOGO DESIGN SOFTWARE FOR FIXED SIZE LOGOS Designing logos for the web, even if created initially with illustration software, requires conversion to GIF, JPG, or PNG formats. A bitmap graphics software program handles that job and usually allows for other special effects, including simple animation. These logo design tools are ideal for integrating photo-realistic elements into your logo designs for web or print. You can use Adobe Photoshop for this purpose, along with Corel Photo-Paint and GIMP. Of these options, GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free, open-source graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, and converting between different image formats. OTHER LOGO-MAKING OPTIONS As you probably know, you can find most anything on the web. That includes customized, web-based logo-making applications and suite of services, some at a nominal fee, that can help you design your business logo. For some, this option might be the quickest option. It may not be the highest quality design work, but if a quick logo is what you are looking for, this might be your best answer. Some of these online logo-making services include - Canva, LogoMaker, SummitSoft Logo Design Studio Pro.  Thanks for reading till last. have a nice day !

It is the art of companies to affiliate and attract people to their brands and make them take ownership of it. There are multiple strategically designed marketing activities, which lead to such effective and impactful results. Marketing is the backbone of any business; it is the magic of marketing, which transforms a business or product into a ‘Brand’. The word ‘brand’ may seem just a five-letter easily pronounced syllabus but it holds the greatest power when it comes to generating revenues for the company.  Just the name of a brand is enough to make people do the purchase. However, creating this name takes untiring efforts and devotion towards work. It is not only about efforts and devotion though; it needs planned strategies and ideas on each step a business takes. Continuing that, a business creates multiple marketing campaigns, invites celebrities, makes its employees happy, and runs ads on TV, radios, social media, print media, and whatnot. Though these are all the important steps a business needs to take in order to become a brand and then to become a successful brand, a ‘Logo’ tops the list. A logo is the face of a company; it represents the company and its values. You must be thinking about how does a logo design helps a brand in being successful. Here is how it does: It is the recognition of the brandA logo is the face of a brand; it represents the brand as an identity, just as for humans an identity card does. It brings the recognition of brand needs. Imagine a human without a face! It seems quite disturbing, right? No one would imagine a human without a face, it is the same with brands too brands cannot be identified without a logo. They need recognition and for that, a brand puts in all the possible efforts by using different tactics and strategically aligns all the business goals but for people to recognize it all and to appreciate the efforts it does a logo is needed. Once a brand is recognizable by people, they do make an effort to go and make a purchase, the cycle goes on and this is how the brand makes numbers and increases profit for its success. You can also increase your customers through a logo. Familiarity with the brandFor a brand to be successful it is important to get customer response and response is only possible if the customers are familiar with the brand and its offering. A good logo design creates familiarity between the brand and the customers. It does so because of its vibrant and attractive features. An attractive logo design is the first thing a customer notices when he/she visits a brand. This process of noticing the logo design may not be consciously done but subconsciously, in the back of the mind, the person looks for it. It is in human nature to see the presentation first and then move ahead with quality and productivity. Influences brand performanceBrand performance initially depends on the anticipated demand of the product by the marketers. But later in time, the brand performance is riven by the customers, the productivity is based on the appreciation from the customers, brands seek acknowledgment for higher productivity. After all, no one would want to continue putting in efforts without any appreciation or acknowledgment. In that matter, a logo is smartly designed to attract customers. The logo design influence brands performance because it creates the connection between the brand and the customers and this eventually leads to a good relationship between the two. The more appealing the logo is, the better the brand performance will be. Brands do continue to put in more effort into the motivation of keeping their current loyal customers with them and for attracting new ones. Just as a kid will not do better in grades until you get them a present for motivation, brands need the same motivation in the form of appreciation and loyalty. Differentiation from the marketThe basic and elementary rule of branding is to have uniqueness and differentiation. Without this, a business cannot become a brand. Everything which demands to be successful is unique and one of its kind, there is no other like it. It goes for a brand’s logo as well. Being unique is the mandatory rule or becoming successful and a logo does this for you. The persona of the brandYou may like a person even if you do not know them because of their persona. The random lady walking on the street you found attractive was because of her persona, the little kid playing baseball has got your attention is because of his persona. Persona is the ability to attract people towards you and engage them in your personality. The persona of a brand is expressed by its logo. A logo design explains the personality of the brand; it tells people the values of a brand. It creates a unique and appealing persona for a brand as well. The more flourishing and captivating the logo design will be the more appealing the brand persona will be. The needed logos can be created from custom logo designs or brands hire logo designers to add that unique aura in their brands. It a onetime investment, which will benefit the brand for years, since changing it may cause damages to the customer base. Creates brand loyaltyOut of all the things a logo does, brand loyalty tops the list because it is the most needed thing for a brand in order for it to be successful. Everything you read in the above-written text is useful when a brand has loyal customers, one way or the other, the whole circle of customer retention, customer engagement, and grabbing customer attention merge at the center point, which is brand loyalty. A logo design makes it possible for brands to attract loyal customers. Most of the time, the customers’ are attracted to the logo and develop an emotional attachment to it, this leads to customer loyalty which turns into brand loyalty. This is why popular brands do not change their logos all of a sudden but prefer to do changes gradually over the years.

Because it’s exposure to the logo identity over time that will impact people. They grow accustomed to it.

Yet, to achieve brand awareness you merely need to expose people to your value proposition, logo identity, and brand name repeatedly in high traffic areas. Those are the three elements required; Value PropositionLogo IdentityBrand NameSo, you can see “logo identity” only makes up a third of brand awareness measurability. Where as, “brand recognition” is after countless exposure minutes to the identity, “brand awareness” is exposure to the value proposition. In effort to increase brand awareness, which can validate or invalidate one’s value proposition, people become accustomed to its logo identity. Logo design therein, must consider itself merely as a beacon of light from the lighthouse during a dark night. It’s job is to merely identify there’s land, not spell out what country it is. Logo identities that spell things out over communicate, and cannot achieve their purpose. That purpose is to be flexible enough to fit into a favicon or a billboard, because this increases exposure to the identity in conjunction to the value proposition and brand name. Once you’ve achieved brand recognition by increasing brand awareness, you no longer need the brand name in conjunction with the logo identity. Like the Nike Swoosh no longer needs the word “Nike” stuck on top, so too will your logo wean off of its brand name. Therefore, ensure your logo design takes that into account. Does your logo design take into consideration that after months and months of brand exposure the logo identity may stand on its own as a symbol, mark, or icon with out a label? If so, that’s the impact of logo design on brand recognition. The ability to plan for a future when the identity will stand on its own as a symbol without the value proposition and brand name (training wheels.)",2021-03-06T14:02:14.922Z,"What is the impact of logo design on brand recognition?

Think wider If you have ever researched logo design, taken a course on it, or perhaps you have experience in designing logos yourself, you've no doubt run across guidelines like, ""keep it simple,"" ""make it timeless,"" and ""it needs to work in black and white."" But what you usually don't run across is the whys behind these guidelines, that is, the evidence that makes them so. And understanding the evidence is important because such guidelines are not only often oversimple,they're often just plain wrong. For example, why is a simple logo better than a more complex logo? Well, it turns out, it isn't always better. There are many cases when complex logos outperformed simpler ones. Why is trying to make a logo timeless a good thing? You may be surprised to learn that it usually isn't. A timely, relevant logo will typically outperform more timeless designs, and then it can always be changed over time as needed. Why do logos need to work in black and white? The short answer: they don't. Not anymore. There was a time when limitations in printing made this an important consideration, but today, it is largely an artificial constraint. The point is that when we blindly follow rules, without asking and understanding the whys, we never really get what's going on. That's why understanding the science of logo design is so powerful. It allows us to focus on what's important, to make better decisions, and to design based on evidence versus convention and hearsay. So let's get to it. What makes a logo effective? To answer the question scientifically, we have to frame the response in terms of how our brains process logos. That is, we need to design for the brain. With this, we can see a logo is effective when it triggers the following four cognitive events in order. One: Attention. An effective logo grabs attention. It's a noisy world out there with a lot of things competing for people's attention. If a logo isn't noticed, then everything else is moot. Two: Response. An effective logo elicits an appropriate emotional response. Generally, this simply means people like it at a gut level, without thinking about it. Three: Meaning. An effective logo expresses appropriate meanings. Logos represent brand values, so it's important that the meanings expressed align to those values. Four: Memory. An effective logo is easily recognized and recalled. If people can't recognize or recall your logo, then any benefits will be short-lived, indeed. You can get everything else right about a logo design. You can make it pretty, simple, timeless, and scalable. But if it doesn't get high marks across the ARMM categories, it won't be effective. Good luck! If you have questions, you can ask me personally and I will be happy to answer.",2021-03-06T14:03:52.279Z,"How do I become a better logo designer?

Another excellent way to advertise yourself would be to hand out flyers. I don’t know all of the rules about door-to-door advertising, but you won’t get shot handing a flyer over a business’s front desk. Keep an eye out for nearby owner/operators (e.g. plumbers, landscapers, etc), who may be interested in putting a logo on their vehicles. Catching them in person is a chance for a conversation, but expect to just hand them your flyer rather than stand around and talk because they’re probably busy making money. For best results, don’t look like a missionary, and limit what you say to one quick sentence that doesn’t beg for a conversation. If they say no, they mean no - don’t be a salesman. Local print shops, e.g. t-shirt printers, banner printers, vehicle wrappers, etc. may be the first place a local business looks for a logo. Many of those businesses will offer in-house design services in addition to printing, but some may be willing to connect you with their clients as a subcontractor, or even hire you for an in-house position. Advertising online may seem like a great way to reach a wider audience, but consider that you’re competing with the rest of the planet. Only people who happen to look where you post will even see your ad. Search engines (like Google) bump paid advertising to the top of a list of search results, so don’t expect a search engine to be the least bit useful unless you want to spend some money. Additionally, dealing in person practically eliminates hacking/spam risks, and you have the opportunity to be a little pickier about your clientele. Your Ad You’ll need a portfolio to get clients. This doesn’t have to be logos you’ve sold, just examples of your work. Gather some material together and preferably present it on a single page or in a single image, e.g. tiling the logos. That way the prospective client has an opportunity to see the full breadth of your style all at once rather than potentially be put off by the first few images. I would suggest adding an unobtrusive watermark to each logo using a custom font or custom handwriting, having a texture in its fill, to prevent theft. I don’t know all of the details on watermarking, but those are my suggestions for a place to start. If you find a client, keep in mind that he/she may try to steal your work without payment because people suck. Therefore, I would suggest watermarking EVERYTHING until payment has been made. Be friendly, but be suspicious of any request to re-position or otherwise re-render the watermark! Be sure to include tags at the end of the ad to increase your chances of getting a hit. Similar Service - Web Design If someone is looking for a logo, chances are they’re also looking for a website, even if it is just a single page with contact info and a description of what they do.

Your designs will suck at first. You'll lose contests, but gain something valuable- real experience. Consider these early contests as an internship. Next you'll place high in a few contests, and you'll lambaste the winning logo as nowhere near as good as yours. Reflect on the winning logo, the creative brief and your logo, and figure out why you weren't the winner. Soon you will win a contest or two, lose some more and hopefully continue to learn and make more money from it. These wins can often lead to clients that can be the start of your client base. A fourth thing that you will learn from the process is that there is NO way you as an independent designer could afford to do logos so cheaply, because the communication and revisions involved are just too great. By that point you hopefully are competent enough of a designer that you can charge and get the right price for your work.",2021-03-06T14:08:13.355Z,"What are the best resources to learn logo designs?

Since brands are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of visual branding, they strive to come up with creative and characteristic logos that would be easily recognizable, channeling the right brand message and associations every time a consumer spots it among other visual materials. Logo design is a flourishing field, but it’s also changing – here are top 8 logo design trends predicted to grow and blossom in 2016. Typography and Script: There’s no denying it – 2015 will be the year when typography will gain a new and really intense focus. More often than not, logos will be just company names – but scripted in a unique and captivating way. Companies will use their logos to reinforce their brand message and help it resonate with consumers. Special attention will be paid to fonts that offer some truly unique and personalized script styles.Dual Coloring: Mono-colored logos are giving way for more eye-catching alternatives – in 2016, we will witness the growing popularity of dual-colored logos. Brands that want to look fresh and innovative are likely to add a dash of color to their simple white or gray typographic logos. This kind of color combination will work for compound company names, for instance – coloring one part of the name will simply help consumers to read and remember it.Low Polygon: Low polygon is a design technique that until now has mainly been used in backgrounds and wallpapers. In 2015, it will start to get really noticeable in logos, as well as icons. Its characteristic 3D quality makes logos literally pop out from the page or screen, ensuring that viewers notice and remember them.Negative Space: This trend can be situated within the aesthetics of the king of design principles, minimalism. As we’ve all seen in recent years, adding embellishments to logos isn’t always a good idea – instead of making things complicated, the use of negative space can produce more coherent and interesting logos. This goes especially for black and white logos – spicing them up with a negative space design can be very rewarding.Overlapping: Another minimalistic trend that will gain steam in 2016 is overlapping. It’s basically a technique used when two design elements overlap each other – designers can use shading to create a logo design with more depth. Shadowed logos look very interesting – such a small detail as shadow can take a logo from simple to sophisticated, adding a small touch of elegance to every logo design.Calligraphy and Hand Lettering: The trend for logos that look ‘hand made’ will blossom in 2016. We’ll see more and more brands turning to calligraphy professionals for creating custom made logos, marketing materials and event invitations. This trend is already visible in the fashion industry, where brands use calligraphy in fashion show invitations, emphasizing the professionalism and creativity behind the brand. It’s only natural that this tendency would spread to logo-making as well, allowing designers to adopt a more creative approach towards designing logos that captivate consumers.Gradients: Mesh tools and colorful gradient logos are becoming a favorite of the tech industry and we’ll surely see more of them in 2015. They’re simple, sophisticated and modern – the unlimited color range and  possibility of creating soft, innovative shapes proved to be more than attractive to many logo designers so far.Vintage: Just like calligraphy and script fonts, vintage logo designs are highly decorative and can work well for businesses like restaurants or music clubs. Well into the 21st c., our fascination with vintage can only grow – vintage logos are charming, simple and one-dimensional, essentially standing for values like tradition, quality and trust. It’s no wonder than 2016 will be very kind to vintage logos.Just like in case of any other design element, logo trends come and go. All trends listed above are already present on the design scene and the future looks bright for them. It’s more than likely, however, that in the near future logo designers, challenged by all sorts of creative strategies brands use to engage consumers, will come up with new solutions for evocative logotypes. www.creativespecks.com Continue Reading",2021-03-06T14:10:04.688Z,"What are the upcoming logo design trends for 2016?

I agree with most of what Paul Hopkinson has said, but I'd like to add a few points of my own as well. Yes, the thing to keep in mind about graphic design—and to an extent logo design—is that it's primarily about communication, not pretty little graphics. It took me years to learn this, and I still have to slap myself across the face whenever I find myself too consumed with making something prettier for the sake of it. Graphic design is about communicating an agenda or a message across with clarity and intention, with beauty and grace. To that end, if I find myself holding a business card without a logo, assuming it still has all the other relevant information such as the company's name, contact info, etc., I'd ask myself does this card communicate the message across? You have the business name and what it does in the tag line. You have the contact info to reach out to inquire about the product or service that they sell. Is there anything important missing? Was there any confusion in what the company does? The second question is how well does it communicate that message across? Did it intentionally left out the logo to make a point? Does the layout look haphazard and the design makeshift? If there is a website, does the website feature the logo as well? How thoughtful, functional, and accessible is the website? Are there user reviews or testimonials in the site? All these questions allow me to form an opinion of the company, and ultimately the decision to employ the company's service or not. But it's not about me. It's usually the target audience who will be looking at the card. They might find themselves going through the same train of thought without thinking about it in design terms, but it will affect their perception similarly. How well does this company do? Are they reliable, trustworthy? Are they thoughtful? If a person sees a beautifully and well designed card without a logo, they still might be inclined to pick it up and follow the link or the phone number. If the website looks equally well-made, and the phone call was informative and pleasant, they would likely employ the company's service and not worry too much about the logo. On the other hand, if their experience is the opposite then even if you slapped 20 logos on that card, it wouldn't do you any good in convincing them to go with you. Design is more or less marketing; and marketing is more or less about perception, not necessarily the product. The logo serves as a lighthouse, a beacon that reminds the users or clients of those pereceptions, along with many other pieces of branding material. Not to say that you'll get away with a bad product; but with two equal products, all things considered, design throws in the extra weight that tips the scales to one side rather than the other. Ask yourself those two questions first and you'll get a pretty good answer, regardless or the brand or the card.

Getting clients: The buying cycle for our services (graphic design in general) is Continue ReadingI will give you some of what I went through when I decided that I wanted to specialize in logo design back in 2012. I went for it and never looked back. I made sure that every business owner I worked with in the past knew what I was doing. I made sure that every new interaction with a lead/prospect/referral also knew that I specialize in logo design. I made sure that my network of friends and colleagues also knew what I was doing. I made sure my website, social media feeds and linkedin profile all had the same message. Getting clients: The buying cycle for our services (graphic design in general) is short. When a business owner comes to us they want to buy within the next 3 months MAX. I learned this by examining all my clients of the past 8 years and figuring out when we first spoke to when they gave me their first deposit. The average was 1–3 months. Knowing that, I realized how important it was to be top of mind and respond to requests for quotes/meetings/referrals VERY QUICK. Timing is very important. How I continually get new clients asking me for logo design is simple. I created a strong word of mouth marketing campaign. I joined a BNI networking group which helped immensely. I also make sure that every logo design I create is better than my last logo design. I live, breathe and talk logo design everywhere. People know me as a logo guy. Social media didn’t get me to where I am today. SEO and online marketing didn’t either. Print ads, commercials, videos, etc…I don’t advertise. Word of mouth is my biggest marketing campaign. Emailing my existing/past clients monthly, asking for referrals from my network and hosting free information sessions of value all contributed to MY success. Listen, what worked for me may not work for you. Hell, since I never tapped into online marketing and social media aggressively, I am sure they can work. Visibility + credibility = profitability. It’s that simple. You have to get out there and let people know what you do. You have to have a strong body of work to back up your actions. You need to talk the talk as well if you want people to think you are a credible source for logo design. When you piece it all together, it begins to create momentum. Joining a BNI chapter in your region can really help you grow. Surrounding yourself with complimentary service providers who can refer their clients to you, will also work. But keep in mind, you also have to give back. Referring works both ways. I hope this helps you.

Should the typography show a brand that demands the consumers to buy or gives off a more casual vibe? Is there a specific niche for this bakeries market? Do they serve traditional cakes? Or perhaps vegan cakes, anything unique to the brand should always be considered for the overall design. Now for the fun part, drawing your ideas! There are two types of designer when it cones to the rough concept stage, the one that will use painstaking measurements and detail, or the ones that just use basic shapes and crude drawings, whatever fits your style but I personally go for the latter. Really for a strong body of work, you really want to be designing around 6 to 12 ideas, it all depends how much you want to do, but let’s say this was for a client, they will want to know where their money is going, 6 to 12 is more enough to impress them and sometimes may want to take several aspects of other initial concepts into their vision of the final design, a common practice.  Here’s a collection of idea’s I had for one client, the final design came out completely different but it took aspects of these following concepts. Once all that is done, it’s time to design, of course you cannot go wrong with the mighty Adobe Illustrator for complete control, however any of the previous softwares mentioned will do just as well (plenty of how to videos up there for whatever software you pick) If you are friends with a designer or someone who knows their way around design software, don’t be afraid to pick their brain and get their opinion, most importantly have fun! :) The best thing you can do, is first get feel for the logo itself.

""It’s important to design something that you think is different from anything that’s already out there It’s said that ""It’s mostly impossible that what you design will be original, but you should believe that’s the one and only."" Designing a unique design isn't all about just thinking how to reduce plagiarism, but also about designing something very unique and excellent. It’s enchanting to just throw an industry icon on the page, but it’s important to think uniquely and wisely. ""The logo of Mercedes is not a car. The logo of Virgin Atlantic is not an airplane. The logo of Apple is not a computer. It has to be a vintage logo maker. 2. Understand the brand Yes, a logo is an image, but it also introduces the brand. The logo must get a specific audience and when designing, you must have this in mind. Write down what you think about the brand, or even make a mood board with images that remind you of the brand’s philosophy. But be careful of becoming inspired by only attractiveness rather than deeper meaning. ""Discovering other visual brands can be informative, but designers need to take care not to steal the inspiration and ideas,"" It’s sad. ""Any design must be original and be an image of the client’s unique brand attributes."" Being concentrated on anything else, you have to know what your logo means. Every logo has a history, filled with meaning or having a purpose. Like Apple, for instance — the apple is missing a ""byte."" Or Wikipedia, unfinished earth of pieces of puzzles covered with icons from different writing systems. Both logos are basic but have a twist that circles back to brand ideology. You would have to gather logo design ideas in order to understand the brand attributes. 3. Color is key When taking the brand’s image into account, you have to be aware of every minor thing of the image. Bold and bright colors may grab someone's attention, but it could also seem arrogant; muted tones leaks smoothness but could be overlooked. Every color has a different significance and can bring efficiency to your message — don't ever go into the trap of conveying the wrong message because of a simple brush stroke. The Logo Company published the article ""The Science behind Colors"" and information displaying the use of Color in Logo Design. Here’s a quick break-down: Red: energetic, sexy, and bold Orange: creative, friendly, youthful Yellow: sunny, inventive, optimist Green: growth, organic, instructional Blue: professional, medical, tranquil, trustworthy Purple: spiritual, wise, evocative Black: credible and powerful White: simple, clean, pure Pink: fun and flirty Brown: rural, historical, steady 4. What is in the name? Perhaps your brand can use a Logotype depends on the kind of name the brand has. ""If your brand has an ideal name, then you could get a logotype. But if you have a basic name, then you have to need something to identify the company by, which can be done by using a logo mark,"" logo design blogger told in a previous article. And when considering fonts for your text, be sure to avoid modern fonts, use negative space and perhaps tweak an existing font — websites like Font Squirrel or Hype for Type are efficient for this. Some logos are even recognized because of their custom fonts. Coca-Cola used the slanted font and now others try to copy them off. 5: Keep it easy and flexible It’s necessary to have an equal combination of simple and unique — you want your logo to be interesting, but you don’t want someone to have to sit and stare, analyzing the logo. A perfect example could be FedEx's logo, a simple Logo with a twist. The image uses negative space to make an arrow that identifies speed, precision, and direction. Meanwhile, the company changes the color of the “Ex” to identify the type of shipping. Amazon, too, uses just its name but also refers to its wide inventory with a small arrow pointing from a to z. Like the Starbucks logo which represents to reflect the seductive imagery of the sea Continue Reading",2021-03-06T14:13:22.283Z,"What does a beginner in logo design needs to know before starting?

There are many reasons why you need a professional logo (which is just much MORE than a simple shape). But in this answer I will focus on another, interesting aspect only. There is an interesting (and scientifically true) theory about novelty. It explains the reason why novelty hits us in our face, with a lasting power. And this interesting theory also explains why the human race has become the dominant race on our planet. In a nutshell, when we see something new, our brain is programmed to stimulate the hippocampus and the amygdala parts of our brain, which have been found to be the ones which produce new brain cells. This means that novelty actually makes us more intelligent. A sideproduct of this happening is that it also releases endorphines while doing it. Endorphines are the substances that make us feel happy. So, what does all this have in common with a profesional logo design? A professional logo design is carefully crafted through graphic mastery to broadcast in the most direct way that there is something new and beautiful around, which deserves our attention - and our direct engagement. So, a new logo helps you overcome that barrier of noise that our brain is trained to do to survive. Every day, we are displayed a multitude of visual stimuli - more than 5.000 per day - which are vying for our attention. And you know what? Our brain selects between them by…. yes, novelty. Because the brain does know that novelty is good for him to expand. It is a selfish organ, you know.

Second, you should do a lot of research about the ecosystem that the product or company will be entering. See how others have designed and created their brand. This will help you figure out what works and what doesn’t. Third, brainstorming. This stage helps you figure out how to start the design and where it might end. Forth, mockups. You will need to create mockups and sketches of the different ideas to have a variety of creations and it will allow the person or company to choose from the one that they feel is best. Fifth, you will begin expanding on the best mockup chosen by you or the person or company. Sixth, after finishing the final design you will present it to the person or company and get their input on it. They may or may not change anything or you might be scraping the whole thing but if that's the case I would say that you should be paid more to go through the process again. Seven, the revision phase. This allows you to implement changes to the design. Eight, delivering the final product to the person or company and saying a “Glad to work with you. Hopefully, you enjoy and appreciate my/our work and you will continue to work with me/us in the future”. This whole process can take up to six or seven months or even longer.

At a certain moment, when it’s time to see what it all is boiling down to, you begin to recreate some ideas in Illustrator, try out all sorts of variations, skip the most, tweak the best. (Many more Quora questions can be found on the birth of a logo…) Some designers finalise their design by delivering guidelines, a stylebook, a brand manual, whatever. And some might even go so far to associate their design with certain “golden rules” or “standards”. I’m not a fan of such an approach. If you search long enough in any design like a logo and its usage, you can always find some rules or guidelines, whether they’ve been used intentionally or found coincidentally… Peter Villevoye's answer to:

However, if you follow a particular path and that you proceed according to the questions that you should ask keeping the content that you need, the process becomes smooth. Let me take you the steps directly as how asking these questions can easy your work a bit and help you go in a direction that will help to get better understanding of the client and deliver the desired logo that not only answers the objective of the company but also satisfies the client. Questions that you may ask a client before coming to a conclusion about where to start from can be: What is the aim of the Company? What products/services are you selling? What does your company represent? How are your products different from the existing companies? How are the products going to fulfill the aim? What is the USP of the company? What are the expansion plans? Where do you see your company in 1 year from the start? What more product or services are to be added in recent time? I have framed these questions according to my knowledge and experience provided that we have the name already decided for the company. We can add more to it with time and knowledge. Name of the company actually feeds in new ideas and inputs required for the specific design playing the deciding factor in the colour and the symbol that can be implemented. If the logo has to be symbolic or typographic or a combination of both matters. Readers may contribute too in adding more questions that can be asked. In my work what I have experienced is that there can be a logo delivered within 2 hours to 2 weeks to more than 2 months too. So keep up the quality work in investigating evrything that you need to know about that company through its working and the name should tell it all, if not, you must make it in contradiction to the name and the work the company does. I would like to share some of my logo works with the time I took to make it:  This is the logo which took just 2 hours as this is a startup that want to get in collaboration with us and me being the designer/learner made it. The name of the startup is SolArchs which transends to solution architects and it makes technical products. The logo contains the finger print and also the foot print of Neil Armstrong on moon showcasing that the things/Products made by the company varies from the materials used on earth to something that can be surreal and innovative. 2.  This is the logo for Unboxx fitness, which is a online food delivery company. The owner of the company has her ideas to expand to many things which we got to know when we asked evrything and accordingly decided to go with this design. The shape justifies the opening/unboxing. This logo took nearly 2 weeks. 3.  This is another logo that took me 2 weeks. It is a logo for a salon which again not only offers the hair services but much more than that. So to justify that it has to be more catchy and should showcase some quality. The colours fit in the end and the client was happy with the design. There are a couple of logos in line that I'm working upon among which one is going on more for than a month and yet after sending 10s of logos and even finalising over a couple of logos we had to change as per the customer dissatisfaction. So, conclusion is have patience. You can not be sure what is exact thing for a name that you are given a responsibility to portray in the best possible way. It takes a bit of pressure sometimes but eventually you will find a way. PS: Don't forget to forward the idea or the reason why you chose to make that design at the priority. Because storytelling is an important need in design. People/clients usually just see the logo and judge it by how it looks but when you send the document you give the client the reason to understand the design as per your sense and his/her requirement. So don't forget to send an explanation because trust me that works. You may take time in the beginning but then you will get to understand what works and what not learning the kind of customer you are dealing with. Looking for another question now. Thank you!

I would like to talk about the characteristics you would look before you hire a logo designer. Myself working as a logo designer, I know some good ways which I am going to share with you today about how to choose a right logo designer. Below are the 6 things you should look before making a hiring decision.  1. What Experience Designer Have Besides Designing A Logo? Its sound little strange, I know you might be thinking why I need to know if they can design materials besides a logo design. Why is this important? The reason behind to check whether a designer you are about to hire, just know to use tools without having the actual knowledge and understanding of design and branding. 2. Real Design Portfolio Looking at previous logo design projects will give you a good sense of skill level, your designer is at and what you can expect from them. 3. Check References / Testimonials Another way to validate your designer before hiring is to check for the past testimonials from clients and colleagues. This will speak about client/colleagues experience with the designer. 4. Design Process & Pricing This one is tricky, most of the designer will have a design process in place for sure if someone doesn’t have a design process, that’s a red flag. You will come across logo design services offering a solution for just $5 and other charging few thousands of dollars. Similarly, with project delivery time (some designer offering one day turnaround time and other need weeks to work). Marketplaces For Logo Designer: If you hire a logo designer to do your logo for cheap and your expectation is high, then you will mostly get disappointment by the result they will produce.Professional Freelance Logo Designers: On other hands, if you hire a freelance logo designer charging few hundred to thousand dollars for a logo design. You can expect some good work from them.Marketing Agencies: And there are companies charging thousands and millions of dollars to design a logo. The process they follow is more than just design; it also involves target market research, focus groups, surveys, reviews, testing and lot more before they deliver/present any design concepts.5. Business Professionalism & Great Customer Service How good is your designer with communication and presenting themselves? Do they answer your query? Provide you with useful information? 6. Appropriate Questions One of the best indicator to know about a professional designer. If a logo designer asks a variety of questions to find out your needs with relation to your business goals, that’s a positive sign to know that they are following a process to understand your business before offering you any solutions.

But ... sometimes this is not possible !!!A bad logo has a lot of headaches behind it. The famous example of the napkin drawing. Who never came to a client with a drawing on a napkin? Normally this case is solved by putting a Comic Sans under the napkin drawing. No gentlemen, do not bring us a drawing on a napkin !!! Do not break something as important as the phase of divergence! Do you want to participate in it? Perfect. Do it!!! this is your house!!! But listen to the rest of the options. That in case you want to stay to the divergence phase, as we said, but before, you will have to understand and accept the concept of this phase. No Converger !!! The option of the napkin will be one of thousands. Then if you stay in the convergent phase, defend your napkin.A good logo is the work of professionals. We have stuck a lot of years burning our eyes in front of the screen, reading books, manuals, seeing examples, observing when we are co-driving in a car. All this mixed with the practice, the drawing and the management of the programs, makes of the designers people apt for this task. Keep it in mind and value it. Value yourselfA bad logo can be made by anyone, you do not have to be a designer. I do not have much more to say at this point. I'll explain it well in the next.A logo is not a drawing with some letters, with many colors that I like, many letters of many types that I, ah, and what if you put a palm tree next to the house in front of the landscape mountain? Gentlemen, nooo, noo and no. Keep it simple Stupid !!! If you like that landscape, make yourself a painting and put it in your living room, but do not confuse the world. A logo is something iconic. Something summarized. It aims to distinguish you from the rest but also to remind you. Same as the name. Or would you call your business ...: Home where the best tripe with fried potatoes and eggs of the Fanjul world are made. "" I know someone would do it, but that is not the idea. With the same logo, keep simplicity.At this point we will speak properly and explain a little better that it is a logo and its different types→ Logo or logo: Here is the most common mistake of all. It is often confused with the imagotype or with the brand. The correct thing for this term would refer to word formations (Logo means word). Therefore, only logos are denominated those that do not have symbols added to the text, that is to say, that an exclusively typographic set is composed in its entirety.  Isotype: Symbol or icon of the brand. There are cases in which the isotype works perfectly without being accompanied by the name of the brand, such as NIKE.  Imagine: It is the sum of an icon with a name but in a clearly differentiated form. In some cases their parts also work separately.  Isologo: The text and the symbol or icon are completely merged. They can not be separated.  Corporate image: This term represents much more than symbols and texts. It represents the perception that users perceive of the company.  Corporate identity: It is the physical materialization of the corporate image. The correct term would be Corporate Visual Identity. It encompasses all the visual aspects of a company's identity: uniforms, signage, stationery, vehicles, signage, etc.  Brand: It is the most global concept of all. It represents all the aspects that define a company, tangible and intangible aspects: philosophy, personality, communication, logo, look & feel, stationery ...  Now we have all in mind that the work of creating a logo takes many hours of work if you want to do well. Many more if we take into account that the ideal is to create a style book so there is no confusion when it comes to your applications. So let's give it the value it deserves and let's do a good job.

Lettermark uses the company name’s initials or first letter, which may better graphically represent the company better than the full company name. Examples of Lettermark are HP and IBM.  Brandmark Symbol This type of logo represents the company by using a simple but bold symbol which is often through abstract design. Its simplicity leads the mind of the consumers to easily remember the logo and company being represented by it.  Combination Mark This type of logo is a combination of type and symbol. The type may be bigger than the symbol vice versa depending on the design and purpose of the brand. In some cases, the company’s/brand’s symbol in this combination mark may represent their company/brand without the text with proper investment of time and money or if this strong combination mark already left brand identity. Examples are Pizza Hut, Quaker, Total, Unilever etc.  Emblem This type of logo encases the company name or brand name within the design, which means, this is also a combination of text and symbol. The difference between combination mark and emblem is that the company name is within or inside the design or symbol. Examples are Harley-Davidson, Master Card, UPS, and NFL.

This whole green circle shape and it’negative space is rather phallic and if that is an idea that is in the air I advise you to switch. It’s just not a good idea to keep going with this execution on the current feedback. The gradient is well.. don’t X it but don’t be married to that idea. I can’t really help you about the concept but I don’t believe it’s a lost cause yet. Although some other things you should avoid places that cause any visual pitches. Like the spots with the green shape below. Avoid small shapes like these especially because if the logo was printed small those details would be lost and even cause printing issues. This also includes all the spacing around your logo.  Your typeface choice isn’t the best solution. Copperplate Gothic is sometimes nice but when it’s a logo I advise you to get more creative with it. As a hand letter this is what I love. Although picking the right typeface is also a way to go. Make sure your kerning is correct, below there are many issues. See how space between “N D” compared to the space between “E X” cause a real separation. This is a real problem that needs correcting.

But look what happens when I make the design black and remove the circles:  Grids and strict geometry are suddenly not so cool anymore. Now, I don’t claim this letter to be perfect, but after some optical adjustments and an obvious deviation from the grid, we end up with a much more balanced design:  This is typography, but the same principles apply to logo design. This simple illustration shows that rather than grid systems being a necessity in logo design, in can be beneficial when used as a guide, but it should not dictate and constrain the design.* * There are exceptions, as sometimes adhering strictly to a grid is exactly the point of the design.

(the name of your company, slogan, web address etc) – What fonts would you like?  (name actual fonts or font styles you’re looking for, modern, fancy, grungy etc) – What color scheme would you like?  (white, blue etc) – Icon/design element or any additional ideas of what you’d like to see in the logo?

Now,  although lots of seasoned designers will frown upon this and you may get  some nasty feedback, there is actually nothing wrong with this. The  fact of the matter is that there are students that do need practice, to  receive credit for school or to begin building their portfolio. Some  schools actually have programs where they offer to design logos and  websites for free so that their students can get real world experience.  Good luck getting on one of these lists or not being 437 in line though  ;). Step 4: Flat Rate needmyLOGO: Page on needmylogo.comNow  if you’re willing to pay at least $100 for your logo, there are some  reputable professional services that offer affordable quality work  without limits on revisions so that you won’t get stuck with a logo you  don’t want.

You should only invest in logo design once you have your business and marketing plans figured out.You are a local business in a small community. In this case, your business will be known for the quality of it’s product/service. The word of mouth spreads fast in smaller communities, so a good or bad logo won’t make much difference. Just think about the time you were in some smaller community. If you had any friends, you probably visited restaurants and other places based on their suggestions, not based on the logos.Now we’ll see when the logo matters a lot. The logo and overall brand identity matters a lot when you are trying to compete in a bigger highly competitive market. A well-designed logo can attract consumers at a very early stage of the marketing funnel by being modern and eye-catching. The logo by itself won’t help you convert those people into customers, but it will play a big role due to trust (or lack of) that it provides. The rest of your brand identity (website, user experience, and other materials) are there to invoke trust in consumers and create raving fans. Customers want to stand behind strong brands, and strong brands are meaningful and congruent throughout all touch points.The logo and overall brand identity matters a lot when you have an online business. Let’s say you are facing a problem and some tech companies are offering a solution in a form of a software. There are usually 3–5 big players in every niche and all of them have only the slightest differences in features they offer. A well designed logo and website is a huge social proof and a symbol for high-quality product/service. That is why most online and modern businesses invest heavily in great design because they understand the benefits that come with it.Hope that helps!",2021-03-06T14:25:45.657Z,"Does company logo design matters?

Only such typefaces are capable of attracting the serious customers to your business as they will recognize your business for quality offerings. 4. Match The Typeface With The Brand The typeface choice should be based on its purpose for the brand. Here is an example of how fonts match with the brand. The logo mentioned below is of British indie magazine NME [New Musical Express] which is a music industry institution. The company wished to convey the message of authority through its logo. So, the designer used a sans-serif font called Sharp-Sans, created by Lucas Sharp, and the simplicity of the font is capable of putting across the authority of the institution.

Whether the golden section should be the proportions that are used is harder to answer  I think that there are both physical and cultural aspects to aesthetics. The Golden section is pretty commonly found in renaissance architecture as well as in nature so people in the West generally feel it looks right. But in parts of Asia different proportions are in common use, perhaps more slender due to different building materials and plants. The influence of bamboo is a factor which I think plays a part here. So I think the answer to this second part is that yes, it is a useful ratio, but not the only one 2:1 or 1:1 or 6:1 are also totally fine.

The logo that Buzzard designed is almost identical to the logo that Facebook uses to this day, as the company has made only minor changes to their original logo over the years. In an interview, Buzzard explains some of the design decisions of the logo, saying, “It was a modification of the typeface Klavika, which was designed by Eric Olson. Type and graphic designer, Joe Kral, who was a good friend that was working closely with Cuban Council at the time, completed the type modifications and final word mark, whilst I oversaw the project.” Interestingly, the blue color scheme of the logo was chosen due to a vision condition that Mark Zuckerberg suffers from called deuteranopia. Deuteranopia is form of color blindness that makes it difficult for someone to distinguish between colors. However, the one color that someone who suffers from deuteranopia is able to easily distinguish is blue. In the time since Buzzard completed his original design for the Facebook logo, only minor changes have been made, most of which you probably wouldn’t even notice if you weren’t looking for them. Facebook has stuck by the simplicity and recognizability of their logo, opting to keep it as a stable aspect of the company in spite of the fact that website itself has changed dramatically over the years. Design Elements of the Facebook Logo  The Facebook logo features a relatively simple and straightforward design, with white lowercase font on a blue background. As already mentioned, the blue and white color scheme was a purposeful choice based on Mark Zuckerberg’s vision condition. However, there’s also some significance to the color scheme itself as blue and white have long been used in combination to represent purity and optimism. As is often the case when using lowercase font, the lowercase font of the Facebook logo is likely meant to represent that Facebook is a casual and laid-back company. People go to Facebook largely for entertainment and for casual connections with friends and family all over the world, and the company is able to convey part of that message about what the atmosphere on the website is like through the lower-cased font of their logo. Beyond the color scheme and the font choice, there are few other design elements to the Facebook logo, and the company has only changed minor details such as sizes and shadings in the years since the logo was first designed. When it comes to their logo, Facebook sees simplicity as being key and has been hesitant to alter what has thus far been a winning design Once Facebook began to grow from a university networking site to a worldwide success, Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker hired Mike Buzzard of Cuban Council to design a logo for the company.

But as a professional, you need to resist this temptation and limit the scope of your work to what you've been expressly hired to do. Part of your challenge as a graphic designer is to use a graphic vocabulary to solve problems, one of which may be a weak name, tagline, business model, product, or anything else. A designer hired to make a new logo for a restaurant is no more authorized to change the restaurant's name than he/she is to change their recipes or hire new waitstaff. You work within the parameters you're given. If your client mentions that they are open to a name change and ask for your opinion on the matter, you're free to offer it.

My number one tip is a little different in that it’s something you don’t need to do, but many designers think you do. I’ve seen situations where it can either be a big creative hangup or it can create overly complex logos. It took me many years to realize this, but once I did, I found it to be revolutionary to my design process: The logo does not need to tell you what the company does. I’ve seen several instances where a logo designer will talk about how great logos need to “tell a story” about the company or how they should “explain the product”, or various other similar bits of advice. This is not true. I’ve seen many more instances of logo critique (often by other designers) where the designer is told the logo “doesn’t work” because the viewer doesn’t understand what the company does from the logo. This bad feedback. It is not a logo’s job to explain a product, it is a logo’s job to associate the product with a certain brand. It is not a logo’s job to tell the company’s story, it is a logo’s job to identify the company fittingly.  To prove that a good logo doesn’t need to tell you what a company does, I encourage you to quickly browse through this list of the Best Global Brands of 2017 by Interbrand and count how many logos tell you anything about the product or company that they’re branding. Out of the 100 companies listed, I would say you could maybe count Sprite for having a lemon and a lime in their logo and Discovery for having the earth in their logo. That’s only 2 out of the top 100. The rest of them don’t even hint at what the companies do. In fact, a third of them are just text with no imagery whatsoever, and the ones that do have images would be very misleading if you were to try and decipher what the company does from those images. Seriously, try to imagine you’ve never heard of these companies before and think about what their logo would tell you about them. Ferrari isn’t a horse farm, Hermés doesn’t give stagecoach rides and Apple doesn’t sell produce. What they might tell you instead is that Ferrari is Italian and possibly performance-related, Hermés is Parisian and likely quite fancy, while Apple seems very simple. Now, these companies are not the most successful brands solely because of their logos. There are many factors that go in to making a well-respected brand, from product quality to personality to customer service. An argument can also be made that these logos are simply famous because the brands are famous, not because they’re great logo designs. That being said, the logo still needs to fit the brand. Each good brand should have a particular identity and personality that sets them apart from competitors, and a great logo will reflect that personality. Apple’s logo wouldn’t reflect Apple very well if it were complex and technical. Hermés wouldn’t work if it were typeset in Helvetica Black. Ferrari would be decidedly less effective if its logo used an image of a snail.  Now, this doesn’t mean that a logo can’t have anything to do with what the company does. There are numerous logos out there that work very well while literally looking like a picture of the product or service. I’m just saying it’s not necessary, because I feel that knowing that fact can free up a logo designer to explore more options so that they don’t get stuck designing another hairdresser’s logo with a pair of scissors in it. Logos are meant to be unique, and if every salon has a pair of scissors in their logo, none of the brands really stand out. A common theme in the rest of the answers to this question is to “keep it simple” and I wholeheartedly agree. I think there are many young logo designers out there that try too hard to “tell a story” in their logo or make the company’s service clear in the logo, and that usually comes by sacrificing simplicity. It’s tempting from a designer’s point of view, as the mind-blowing logos that get noticed in design communities are the ones that tell a story or weave in a clever graphic related to the service. The designers for those logos are commended, while no one really cares who designed the Canon logo or the Gillette logo because they’re not as “impressive” designs. While their logos may not include clever graphics that blow your mind with their creative use of negative space, you can’t deny that the brands have been successful, with a small part due to a logo that works very well for the brand. So the next time you’re designing a logo for a client, don’t insist that it needs to be something clever and flashy to put in your portfolio and blow everyone’s mind. Give yourself the freedom to design something extremely simple that doesn’t explain the company but simply fits the brand.",2021-03-06T14:31:47.876Z,"What is the number one tip that logo designers have?

Further, the logo as such must be scalable since it is likely to be used that it in any place right from a letterhead to a bill board during the course of promotion. In the aesthetic sense, a unity is needed among the different elements and good colour contrast in order to be easy on the eyes. Thus logo design is a complex process interpreting the very soul of your business.

All these mega trademarks have an enthusiastic fan following. These energetic followers are always ready to get their hands laid on the specific brands' products. Moreover, a custom logo design generates curiosity among the consumers and gets them thinking about what all the hype is about, and gets them drawn towards your company. Furthermore, an identification mark of the brand makes them earn customer loyalty and trust. When a customer utilizes and uses a specific brand and is satisfied with its products, they do not look for other brands. The symbol of the brand becomes a label of trust, and customers become loyal to the brand. Moreover, this factor attracts new customers as well. Those new customers utilize your brand, and it results in a further expansion of your brand. An effective logo design separates you from your rival brands as well. It is the differentiating point among the brands and specifies the companies and explains what specialty the other brand has. If your brand has a distinctive logo design, it will grab new and potential buyers' attention. Curiosity gets everyone, and you can show it through your dynamic and effective logo design. Moreover, you will have a fair chance to tell a story or send a message through your brands' symbol. It will make your trademark more appealing, significant, and different from others. Furthermore, one of the essential factors is that your professional logo design will be performing as the visual communicator of the brand. Through that, people can assume what you are and what your brand is doing. Many creators make sure that their symbol is imaginative and expressive. Moreover, a custom logo design will help you generate a separate identity from the other brands. It will give your brand a head start in the marketing department and create the curiosity factor. We can conclude that a company logo design plays an essential role in setting the company's direction. It will also show how good the brand is with creativity and intellect.

It’s usually plain, basic and used by millions of other blogs on the internet. Ever after you add a premium WordPress theme to the site, there is still room for creativity and ownership. All of that can be pulled together with a great logo — and that’s exactly what I did with this blog when I first launched it over 8 years ago!In short, logos are awesome and they mean much more to businesses and brands than just being a name. In fact, some of the greatest logos in the world don’t even have names on them.To stress this point even further, many of the world’s most famous logos have hidden messages within them as well — which is exactly what we are going to be looking at in this article.Special thanks to Designhill for coming out with their own interactive chart on famous logos and their hidden meanings.What Hidden Messages Do You See in These Logos? There are hundreds (if not thousands) of logos in the world today that have hidden messages within them — each representing different components of their brands, how they were started and the services they offer. I hand selected a few of my favorites and showcase them for you below.Amazon Logo The largest online shopping site in the world is also one of the most famous logos as well. This can also be attributed to them stamping their big logo on the millions of packages they deliver daily.While the Amazon logo has changed greatly over the years,in the year 2000 they made a simple, yet creative design change. Many people will notice what looks like a yellow “smile” under the amazon.com name, but it’s also saying that Amazon.com sells everything from “A” to “Z” — now you know!  ​Apple Logo Most of us already have something with this logo in our homes or office, while the majority of us probably have it stamped on our mobile devices and laptops as well.Of course it’s Apple, but why the bite out of the side of it? This was done by the original designer to make sure other people wouldn’t confuse it for a cherry or another fruit.Also, this simple apple design wasn’t the original logo for the company (which can be seenhere). The original had a picture of Issac Netwton sitting under an Apple tree — imagine that being stamped on the back of your phone!  ​Batman Logo This one is easy right? It’s everyone’s favorite super hero… Batman!But do you know why the Batman logo is oval, yellow and black?Each of these features were put together to represent fearlessness, elegance, heroism and valor.  ​Beats Audio Logo From Dr. Dre, to Apple and all the celebrities in between… Beats Audio has been all over the place.The logo is clean and simple in itself, but the “b” instead the red circle can also be represented a headset or earplug.Apple loved the logo (and brand) so much, that they recently acquired it for $3 billion!  ​Firefox Logo Many of us use Firefox on a daily basis to browse the internet… but why then name FireFox, and why it is on fire and circling around the globe?Firefox is the name of the browser from Mozilla, but the concept behind a fox tail on fire and circling around the world is to represent the browser’s “global reach and also it’s blazing speed” — hence their claim that Firefox can read the entire internet!  ​Goodwill Logo If you’ve ever had the chance to drive past a Goodwill location, you will have probably recognized this logo — mostly because it looks like a half smile on the top portion of their logo.However, the smiley face is actually a bit more. It’s a smiley face, a lower case “g” and the same “g” that is used in their “goodwill name”.Who knew a “g” could make people so happy!  ​Toyota Logo A logo that we all probably see on a daily basis is the Toyota logo, but what the heck is that symbol above their name?The three ellipses on top are actually three hearts, each representing something different. The heart of the customer, the heart of the product and the heart of progress in the field of technology. The space that can be seen in the background within each of these hearts is meant to exhibit the “infinite values” in which Toyota stands for.Not the easiest logo meaning to explain… but I’m sure you now know something 99.9% of Toyota owners don’t!  ​Want even more logos with hidden meanings?

It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a wordmark.” So, a logo serves to identify a company, or its products or services. It’s like your photo on your drivers license. It’s not on there just to make your license look pretty. It functions as an ID. To illustrate, when you see a swoosh on athletic apparel, you immediately recognize the source as Nike. You will never see an Addidas swoosh. In fact, you will never see any other athletic gear company using the swoosh, as if it were some kind of template. If others used a similar logo, would it not defeat the purpose of the logo? A true logo can function as a piece of intellectual property, something that can be owned by a company. Further, a company’s logo, if it identifies goods or services, can be registered as a trademark, and other companies can be prevented from using it or sued in court for infringement if they do use it. A design template cannot function as a logo by any definition of the word “logo” as accepted by professional designers. Many of the “logo templates” offered by stock providers even contain images protected by copyright, and the providers can prevent a customer from owning such an image. This is often spelled out, though not always clearly, in the fine print of the provider’s end user agreement. An application for trademark registration for an image covered by a prior copyright claim would be rejected by the US Patent & Trademark Office. A professional designer would never create a logo design that includes copyrighted images belonging to someone else. This would be deceptive and unethical. At least some of these “logo template” providers are deliberately relying on the ignorance of the marketplace to delude buyers into thinking they can avoid paying a professional to do something they can do themselves for next to nothing.

Every business owner has different requirements and they are based on the type of companies and their interests. Let us consider a typical food company that serves burger, so its logo will definitely signify an attractive icon of the delicious burger because a burger is the main product and thus, it will be focused while designing a logo for that. But a unique logo is completely different from others and sometimes a logo is created with the combination of the brand name and product. Apart from relevancy factor, it is not necessary to add any specific image of the product in every logo design for the food company. One can also use other visual elements which are directly related to the product so that viewers can easily interpret your message through a logo. As you know there are various food companies which are popularly recognized with their logos like Nestle, Hershey Co., Mapple Leaf Foods, Kraft Foods Inc. and others. All these companies are holding the most competitive logos which are attractive, relevant and remarkable as well. Usually, following are the main features which are essential to create an interesting logo for the food company: Unique- If your logo is unique, then it is best for your company because it will be difficult to establish your business with an identical logo. Appealing- A logo has been designed with a motive to capture the viewer’s attraction and create a long-lasting impression on their mind. As you know, viewing an interesting icon is extremely engaging and this type of logo makes the viewers stop and have a look on it. Relevant- Talking about food company, its logo design depends on the food type it is dealing with. As a logo represents your business, it must be somehow related to your company. Quality- A logo that is high in quality comprises different visual elements in it. The dimensions, font, color, format, sizes, and shape are basic tools which must be used appropriately as per the standard of the food company.

Pixel images are easy to make in Adobe Photoshop from the Illustrator files as Photoshop opens them and you just do a ‘Save As’ and close the Illustrator file without saving any changes. CorelDraw and other Design programs can also output in a variety of formats. Also you can make/adjust/edit any pixel images in Photoshop and import them into Illustrator. However there you want the 300ppi of printing and as large as the “biggest printed image will use”. Never use the print enlarged image option. It simply looks like crap. All vector images should be built at the largest know image use size. Building a business card size image and the outputting it for a billboard is a good way to hate your work. What looks good at 2 inches tall will show mistakes and not meeting lines at 20 feet tall. However some times you just have to deal with a customer who likes your design and wants it on a big sign in front of their business. Take the time to resize everything in vector, look it over and then output a tiff, jpeg or other raster file if needed fro the sign printing company. Also if you need any “cut vinyl”, you will need a vector image, NOT pixel. I.E. glass door & window signs are vinyl applied to the glass. Those are “vector image file” so the cutting machine knows where lines are to be cut. This also applies to foam/plastic/metal lettering and logos.

This step is very important: sit down and think about it before creating your logo, expressing what your company has to offer is no small feat. 2- Study your competition: this is a fundamental step, you have to become a spy , you need to know what they do to know what differentiates you from them or what you can do better. 3.

With logo design, bear in mind that negative space is just as visible as marked space, so you'll want to think about the shapes you're creating with it.  If your negative space can create a shape that further pays off the client's concept or tone (like the arrow in the FedEx mark), it can be worth major bonus points.     Similarly, you'll want to make sure you're not unintentionally creating shapes that might be offensive or lewd with the negative space, unless of course your client wants to go the offensive/lewd route :)",2021-03-06T14:41:00.935Z,"How do you use positive and negative space in logo design?

For the businesses, sports logos promote the products or services, while the teams get motivation by looking at their logos that have some message of courage, strength, winning, etc. courageous qualities. Unfortunately, as we take a good look at most of sports logos, we find that they are lacking in quality due to some of the commonest mistakes made by the designers. They end up legging behind their rival businesses just because their logos are now working efficiently for their companies. Remember that a major purpose of logos is to lure people to your business.  Here are some of the critical mistakes that many logo designers make but you must avoid them. Designing without purpose – Many sports business owners have sports logo for the sake of it. There is no purpose behind the design. Such symbols are nothing more than a random assembling of colors and fonts. You cannot fool people by making them see any casually drawn shapes. They will appreciate an impressive sports logo design only when they get some message from it. So, make it sure that your logo has something unique to say to your target customers. Creating an overtly complex logo – Many designers frequently make this mistake. They want to create a cool sports logo but end up involving too many elements in a tiny space of the symbol. Such design gives confusing signal to the viewers and so they just ignore seeing it again, harming your prospects of benefiting from your logo.  Instead, settle for a simple logo. Already, minimalism is a well-accepted design trend. This is because now the business owners and designers alike have acknowledged the benefits involved in creating a simple logo. Use not more than two colors so that people can focus easily on logo to get the message you wish to deliver. Similarly, not more than two fonts is an ideal way to incorporate typefaces. Not involving right colors and fonts – A random use of colors and fonts is recipe for ruining your sports logo. Remember that colors and typefaces are the two major visual elements that transmit a message to the viewers. This means that you need to pick up right colors that evoke the desired emotions and the right fonts that match with personality of your sport entertainment business.  Creating a run-of-the-mill logo – People will simply not look again at your sport logo if it looks similar to many other logos out there in the market. They will remember your logo only if surprises and excites them with its unique use of shape, colors and fonts, lines, white space, and figures etc elements. Only such logos stand out despite their simplicity. Hope these vital tips will remind you of how your sports logo must look when its purpose is to engage customers and invite them to your business to convert them into buying your products or services.

They asked me what I wanted and made sure that they delivered on the specs that I gave. All logos they submitted had my initials: D.R., and my blog’s color palette: black and silver. I requested a thoughtful yet minimalist logo because I didn’t want it to be too loud and busy. I honestly think that having too many elements makes it harder for a logo to be recognized. Once I chose the design I wanted, I received the file in all formats. This is an essential step if you’re paying for a logo. When I worked with other designers in the past, some would just give me a JPEG or PNG copy. This eventually gave me a hard time since many software or sites require PSD or BMP. Every time you convert your JPEG copy, the quality resolution suffers, and it pixelates. One thing I learned the hard way before is if you’re planning to have your logo printed, you need to ask for high res soft copies. I took the liberty of uploading some of the logos DesignBro has done in the past to help give you an idea of the scope of their work:",2021-03-06T14:42:22.944Z,"Where do I find the best logo contests for logo design?

Person A needs to get from home to work and back 5 days a week and have the ability to go on long motorways drives, and short trips on weekends.  Person B has a big family. He needs to do the same as person A but he shares his transport with the diverse needs of his family. He needs transport that can pull a big trailer,  go extreme off roading and ferry groups of people.  Person A buys a Honda Civic.  Person B buys a Land Rover Discovery.  The Land Rover on paper does the same thing as the civic, it gets from Ato B. But it cost a lot more. Why? Because the Land Rover is versatile. It's designed carefully as a system to provide a solution across many changing variables. So it's worth more.  Larger companies need logos to be land rovers. It's not the logo itself that costs the extra, it's the systems and planning around it.  Now, that's part of the answer but not the big part.  Let's say I design a logo for you and you use it and are happy with it. You use it in your website, stationery and maybe signage. It cost X and you get X to the power of 3 use out of it.  Let's say that I design a logo for IBM. It also costs X.  But they use it on 300 websites, 600 areas of signage, 3000 advertisements, 1200 uniforms, 30 items of stationery, hundreds of pieces of collateral. They leverage it and get X to the power of 3000.  You see that's not fair? A company should be paying for what a logo is worth to them. It's a piece of intellectual property that is owned by the creator and licensed for certain usage. More usage means more cost. That's fair. This is a great question. I think a lot of designers see the situation and assume that larger clients are charged more because they're wealthy.

Plus there’s our unconditional 100% money-back guarantee that you’ll be happy with your design or you get every penny back. There are other sites, including traditional marketplaces where you receive bids and proposals from designers and pick the bid you like. Upwork is one example. Having gone through that process ten years ago, I’ll never do it again. I’ve never understood why someone would pick from bids and proposals (as you would on most marketplaces or when looking at bids from freelancers) as opposed to setting your own budget and working with dozens of freelancers on a site like crowdspring and picking the design you like best from among many custom designs. You have lots of options but let me offer a few cautionary words. Stay far away from “logo stores” that sell you generic logos. They will expose you to legal risk and cost you dearly in the long run. You can’t differentiate your business with a logo that’s also used by thousands of other businesses. Generic design (like what you would get from Fiverr, for example, or an online logo store or logo maker) is a good way for your brand and business to hide from customers. Online logo stores and online logo makers may be cheap (sometimes) but they offer marginal value. I wouldn’t pay even $5 for a generic logo design. You’ll get at best, poorly designed templates. And don’t get confused by claims that some of these logo makers use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create their designs. If you look at the examples on those sites, they’re using generic elements - thousands of generic glyphs, images, and other things that ensure your logo will look like thousands of other logos.

A professional logo will help you to stand out from the crowd because that’s the one thing nobody can copy. It’s also at the heart of your branding, so the success of your logo will determine whether someone buys into your branding or not. There are 3 types of logo design principals: Text only  Text + symbol  Symbol only  Most likely you are best off choosing one of the first two types of logos. Because a symbol only logo works best for brands that have already established some prior brand recognition. Regardless of what type of logo you decide to create, you should try to make a logo that is: Uncomplicated: A simple logo design that isn’t over-complicated or over-designed. Simplicity is a good thing and when in comes to creating a logo and less is definitely more.Easily remembered: Your logo is a visual representation of what your company stands for. A good logo design should be memorable and it needs to make a fast impression.Long-lasting: A good logo should be able to stand the test of time. Avoid trendy fonts and symbolism to ‘future proof’ your logo to still be effective in 10, 20, 30+ years time.Flexible: A good logo should be able to work across a range of mediums and applications, e.g. it should still look good in different sizes and look good in black and white.Okay so you know you need a logo and you could hire a graphic designer, but that’s going to cost you and you don’t want to spend all of your startup costs on your logo. This is when a logo maker comes in handy. You can use a professional logo generator, and this guide is going to introduce you to the eight best free online logo makers on the market today. » 1. DESIGNHILL LOGO MAKER  DesignHill works differently from the other logo generators on this list. You actually have two options on the table. The first option is to use the DesignHill free logo generator. It’s just a three-step process to putting together your own logo. The difference with DesignHill is you have more than a free logo generator to take advantage of. The main attraction of DesignHill is the Design Marketplace. This is where you can get other people to make a logo for you. DesignHill will prompt you to add as much information about your proposed logo as possible. The more accurate it is the better. These are essentially design contests, where you can choose from a number of solutions put in front of you. It’s also a great way to find a professional designer for the future. Official website: www.designhill.com/tools/logo-maker » 2. SHOPIFY ONLINE LOGO MAKER  Shopify offers you the chance to create a logo in a matter of seconds. You don’t need any technical expertise and you don’t need to have a degree in design. Small businesses and online entrepreneurs who’re just getting started can use Shopify’s stock imagery to help them put together a unique logo. It has a vast library of options available, and it’s adding to it all the time. The only downside to Shopify’s online logo maker is that you may not be able to make your idea fully come to life. You also run the risk of the most popular icons being used by someone else. Official website: www.shopify.com/tools/logo-maker » 3. LOGO GENERATOR BY SPACES  Spaces is another logo generator that rivals Shopify for popularity. You’ll notice that the interfaces are extremely similar, so if you’ve used Shopify’s online logo maker before you’ll easily be able to use Logo Generator by Spaces. Even if you haven’t created a professional logo with either of them, you will find using it easy. All you have to do is enter your business name and add a few keywords describing it. Spaces will then generate hundreds of different logo options that relate to your business. Unlike other logo generators, Spaces will allow you to tweak the little things, such as typography. This makes it easier to create a unique brand. Official website: www.gospaces.com/tools/logo-maker » 4. LOGO MAKER BY UCRAFT  Ucraft’s logo maker actually comes in the form of a free app. You can easily create a logo with the help of the various prompts that come up on your screen. These logos tend to be more cartoonish in style, but if you have an audience that appeals to this, it can be the ideal logo maker. Perhaps the main advantage of Ucraft is that after you create your logo you can download a free PNG file. The transparent, high-resolution PNG file can be used anywhere. We have seen businesses create a base logo here then pass it to a professional designer for refining. It’s also an entirely free logo maker. Official website: www.ucraft.com/free-logo-maker » 5. GRAPHICSPRINGS LOGO CREATOR  The GraphicSprings Logo Creator is one of the strongest additions to this list. The sheer number of customization alone makes this online logo creator an ideal option for businesses that want more control. It provides many of the same features that professional image editing programs provide. You can break down different logo types into categories like abstract and letter-based, to give you an idea of how this works. What makes this logo creator particularly interesting is that you can even pay to hire someone from their team to create the logo for you. Official website: www.graphicsprings.com » 6. CANVA  Canva is not a dedicated free logo generator, but it’s highly useful for creating logos. It aims to mimic many of the features that come with professional design programs. You’ll see many similarities to Adobe Photoshop. Despite the apparent complexity of the tools available, the way they’re used is simple. For example, you can use the drag-and-drop system to move various elements around. It even comes with live orientation guides, so you can match everything up as and when you see fit. It even has a huge catalogue of free stock images that you can use to create your logos. Official website: www.canva.com/create-a-design » 7. HIPSTER LOGO GENERATOR  The Hipster Logo Generator was created as a result of the rampant hipster movement a couple of years ago. As you can expect, the logos created with this logo generator replicate the hipster style. That means it’s not for everyone. But if you have a business that caters to younger, alternative people this can be the perfect logo generator for you. It doesn’t get any simpler than this. All you have to do is run through the various options and start putting your logo together. There’s no design experience necessary and, for a fee, you can export a high-resolution version of your logo that you can use anywhere. Official website: www.hipsterlogogenerator.com » 8. SQUARESPACE LOGO MAKER  SquareSpace’s logo generator is perhaps one of the most controversial additions to this list. Designers reacted with fury when it was initially released. Part of the reason for this was that it was aimed at small businesses who wanted a professional logo without paying for it. Nobody can deny the incredible results that come from it, however. The simple drag-and-drop system, together with the slick interface, makes it easy to create a logo that you can be proud of. The results are stunning and can rival those of a professional designer. Official website: logo.squarespace.com Your logo is the “face” of your business. It helps people visually and instantly recognize your brand and what your company stands for.

Find designers or design studios rather than named agenciesShop around for freelancers who come with good references. Meet them and have them present their portfolio and explain their work process. Designers have their own aesthetic proclivity so pick one who is able to deliver a similar style to what you have in mind. 2. Break the payment into partsThis is beneficial for both you and the designer. For a branding project, you can break it down to a 35% payment upfront, 35% payment halfway through the project..perhaps after VI is completed and the balance 30% after sign-off. It is beneficial for the designer because he would have received 70% of the payment two-thirds into the project. It benefits you as it gives you time to find more money. 3. Do you own research / footworkDesigners will include brand auditing. By doing some of this research yourself, you will be saving research time and cost. Brand Platform The Brand Platform consists of the following elements: Brand Vision - The brand's guiding insight into its world.Brand Mission - How the brand will act on its insight.Brand Values - The code by which the brand lives. The brand values act as a benchmark to measure behaviors and performance.Brand Personality - The brand's personality traitsBrand Tone of Voice - How the brand speaks to its audiences.Brand PositioningThe distinctive position that a brand adopts in its competitive environment to ensure that individuals in its target market can tell the brand apart from others. Positioning involves the careful manipulation of every element of the marketing mix. Design researchWhat is the visual style of the brand? What is your colour palette? What key insight should be the focus of the brand? What is the difference between you and your competitors? Show references of style that you have in mind or logos that you like, and why. Provide them with your competitor's logo and branding work. Who are your audiences - and what other brands do they like? This refers to your demographic and psychographic. These would be good to have prepared while you are shopping for a designer. The clearer the brief, the more efficient the work process can be. 4. Don't stretch the projectContracts have clauses where the date of completion is specified - at which time the final payment has to be made whether the project is completed or not. This is to protect designers from clients who are disorganised or have delays in projects through no fault of the designer. A separate cost will follow to resume or complete the work. 5. Ask for mock-upsWhere would the logos be used? On uniforms? Vans? Ask for mock-ups. See how they look when colours and logos are applied. This would help you make better and informed decisions so as not to incur costs should you change your mind after signing-off. 6. Have a good relationship with designer Understand that design is a processBe specific - it is as important to say what you LIKE about the design as what you don't like. A happy colour to you might be red but to the designer it might be yellow. The more back and forths you have, the longer the project could take.Don't dump a boatload of information to the point of paralysis.Read their emails. Designers will rationalise their design...telling you why they picked the typeface, why the colour and their thoughts. Don't discount what is being said whether you agree or not. The point is to have a conversation - it is as much a relationship as it is a design process. The best works come out of a collaborative environmentNever say, ""It only took you 3 days, so can I have a discount?"". Sure, and it only took Paula Scher a few second to doodle Citibank's logo on a napkin. The 3 days spent is a culmination of years of education, edification and experience. Be respectful.Further down the road, you might need the designer to tweak or update a design or help with bits and bobs like a Christmas card. For clients I enjoy working with, I'll simply do them those favours. For those who nitpicked about payment, I return that favour providing my daily rate.  Most of the time, it is a fun and learning process. Have fun and play with the designer!

Why does everybody recognize them from the first sign? Through this you can understand the basic principles of logo design and fix them in your mind for good. 2) Establish your own design process - organize your work. What do you start with? Research, design brief from your client, finding good references, making first sketches, etc. It'll help you to organize your work and your time for one logo so you could follow this process all along during hundreds of projects when you have them. 3) Price your work. It's very important to value your own work in a way it should be valued. Of course, when you only starting it's hard to make hundrends of dollars on one project, it's totally fine to practice by making logos for free - as a gift, for promotion or for a little price to get experience, but you should value the design and your efforts anyway because if you don't your clients won't either. 4) Make a reserch and study fonts and how to use them. They're a huge part of logo design process and you should be sure the fonts are working perfectly together and with the sign created if there is one. 5) Learn different file formats and how to make them. It's important as all the original files must be send in different formats sometimes and it's better to know these things before you face this problem in reality. 6) And last but not least - make mistakes and don't be afraid to make them. With mistakes you learn much more than without them. Practice when you can, be passionate about what you're doing and everything is going to be just the way it should be.

Sketch some more.Scan your sketches in high resolution.Mock up what you've sketched in Illustrator, dealing first in black and white. Now add color.Try using the logo in different locations, to see how well your design meshes with pseudo reality. (Side note: I recommend using LiveSurface Layered Image Template Library : Context for mocking up in any physical location, as it's an Illustrator plugin and eliminates the need for a separate Photoshop mockup). But I find that process rather stale.  Instead, I would think about what works best for you: if you hate sketching, but but love the pen tool on Illustrator, head straight to the computer. Don't confine yourself to the ""traditional"" ways, because, guess what, design has changed a hell of a lot since the days of painting logos by hand with gouache (yes, this is how my first design teacher started our class). I have a couple of topics that might interest you: Firstly, learning about the five gestalt principles is a great idea: The Gestalt PrinciplesThey classify the different ways to delight the eye.

The new iPad version of Josef Alber's Interaction of Color is amazing: Interaction of Color It breaks down how colors get along and is great for a designer to understand (also amazing to realize how many people are mildly color-blind). If you haven't learned about typography, check out Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type: Thinking with Type | HomeIt's the first thing a designer will nitpick in your work. I think it gives us some kind of gloating thrill to see another designer mis-kern a word.

This is fine, but the problem with asking for advice on an effective logo design is that I don't know what your brand message is? I know your a 'tech company' but 'tech' is a term which covers a very broad range of products and services, and it's growing all the time. I could give you technical advice on execution, such as using vector software, using your brand name alongside an element, making sure it works it black and white etc. but this won't help with that actual design aspect of creating it. Is there anything wrong with using the element you mention? Well, not classically no. It's geometric, it's not offensive or tied to anything negative in a symbolical manner. But is it right? That's the thing, without seeing your final execution it's impossible to say. I certainly wouldn't use it in its current incarnation as there's far too much going on and it's not going to be very scalable without losing the structure or detail into just a muddy smudge. In the interests of being helpful I'd say that you should: Decide on what your brand message is. What's the key ethos of your brand you want to communicate? Refine this down to one word or a few words and use this as a anchor to base your design around. Your first idea probably won't be very good. This isn't a put down, the same rule applies for me or any other designer. Sketch your first idea and then come up with and sketch another, and another, and another, and... you get the idea. Take all these ideas and choose 2-3 that you feel are strongest. Then spend time refining these down, over and over until by process of elimination you're left with one great concept.Take this one forward to execution and then use all the great technical advice on this that you've been given in some of the other answers.

So brace yourself to see more of logos that shrink every time you scroll down the page, logos that survive the transition when shifted from one device to another and logos that don’t even an ounce of their charm, no matter what device you view them on.With the steep rise in mobile and tablet usage, more and more people now look for and essentially demand better mobile experience.   Flat Design Keeps Trending:Flat logo design Source  Flat design has been a trending logo design technique for years. It’s still here and we’re sure to see more of the same in the year ahead. With a balance between aesthetics and usability, it’s no wonder why flat designs have long been ruling all hearts for years. But a blog published at Cleanpix reveals that this trend will grow into something better in the time to come. We expect that flat designs will become even more flat in 2016. But it’s not just that! We’re sure that designers will explore the extremes of creativity by to bring flat logo designs breathe to life. Little extras will be added to the icons, illustrations and even typefaces to bring such flat logos breathe to life in 2016. This will ensure that the logos appear neat and clean especially on the mobile and smartphone devices.  Low Polygon Style Will Rule:  Polygon logo design Source  Having originally started from the use of 3d model designing software such as C4D, Maya & 3D studio Max, Low Polygon was written off by experts last year. But Logogarden reveals that low polygon style will is all set to make a comeback in 2016. This style hinges upon using a 3D polygon mesh that has a low polygon count to create an amazing object with simple geometric shapes. The shape can then be further modified with textures to add sophistication and visual appeal to the design. More and more designers are likely to use this famous logo design technique for their logos and icons in 2016.  Negative Space is Still Cool:Negative Space logo design Source  Yet another major hit of 2015, negative space is expected to go strong this 2016. An article published at Smashing Magazine reveals that negative space improve the legibility and readability making your logo design look unique to help you create that first killer impression on your clients, customers and even competitors. In addition, this technique lends a unique visual aura to your logo making it memorable. Given these reasons, it’s not too difficult to understand why negative space is so popular. And we are sure that it will be a major win for us in 2016 with more awesome logos created using the negative space technique. Logotype Is Here to Stay:Well, this may seem to be a pretty audacious bit of 2016 logo trend predictions, prima facie. But given that logotype is one logo design style that’s self-contained and can dramatically add tremendous brand value, we’re sure that more and more designers will focus on creating logotypes. This unforgettable identity instantly gets etched in consumer’s mind, thus creating instant brand recognition. And that’s why we believe that logotype will continue to make waves this 2016. Custom Typeface in Logos. Custom typeface was a major hit in 2015 and will continue to win all hearts in 2016. The popularity was spurred on by Google revealing its new logo with custom sans-serif typeface called “Product Sans”. Designhill reveals in its exclusive blog why the custom typeface in Google’s new logo has gone viral and why the trend of custom typeface is catching up the world’s fancy. More and more designers are trying their hands at creating custom typeface. As a result, 2016 will witness more custom typeface than ever before. Simple is Beautiful.Some things never change and simplicity is one amongst them. Industry experts have long been saying that logos with simple designs work best when it comes to branding a business. Logos with complex and intricate designs are the ones that are difficult to carry off. And that’s why we’re sure to see simpler logo designs coming to the fore in 2016. The Potential of Overlapping Elements:Yet another trend that’s all set to rock the world in 2016 is ‘overlapping trend’. Remember, the main motive of creating a logo is to represent your brand and business effectively and interestingly to catch the attention of people. Whether its an Educational logo, Business logo or a Sports logo it has to be very attractive  and interesting. And one of the best ways to make your logo interesting is to use overlapping design elements. With its three-dimensional feel and dynamic interlock, overlap elements technique makes your logos memorable and interesting in equal measures. We expect that designers will embrace the overlapping technique in 2016 add depth and motion to their logo designs. Stenciled Typography will Evolve:The stenciled typography adds a great visual appeal to the logos. The visual hierarchy of stenciled typography adds extra oodles of charm to your  design and make it memorable and endearing. And this realization is pushing a lot of designers to embrace stencil letter forms in their logos. We expect this trend to continue and grow bigger in the year 2016.So there you have it, our 2016 predictions. At this point, it’s pretty difficult to understand which trend will become the order of the day and which one of them will become extinct like dinosaurs. But we’re sure of one thing: more creativity and awesome will dominate the graphic design arena in the time to come. May we see better and beautiful designs from 2016.

Don’t listen to that voice; he couldn’t be more wrong. Having a logo is an integral part of making your brand a successful one – right up there with having high-quality products and positive referrals.  Developing a brand identity is one of the most challenging aspects for any business and industry. A logo design is the missing piece of the puzzle which can help the brands to build an identity and encourage the people to make a decision. The quality of a great design isn’t just in the colours, fonts, shapes and images used in design, but the memorability of the brand is what determines the greatness of a design. If you are still unsure how a logo design help in creating a brand identity, here are four ways in which a logo design makes a significant difference in marketing. Your logo design can make your brand recongisable A logo design is a source of instant recognition. Being the visual representation of the brand, it can trigger emotions and associations conveying the brand message to the potential customers and business prospects. They might not be able to recall your name, but they will surely be interested in knowing what you have to offer. It Grabs Attention A logo can quickly grab viewers’ attention and communicate a company’s core values in an interesting way. That short attention span – you know, the one that causes consumers to judge your business by its appearance – can work to your advantage, if you have a solid logo to speak for your company. It can represent professionalism Often businesses hire logo designer’s agency to create the visual representation of the brand. It requires extensive thinking and creativity to create a well-thought logo design which can showcase professionalism of the firm. It can boost the competition and separate your brand from all in the market. It's the Foundation of Your Brand Identity Successful branding is about telling a story that will influence customers’ emotions – plain and simple. And, while it’s true that logo design is only a part of a company’s brand, it serves as the foundation for the entire narrative on which the brand is built. Colors, tones, fonts – all of this is determined by the story you’re trying to tell, and your logo sets the stage for this story. These elements will later translate from your logo onto all of your branding materials – letterheads, business cards, landing pages, you name it – creating a concrete, marketable brand identity. It can be used as an advertising tool A logo is the face of the company which is used on every medium for marketing. From a Facebook page to a business card, each medium consists of a brand’s logo design which can help in making a brand identity. A logo design is one of the most essential elements of a business and can help in the growth of your business. In order to be successful at creating a robust design, it is important to research the market before beginning with the designing process. It Separates You From Competition Dare to be different with your logo, because your company logo tells consumers why your business is unique. Sure, maybe there are 50 other coffee shops in your city, but yours is the only one that’s committed to sustainability, and your green, earthy logo drives that message home. A well-designed company logo can communicate everything from the company’s background (professional, relaxed, fun) to their mission (entertainment, efficiency, and innovation) through the right icon or proper font. In other words, your logo is the forum to both convey your values and show consumers why you’re not like your competitors – you’re better. When you’re considering all of the factors that go into building a business, creating a logo might not seem like a top priority. “Maybe I don’t even need a logo at all,” a little voice is whispering in the back of your mind.

For every logo project you work on with new clients double your asking price until someone asks why so much? Then you might know you’ve reached your top asking price for your current network. There are a lot of variables that drive your cost: do you live and work from home? are you renting? do you own? are you living with your parents? is this a side gig?how much does your computer cost, internet access, access to programs, fonts, etc do you have a dedicated workspace with business hours that customers can walk into? You have to figure out how much you need to charge to sit down in front of your computer for an hour just to break even – now add to that how much you’d like to make per hour. Now multiply that by as many hours as you think it will take to complete the project. Now multiply that number times two because it always takes twice as long as you estimate. Someone once asked me why so much and I said because I’ve been doing this for awhile and I have a process that delivers great solutions. So great that it’s hard for clients to choose what direction to go in. They asked don’t you just use a template or clipart? I said no - do you want your logo to look like someone else’s? Clients ask for discounts because my process is so efficient and that I should pass that time savings on to them. That’s a big nope. That’s why I charge more. They’re not paying for my efficiency, they’re paying for my experience.

Despite the lapse of over a 100 years, Pepsi Cola still leads the beverages industry and continues to capture the hearts and minds of millions of consumers with its dazzling taste and refreshing qualities.The production of Pepsi Cola kicked off on 16th June 1903. The logo that was designed back then remains more or less the same with minor innovations. Caleb Bradham , the man who founded the company, basically scribbled a design which later went on to gather fame. Sensing the success of his ground breaking drink, he came up with a logo and that centered on curves.The first visible changes were made in 1940 and 1950, when red and blue colors replaced the original red logo along with a slight alteration to the shape. Another change to the logo was made in 1962 when the word “Cola” was dropped from the logo, making it just “Pepsi”. The logo again embraced some minor changes on its centennial anniversary in 1998, with Pepsi’s success reflected by a sphere which still is part of the world’s most popular logo today.  DESIGN ELEMENTS OF PEPSI LOGODespite the passage of the century and the advancement of technology and trends, the Pepsi logo design still retains its uniqueness. The mesmerising taste of Pepsi Cola can be noticed in the logo which is a combination of colors, shape and font style.Shape of the Pepsi Logo:The Pepsi logo is three dimensional in nature. It comprises of a globe painted with two completely opposite colors complimented with a swirl in the center that separates the two disks of the globe. The fonts appear along with the globe which gives the logo a simple but appealing look.Color of the Pepsi Logo:The beauty of the Pepsi logo is hidden in the use of two distinct and contrasting colors. The Pepsi font is inscribed in white. The top hemisphere’s color is red whereas the bottom one is blue in color. With red and blue combined, the logo produces an extremely tantalising spectacle that challenges the consumer to taste and become part of it.Font of the Pepsi Logo:The Pepsi logo font is simple yet elegant and prominent, thanks to the use of italicized roman type face.PEPSI LOGO REDESIGN  The Pepsi logo was revamped by New York-based Arnell Group for $1 million, much to the criticism of both the press and the consumers.

This scenario is possible only if designer mentions this clause in it’s estimate/quotation or legal binding. If designer doesn’t mentions it and still claims the ownership of logos, it will create a mess. Similarly client agrees to pay verbally and doesn’t pay for the same, designer is in disadvantage as he/she has not made the paperwork. So it’s better to get picture clear from both ends, designer as well as client. Always make everything official, always do paperwork.Logo is not registered for trademark: This is one of the most common case scenario. A lot of people think that just by creating and paying for a logo gives them ownership of it. This is not true. You must register the logo for trademark. If you don’t do it and publish it in any medium, chances are very high that your logo will be stolen and used. And in worst case scenario, someone will trademark it for their business and you won’t be able to do anything about it. I have came across some cases where someone who registered someone else’s logo for trademark and the original owner when tried to registered it, couldn’t do it as it was already registered.

How much time do you think people can afford to spend on a design where if they’re even picked they will get a fiver for it. Lets take a moment and imagine a logo as any other goods purchase. What do you think a car that costs a fiver would look like?  Now at first glance, this may look the part. However for those keen eyed amongst us it’s clearly just a toy. It looks okay at an initial glance but it’s going to be painfully disappointing if you ever need to to perform the functions of an actual car, like driving or getting you from A to B. A logo which costs a fiver is going to be much the same. It might look okay at first, but it’s not going to do any of the jobs a properly designed and well thought out logo will. Now there are some products which cost a fiver which are fit for purpose. But how do most of these get produced and sold for so little cost? They are mass produced. They are made to a template and reproduced for relatively little cost. The same applies with a fiver logo. Stock sites are full of template logo designs with an ‘insert business name here’. They are made to be generic and appeal to the broadest range of potential customers as is possible. In that way they do not contain specifics or anything which would narrow down their potential use. Many fiver logos are made using such a system. In this you wind up with a logo that is broadly unspecific and says nothing unique. It also has been and is probably in use in a variety of iterations by multiple others. A logo which is not unique to your business and says nothing specific about you is not a good logo. It’s just a general image which fails at its most basic role - to be a unique piece of visual communication. It doesn’t set you apart from others, if anything it can harm your business and brand identity by showing you as just another drop in a vast ocean of poorly thought out, lowest common denominator marketing and at best does nothing for you and at worst cheapens your brand. My advice, save your fiver, go and buy a coffee with it. After enjoying your coffee if you’re still looking to take your business forward then approach a designer or agency who specialises in logo and branding who will take the time to get to know your business and will work with you to produce a logo which actually speaks for your business. Sure, it’ll cost more than a fiver, but it’s a fiver saved plus more by not having a generic piece of branding attached to your business. Is Fiverr a good place for getting a logo design?

But a list of good designers won’t get you anywhere without knowing what context you’re asking in: The quality of the designer is important, but more important is how you can work with them. The designer-client relationship isn’t a consumer-retailer relationship, it’s not an employer-employee relationship either, it’s a weird amalgamation in which the client and designer work together. This means the two must have an understanding and rapport that extends beyond money. You might find a wonderful designer but realise you can’t work with them because your personalities clash, or perhaps they are too overbearing with their own ideas and ignore your concepts, perhaps you want a selection of ideas but the designer will only provide you one. Simply finding a good designer isn’t enough, you need to find out as much as you can about them to make sure you get what you need. Reputation tends to be based on the quality of your client-base, and you client-base is based on luck and your skill as a businessperson. On the whole, good designers get good clients; but good designers also don’t get any clients. Some of the best designers in the country are probably working dead-end jobs or have moved to other sectors for lack of opportunity. Then you have companies like Wolff Olin, who continually fail to deliver quality solutions, who are consistently getting high-end clients. Simply finding a list of “the best” is erroneous and unhelpful, the “best” designer for you is going to be different to everyone else’s. It’s a people thing, not just a quality thing.

I wasn’t able to communicate via 3d models so I switched to Photoshop and learned basic things but I used to do image editing only in the beginning.

Be it a memorable business name, captivating tagline, or logo to brand your business effectively is the foundation of all there is to come ahead of your marketing efforts. Naming Your Business the Right Way Keep your business name simple. Your customers are your first priority whom you are focusing on. Choose a name that would please and relate to them.Use emotions to create connection. Choose a subtle and connecting name that would bring nostalgia to your customers so that they may respond to your business at an emotional level.Avoid confusing business names. Avoid drafting names that are too long or confusing specially jargons or puns that only you are able to comprehend.Take SEO Into Consideration Another perspective to look at a business name is through the matching domain concept. Many times business owners have resorted to poorly constructed names. The results are company names sounding more like obscure drug manuals than actual business names. I strongly believe that the name you choose for your brand can affect the success of your business. You have a lot to consider. Not only should your company name be unique (which is a challenge in itself), but it should also match your field of business. An equally important task is to come up with an easy-to-remember word or phrase, as customers won’t spend their time trying to recall your brand name. It must be catchy and evoke positive associations with your audience.

It is important for a business to take proper consideration of their logo. Because even if the products and service are, good enough, a poor logo can revert many potential customers. Therefore, while designing a logo, it is necessary to care about the process to have a perfect logo design for your company. Due to its fine consideration, experienced and creative logo designer find difficulties in creating an attractive and engaging logo. Therefore, we are here to save you from the difficulties by highlight the mistakes that you might encounter ion your logo designing process. Dependence on fashion and trendsTrends are time bounded. It changes frequently and rapidly. This is why; the companies that focus on creating a logo with current trends might get into difficulties when it is outdated. Companies need to understand that a trendy logo might catch audience hugely but it will be restricted for some time. In the long term, the conventional style and method are durable as it is accepted with a trend and without trend. Moreover, trends can be utilized in the designing process for taking inspiration but their contribution is limited until there only. Further main elements that a logo should contain has to be related to the successful logos present in the world. Irrelevancy in the typefacesTypefaces are the most important element in logo designing. A creative logo designer should have proper knowledge of the real meanings and perspective of using a specific typeface. Designers usually never consider a typeface relevant to the company’s product or service. They add it up with no sense and it creates a blurry image of the brand in the audience mind. This is why; it is advised to take a thorough study of the different and unique typeface that will help you in selecting the best-suited text for your brand. Selecting an inappropriate color themeIt is one of the most commonly practiced mistakes a designer does. Selection of colors is a critical part as it is the source of creating the personality of a brand. Using random colors in a logo can distract your potential audience. It is because a color creates a perception of a brand that depicts its real objective. This is why; it is advised to the designers to cater to the real meanings of the logo and present that through the right choice of colors. The colors selected need to be considered in a way that it can be easily printed in a vibrant way. Reducing complexityA complex design is never a good choice for log design. It is because the more complex you create it; the audience will never understand the meaning or objective behind. This is why; it is necessary to for a designer to keep the design simple so that everyone can understand it easily. A logo should not contain a lot of colors and irrelevant typefaces merged with numerous icons just to create a complete understanding of the objective. However, a design should be simple an understandable and it should creatively define the objective needed. PlagiarismIt is the most significant mistake that is made by countless designers out there. However, unfortunately, this mistake is still becoming common day by day. A designer can take reference and inspiration from logos but coping their style is not accepted. The importance of a distinct and unique logo is necessary for every brand. Because most of the people get attracted to the designs that are creative and unique. Moreover, copying a design is to copy its aim and objective, which has to be its sole representation. While your company having different objectives should have a different style of presentation. In addition, a plagiarized design can cause you and the company in trouble. As a person can take legal action against you for copying their content. Conclusion After reading all the common mistakes, you can now care you the designing process by eliminating the mentioned ones. Make sure you critically analyze the elements that need to add in the design and the points that should be added to avoid blunders. Numerous guideline is available online just go through and start your designing process. Continue Reading William Petter",2021-03-06T15:24:56.465Z,"What are the common mistakes in logo designing?

Think of one of the most famous logos ever by design legend Milton Glaser Mr. Glaser is an incredible logo designer and certainly it’s arguably what he’s most known for, but he’s also done work for posters, publications, and more 2. Based on your question, I’m going to assume here that you are a student or fresh out of university, and you’re obviously interested in logo design. Logo designing is great. I’m a designer, I love doing them. But you’re not likely as a student or someone fresh out of university who will be able to bring in enough clientele (and therefore not enough money—- less experience = less money for your work) so soon to support your life. 3. In the case that you can’t support yourself, having a portfolio exclusively of logos will indicate to a potential future employer that you aren’t a versatile designer. They’ll want to hire someone who has a strong understanding of different areas of design in case they need to utilize those skills. Print design, packaging design, editorial design, what have you. 4. Supply, demand, and where you live will all factor into this. I can’t say which type of environment will lead to more jobs because they all have pros and cons. If you lived in a big city like NYC for example, you’d have a higher saturation of businesses seeking design help. But there would also be far more designers available to snatch up that project. You’d be competing with more designers for their business. In a smaller city, you’d less designers to compete with to get that business, but there would be less businesses, and therefore less potential income from work. In either case, this is also where having a strong understanding of multiple areas of design would come in handy in case the business wants you to do more than just their identity. 5. I personally think doing just logos would get boring. And I say that as someone who LOVES doing identity design. Being bored with what you do is no way to live, right? Those are all the reasons I can think of right now. Good luck :)",2021-03-06T15:26:05.582Z,"Can I make a good career in freelancing just by learning logo design? ",Quora

You probably won’t be getting into gradient meshes and filters and other stuff in a logo (But then again, you never know!). There will be many answers to your question on here, and it truly depends on what you’re trying to do, but if you treat AI as you would hand-drawing art, then you need to do the same thing that you’d do with a pencil in your hand: start with the basics. This means learning your simple line art first. Learn to draw, digitally - then take it from there. When you draw a logo on paper, what do you use? A pen! Or pencil. So start there.

This means you're going to have to provide a lot of information as possible. During my nine years as a senior graphic designer, I’ve seen amazing logos created when clients have answered 8 critical questions before kicking off the project. Their careful consideration and thoughtful responses enable the logo designer to blend art and science to produce logos that stand out, and, at the same time, genuinely represent a company’s values and distinctive nature. Before looking at the 8 critical questions, you should understand What types of logos there are?From there, the next step is to begin collaborating and communicating with your designer. I emphasize “designer” because some people are convinced that they can design a logo themselves. That’s a common mistake. Finding a talented logo designer will pay off in the long run. Trying to save a little bit of money and living with an inferior logo is not the best option. Instead, invest in a logo that instills confidence in your brand and your future customers. 1. HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE YOUR COMPANY’S SERVICES AND/OR PRODUCTS?WHICH LOGOS DO YOU LIKE MOST?What do you want your new logo to accomplish?Who are your main competitors?What’s the main age range of your target customer base?Do you have any color preferences or existing brand colors?Do you have any fonts the designer should consider?Do you have a slogan, tagline, or motto? Does it need to be incorporated in the logoAs I said in the beginning, logo design is a science and an art. Answering these 8 questions enables a designer to formulate the science that, in turn, supports the art. Why? Because art can’t be forced. Give your designer time to research, think, understand your business needs, sketch, and take necessary actions to create a great logo. Don’t ask a designer to come up with groundbreaking ideas in a few hours. Design is a creative process and it takes time and patience. Some designers are faster, some are more methodical, but everyone deserves reasonable deadlines. Have a look at my portfolio, you will found some great logo designs for inspiration.

That’s why some of the most outstanding logos in marketing are also the most simple ones. For example NIKE, APPLE, UBER. To give it a minimal and yet powerful look, firstly go for the theme or goal of the company. Try to decipher the meaning behind the company’s business. Is it an action, is it a thought etc. Next, go for the brand colour. It is very important to have a connection between a company and its logo. So choose the prominent brand colour as a backdrop of the logo. Try and figure out the symbols associated with the business. For example, the silhouette of Mickey Mouse. Take the power of the name. Yes, a brand’s name reflecting in the logo, is always a good idea. Just like UBER. Unless the name is too long. Then maybe you can go for initials, like ttt for Terribly Tiny Tales. The right thing here is to delete the non-required information and go for the direct approach to figure out what strikes the best for the company. It could be a name, a symbol, a place, an idea etc. If you think, all these are too general, then go for the out of the box ideas like OYO, the logo is inspired by the famous Lord Jagganat, with the Os representing the eyes & Y representing the Nose. I hope this helps. :) Continue Reading",2021-03-06T15:31:28.187Z,"What is the minimalist approach in logo design? ",Quora

Know the rules and principles of logo design Now that you know what a logo is supposed to do, and what it should represent, you now must learn what makes a great logo aka; the basic rules and principles. For further reading on the principles of great logos I highly recommend reading these logo design tips before continuing. 3. Learn off other’s successes and mistakes Successful Logos Now you know what the rules are, you can distinguish the difference between a good and a bad logo. Knowing which logos have succeeded, and why, gives an insight into what makes a good logo. logo design mistakes For example, let’s look at the classic Nike Swoosh (shown above). This logo was created by Caroline Davidson in 1971 for only $35, yet it’s still a strong, memorable logo, effective without colour and easily scalable. It is simple, fluid and fast, and represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek Goddess of victory, Nike (something perfect for a sporting apparel business). The Nike logo is just one of many great designs, think about other famous brands that you know about and check out their logos. What makes them successful? For more quality, lesser known logos I recommend browsing LogoPond or visiting your local book store or library and reading some books on logo design. The Not So Successful Logos We can also learn from logos that have not been too successful, such as the ones on the right of the above picture. Some more very bad logos can be seen in the post is your logo design phallic? As seen in that post, some logos can depict things that may not always be noticeable to the designer (as in the middle logo above) or they could just be plain bad design, as in the logo to the right (above). 4. Establish your own logo design process Now that we know what a logo is, what the principles and rules of logo design are and what makes a successful logo, we’re now prepared to begin the design process. This is the hardest part of these 5 tips, and is a whole topic in itself. Each person’s process is different and experience is usually the key factor when creating your own logo design process. For an example of a well established method, take a look at David Airey’s design process. If you ever get stuck before or during your design process, I’ve provided some tips on How To Boost Your Creativity. 5. Learn the software and complete the logo After you have got your design process sorted out, it is usually a good time to begin mastering your software (here’s a selection of Adobe Illustrator tutorials for reference). But before I get to that, I want to point out that Step 4 and Step 5 overlap, as it’s a catch 22 situation – you can’t design a logo by just hopping straight onto the computer, nor can you complete a logo design without knowing your software (the Adobe Creative Suite is a popular choice with professional designers).",2021-03-06T15:36:31.499Z,"What are the little known software tips about logo design?

Facilities for young children might focus on the play aspect of learning, with the use of pictograms of children and loose typography, while institutions for the older students would employ more professional logos. While it might be tempting to try and find a clever or euphemistic logo, often simple logos – even just a typographically presented logo of the institution’a name – are better and more effective. If you're set on a euphemistic logo, try and find someone who will help you develop an action-oriented logo: I.e.

You looked at it as a fun gig (which it likely was) and focussed on being creative and possibly had a thought of ‘local fame’ wander across the back of your mind (believe me, seeing one’s work splashed across the front of a building always gives one a slight frisson). But, you never thought about the business side of this. Problem #3. You’re about to drop a price on someone who vaguely thought about paying you a nominal amount and whose business model is all about keeping costs down (restaurants have incredibly tight margins). And, now that you’ve done the work, you’re proud of it; people are telling you that it’s great and that you should charge a lot for it. And, you’re thinking numbers that you’ve never contemplated before. The reality is that everybody starts somewhere and usually never takes the business of this seriously at the beginning. So… Figure out how long it took you to do this—in real time spent on the project. Include meetings with the owner. Decide on an hourly rate and multiply one by the other. Right now, you don’t know what you don’t know—does your logo violate any existing trademarks; can your design be easily screen-printed, embroidered, projected, sculpted etc. so your rate should reflect that there’s a lot that you’re not delivering that a professional would. Add up the costs of paper, paint, mounting board, gas (or bus fare) etc. and mark it up 15%. Deduct the cost of free food that the restaurant (minus tax and tip) gave you. Add it together and you have your price. And you have a rationale for it that you can defend to the owner if they balk. Don’t sell yourself cheap but don’t charge in with currency symbols twinkling in your eyes. Danielle, also look at this as a cheap bit of schooling. Always discuss money up front. That way, there’s no nasty surprises and you won’t sour the relationship down the line. Consider everything that you put into this—time to research, time to sketch, time to finalise and present, all materials, the value of your software, the value of your computer and printer. These are all costs that you have to pay and will have to be tracked. Remember that you’ll have to pay tax on the money you receive—the restaurant owner will (or should be) deducting the expense on their taxes so in spite of the casualness of your arrangement, this is a real business deal. Finally, if you enjoy this sort of work consider going to school. Yes, you can teach yourself by buying books and reading and paying solid attention to graphic design out in the real world but it will take a long time and there will be huge gaps in your education because, you don’t know what you don’t know. If you’re going to continue to freelance, research pricing, work out an hourly rate and practice saying it in the mirror—”I charge a meeeelion dollars an hour”. That way you won’t stumble when asked your rate. Hope this helps. *It’s a real book and absolutely worth buying (and joining the organisation if you’re in the US) if you’re serious. A ‘meeeelion dollars’! Seriously, everybody who suggests that you charge some significant percentage of the Graphic Artists’ Guild: Pricing and Ethical Guidelines* suggestion is unrealistic. You aren’t a professional. This means that you’re not likely to know all of the services a professional would normally provide when creating a corporate ID. You were likely hired because you showed some ideas that appealed to the owner but since you aren’t a professional, you’re unlikely to charge professional prices. None of this has any bearing on the quality of your idea or your ability to draw it out in  Continue Reading",2021-03-06T15:37:43.734Z,"What price should I go with my logo design when I’m inexperienced and not very knowledgeable with logo designs?

Many companies who adorned themselves with such new logos full of graphical and visual hindrances, have already revoked their trendy side steps, and returned to sheer simplicity and even new-found flatness. So the key factor to creating 3D logo design is to keep in mind that one day you or the owner might want to put it in plain and cheap 2D on a pen, a memory stick, or a coffee cup, in just white or black ink. Can your nifty 3D design stand this petrifying printing test ? And how about the visibility and recognizability of your 3D designed logo among other screaming and shouting ads, on a crammed photo background, as an app icon on a cluttered smartphone screen with a background of two babies in a tub ? Yes, the logo seemed very nice when presented on a pristine piece of foam board, or as a centerpiece in a full-blown corporate video... But there comes a time when you need to used it in a plain cheap, quick and dirty manner – how well will it survive ? As promised, some simple tips: [Edit – See this Quora question as well for more thoughts and samples: Why most icons are static instead of animated or interactive?] When the logo will be animated, make sure it will remain strong in all view angles. E.g. a revolving logo for a financial institution with an arrow going up, will suddenly be the laughing stock when seen from the rear (arrow going down...)How beautifully crafted a 3D shape might be, it will literally render as a piece of boredom when lit unattractively. A good taste and feeling for lighting can make even the simplest bevel show as a dramatic 3D masterpiece.A design in 3D will suggest depth, and depth will catch light and cast shadows. Any lighting angle you choose will be somewhat expected in the environment surrounding the 3D logo as well. Can you account for that ?Don't do marble. Don't go there, don't even try it. It's the first thing everyone tries, when using 3D software for the first time. It's the Comic Sans in 3D Design.Now, can someone tell me how to stop this list formatting ?

A logo in clear form, revamps the entire look and feel of a growing or thriving company. What to keep in mind when creating an impactful logo for your business For some, a logo may just be another design that is attached to the doors of a company. That is far from true. A logo, to help your company stand out among the rest, needs to be created in the most unique and timeless way possible. This is something I had considered when I was looking for the best team in logo design Australia. The team of professionals got together and discussed every little detail with me. To create a timeless logo, you also need the perfect team for the job using the best techniques possible. They should Be open-minded with ideas and welcoming towards their clients’ visionBe very innovative with their workAllow the clients to be invested with the team during the whole process if needed beAre good with time managementRelate to the incentives of the client’s needs and wants rather than just to get the job doneCommunicate with the team and client throughoutMake room for changesResearch and find inspiration; coming up with one of a kind designsTips to create simple but good logo designing techniques 1. Less Is More Viewers are becoming a big fan of minimalistic designs, this is the reason why minimal and flat designs are dominating the market. The main purpose of your logo is to curate your brand story to targeted audience, therefore you should make sure the logo you are designing with minimal elements is practical and goal-oriented. Minimalistic logo designs are easy to understand and thus are more likely to be remembered for a longer time. They are more like a nice pair of jeans, they go well with everything; no matter whether they are used on stationary designs or website. 2. Hand-Drawn People love everything that owns a humanly touch. Hand-drawn graphics started their journey in the graphic design field in 2016 and have gained more ground in 2017. Usually used in food and drinks industry, hand-drawn logos are unique, modern, quirky, credible, and charismatic. Handmade designs are a bit labor-intensive and difficult to work with when using on the digital platforms, yet they feel fresh and human. If you think your project is worth that much effort and you can handle such designs even on the digital mediums, then go for it. 3. Line Art One of my personal favorites, Line art graphics are counted among the most creative designing styles in the industry. They give you enough room to show up your creativity when paired with the negative space. This type of designs uses an even thickness of lines to create a design usually with a single color. If your client is looking for a simple, sleek and sophisticated design, try line art graphics. This gives a fine combo of image and text which enables to convey brand message conveniently. 4. Letter-Stacking When used well with negative space, these letter-stacking graphics grabs viewers’ attention and tempt them to stop and peek at the design to crack what has been written. It amazes people; the more they are involved with the design, the more they will like it. Besides, when you have longer text to use in your design, you can try this style. Make sure to choose your font wisely. Bold, legible fonts are consider-worthy here. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T15:43:27.410Z,"What are some simple but good logo designing techniques? ",Quora

I don’t even have a go-to font in general—though admittedly I do get a kick out of trying Founders Grotesk.  Tailor-made design The purpose of logo design is to craft an identity that is tailor-made, bearing just the right connotations. Now, although there is more and more variety to be found in the free fonts market, and typefaces like Open Sans are quire fantastic, it’s strongly recommended not to use free fonts for logos. After all, can you really be sure that the free font market has exactly the right font for your logo? It would be nice if that is the case, but even then, you want your logo to look unique, rather than look like something everyone has free access to. Designing a logo out of materials that are freely available to everyone obviously undermines its exclusivity. In this sense, graphic design is not only about communicating the connotations of the brand properly, but about upholding the brand’s integrity. Would you build a house out of potentially mediocre, overused materials, or the most durable, strongest materials the market has to offer? A logo is hugely important for a company or product. Don’t settle for free materials if those materials are not going to be the best choice for your logo.  Sans-serif typefaces In terms of go-to—but not free—typefaces, here are some sans-serifs I may try first:  Aktiv Grotesk, Avenir Next Pro, Founders Grotesk, Haas Unica, Harmonia Sans, Museo Sans, Proxima Nova, Walsheim  Don’t stop thinking It should be said however, that I never just try a bunch of typefaces that have become part of my standard routine. There used to be this saying: When in doubt, use Helvetica. It’s a mentality that I came to call anti-design. Why? Because at this point you are simply following a protocol, rather than looking for the typeface that fits the needs of the product, company or message exactly. This is also why one tends to refrain from typefaces that can be acquired for free, because what are the chances that one of those limited options fit the needs of your logo exactly? Don’t blindly follow protocols, but think deeply about what the brand ought to communicate. Don’t look for “beautiful fonts”, but type that carries the right meaning.  Connotations of the brand So, first start thinking about what kind of connotations you want your logo to convey. Try out font testers like the font previews on MyFonts or on the typeface’s foundry website and type in the name of your logo, take a screenshot and put it underneath or next to the symbol you designed to see how it looks. When you have found the typeface that fits your needs exactly, purchase the font you need for the logo, which will be around $15–35. You can easily calculate that cost into the price your client pays for the logo design.  The risk of go-to fonts Let me further emphasize that it’s bad to have go-to fonts. I don’t actually remember ever having used a typeface more than once for logos. I’m not actively preventing that from happening, and the more logos you design, the harder it will be to prevent using the same typeface twice. But the risk of having go-to fonts for logo design is that you do a lot of logos using the same typefaces. This reeks of anti-design. Nevertheless, experience will certainly teach you that certain typefaces work well for certain logos. So I guess a capable logo designer has many go-to lists of fonts for different needs. Experienced logo designers tend to build up a catalogue of fonts so they have a lot of freedom in what they can try out and see if the style and connotations are appropriate for the brand.  Serif typefaces Although I don’t remember ever having used any of these for logos, here are some serif typefaces—again, not free—that could be worth considering:  Adobe Caslon Pro, Baskerville 120, Bulmer Display, Calluna, Caxton, Farnham Display, Le Monde Livre, Tisa Pro  Cheap, professional typefaces I can also recommend checking up on MyFonts frequently to see what fonts they offer at a reduced fee, as many typefaces are reduced by up to 90% upon being released on MyFonts, so sometimes you can get a whole typeface with a full range of weights and styles for $12–35. Have a look at their Special Offers page, as some of their offerings are seriously underpriced upon introduction to MyFonts.",2021-03-06T15:45:00.825Z,"What are your go to free fonts as a logo designer?

I often tell people if they have a $10 business, by all means, get a $10 logo! If you do not think it is important to have a quality logo, then perhaps you don’t really understand what a great logo and identity package can do for a business. Here are a few things to consider that an experienced designer is thinking about when they create a company’s identity: Attention - When you pay an online freelancer, you are paying them for the time they put into the effort. If a freelancer charges $50 an hour, you get one hour’s worth of attention. That’s complete, from concept to execution to delivery. You are worth 1 hour to them. Remember there are professional designers available who have years of experience helping businesses successfully position themselves in the marketplace. They want you to succeed because you have invested in them. Contrast - You are competing for eyeballs in a visually saturated world. Will your logo be different enough to stand out in your industry (from anything, really), or does it look like any other business that offers the same products or services? Timeless - Not trendy. Design is often a tool used to look contemporary and not outdated. The trouble comes when you latch onto a design trend that looks good now, but leaves you looking outdated in five years. Remember when mullet hairdos were a thing? How about avocado-colored kitchen appliances? Remember when every “new” logo had a sweeping “swashy” line in it? Make sure you aren’t anchoring yourself to a time period that makes you look old before your time. Targeted - A professional designer will have you, your audience, and your value offering in mind. It is important that you feel good about the logo you use, but it’s REALLY important that your customers feel good about it. Trusted - A logo becomes a shorthand reference in the memory of the public for what you value. If you cut corners on your identity because you think it is a waste of money or just a novelty, you will be perceived that way. That will count against you even if you believe your product, service or idea is superior. Quality - Will it go on a website? How about a business card? Maybe the side of a truck? Perhaps in black and white? Is it pixel or vector based? How big can I make it? How small? An experienced designer is considering all of these things when they are creating an amazing and unique identity for your business. So, have I convinced you? Remember it is a professional designer’s job to add value to your business - and many of us take that responsibility very seriously.

A perfectly crafted logo design can establish communication with their potential customers. However, if not done correctly, it can send a wrong message and can harm your business.  Businesses nowadays are investing vast portions of their budget in creating visual tools which can engage and interact with the audience. An exceptional design doesn’t only engage the customers with the brand; it sends the right message to the audience and influences their decision to become regular customers. Designing a logo is more than using the right colours, shapes and fonts; it is about crafting an image which can communicate your brand message to the audience. So without further ado, let’s discuss five ways to build a successful logo design. Simplicity adds sophisticationThe basic trait of a successful logo design is its simplicity. Simple designs are recognisable and stick to the minds of the viewers. Take the example of some of the known names in the market—Nike, Apple, Mercedes, Audi, all have one thing in common—a simple logo design which is recognised by the world. Adding unnecessary details to the design can alienate the viewers from the message of your company, so make sure to use simple designs and make your business recognisable. You design must reflect your brandAs said above, your logo is not simply an image; it is a reflection of your brand. Think of it as a mirror. Your logo design must be able to describe every aspect of your business and inspire your audience to take action. Your logo design should contain the essence of the business which is essential to make an impression on your prospects. Timeless logosA design that is independent of design trends in the market is timeless logos. They are unique and doesn’t require much tweaking even after decades of being created. Take the example of the brands mentioned above. All these brands are unique and they have been tweaked very little since they’ve been launched in the market. VersatilityBusiness logos are used in many different mediums; therefore, they need to be scalable. You need to make sure that your logo can be changed in different sizes and colours without losing the essential details in the design. There are many designing companies such as logo design Australia, logo inn and more which you can hire to create a perfect logo for your company. Avoid using clichésThe uniqueness of a design can make it more memorable for the customers. Try giving your design a personal touch while keeping it trendy. Make your company look professional artistic and creative to make an impression on the viewers. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T15:52:13.255Z,"What is the best way to go about getting a logo designed?

If you are looking for tips on how to run keyword research using free tools, check this step by step guide: Simple, Proven Keyword Research Formula to Find Relevant Keywords with FREE Tools It shows you how to find keywords using tools such as Keyword Planner, Google Trends, Uber Suggest, SEMRush and more, as well as how to select the ones that are less competitive, and therefore that would give you bigger chance of getting to page one. One keyword research tool I like to currently use is simply Google’s own auto-suggest. The phrases you get on auto-complete as you type your query:  They are there for a reason - as they are used by other people when searching for a similar query. So you know you will get traffic from Google, if you rank for any of these phrases. Another plus of this method is, that you won’t be targeting the same keywords everyone else would be targeting - which would be the case if you used keyword tools. Everyone is using the same tools, so everyone gets the same keyword results, right? If you want to stand out and outrank competitors, definitely go for Google auto-suggest. Also test each of the phrases to see how the results look like. If there are millions of other websites competing for the same phrase, you will have much bigger challenge of getting to page #1:  In the case of “logo designer online” keyword, there are 770 million other websites competing for the same phrase. So you would start at the bottom, trying to climb up - that’s just not worth it. Much better approach would be to pick a more specific keyword, that still gets decent searches, but is less competitive. You can find it by digging a little deeper. What I like to do is to take my base keyword, let’s say “logo designer online” and add a single letter after it to see additional results:  I start with “a” to see the results, and if any of them can be applied to my business, I then click the phrase to analyse the search results:  Keyword “logo maker online and free download” is less competitive, yet it still has 303 million results, which is way too many to target. I’d narrow the search further by adding subsequent alphabet letters ‘b-c-d-e-’ and so on to the phrase and see the results. I didn’t find any more specific suggested phrases, so I decided to try a different base keyword. I scrolled down to the bottom of the results page to see other suggested keywords there:  I opted for “circle logo design maker” as the most specific out of those:  It has 274 million results, which we can narrow down further:  I added ‘a’ at the end to see additional ideas. I really liked “circle logo design maker arrow abstract”:  It’s much more specific - which means it would be used by someone looking for a specific logo, and therefore most likely to buy [they are not browsing for logo ideas, they already know what logo they want, and therefore are more likely to place an order]. Additionally, this keyword phrase is much less competitive which gives you much better chance of getting to page #1:  It has 7.7 million results - which is perfect. You can save it in your file, and continue the search the same way until you have a satisfactory selection of keywords. Make sure also to analyse the results on the first page to see if the websites already ranking at the top provide logo services [it would mean it’s a transactional keyword, which is perfect for you, as you sell logo services]. If the websites at the first page provide information - such as articles on how to design a logo, or free logo design software review guides - it would mean this particular keyword is informational, and you, as a business providing services, won’t get ranked by Google at the top.

Your logo will represent your organization. For many products out there, it is the distinguishable feature that many people recall --- not the name, not the product itself but the logo. Some examples include Apple and its iconic apple with a bite taken, Nike and its check logo, and Mcdonalds and its infamous Golden Arches. Put in the hands of the right marketers, a logo is a powerful tool for building your company’s brand identity. Logos can be as creative and expressive as you want. They must, however, encompass a few underlying principles to make it unique and relevant to your mission and vision. When creating a logo, don’t consider it as just a branding task. It must be done with the company’s growth in mind. Regardless of your business niche, your logo has to stand out. It will be competing with different brands so you need to ensure your logo sticks to the minds of your consumers. If you’re a fairly new company, it’s important that you gain an edge over your competitors as soon as you can. Your marketing strategy, of course, comes into play here, but so does your visual communication skills. Visual communication tools like logos, business cards, and others help you instantly connect with your audience. Many marketers fail to give visual communication importance. This is when businesses that pay attention to such tactics get the edge that I was talking about. While there are many visual communication cues and tools, logos do hold a special place in the mix. Not discarding others' importance, but logos helps visualize the company's beliefs, personality, and approach to the audience while giving them something to remember the brand by. The central concept of logo designing is to get an effective logo design that communicates the brand message, brand name, and to an extent, the brand's philosophy to the target audience. Some principles would help you design a professional logo. You could also get a custom logo design done. Here, I have listed down some of the key factors to consider when designing your logo. 1. Use colors strategically: Colors have an important role to play in logo design. They have an immediate impact on brand perception and evoke certain feelings. For instance, red generally symbolizes anger, love, passion, or energy. Hence, if you have a business that provides dating services, a red logo might be an effective way of attracting individuals looking for such apps (like Tinder). Additionally, studies found that red provokes hunger and appetite which is why many fast-food chains have red on their logos: Mcdonalds, Wendy’s, etc. Blue, on the other hand, gives off an air of calm and intelligence. It also gives a feeling of friendliness. This is the reason social media giants like Facebook have a blue logo and look so welcoming. And the list goes on. 2. Make sure it looks good in black and white: Keep this thought in your head even before you start making your logo. You will advertise your brand on different mediums like newspapers, leaflets, magazines, digital platforms, and more. If any platform requires you to submit your logo colorless, it should still make an impact on your customers. If you have an impressive logo in colors but it doesn't look good in black and white, you should probably reconsider the design. 3. Make sure your logo is memorable: Don’t settle for a generic logo. It is very important to create unique yet relevant logos to stand out in your niche. Make memorable logos that customers can easily associate with the services you provide. For best results, get a custom logo design tailored to all of your requirements as it will give you that edge you need to survive in the market.",2021-03-06T15:59:56.144Z,"What are the Basic tools used in Logo Design?

Yes, it was likely designed, but technically it is a logotype, not a logo, much like Google. What makes YETI a memorable, desired brand (and effective logotype) is their insistence on finest quality, a promise to perform that is always backed up, and their marketing integrity.

For instance, YETI uses their name in a specific typeface as their symbol. To add a set of antlers or crossbow next to the name as a logo would weaken the brand more than strengthen it. Yes, it was likely designed, but technically it is a logotype, not a logo, much like Google. What makes YETI a memorable, desired brand (and effective logotype) is their insistence on finest quality, a promise to perform that is always backed up, and their marketing integrity. No blowout sales, just a great product at a premium cost and a pricing position that automatically characterizes any other competitor as cheap goods or a knockoff. Logos cannot do that without the whole of the company maintaining the integrity of the brand consistently and without fail. It helps that their company name is short enough to serve as a clean logo and the name also has no common intrinsic meaning or definition (it is actually the term for a mythical hairy Himalayan creature). Their marketing consistently depicts rugged outdoor settings and creates the image of a nature loving, adventurous, outgoing lifestyle that many people would like to embrace—if only by embracing their products. Their marketing and distribution channels support that image. A well designed logo helps unify the best attributes of a brand. If the brand name is long or the product line/service complicated, the logo makes it easier to reflect or remind you of that brand quickly and simply—like the asterisk for Wal*Mart or the smiley-arrow for Amazon. FedEx has a “hidden” arrow as a logo in their name (in every language, too), but it is not that arrow which makes the brand valuable or effective. It is the people, the service, the reputation, the promise, the integrity that makes the brand strong. Logos do not make a brand valuable or memorable. People with integrity do.",2021-03-06T16:01:06.655Z,"Why has logo designing become a necessity for a brand? ",Quora

Don't choose anything too weird, and please don't use Arial, Trebuchet, Times New Roman or Comic Sans. This is not going to replace a real branding which is about much more than 'your logo', but it's giving you something to put in the top left space of your website until you have a product, and thus hopefully revenue or funding. The truth of the matter is that if you want professional work, you will have to pay for it. I get paid to do the work you are asking for, and I build my portfolio that way.  The only people possibly in need of unpaid portfolio-building are students or career changers, both of which will not serve you with the same level of professional behavior and knowledge as a fully fledged designer.

Full-time employment in transcription is largely a thing of the increasingly distant past, just as typing pools are. You can get started in transcription easily. You need a decent computer with a reasonable internet connection, and any of a variety of free or inexpensive software. A good set of headphones is important, and that’s really it. Some folks prefer specialized foot pedals to control playback, but most people these days just use keyboard hotkeys. Payment is often via PayPal so an account is important. However — having the gear will not make you a good or successful transcriptionist. The first real hurdle is simple your level of skill in the English language. The sad truth is that an astonishing number of people brought up speaking English are in fact absolutely terrible at writing English. If you can’t spell properly, if you don’t understand basic English grammar, you’re pretty much doomed. Beyond that an amazing number of people don’t know how to review and correct their own work, or research names and terms in Google. You don’t need to be an English major, but if you can’t write clean and correct English, transcription will be a disappointment for you. Transcription is also really hard work. You are paid for the work you actually do, and so to do well you need to invest a lot of time in sustained concentration. Sitting at a computer, listening to (often very) less than perfect recordings, and typing, for hours on end. Lastly, you need to be reliable. A very great many contractors might have all of the above skills but still can’t be counted on to finish what they start, or even to tell us when they abandon a piece of work. Actions like this can quickly reduce the amount of work you get, because you are less trusted than others. You will never get rich working in transcription, but you can make a decent amount of money, from your own home, on the schedule you prefer to work. We work with folks who are awesome at it and make a living doing it, but they work hard for it. And we work with others who are great but do this work part-time, in the time they have available.

I’ve also gotten work from various other companies that I didn’t stay with because they didn’t pay too well. But since 2010 I’m only transcribing dictation from four doctors, two psychologists and two psychiatrists, and listening to ONE person speak clearly, on a top-notch microphone, beats out all the other transcription work I’ve done where I had to deal with bad microphones, people mumbling, too far away from the mic, bad accents, background noise, people speaking at the same time, etc. That can be VERY, VERY frustrating to the point of crying, cursing until the air is blue, wanting to smash things and wanting to tear out your hair. No kidding, that’s how terrible some transcription work is. I’ve gotten all my clients on my own, not through any transcription websites, with the result being that I’m paid pretty well. I make sure in transcribing for the doctors that I bold any discrepancy in their dictation I come across so they can check it. I’ll correct minor grammatical errors without changing the meaning of what they’re saying, and I get their work back to them within 24 hours with the very rare exception. And it’s all so much easier now with digital audio files and Express Scribe (which can be downloaded for free), rather than dealing with couriers, cassettes, transcribing machines, etc. I absolutely love the freedom of working at home. I can attend to errands and appointments on a weekday afternoon, sleep late which I do all the time, and pretty well work at my convenience, within reason. For me it’s ideal.

Outsourced Healthcare is slowly taking different perspectives in the form of medical coding, scribing, etc Now comes the second approach. Many doctors and small clinics do outsource to a small team, their medical related work. If one is lucky enough, there is a possibility of getting paid more. Remember, this is very tough, but not at all impossible. A small calculation: If you work in an outsourced company, Your earnings can be fixed depending on the lines you type, for example you are paid around 2 cents per line. If you work for a small clinic for US, there can be estimated earnings of around 6 to 10 cents per line If you are able to produced 15000 lines, there can be 300$ earning from an Indian company and this is after profits and overhead expenses of the company. And the same can be 900$ earning if you can work directly for a doctor from abroad (at 6 cents per line, in India). This is for 6 cpl, do the math from 7 to 10 cpl. Do your math! This is not a magic formula, but just a math, and analyze! There are still more possibilities. This is just an example. No work is ordinary, nothing is lower; but how we do it, matters!!

The ability to use VR tools / platforms, familiarity with EMR will all contribute to ones ability to sustain during this grim phase. EMR even though is a mandatory tool for healthcare centers to implement has not quite impressed most of them due to the complexities involved and the greater time it takes for one to operate the same.

The cool thing about transcribing is the minimal stuff needed. I don’t need a vehicle. I don’t even need clothes, really. Just a little place to put my computer and a quiet comfortable place to sit for lengthy periods of time…with a window that can see the sky. I go crazy without a window. I’ve tried many chairs and workstations over the years, and have been using a $15 Coleman folding campchair for a couple years now. I think it’s a winner! It’s even got a cup holder! I need a computer, a keyboard, a foot pedal, headphones, and an Internet connection. And then a few programs to control the audio and something like MSWord or even Google Docs. (I use MSWord, because it has more gizmos that are easier for me to play with than Google’s.) If I lost EVERYTHING, I could be back up and working with less than $1000. That’s pretty cool. I’ve never had a job where I could be this productive with tools this cheap! Get files. Transcribe. Get files. Transcribe. Get files. Transcribe. Get files… . So, to break it down — the ‘Get files’ part. This can sometimes be a little tricky. The easiest way to make a living at this is to pass the tests for a handful of agencies and then pick and choose which ones to work for. I tried doing that for a bit, but I drove myself crazy and kept mixing up templates and style guides, so I settled on one agency. I still have several contracts with other agencies, but their rates suck. Sometimes, the agency I like doesn’t have files to give me. When that drags on for a month or so, scribing becomes more of a lifestyle, and not just a job. . When the agency work is slow, I pester people. Hey! Give me some files! I’m jonesing over here! I just do it. It’s not about getting paid. I just have to transcribe stuff. ‘Hi. My name is Matthew. I’m addicted to transcribing audios,’ — which is, by the way, a terrible cold-call introduction…but it actually worked once. I can’t take files. People have to give them to me… I do think about it sometimes, just cyberstalking some content producer who needs transcripts…just follow them for a few months and then dump an assload of transcripts in their inbox and run away…creepy, right? But it kinda goes that way. I find somebody that I think is interesting, and I email them. GIVE ME YOUR FILES! And then I transcribe them for free, so there’s zero strings attached. And then when there’s other files coming in, I run away and they probable are left a little stunned as to what just happened and what to do with the mess I’ve left in my wake. It’s really easy to be low on cash, but be swimming in files. It’s glorious! I’m never without work to do. Never. Projects succeed or die depending on whether I put in my effort. There’s entire databases of audios waiting for me. Just most of it doesn’t involve getting paid. The Smithsonian Digital Volunteers needs scribes, y’all. Getting files isn’t hard. Getting paid is more tricky, if you care about that. I probably should add ‘get paid’ to my formula, but it’s just simpler this way. I’ve tried to quit. I can’t. Somebody really needs to stage an intervention here.  The second part — Transcribe. How the hell does anybody do this job‽ — (behold, the mighty interobang.) I really don’t know. I have no training. I’m not even sure how I’ve passed the tests I’ve passed. My highest education is in gunsmithing, which likely prepared me for the tediousness. I took a semester of typing in high school — where I barely graduated. I was an army medic for several years and never did anything like this until I took that first test 11 years ago. I was desperate to get out of the nursing home and do something different. It makes no sense. None. In 2008, right as the economy was going crunch, a coworker just came back from vacation and said something like his sister’s husband’s aunt’s neighbor’s daughter was doing this thing, and here’s a website. I had zero idea what general transcription was about. I was thinking medical. I was only typing around 50wpm (I lied on the application…figured I’d get faster.) I just read the style guide and took the test. It was a 60-minute audio. It took me like 11 hours. (Same file today, it’d take maybe 2–3 hours.) I know over a dozen people who took that same test. They didn’t pass. My wife took it, and it still haunts her. 11 years later! (It was a mildly stressful story about a divorce.) But I got in and we were able to cut back to part-time and could stay at home more. I started off with reality TV shows back when they were booming and on every channel. That was SO different. I’ve only watched one episode of all the shows I’ve transcribed for. Bamazon. What I saw on my end was soo much better and more interesting, but I only worked in certain bits and pieces and didn’t get a chance to see the whole picture, just what they were referring to…lots of stuff I wanted to see. It was the only show I thought it was going to be a really cool show and they killed it with the editing…like bad kill, not good kill…oh, English, you just slay me. Anyway, it was really disappointing. If you’ve watched U.S. reality TV shows in the 2008–2012 time period, my fingers were in quite a few of those. Pitbulls & Parolees (Not just a show. They’re really legit.), Storm Chasers, Peter Perfect, Locked Up and a BUNCH of others…I just can’t remember their names because it was silly. In 2012, I quit the nursing home and transcribing has been my sole means of income for 7 years. I moved into corporate U.S. and government. IBM, Intel, USDA, and a bunch of other alphabet soup agencies. In 2015, I was with an agency based in New York City — investment bankers, marketing research, media production, life coaches — I kinda had a mental breakdown here. Some of that life coaching was really timely, but not very helpful. Then Trump started getting loud. Bad, bad time to have my ears in New York. So, I put my ears in Canada for work. It was Mental Health Month in Canada. Really, really helped me fix my head. I love Canada. (Y’all should have heard that global moment of silence after the election, and all the chatter afterward. It’s heartbreaking.) Today, somehow, I’m transcribing for classical literature professors and PhD researcher folks. (Most of my agency work is research institute/thinktank oriented. It’s a cool agency.) I’d love to be in a thinktank, but scribing for ‘em is pretty cool too…sometimes. It’s getting kinda stale. There’s just a little too much of the U.S. in Canada sometimes. I try to keep my ears up north with the First Nations and Inuit, in the fly-in areas. My ears really like it up there. I’m working on some white people garbage right now…can’t quit my ‘day job’ just yet. There’s white people, but then there’s white people. At this point, all around the globe from Australia, South Africa, India, Hong Kong and anywhere people speak English, there’s little bits of me everywhere — in marketing, medical, law, focus groups for products that you see on the shelves and in the car lots, behavioral research, social research, transcripts to create emotional heat maps of meetings with big-name corporations…and on and on. I’ve just been making it all up as I go. Ten years, virtually no feedback as to what I’m doing is right or wrong. It’s only in the last year we’ve had any QA. We haven’t even had any proofers. After I hit send, it goes to the client through the server. Turns out, I’m just a mediocre scribe. …I’m really a burned-out scribe. The voices keep me awake many nights and turn me into a weeping heap at unexpected times…victims of kidnapping and brutal gangrape, residential schools, holocaust survivors, victims of human trafficking…it gets heavy. There’s no therapy support or medical for independent contractors.  It’s really as challenging as you want to make it. I like challenges. Like, ‘Can I transcribe from a hammock with a customized footpedal?’ Yes, yes, I can. Being in pain is definitely a huge challenge when transcribing. I tried standing, kneeling, squatting, you name it. The most challenging part of the hammock — staying awake. But then challenges like, ‘Can I transcribe the rough footage for an ENTIRE documentary?’ ‘Can I make captions?’ ‘How do I type faster?’ ‘How can I be more productive?’ I’m constantly changing how my workstation operates. There’s at least a dozen changes I make every day in how I do things to try to produce a better product in a shorter time. (There’s a bit of a factory worker mindset in my upbringing, methinks.) I’m adding in another programmable keyboard this coming week, because the two I’m using right now are annoying me. I don’t sit still very well. Transcribing is a very weird thing for someone with ADHD. When I’m transcribing, it’s a mad flurry of intense focused activity. It’s highly meditative for me. But it’s tedious, boring, and monotonous — that’s why I get paid. Very, very, very few people seem to have the patience. Myself included. I hate being plugged into the machine all the time. I do everything in my power to decrease the amount of time I have to sit here thinking somebody else’s thoughts…I tend to come to Quora to remember who I am. Writing kinda gets the junk out. But sometimes when I write here it’s like, “Who’s words are these‽ I don’t use these words!” Sometimes when I pull the headphones off and start talking to my wife, I realize I’m acting like a whole other person. It’s really not good sometimes. Trying to explain where I’m coming from is a bit of a nightmare, because sometimes it’s from places like Kangiqsualujjuaq.  I’ve also been preparing transcripts for editors all these years, but now I’m learning how to use the editing tools. I’ve made many modifications to the stardard transcript template. What I can produce is better than Democracy Now, FOX News or Stephen Colbert. C’mon guys, you’ve been sitting on that file for hours. What the hell ya doing? Why does the text look like crap or just not useful? Journalists and production companies pay me to make their transcripts…I know what they get takes a ton of work to make everything look nice. There’s no easy way — or so people assume. I’m cranky that my transcripts keep getting hidden in some harddrive somewhere and forgotten about, or stuff gets published with typos I didn’t make. The ease of use of my master template makes editing a breeze. I haven’t been able to find the editor that really knows how to use what I’m doing, so I’m morphing into editing…slowly. I might be a mediocre scribe, but I have the best transcript process in North America. I know this, because I see it everywhere I look. A lot of what gets published looks like crap because somebody didn’t want to put in an extra ten minutes of effort. (I know now, because that’s how long it takes me!) What the hell, editors? It’s exciting, and kinda scary. I know I’m prone to delusion and ‘Walter Mitty’ syndrome (Keyboard goes pocketa-pocketa-pocketa). As an editor, if I asked a transcription agency to follow my guidelines, it’d cost in the vicinity of $2.00 an audio minute. Maybe $2.50. If it’s stupid content, $3.00 an audio minute. As a scribe, I know what I’m doing isn’t easy unless you’re a pro at scribing. Editors don’t have time to learn all that — that’s why it’s worth $2.50 an audio minute. But, working for myself, it’s REALLY quick and cheap. Technology is advancing. Speech recognition is improving. But what will cost the mortals a massive heap of cloud computing and processing time to be able to do, I can accomplish with a spreadsheet — and faster. Through my volunteer work, I have global connections with world-changing people. I just have to show up and take a bit of initiative. It’s a superpower — that’s what it’s like to work as an audio transcriptionist. It’s the same with all members with the Guild of the Dancing Feather — the scribes.

Beware of scribes with something to say — they write with great length. Is there enough work in the world for human transcribers? Absolutely. The problem is, there’s not a whole lot of people who have the funds to pay for a scribe, and automation and crowd-sourcing is cheap and gets the product close enough to where the consumer can modify it for their own needs. And corporations want to keep their shareholders happy and always want to pay the lowest prices possible. There is a lot of demand for human-generated transcripts, but little willingness to pay for it. It is a time-consuming endeavor. I could keep myself busy for at least two years, probably much longer, just transcribing the things that I feel have an urgent need in the world — I often transcribe just because some signals need a good boost, and every little bit helps. It is very much gig economy work that varies from day to day. But it is also international freelance work. Every day is different, different projects, different clients, different parts of the world, different sectors of the population — always different. . It does make me wonder what the hell I’m doing and if it’s worth it. There is a similarity in the business model with the performing arts industry. A good agency smartly pairs us up with clients that makes everybody mostly happy. (The agency is generally always the happiest in the deal.) My project manager is very much like a talent agent/talent coordinator, matching the scribes with the jobs. But it’s also freelance, so I can contract with as many agencies as I want, and work for my own private clients — which I do. I seldom interact with other scribes. We all seem to work in isolation and don’t use more than five words when communicating with each other, if that. I worked for an agency for nearly three years without ever contacting a human. No emails. Nothing. Passed the test first try. Signed the NDA. Submitted transcripts, and they paid. I have no idea who the hell they were aside from a hokey looking website. (Put that on a resume…) The agency kinda functions like making sure when somebody orders a clown for their kid’s birthday party they’re getting a magician and not a Pennywise doing BDSM things. Yeah, they might be able to somewhat do each other’s shows without any notice — but, um, no. I suspect the clients totally know, even though we’re masked with anonymity. Honey, this ain’t the same clown we had last time… …I do not know what little personality quirks we bring is worth to the clients. But I know I have some and tend to care about some things way more than others. (I make shitty financial transcripts. Earnings calls, marketing research, and business conference calls really piss me off. Every time they try to give me financial shit or product focus groups, I disappear for a week or two. But land-use surveys — everybody else in the agency hates those, and I absolutely love ‘em. I get the bulk of those. It’s great!…but then I think it’s kinda sad that more people aren’t having the opportunity to hear some really good stuff.) In many ways, I think it is the best time to be a scribe because of all the cool stuff we get to hear from really smart people, and helping them communicate with each other. My transcripts have been used everywhere. I am a true generalist and transcribe for everything. Books, TV, documentaries, magazines, changes in academia, medicine, law, politics, finances, sex trade, black market, gray market, open market, gift economy, etc. Little bits of my work all over the world. It’s wild. In one day, I worked on a project to bring awareness about the plight of Right whales, and another to teach nonviolent conflict resolution to a war-torn area. Who else gets to do that while in their underwear? (It’s a very, very small effort on my part, but every drop counts, eh?) If somebody hadn’t stopped by and asked me what I was up to, I wouldn’t have even thought of it…Can’t talk. There’s whales to save and a war to calm…you know, deadlines… oh, sorry. There’s no time for pants either… Nobody has any idea what modern scribes do. I know I don’t have any clue. I like to think some of that stuff has real worth to the world, but it’s mostly all nonsense. (In reality, I’m mostly sitting here staring out the window and drooling on myself — with a great deal of focus and frantic fingers. It’s like being plugged-in to a slo-mo Matrix, and not being able to choose what to download into my head. But I do know how to approach a migrant sex worker…which I don’t ever see happening…) But it’s also one of the worst times to be a scribe, because of all the terrible stuff that we’re doing. (I currently transcribe mostly for Canadian researchers and research institutes.) The Right whales and a lot of marine and river life ain’t doing so well. And global tensions are increasing. I can hear it in everybody’s voices. It’s a trip to transcribe something from 20–50 years ago and hear how our language has shifted. I think the modern scribes are scribing more than any other scribe in history. I don’t know how it affects other people, but I know it puts a whammy on my mental health. The isolation of the job makes it even more fun. It is kinda crazy to me. After marking on clay tablets, scriggling quills on paper, punching typewriters, until the tools of today — the scribes of the modern age probably transcribe hear/read/write more than any other scribe in history. And probably in a few years, the machine will do it all. I think the modern scribe with headphones and keyboard is only going to be here for a blip. I think the human-digital era surpasses the audiotape era in individual output — what one person hears about/types. When I’ve looked backwards at how people have dealt with problems that I deal with, there aren’t many similarities. Because with the Internet I can work remotely in complete isolation that hasn’t ever existed before. I started off with a few reference books, but I don’t need those now. When I look forward, how these problems might be solved in the future — they don’t exist, because of the crucial need and advancing rate of automation technology. So, it’s interesting to be part of this group of data creators. I like to think I’ll someday entertain a digital archaeologist, putting all my transcripts into one pile and wondering what it all did to the human that created them. I do wonder if such a person will exist someday. When you look at it from a historical perspective, the life of a professional scribe has rarely had much value. Much less in this day and age when we work remotely and anonymously. I know my transcripts are being fed into Watson — and not generated by Watson. The people who can afford it understand that value. For the meanwhile, the rich people and government funding keeps us going. (Most of what pays my invoices comes from research grants.) . But is it worth it? Would I start to learn to be a scribe today if I didn’t know what I know? I quit working in a locked dementia unit to transcribe full-time. In many, many ways the locked dementia unit was better and easier. I would consider going back if the administration would ever change. After some files, I seriously give it a think. Just turn off the computer and never turn it on again. People who work in locked dementia units are a little more valued by society. I tell people I transcribe for a living and I get a blank stare in return. It’s really difficult occupation to articulate with a sound bite. It sounds so simple to sit and type, but it’s not. I do know that it’s possible to make a living by transcribing — not much of a living, but it’s a living, once a level of proficiency is obtained. If I’m allowed to use myself as an example, I know it’s possible. It’s not easy. But it’s possible. I think after you’ve transcribed 20 hours of audio, you’ll know how hard it is to make an income with producing transcripts. I could have three weeks of low-paying or non-existent work, and then one week of fat projects that fills out the invoice in a less stressful way. And there’s all the things in the U.S. that makes it hard to run your own business. I do a lot of work for free to stay in that poverty zone, because it’s just easier that way. It is a huge challenge. Sometimes it takes the agency a couple months to pay my invoice. It’s not a job, it’s a lifestyle. Considering our population, technology, rate of adaption, and the state of our planet… It’s baffling, when I stop and think about it. I know I’ve produced an excess of 100k words in a week for a variety of projects. (22k words in a day seems to be my physical limit. Everything goes to mush after that. If I go over 22k, it ruins me the next day.) After 11 years, it’s a lot of words. It’s a lot of voices. They keep me awake at night. That’s why I transcribe meditation talks and volunteer transcribe for other organizations. (I find the teachings of Guanyin to be of great benefit.) . I still don’t know if the job is worth it. I question this at the end of every file. I transcribe because it’s easy for me and it’s the only way I can think of to make money from where I am. There has to be better and easier ways to make money than this. If I was in it for the money, I’m not sure I’d still be transcribing. I’ve tried to get dozens of people started transcribing. Not one has made it past two audio hours…and most never talk to me again, or quickly avoid anything referring to what I do for a living. (120 audio minutes is a solid day’s work for me…maybe 80 minutes if the audio is crap.) People either think they’re too good to transcribe, or they’re not good enough. I figure if you see something that someone needs, and you can do it, why wouldn’t you do it? Some projects sit for years waiting for someone, anyone, to show up and do it. I do know people, corporations, NGO’s, and many other types of organizations find value in human scribes over machine. Just don’t expect them to pay you well — but I think that’s true for most jobs nowadays. Humans being cheap is more a reflection of our culture and economy, not the occupation. There’s countless files I know if I didn’t do it, nobody would — or could. I’m sometimes the last resort on terrible audios. If I can’t do it, the words in that audio are lost forever. At least I can sit and watch the birds and the grass grow, even if I do have some strange voice living in my head. …but it comes with a cost to your body sitting in one position all day. Plus a large chunk of sanity will be sacrificed. I’m not sure what the value of that is. There’s a lot of transcripts that software and computers can’t do. There’s also a lot of things other humans can’t hear, or have the patience for tedious things. If you can scribe, there’s a lot of worthwhile work in the world to do. Getting people to pay for it, is the trick. . I think the next phase will be humans trained to think words into the computer, rather than type — and that will eradicate the need for automated and keyboard input scribes. After words, comes images. Then moving pictures. Then audio. Then we have quantum computing+artificial integration+Internet telepathy+Singularity+machine superintelligence, hopefully in the hands of a fully democratic and free society. If that world happens, I don’t know if there’ll be scribes — or much use, really. What a timely question. I’ve been kinda wondering this myself. Beware of scribes with something to say — they write with great length. Is there enough work in the world for human transcribers? Absolutely. The problem is, there’s not a whole lot of people who have the funds to pay for a scribe, and automation and crowd-sourcing is cheap and gets the product close enough to where the consumer can modify it for their own needs. And corporations want to keep their shareholders happy and always want to pay the lowest prices possible. There is a lot of demand for human-generated transcripts, but little  Continue Reading",2021-03-06T16:20:03.005Z,"Is it still worth becoming a transcriptionist in 2019? ",Quora

Voice recognition isn't always correct, especially when it comes to names and places and even topics that the computer may not be familiar with. Then when you add in things like different accents, poor audio quality, etc. you see why the computer may never be as accurate as we'd like it to be when it comes to voice recognition. So now, we have voice writers who help make the captions that you see on T.V. What they do is prepare for a broadcast by researching the topic of the broadcast ahead of time. For example, if there is going to be a news broadcast with an infectious disease expert, the voice writer will research that topic and add the terminology and names of people and places that are likely to appear in the broadcast. They are essentially programming the computer to recognize these terms when they are spoken during the live broadcast and also teaching the computer how they should be spelled. But that is only the beginning. When it is time for the live broadcast, the computer does not just recognize and transcribe the conversation. Instead, the voice writer has to repeat everything that is said, enunciating very clearly, and speaking in sort of a flat monotone. What was interesting to me about this was the voice writers themselves are humans that sound like computers or robots. So basically they are still using a transcriber type person to verify spelling and terminology, but they are utilizing voice recognition technology to allow the transcriber type person to talk instead of type. I was able to observe a voice writer in action once and it was really pretty interesting. I think if anything the future is headed more in that direction. I do know that some transcription companies offer voice recognition services, but usually they can only produce a draft and still need a human to edit and verify accuracy. I guess it is possible that this could change in the future with the advent of even better technology, but l suspect a human will still be needed in some capacity to create a quality transcript.

On paper, I really thought I could make $2200 a month easy-peasy. 100 bucks a day, 22 days a month. It looks totally doable. Easy target, right? But the reality is sometimes 1/2 or 1/3 of that. Once in a blue moon I’ll reach around $3000 when my body isn’t complaining and I have enough work to keep me busy. I seldom see $2000 a month. The reality is it’s incredibly hard to maintain that amount of focus for over 6 hours in a day. We’re talking about a fairly deep zen-like focus and attention to details, where the concept of Self is eradicated and left in another world, and all that’s left is a, drooling, nearly lifeless, intensely listening body with twitching fingers while the ego whimpers in isolation. It’s hard to maintain that focus without distractions, external or internal. When that focus is broken, it’s hard to get back into it. In 8 hours of work, the last two hours are chock full of errors and take me twice as long as it does first thing in the morning. I’ve experimented with reserving that late time in the day for proofing or email writing or whatever. Except… after a long day of making words, my brain is kinda squirrelly, exhausted, and ruminating in some other part of the world. Words get all jiggly on the monitor and I’m only wasting time trying to get something done. When words quit making sense, I shut off the computer. My body is telling me it needs to move. If everything is going well, 16,000-20,000 words a day is a good pace for me. If I go much over that, when I hit the computer the next day, everything is a big struggle to get going. Also, the workloads are never consistent and if I choose my days off, I lose work. I work as much as I can when it’s busy, and bite my nails when it’s slow. Having a consistent workload with good rates to the point where I could schedule my days off is something I’ve yet to achieve.  Let’s approach this from a different angle. And bear with me, the math part of my brain doesn’t always work these days. Humans speak around 200 words a minute. One hour of audio will be around 12,000 words. Some people speak 120 words a minute, some are up in the 320 range. One hour of audio can range between 8000 and 18000 words, so I don’t like to put the audio length into my metrics when I’m doing a self-audit because it doesn’t tell me much. (It’s always good to audit yourself now and again. Take inventory, look for places that can be improved. I need to do that…) The last time I did a word/rate analysis I was making about $.007 a word. But there’s some projects that are probably closer to $.009 and higher that I’ve been getting, I just haven’t done a quarterly analysis in a while. A penny a word…those are good rates. For the sake of round numbers — At $.007 a word you’d need to transcribe 720,000 words in a month to make $5040. That’s 24,000 words a day, 30 days a month. The average 400-page novel is 100,000 words. At $.009 a word you’d need to transcribe 570,000 words to make $5130. That’s 19,000 words a day, 30 days a month. I look at that and go, “Yeah, I can do that. Sure.” But, no, my body would absolutely revolt with me treating it that way. I can keep that pace for 2 weeks at best, and then I’m going to need quite a while to recover — maybe another 2 weeks. Trying to push through that, “But I don’t wanna go to work today!” is sometimes difficult. And sometimes when I push through it, it really, really hurts me. I try to listen to what my body is saying and try to remind myself that taking breaks is healthy. I shoot for making enough words to fill 3–4 novels a month, if I can get it. See how many words you can transcribe in an hour and calculate how many hours it will take you to achieve the necessary word limit…then go hunting for the work, and don’t take so much that you miss deadlines. Maybe your body can do it. I know mine can’t.  Another part — transcribing speed is different than typing speed. Transcribing speed also includes the time for researching unfamiliar terms and name spellings, responding to work-related emails, and proofing — making sure all the commas and end-quotation marks are in the right places and nothing has crazy capitalization. I average 50–60wpm transcribing, but I’m in the range of 100–110wpm with “typing.” I’m always looking to boost that number and one time I transcribed 14,000 words in a little over 3 hours, sustaining somewhere between 70–80wpm. I’ve done it, but I haven’t been able to repeat it. It was just a glorious audio and my body was enjoying itself, and maybe it had a lot of caffeine that morning. I think being able to make $5000 a month at transcribing would make you into an endurance athlete, with great attention paid to diet and ergonomics, employing technologies to increase efficiency, and you’d become an exceptional human being. But we’re not robots. There’s the human aspect of understanding the knowledge and emotion in the speaker, punctuating everything in way so that it’s understood, readable, and has the capacity for the reader to mirror that emotion and acquire that knowledge. That human aspect is something that I don’t think algorithms are going to accomplish anytime soon. Being able to do that is exhausting. You really need a human brain to transcribe human speech into human text. But we are weak humans and there are limitations. Maybe you can make $5000 a month. I know it’s feasible on paper. I like to think that there are some people who are doing just that. If you can get there, I’d like to know how you got there so that I can maybe fix whatever it is that I can’t seem to figure out… $2500 is more realistic (which is what I wish I could reach), but if your significant other is also transcribing, that’s probably the most healthy way to achieve $5000. My wife tried transcribing, she can’t do it. Every single person I know that has tried, didn’t last very long.

At first, you should expect a very small amount of work and a commensurately small amount of pay. My advice would be: Once you get that first MT job, don’t quit your “day job” until you’ve built up some good knowledge and experience that you can put on a resume and carry you into a greater workload.

So yes, you can start out with 30–45, but the pay is going to be extraordinarily lousy and might make you question the decisions you’ve made in life. But if you have no other choice, don’t tell anybody how fast you type and apply to all the places you can find — and keep practicing your typing for around 2 hours a day. (After 2 hours, you’re wasting your time. You’ll progress just as much with a good two-hour practice session as spending 4-hours typing. It’s just how brains work.) If you’re already in the 30–45 wpm range, 2 hours of practice a day for a month or two, you’ll be easily in the 60–80 wpm range.  But if you mean you’re typing 35–40 wpm as your transcribing speed, you’re right where you need to be to start. My average words per hour while transcribing is around 3000 — and that’s with going back and fixing all my errors and researching stuff that I don’t know how to spell (I’ve been in Ojibwe - Cree country lately…Weashkog sounds a little like Bushcog or Meshgog…that one took a bit to find…it’s a lake…I found it!)  So, I average roughly 50 words per minute — but averaged over an hour. In actuality, it’s not blazing fast. (I recently hit an average of 75wpm for 3 hours of typing+breaks+proofing…that was a record and never happens…probably had a little too much coffee that morning...roughly 14,000 words in 3 hours. It was a GREAT audio with familiar content.) And with some projects I’m around 2000 words an hour because of the crappy audio and all the other junk involved…like following all the creeks, rivers, and lakes in Ontario.  But yes, there is legit work out there. Pay attention to the pay rates. An audio hour is not the same as a work hour. It takes me roughly 4 hours of work for one audio hour. 4:1. You want to aim for $60+ an audio hour. (Speaking US$) Some places pay $20 an AH, and that’s slave wages. Don’t look at those places. From the responses I’ve had once or twice, I can be pretty darn quick in my turnarounds. I couldn’t live on $20 an AH…and I like to think I know what I’m doing. Places that pay that little aren’t legit. Rev is the bottom of the barrel in my opinion. I do think they’re a great place to start, but after 6–12 months, you should be getting paid more fairly. But yes, they are legit too. For me, it’s barely making minimum wage. (I feel better about myself volunteering than working for that cheap.) And don’t disregard the people around you. If you have colleges around, talk to people, talk to professors, see if they want stuff transcribed. Maybe somebody with a bit of spending money wants to write a book but doesn’t want to spend the time typing? Finding a good place to work for is a lot like trying to figure out how to spell Weashkog. Transcriptionists make transcripts. It has a ton more to do with listening, grammar, punctuating, and research. Capturing the words and their meaning while attending to the cadence is the important bit. Typing speeds are arbitrary.

It’s interesting because I’ve heard stuff that other people haven’t heard. And no other person on the planet has heard the same files that I’ve heard. There is no person to go to say, “Hey, did you hear about that thing that’s going on? How do you think it relates to that other thing? This is what I think…” Everything is bound to secrecy through non-disclosure agreements, so it’s not like we talk about anything anyway. Transcribing is an isolating experience. Because I have no coworkers — there’s less socializing. Because the stuff I hear is counter-reality to my old friends and neighbors. I make them uncomfortable and my mother hangs up on me — there’s less socializing. Because I’ve never been a social creature and live out in the middle of nowhere — there’s less socializing.

Based on my research, there are three payment models for transcriptionists. Full-time transcription jobs - they are paid a salary of about $2,000 to $4,000 per month; this figure is only indicative and hence can change depending on numerous factors like your experience level, past performance, the economic conditions (like the COVID-19 situation now has caused the pay to be reduced).Part-time transcription jobs - they are paid per audio hour or audio minute. I will give you an example.Say you are a transcriptionist who has been asked to transcribe 15 minutes of audio. Now, usually it takes 4 minutes to transcribe 1 minute of audio. It can take more or less, but usually about that much. So, 15 minutes of audio would take you about 15*4 = 60 minutes to transcribe.Now, 60 minutes = 1 hourBut, you are paid in AUDIO HOURS, meaning1 audio hour = 60*4 = 240 minutesSo, most agencies pay transcriptionists per audio hour or audio minute. As for the rates, I checked and found that they are usually paid $0.10 per audio minute; audio hour rates go up to $25 to $50. By the way, the rates might vary greatly; the pay for each audio minute depends significantly on the quality of the audio.

If the question is about medical scribes, individuals who accompany physicians and created the electronic record, it doesn’t save a lot of physician time but with medical notes that are typically cut and paste meaningless. I sent a patient for a 2nd opinion with a highly specialized (and I’m sure very busy) surgeon at a university medical center. He’s consult note was clearly written by a scribe. The physical exam went through a long list of things examined but had no findings. Every possible lab and scan had been cut and pasted in it’s entirety. The report was literally 10 pages long. There was also a problem list created but no treatment plan or recommendations. I had to call the surgeon who apologized for the inadequate report and told me what he recommended. And that’s the problem with scribes. They have little medical background and so they can create notes in a very cursory manner. The US requirements for electronic medical records have made the records an exercise in clicking boxes to meet Medicare billing requirements. The electronic record is definitely not an instrument to relay information to other physicians. Long lists of diagnosis without treatment plan is meaningless. Electronic records add on average an extra 90–120 minutes to a physician’s day, without compensation. I don’t blame them for hiring scribes to check the boxes.",2021-03-06T17:12:56.204Z,"What are the pros and cons of a medical transcriptionist? ",Quora

The qualification exam consists of 3 parts: You can proceed with the next part only if you pass the previous one. When you complete one part, you’ll receive an email about the results within 10 minutes. The overall results should come in 1-2 days after the due date of your exam. I’ll try to give you some tips for passing the exam; PART 1 (Theoretical Part) This part assesses your theoretical understanding of the General Guidelines. In this part, there are 32 question blocks and each block has 4 questions so there will be 128 questions in total. This part is the easiest part of the exam however some questions can be very tricky. I recommend you to read the guidelines rapidly before starting this part. Also, you need to refer to the guidelines if needed because some questions require detailed knowledge of the guidelines. PART 2 (Page Quality Part) This part has 7 different web pages to evaluate its Page Quality. Each webpage should be evaluated in terms of 4 different aspects: MC quality, information about the website, Reputation and EAT level of the pages. People suggest that it’s better to examine the pages in terms of 4 different aspects before having an overall PQ judgment however I think that this approach confuses new raters. So I recommend that you should examine the whole task page and have an overall judgment before proceeding. After that, you can think about quality aspects. For example, if you found that the web page is deceptive, you can’t give high MC quality to that page because all quality aspect ratings should be consistent. Also, almost every task in this part has a similar example in the guidelines so it’s better checking the guidelines while rating. PART 3 (Needs Met Part) In this part of the exam, you need to rate 7 different tasks, each task consists of 8-10 result blocks. Therefore you will have 56–70 result blocks to rate their both Page Quality and NeedsMet. It’s probably the hardest part of the exam. First of all, you need to analyze queries to understand user intents and needs fully because ratings should be given according to the user's intents. I think people fail this part because they are approaching the tasks ignoring the user intents and needs. A result cannot be automatically useful because of its relevance to the query. You should think like you are the person who wrote that query. Again I recommend you to check similar examples in the guidelines while rating. Also, you can take a look at this website to get more information and help.

These companies were able to drive small MT companies into the ground and out of business and acquire their hospital accounts. These companies also outsourced, mostly to India, because it was much cheaper to hire transcriptionists from India than US-based transcriptionists. Unfortunately, healthcare reform did not include a law requiring medical records to be maintained in the US. Since all of this resulted in lower quality reports, some health organizations still want their reports typed by an experienced US medical transcriptionist and only hire people from the US. For example, Quest Diagnostics is one of these companies. Most MT companies, however, now only offer independent contractor jobs working remotely with no benefits. You have to provide the computer and everything needed for the job, which is tax deductible but you also have to pay 7.5% more in taxes, which is the portion the employer normally contributes. The MT jobs nowadays are mostly medical editing, which consists of listening to dictation and correcting any errors. The standard pay for editing is 4 cents/line, which is not much. Straight typing jobs pay an average of 7–8 cents/line nowadays, which is also not that much. However, you may get lucky and get a job with one of the few hospitals that still hires or a company like Quest Diagnostics or maybe even a private company. However, these places want lots of experience. For the record, I was hired by Quest with a good salary and generous benefits, but I quit because of the schedule, which consisted of working late every night. However, I was offered an MT job with better hours by a former employer and took it. This career used to be amazing. I used to work part-time, only 3–4 days a week, and could make 50k/year at 10.5–13.5 cents/line. I was able to work from home and didn’t have to pay for childcare. Unfortunately, it is not like that anymore. The average experienced medical transcriptionist probably only makes around 20–30k/year.

Patricia Bowe It depends on a few things. One, how fast you are at typing and submitting an accurate file, the quality of the file you’re transcribing, and how much the file pays by the audio minute (which is different from an actual minute). At Rev, they say that you can earn between $.30 -$1.10 (audio minute) as a transcriber and between $.54-$1.10 as a captioner (again, these are audio minutes). An audio minute is price of the file itself based on how long the file is, so it varies greatly how much you get paid. If you can finish a 15-minute file that is $1.10 in an hour, you get $1.10. If you consistent Continue ReadingIt depends on a few things. One, how fast you are at typing and submitting an accurate file, the quality of the file you’re transcribing, and how much the file pays by the audio minute (which is different from an actual minute). At Rev, they say that you can earn between $.30 -$1.10 (audio minute) as a transcriber and between $.54-$1.10 as a captioner (again, these are audio minutes). An audio minute is price of the file itself based on how long the file is, so it varies greatly how much you get paid. If you can finish a 15-minute file that is $1.10 in an hour, you get $1.10. If you consistently finish a file in good time, you can pick up more files to fill up your eight-hour day. BUT…if your file is really bad quality, or you do not type fast (they request that you type at least 50wpm, which, if you want to make any money at this, isn’t really a fast typing speed) and that 15-minute file takes you 2 1/2 hours to finish, the payment is still $1.10, but it took you twice as long to finish, which reduces the number of files you can finish in an eight-hour day. Now these are just examples to get you to understand how the audio minute works. Higher priced files can pay a lot more, but they are either really bad in sound quality, a lot of speakers, boring as hell, or all three. Those files can range from $20 - $80 depending on how urgent they need the file to be finished or how old the file is. BUT…it can take you an entire day to finish. So if you pick a $20 file and take all day to finish it, your pay for the day is $20. I must stress that unless you have the typing speed, good headphones, and can invest in software that can help you try and improve (somewhat) the quality of the file, you won’t make much money. The average pay at the end of the week will help you get some extra money, but it is definitely not a full-time pay job. On a good week, with my typing between 65–70wpm, and I luck out with good files or files I can improve on in terms of quality with my sound software, I can range between $80 to almost $200 at the end of the week (I average about $120 a week). AGAIN, this depends on how well you can transcribe long files that are bad quality as they tend to pay more. So, to finish, this is a good job if you are looking for extra money, but not really good to be your sole source of income.",2021-03-06T17:35:15.139Z,"How much can I earn as a transcriptionist from Crowdsurf?

You’ll need to be able to type at least 60wpm, have some basic computer and maybe MS Word knowledge. You’ll probably need to buy some software to play/pause the audio — foot pedals make this a TON easier. It’s not necessary from the get-go, but you’ll want one. Transcribing also requires above average comprehension of spoken and written language, understanding of global accents (I struggle with some Indian accents, esp. Gujarati — and Hong Kong accents — Australian can sometimes trip me up with some of their muttered colloquialisms.) Is it “fur bearing animals,” or, “fur, bear, and animals?” Was that, “Kangiqsualujjuaq,” or “Kangiqsujuaq?” Did they just say, “Sam is here,” or “Sam isn’t here,” and the phone skipped at the “n’t?” Some of these questions don’t get answered until 15 minutes into the audio. Transcribing requires intense focus to capture the cadence and the meaning of the speaker — even if they’re speaking inside a heavy metal bar with a live band. I often hear very sensitive things that are very emotional. Listening to some of these stories with no option but to truly pay attention, and researching all the back stories that led up to theirs. Listening without judgment and listening without any ability to share any of my own thoughts is sometimes a little…hard. (Think social worker conversations with the people they serve. Canada wants to improve services for their people. They do lots of research to help struggling people.) Things we hear get severely stuck in our heads. I mean it passes through my ears, comes out my fingers, where it’s read by my eyes…several times. My wife applied to the same place I got on with 10 years ago…she still remembers the story she transcribed. It wasn’t a nice story. She helped me with some stuff I did around the Westboro Baptist Church (They’re a different group of people. Having them in your head is a little weird.) — at least she’s had a taste of what I go through. Transcripts I’ve made get triggered by different things. My wife asks, “Do you want blueberries?” Oh yeah, the Blueberry Band near Pink Mountain… I answer with, “We need to stop using plastic.” It gets incredibly confusing at times. My wife gets a lot of answers that she wasn’t looking for. So yeah, you can expect that to be part of the job too.  One way to start, do some Google searching for transcription agencies. Anybody paying less than $1 USD an audio minute is cheating you. If you can’t Google this, you need to work on your Google mojo because this job requires a ton of researching and reading. Finding someone’s correct spelling of their name sometimes takes some creativity. (Hint — there’s several forums that have lists of fairly decent transcription agencies.) You submit an application, resume, or whatever. They’ll ask you to take a test. My very first test was an hour long audio — it took me 9 hours. Most other tests I’ve taken are between 15–30 minutes. The labor mill places are usually 3–5 minutes. So you read and study their style guide, take the tests, do your best, and hope the transcription gods smile on you. …then you do it again and again and again until you like who you’re working for.  Another way to start is to volunteer for people, churches, professors, etc. Every volunteer gig I’ve done has led to a paid gig…or a gig that I could refuse payment. (Taking money for some things I do can be difficult.)  If you’re in an urban or a college/university community, you could probably just ask people, “Hey. So, I’m wanting to learn how to transcribe? Do you know anybody who’s got any audios they want typed up?” You might get lectures, research projects, all kinds of fun stuff. It’s a way to get a cheap, but weird education.",2021-03-06T17:43:14.499Z,"How do I become an online transcriptionist? ",Quora

Data entry operator responsibilities include collecting and entering data in databases and maintaining accurate records of valuable company information. ... You will work with a data team and data manager. Previous experience as a data entry clerk or similar position will be considered an advantage. A data entry clerk is a member of staff employed to enter or update data into a computer system. Data is often entered into a computer from paper documents using a keyboard. The keyboards used can often have specialist keys and multiple colors to help in the task and speed up the work.  BY LAUREEN MILES BRUNELLI Updated June 16, 2019 Data entry isn't a new field; it's been around about as long as the computer. But with more and more companies outsourcing clerical work and the rise of the gig economy, data entry—also known as keylogging—is seeing a resurgence in popularity. Before you dive into a data entry job, get familiar with what to expect. If you'll be working remotely, the pay is not great and you're not likely to see regular salary increases. Data entry is not the same as data mining, and for the most part, you're not going to be dealing with the data that people talk about when they complain about Facebook's privacy practices. Data entry is a lot less complicated than all that. What Is Data Entry? Data entry is actually a broad term that encompasses a number of occupations. People who perform data entry include electronic data processors, typists, word processors, transcribers, coders, and clerks. While many of these jobs may be done from a remote location, data entry jobs from home can be quite different from those done in an office. Regardless of where they're based, data entry jobs don't have a high barrier to entry, and the training process is usually not very stringent. If you have typing skills and a high school diploma, and you can read and write English (if you're in the U.S.), you'll qualify for most data entry jobs. Functions In essence, data entry means to operate equipment (often a keyboard) to input alphabetic, numeric, or symbolic data into a company’s system. The data entry operator may be required to verify or edit data as it is entered, or another person might do this work. The data may come from hand-written forms or audio files. The way home-based or online data entry jobs are performed may vary considerably from office jobs. Data entry operators working for micro-labor offices that use crowdsourcing techniques may simply do small bits of work for small fees. This model is growing more common. Some data entry workers work for more traditional data entry companies, which are often business process outsourcing firms. These people might be paid an hourly or per-word rate for a whole project.  How Jobs Work While many of the data entry positions mentioned above fall under the data entry umbrella, positions advertised as “data entry jobs” (as opposed to ""transcription work"") usually require the least skill and in turn pay the least. In general, the method that data entry jobs might pay could be an hourly wage (rare for online data work); per piece; keystrokes per hour; or keystrokes per minute, per audio minute, or per word. Most of these methods make your rate of pay highly dependent on your speed at data entry. Data Entry From Home Though many companies only allow those who have been trained in-house to work offsite, data entry can often be done from home, especially as remote workers are more easily managed, thanks to better technology. Keep in mind, though, that because data entry from home is almost always done by independent contractors—who are not subject to minimum wage laws and who are in competition with a global workforce—the pay is typically lower for home-based workers than for those who work in offices. You're also less likely to receive merit increases, bonuses, or other perks or benefits than you would in a traditional office setting. Job Trends According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, local government, elementary and secondary schools, and accounting firms are among the top employers of office-based data entry clerks. They're most likely to be doing office administrative services, bookkeeping, and payroll services, or, for more highly trained clerks, medical and diagnostic data entry work. Data entry isn't the most challenging job, but if you're looking for steady work to pay the bills, industry trends show this field will be robust. Spread across numerous sectors, work should always be available.  What (And How) Do Data Entry Jobs Pay? Data entry is a legit way to work at home, but it won't make you rich Data entry is one of those jobs that's pretty much what it sounds like—the entry of clear and concise data into one or more platforms so that it's easily accessible and understandable to others. Those others might be humans or computer systems. Pay for data entry from home can range considerably, from as little as $1 per hour up to the average rate for an office-based data entry operator—about $15 an hour as of 2017. It's an organizational process, moving information from one format into another, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a business or organization that doesn't need to consolidate and organize its relevant data. The position is sometimes referred to as a ""data entry clerk"" or a ""keyer."" Data Entry Salary Information Data entry salary information can vary considerably based on a lot of different factors, including your status as an employee or an independent contractor, the difficulty and skill level required by the position, and the speed at which you can do the job. But overall, data entry jobs generally pay modest wages. Any organization that promises big salaries for data entry jobs is more than likely a data entry scam.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), data entry keyers—not transcriptionists or typists—are paid a mean hourly wage of nearly $15.64 an hour as of mid-2017, from a low of $10.37 an hour for new hires up to $22.24 an hour for a more experienced worker employed by a generous company. This works out to about $32,530 annually, but salaries can depend heavily on the area where you work and live. Five states are known for ample data entry jobs as well as paying a decent wage, according to the BLS: California, Texas, Illinois, New York, and Florida. These wage figures apply to employment jobs in brick-and-mortar offices, not necessarily data entry from home. And most work-at-home data entry jobs are not employment positions but independent contracting. Data Entry Pay Structures Data entry pays using a variety of rate structures, including an hourly rate, per-piece payment, keystrokes per hour, or keystrokes per minute. The job might also pay per work or per audio minute. Of course, no jobs will advertise $1-per-hour work, but complicated per-piece pay structures can actually work out to be that little. These other pay structures are designed to pay more to faster, more experienced data entry operators. But a worker must earn at least the minimum wage in the state in which the work is performed in employment positions in the U.S. that pay in any structure other than an hourly wage.  Work-at-Home vs. Office Data Entry Job Salaries Data entry jobs from home are likely to pay less than data entry in an office. It's not simply a matter of home-based workers often being willing to earn less in exchange for working from home. Data entry from home is almost always performed by independent contractors who aren't subject to minimum wage laws. These jobs might be in competition with other global jobs from home or micro labor positions, which can also lower pay rates. The way in which data entry work is sent to home-based workers can also affect pay. Workers who log on to crowdsourcing or micro labor sites might not be able to obtain enough pieces of work in an hour to make a good wage.  A transcriptionist is a professional typist who listens to recorded or live audio files and converts into text format what they hear. They offer their services to medical, legal, and general transcription industry. May 6, 2018 What does a transcriptionist do? Medical transcriptionists sometimes referred to as healthcare documentation specialists, listen to voice recordings that physicians and other healthcare workers make and convert them into written reports. They also may review and edit medical documents created using speech recognition technology.  What is a Transcription Job? Transcription JobsTranscription can simply be defined as the process by which speech is translated into written form. Transcription has evolved over the years into a specialized area with the rapid expansion and growth of businesses worldwide. Professionals in this field are known as transcriptionists and they are in high demand these days. It should come as no surprise that transcriptionists are expected to do much more than merely type out the contents of an audio file. Transcriptionists are expected to do quite a bit of research and understand terminologies which may not be clearly audible in the recording. This blog post will cover: Different types of transcription jobsQualifications necessary to become a transcriptionistEffects of globalization on transcription jobsDifferent types of transcription jobs The job of a transcriptionist has evolved over the years and this has resulted in transcriptionists specializing in their niche fields. The most common branches of transcription are the general transcription, legal transcription, and medical transcription. General transcription: Most modern businesses use the service of transcriptionists. This can be for transcribing coaching sessions, recorded seminars, one to one interviews and a variety of other business needs. It has become a common practice among busy authors to record their narration in a dictaphone and then hire a qualified transcriptionist to transcribe the recording in a specific format they want. Any person with good English and typing skills can undertake these types of business transcription jobs. Legal transcription: Legal transcription, unlike general business transcription, requires the transcriptionist to have some understanding of the legal terminologies used in a court of law. The job involves carefully listening to recorded court proceedings involving attorneys and other legal professionals and transcribing the recordings into documents in a specific format as instructed by the client.Medical transcription: This is a much more specialized area of transcription where the transcriptionist is expected to know medical terminologies in a variety of general and specialized medical fields. Accuracy is of utmost importance in medical transcription and all transcriptionists have to undergo training and certification before they start a career in this field. The transcriptionist should always bear in mind that he is dealing with confidential patient records which are very personal and all efforts should be to protect data confidentiality.Qualifications to become a transcriptionist The most important attraction of transcription jobs is that a person aspiring to be transcriptionist need not have any special qualification. This is true in the case of general business transcription. If you have good typewriting skill (above 70 wpm) and great attention to detail you can aspire to be a good transcriptionist. A good understanding of the English language with special emphasis on grammar is a must for any transcriptionist to excel in this field. Good computer skills will be an advantage as the transcriptionist will be working on specialized transcription software like Express Scribe. Legal transcribers work for law firms, banks, and big corporations and they deal with contracts, pleadings agreements and a variety of legal issues. Hence, they are supposed to have a good understanding of these issues.  There are a number of Certificate Courses and Diplomas in legal transcription that is available for aspiring legal transcriptionists. The duration of these courses could vary from six months to two years. Very often legal transcription firms offer on the job training for transcriptionists. Medical transcription is one field of transcription where a formal qualification is a must. This is due to the sensitive nature of the job involved. Many firms provide online training programs for medical transcriptionists that equip them to work in a HIPAA compliant environment which ensures that patient data are safe and secure. The training programs are also structured in such a way that the transcribers become proficient in a variety of medical terminologies and jargons that are frequently used in the transcripts. In medical transcription, there is no room for errors since the transcripts form the basis for the settlement of claims in a variety of issues. Hence most transcription firms have three levels of transcriptionists namely, the medical transcriptions, the editor and the quality controller. The transcript produced by the transcriptionist is reviewed by the editor and the quality controller before it is delivered to the client. The training programs in these firms are also structured accordingly.  Effects of globalization on transcription jobs Globalization has affected almost every aspect of our lives and this is true in the case of transcription also. With the rapid expansion of computers and high-speed connectivity, outsourcing of most jobs has become a reality. This has opened up challenges and opportunities in the field of transcription. Clients have a great choice of talented transcriptionists to choose from and hard working transcriptionists can get a chance to apply for exciting transcription vacancies anywhere in the world. This has also opened great opportunities for working from home. Transcription jobs are one of the easiest ways for making money. If you have the strong will to work hard with sincerity and dedication this is one field you can definitely explore. The most important advantage is that you do not have to invest huge amounts of money to start a career in this field. Transcription jobs are sometimes advertised as data entry. These jobs can sometimes require more skill and accuracy so they'll pay more than simple data entry keying jobs.  How Much Does Transcription Pay? “General transcription pays well in comparison to most work at home jobs,” says Mills. “The least I’ve made per hour is $15. But I often make $25 per hour or more. Those who specialize in legal can make an even higher wage per hour.” The exact amount you earn as a transcriptionist will depend on the company you’re working for, how much work is available, and of course your speed and skill level. While Mills translated her rate for me, note that transcription companies usually pay a rate per audio hour or a rate per page, although the audio hour pay rate seems to be the most common. An audio hour is not the same thing as a regular hour. For example, if you’re being paid $50 per audio hour, this means you’ll earn $50 for every hour of audio you transcribe. It could take you anywhere from two to five hours to transcribe just one hour of audio, depending on the complexity of the file is and your transcription skill level.  Experienced transcriptionists often consider rates below $45 to $50 per audio hour too low. But if you’re brand new to the industry, you may find it’s worth working for a lower rate to get your feet wet and learn valuable skills that could help you land a better-paying transcription job later on. Where to Find Transcription Jobs as a Beginner Here is a list of legitimate companies that regularly hire newbie transcriptionists.

And then there are Data Entry Transcriptionist jobs: Data Entry Transcriptionist Overview Data entry transcription jobs are relatively new to the scene. In the past, transcription was only a part of the duties of those hired to do “secretarial work”, who would take dictated notes in shorthand and then type them out longhand. First used primarily in the medical field, the transcription industry has expanded to include almost every industry. A data entry transcriptionist’s duties include (but are not limited to): Copy information into a computerized format. For instance, you may get a document that is handwritten that needs to be entered into a spreadsheet format like Excel. This also could be information that is recorded that you will enter into the correct formats. You may also do some straight transcription that will need to be then entered into some type of electronic or digital format.  What skills are needed to do data entry transcription jobs? There are several skills that are required to be a good transcriptionist. Then there are some extra skills that will help you to be a data entry transcriptionist. You will need to have good typing skills, this includes accuracy and speed.

You will also need keyboarding skills that including the shortcuts and 10-key numbers. While many of these can be researched online, it is extremely helpful if you don’t have to stop to find them. You will also want to have the ability to accurately transfer data, whether heard or read into a digital format. Is an education required to have a job in data entry transcription? While you only need to have a GED (General Education Diploma) to be hired as in data entry transcription jobs, there are some classes or certifications you may want to consider getting. The transcription certification offered by many online and local educational institutions will give you a general premise from which to base further knowledge.  What type of training will help you be good at data entry transcription? There are several courses that can help you become more proficient in data entry transcription.

You’ll learn things such as formatting, editing, formula entry, just to list a few. You may also want to take office procedures and/or specialty type of classes. Because you may be working with varied terminologies, you may want to take legal, medical and office terminology. Each of these is necessary for a wide variety of transcription jobs, especially if you are working freelance. How much do data entry transcription jobs pay? This is entirely dependent on the client, company and whether you are freelance or work with a company. What this means is most companies pay by the audio hour or a working hour at a specified rate.

You will be assigned work based on your skills and qualifications and while the clients pay the company a price, the company will pay you something different. Freelance work means you work directly with the clients themselves. You often will bid for the jobs, and price according to what is the going rate, yet inexpensive enough to win the contract.  The rates of pay can be by the audio hour, which is the time of the actual recording, not the time you spend working on it. This can range from $5.00 all the way to $20.00 per hour. Hourly jobs, which are paid for working time, can range up to $15.00. By the project depends on the size of the project and generally will be negotiated on that size and by the page is generally $3.00 – $8.00 per page. Where can I find data entry transcription jobs? Depending on how you want to work, be it at home or in an office, there are a wide variety of places you can find online to apply for data entry transcription jobs. Here, we will discuss a few of the larger sites in which you can find good, legitimate jobs. TranscriptionJobsHQ.com: We have partnered with top companies to offer you a very easy-to-use job search engine that pulls all listings from Simply Hired, Monster, and Indeed to show you just about all of the legal transcription jobs that you can find on the internet. If you can’t find your job here feel free to keep searching elsewhere, but we are confident that our database has most of them. Upwork.com: The transcription jobs on this website range from large to small. Once you create a profile, start out by charging a reasonable rate by audio/video minute and then build up your profile to eventually have a higher cost and repeated clients. It takes some time, but this can be a great way to get multiple clients coming back over and over again.  Rev.com: This is a great company to join if you'd like consistent transcription work provided to you. The problem with joining this company is that you'll be paid less per audio minute because they have to make money too, but they are very consistent with the work that they get. Simplyhired.com: This is a job listing site that covers a wide range of industries. You can search by keywords such as transcription or corporate transcription. You will want to have a general cover letter that you can edit for each job and a relevant resume as you apply directly to the company itself. These jobs can be at home or in an office. Careerbuilder.com: One of the largest of the job listing sites, Find a Job | CareerBuilder has been around for well over 15 years. Again, you will want to upload a relevant resume and have a general cover letter that you can review and edit for specific companies. Since companies can also search the database for relevant workers, it is good to have a copy there as well.  Again, using keywords, you will search the database for relevant jobs and apply per the specifics listed in the job details. Monster.com: Another large job listing site, you can upload resumes, use the resume builder, develop cover letters, search the database for position and review job details. You will apply to each job per the instructions listed in the job details. <So I choose to give you to your information on Data entry jobs, Transcriptionist jobs, and data entry/ transcriptionist jobs. On the surfface, it seems that one could make more money doing a transcriptionist job since it seems to offer more money, but you will have to do your research on the different companies to see what they are offering for the jobs they have available",2021-03-06T17:54:23.837Z,"How much do entry level medical transcriptionists make?

For a single speaker and clear audio, such as a podcast — $1 USD per audio minute or $.007 per word is barely an appropriate rate in North America. You won’t be able to survive in the U.S. on this rate. Most crowd-sourced agencies like Rev or Transcribe Go or whatever pay less than half of this. I look at Rev and have no clue how people can afford to live on those rates. I must totally be an amateur because I can’t do that. And I’m barely living as it is, even though my cost of living is way low. I’ve been transcribing for my biscuits for 11 years, so I suspect I’m a little faster than most. I type 110+ wpm. After clocking my last few files, I transcribed around 70wpm averaged over 60 minutes, 4000–4400 words per hour — that’s including googling to find names and shit. I can only hold that speed just for an hour or two a day. The other 4–8 hours of my typing day are closer to 3000 words an hour. My brain and body can only handle 20,000ish words a day — at best. Whether I get done fast or slow, I’m done. If I worked for Rev or a place like that, I’d need to double my workload and have little time to recuperate. I’d burn out in a heartbeat. So, maybe I am an amateur. I don’t know. There’s no way I could live on less than $1 per audio minute and keep doing this gig. I make less than $2k a month. If I put more hours in, I end up dreaming about unplugging and feeding myself to the buzzards, piece by piece. NEVER accept lower than $1 per audio minute unless you’re transcribing for charity or for some cause. It’s the same rates for amateurs as for those with experience. Whether that audio hour takes 12 hours to finish or if it takes three. It’s the same rate. Transcription is one of those fields that is full of underpaid and exploited workers trying to survive in a gig economy. This drags us all down to the point where I’m living like I’m in poor hovel while the infrastructure crumbles around me. Just like all my global coworkers, hoping to make a few bucks and live a day longer. Now mind you, these rates haven’t changed in the last ten years while the cost of living and inflation has. Here’s the rates, roughly. Every file is different with varying levels of difficulty, requiring more time to get through it. One speaker, clear audio — $1 per audio minute.Two speakers and clear audio, $1.10 per audio minute.Difficult accents or recorded speaker phone — $1.15 per audio minute.Difficult accents with background noise (TV running, noisy restaurant, etc.) — $1.25 per audio minute.Polyglot focus group on a riverboat with pylon pounding — $2.50 per audio minute.These are the rates that I barely survive on. Because of the time involved, I’d rather opt for the $1 per minute clear audio than some of the crappy files. I can fly through good recordings — so can speech recognition, so good recordings are seldom heard these days. Many, many files haunt me for weeks, months, years — I don’t get paid for that because I don’t know how to charge for that.  Transcribing is a lousy gig in our culture. We work in isolating anonymity with no supports. You’ll spend your time strapped to the machine, falling deep into the rabbit hole with no way out. Every time you put your headphones on or take them off, embrace yourself for culture shock. When you try to explain the world you came from to those around, you can’t. I’m aware now that very few people walk the earth who can do what I can do, and I spend every day questioning the value of my time and my worth on this planet. This existence isn’t worth it, really. In all honesty, we need to start a revolt and push up the wages so our base rate would be $2 an audio minute. $3.50 - $5.00 for the hard stuff — or vote so we can enjoy more government services. We’re not really doing either in my community and it’s causing a bit of a poverty problem. …and there’s so many people around the globe trying to put their hands in, hoping for a better life. But just don’t stick with it for very long. That’s what keeps the industry rates low. I went to Fiverr the other day and saw a woman from Pakistan transcribing for .50 an audio minute. She was crazy experienced. I can’t compete with that because of the costs where I live. There’s no way I could do a good job and continue to buy groceries at that rate. I often hear accents from her part of the world and really struggle with them and probably do a lousy job. We do the same job but paid vastly differently. I guess I’m a lucky one. I transcribe for a Canadian agency because I couldn’t find an American agency that paid fair. I’m fluent in Canadian, but most Canadians struggle with our southern accents, eh? (They like to research us. We’re rather curious, aren’t we?) Canadians and Americans have different perspectives of sociological research. It’s crazy how different our foundational moral philosophies are, even though we’re so much alike. And right now, I’m about through with Canada. My soul has been sucked dry and there’s no supports for mental health when the topics get heavy and life gets stressful. Canadians take care of each other. It’s not like that where I am. I’m still trying to pull myself up from my bootstraps, and they ripped plumb off. I’m just going barefoot now. The exchange rate made me crazy and I don’t know if they’re overpaying or underpaying me half the time. I stopped caring about the currency and only work on projects that have value to me. Nearly half my work is unpaid collaborations, just because I need to do something good once in a while. (I hear things going on in the world. It freaks me out.) . Transcribing is an international biz and you’re competing in a global marketplace. The more accents you can understand, the more the world opens up to you. Because the value of a minute and the worth of a dollar varies from culture to culture, it can be hard to estimate. Good luck! (And be careful of the buzzards.)

I know there’s a few places that want to see proof of 80+ wpm. But there’s quite a few places that just don’t care. It’s more about if you can meet the deadline or not. If it takes you 12 hours to transcribe 1 hour, but you still meet the deadline, nobody gives a hoot. The pay scales are generally based on the 60–80 wpm range. So yes, you can start out with 30–45, but the pay is going to be extraordinarily lousy and might make you question the decisions you’ve made in life. But if you have no other choice, don’t tell anybody how fast you type and apply to all the places you can find — and keep practicing your typing for around 2 hours a day. (After 2 hours, you’re wasting your time. You’ll progress just as much with a good two-hour practice session as spending 4-hours typing. It’s just how brains work.) If you’re already in the 30–45 wpm range, 2 hours of practice a day for a month or two, you’ll be easily in the 60–80 wpm range.  But if you mean you’re typing 35–40 wpm as your transcribing speed, you’re right where you need to be to start. My average words per hour while transcribing is around 3000 — and that’s with going back and fixing all my errors and researching stuff that I don’t know how to spell (I’ve been in Ojibwe - Cree country lately…Weashkog sounds a little like Bushcog or Meshgog…that one took a bit to find…it’s a lake…I found it!)  So, I average roughly 50 words per minute — but averaged over an hour. In actuality, it’s not blazing fast. (I recently hit an average of 75wpm for 3 hours of typing+breaks+proofing…that was a record and never happens…probably had a little too much coffee that morning...roughly 14,000 words in 3 hours. It was a GREAT audio with familiar content.) And with some projects I’m around 2000 words an hour because of the crappy audio and all the other junk involved…like following all the creeks, rivers, and lakes in Ontario.  But yes, there is legit work out there. Pay attention to the pay rates. An audio hour is not the same as a work hour. It takes me roughly 4 hours of work for one audio hour. 4:1. You want to aim for $60+ an audio hour. (Speaking US$) Some places pay $20 an AH, and that’s slave wages. Don’t look at those places. From the responses I’ve had once or twice, I can be pretty darn quick in my turnarounds. I couldn’t live on $20 an AH…and I like to think I know what I’m doing. Places that pay that little aren’t legit. Rev is the bottom of the barrel in my opinion. I do think they’re a great place to start, but after 6–12 months, you should be getting paid more fairly. But yes, they are legit too. For me, it’s barely making minimum wage. (I feel better about myself volunteering than working for that cheap.) And don’t disregard the people around you. If you have colleges around, talk to people, talk to professors, see if they want stuff transcribed. Maybe somebody with a bit of spending money wants to write a book but doesn’t want to spend the time typing? Finding a good place to work for is a lot like trying to figure out how to spell Weashkog. Transcriptionists make transcripts. It has a ton more to do with listening, grammar, punctuating, and research. Capturing the words and their meaning while attending to the cadence is the important bit.

I find it unreasonable to expect a human body to sit and transcribe for eight hours straight. I know I can’t do that. This job requires breaks. Sometimes lengthy breaks. When the audio has a growling bear that eats my brain, I take naps. I think I’ve moved away from seeing transcribing as a job. It’s more of a lifestyle. But in a normal day, I spend 6–9 hours transcribing. But it’s like a few hours here, a few hours there, and whatever else I can get done before my brain goes to mush. It’s kinda like juggling torches and icicles. Eventually, it all just goes pffft, plop! Regardless of my scheduling and operations of life, it’s still 6–9 hours of transcribing related tasks…sometimes more, depending on emails, proofing, researching, reading, invoicing, and whatnot. It might be work that takes me two hours to transcribe, but I end up spending 10 hours reading stuff about it, just because I find it interesting. …and I won’t go into the nightmares. I’m not sure if I should clock that or not. . So with all that in mind, my goal for every day is 100 audio minutes. If it’s studio recorded quality with considerate speakers, 120 minutes. Poor quality audios take longer, but have higher rates…it’s a gamble worth taking. Some ‘complex’ audios are easy peasy for me, some are miserable things that make my hair fall out. Ya win some, ya lose some. Some days I’m only hitting around 60 minutes before my brain just packs it’s bags and leaves without notice. Wait! Come back! I’m sorrrryyy….! …it gets weird after weeks of poor quality audios, where I start to feel like, Why can’t I do my job?! …and then I get some pristine file from out of the ether, and it’s like, Whoa…I’m flying!! Every day has it’s particular variations of complexity, difficulties, distractions, plus the physical and mental challenges. I had one day very recently where I sat down to work and just sat here staring at my screen all day. I don’t know what happened, really. My heart fully intended to work, but my brain said, NO! and it just shut down. The whole damn day, poof! Output will vary. . I’m always trying to figure out a way to do it a little faster and a little better…because let’s face it, transcribing is boring most of the time and the mind tends to wander and wonder how to do things better to unstrap myself from the machine. It’s oddly like driving long-distance. I just put on the ‘auto-pilot’ and start to daydream, and have no idea how I just covered so much territory without paying attention. There’s also how I personally feel about the project. I have one ‘client’ that gets a rather remarkable service compared to anything else I do. From when they cut their mic of their 30-minute show, they have a tidy 5000–6000 word transcript in their inbox in 1 to 2 hours. (They’re turning their radio show into a text publication.) I speculate that there’s stenographers that are much faster, but I think that’s the limit on the standard keyboard. I know it’s possible to transcribe and proof 30 minutes in one hour, because I’ve accomplished that. But it’s really, really hard to reproduce. (It was only like 4500 words. Slow articulate talkers using big words, and I must have had a good night’s sleep and an extra pot of coffee or something that morning.) This last one, I hit 4000 words an hour, but spent some extra time in the proofing. I even included all the things I had to google and inserted them as hyperlinks for the copy editor. That took about a half an hour to figure out how to automate with a keystroke for future use. Writing the email to explain what I did, another half an hour…Total time, 2.5 hours. But an hour of that was me goofing around and thinking about things. They’re the only folks I get to play with when it comes to transcripts. The organization is mostly operated by volunteers, so the client doesn’t really care about deadlines or anything, just happy that people show up to put their shoulder to the wheel. …and oh, it’s not just one transcript, it’s also timestamped for audio editing and set up for subtitling with a few clicks of the mouse [Cue Ooh’s and Aah’s]… Oooohh... Aaaaahh… But that’s me. The doofus who makes subtitles for a radio show, just because I can. Oh yeah, I’ve done it. It’s stupid and useless, but it exists. Why? I dunno. I’m still trying to figure that one out. . From an experienced scribe in the normal world, expect somewhere between 2500 to 4000 words an hour, roughly 15–25 minutes of audio. Expect only 6–7 hours of typing in a 24 hour period, with a few hours set aside for researching and proofing. (I usually do that while I’m drinking my morning coffee or eating my dinner or whatever.) If it’s of the ‘URGENT 30-minute earnings call’ for Seeking Alpha variety, that’s gonna take me at least 4 hours. And it’s just text on the page, with probably some words missing. I also likely spelled most of the names wrong…It’s Jimmy Diamond, CEO of JB’s Organ, right? ugh… It’s good to spend some time cross-check most things, eh? …I like to think I never made any errors that grievous…but I’m pretty sure I have…I hate earnings calls more than focus groups. And so, the adjusted rate from the baseline year-to-date has increased 7% before dividend…it’s always something like that. I’m never really paying attention. I just keep falling asleep, hence why it takes longer… Expect somewhere between 8000 and 21,000 words, 40 to 120 audio minutes for 8-hours of scribing.

Otherwise, this may become a life or death decision for a doctor. Consider just one example. In 1989, I had to edit a translated text which dealt with the description of a medicine. The translator confused the word fetal with fatal. So, instead of a fetal dose, i. e. a dose safe for a fetus, he consistently used a fatal dose, i. e. a lethal one. Just one letter! Fortunately, it wasn't understood vice versa or pregnant women would have been advised to take fatal doses instead of fetal ones! Also, in Russian we use a comma for decimals and a point for numbers. English: 100, 108.23 while Russian 100. 108, 23. If transcribed or translated without bearing it in mind, dosages may be dangerously confused.

Not because he demanded a petty sum, whereas those who demand and get bigger sums, escape the net. He got caught because he became greedy much too soon. Also the pettiness of the sum implies that he must have asked similar bribes from many more people than was good for the department's health and reputation. Either somebody within the department or a victim of the greed complained. Chandan Prakash Pandey got trapped, because he entered the chakravyuh (of bribe seeking) without fully learning the intricacies, and suffered the fate of Abhimanyu. Arjuna never gets trapped. He demands and gets bigger sums. Is it his destiny? Destiny is not immutable. You may be born with some destiny. But you can change your destiny through work. I strongly believe in the destiny. I never knew in advance what my destiny was to be. This did not mean that I waited for destiny to deliver what it had in store for me. I worked hard to unearth my destiny.

So, like the law of physics, they will choose the path of least resistance. So if we are going to cling to interviews, it makes sense to at least improve how they are conducted. Research shows better results if it is a “behavioral” interview where they ask relevant questions about the actual job and they have actual experts present who know enough about a topic to be able to detect BS. It doesn’t sound like you have experienced this kind of interview. Being picky and judgmental does not work. They may be acting that way because there are so many bad hires because of incompetent practices and there is pressure to change that. But a wise person once said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result ( the source that is often cited is Albert Einstein, but there is disagreement). The thing is that people who are gifted at passing an interview can be people who are good at gaming the system, that does not make them good employees. I remember reading an interview with Frank Zappa and the interviewer called him a “pop star” - he quickly replied, “I am not a pop star, pop stars are cute and they wear nice clothes.” HR has obscured their ability to discern the wheat from the chaff because they are not using the correct tools. I rarely recommend a source on-line, but you may want to check out Ask The Headhunter® - The insider's edge on job search & hiring™ I have been following Nick Corodilos’ articles for over 40 years. If I were President of the US, I would put him in charge of our entire workforce planning. I think he would love to answer your question. He had very clear and logical insight into what is wrong with HR selection systems back then and, unfortunately, that system has become a thousand times worse with technology. Nothing against technology, but when it is used to implement poor practices, it just does the wrong things faster. One of the most fascinating features of systems is that they can self-correct, but, if we do the wrong thing faster, it doesn’t allow for self-correction. It just generates more crap.

They took over MRecords in 2013, but then closed down the whole unit, and many peopled were rendered jobless because of this. Their speech recognition software (Dragon) is the best in the world. They have a good culture of retaining people. They are good pay masters, but have a bad track record of deducting pay if errors found in documents. If you have a good quality then Nuance is the company to be. They were flying high until last year when they had a ransomware attack on their servers. They had to keep their servers shutdown for almost a month and because of this most of their clients were upset and took back there work volumes. MModal: Probably the worst company to work if you are in the medical transcription field. When you are about to join, the HR will treat you like the king of the world, and when the joining process is over, you will be treated as a pauper. The managers in MModal think they are God’s best creation and will leave no stones unturned to hurt you in whatever way possible, either by shifting your targets, or shouting at you in front of all the production floor, writing mails to you and copying to all the production guys, and if you survivor from all this ordeal, you are certain to be put to the most difficult accounts they have. Most of these guys are uneducated and have never completed college, and so the designation given to them goes over their head and they start acting like the enlightened one. If you really are able to survive this kind of ordeal, then be assured you will never get the pay you deserve. The deduction will be so high, that you will get only half of you would expect. Due to all this, MModal has an extremely high attrition rate, and people do not stick to this company for a long time. Their speech recognition software (Fluency) is pathetic and does not recognizes speech properly. Dur to the advancement of EMR (electronic medical records) most of the hospitals in USA shifting to EMR based work, leaving the companies to throw out the workforce. Nuance itself threw around 5000 employees till July this year and many more are in the pipeline. They have put a blanket ban on work from home policy and most of their vendors in different parts of India have shut shop. Believe me guys, we have seen 2001 World trade center attacks, and we have handled the 2008 depression (apparently both of them could not being the MT industry down), but this is serious, and EMR is a big pain in the neck which is going to stay, and work will reduce for all, and people will become jobless, so if you are planning to leave this godforsaken industry, this is the correct time. The future of medical transcription in India is quite bleak. The two big players in this industry Nuance and MModal tried to monopolize the market around a decade back by capturing little units, and now their work volumes have started dwindling. Most of the vendor companies for these people have either closed down or are in the process of closing down.A glance at both the companies in this industry: Nuance Transcription Services: It was an excellent company to work with a good work culture till the time T N Raju was at the helm of affairs.

Now, more is needed to get into the field. For me, I had to get done four years ago for medical reasons, and when I was ready to go back to work last year, I had to switch to medical coding, which I took online college courses for. The style of transcription that I had done for 17 years, transcribing from physicians’ dictation, then editing and finalizing after the physicians made corrections, was pretty much done away with. Just about all physicians had switched to voice recognition software, doctors dictate and edit their own reports, transcriptionists are back to being records clerks, following up on records that are missing dictations. It’s kind of hard to do that from home. There are still some online schools that offer medical transcription courses, and they require at least some basic medical terminology and anatomy and physiology education, along with whatever actual medical transcription education they offer. I would certainly check out the career opportunities they offer, their success in job placement, etc. There are still some medical transcription positions in the larger hospitals and health centers, but certification is definitely required. 17 years of experience doesn’t do it any more.

There was one woman in our unit. I’ll call her Ms X. My coworkers and myself could never figure out exactly what her job was since she was always off on her phone making personal calls. But while we weren’t supervised by her (thank goodness), she had seniority to us. I suspect our manager only kept her on because, the way red tape works in large organizations, getting rid of her would probably result in a cut to our unit’s budget. Although we were always struck by the unfairness of it, the less work Ms X did, the more relieved we were, since she was hopelessly incompetent. Not just in the sense that she didn’t get her own work done, but that she would actively ruin other peoples’ work. One time she meddled with my work. I had a project 99% done, and was going to get a co-worker to proofread it, but we had an acting manager at the time, and he insisted that I give my work to Ms X to check instead of to a co-worker on my own level. As a result, the project was delayed by a full 2 and a half months as she just sat on it. During that period, I had two weeks leave, came back, the work still wasn’t done, and I started politely badgering her to get it back to me, which took up the last 2 of the 10 weeks or so she had it. When I got the work back, I immediately noticed she had introduced all sorts of glaring errors that weren’t there before. I got permission from my acting manager to reverse her changes and bypass her. The result of her delay was that some people lost money. My regular manager, upon her return, had started to arrange for my promotion, but thanks to the slow cogs in HR this wasn’t completed before my manager left for another role. Before she left, my manager did manage to hire a new employee to assist me in my work, and I was well on the way to completing the new employee’s training. But without my manager championing me and pushing for it, HR scrapped the plans to promote me with the new employee working beneath me. Why? Whenever a new manager comes in, they make changes, no matter how arbitrary, to put on a show that they are earning their pay. My new manager realized they already had Ms X sitting around doing practically nothing and already receiving a higher pay cheque. So as part of her arbitrary reorganization of our unit, the new manager decided to make Ms X the supervisor of myself and the new employee, and HR had an excuse not to change my role. The new arrangement would entail me training Ms X to do work I was already doing, while she got paid more and (likely) screwed everything up. While I likely continued to give directions to the new employee. I was this close to quitting when I scored another role within the organization (essentially, a promotion to the same level as Ms X, but in another unit). Which left Ms X supervising the new employee. (I had every confidence in the new employee, but felt very sorry for her). One thing my new unit was responsible for was processing particular resignations. These resignations needed to be signed off by the Big Boss. One particularly sensitive resignation involved a person making allegations against numerous other individuals — sort of a scorched earth approach of taking down as many others as she could while quitting. This required an independent investigation from an outside HR organization to be conducted. The results of the investigation was that the allegations were all utterly false, and the person resigning had in fact engaged in wrongdoing (such as violating confidentiality), and had failed to take friendly advice on how to fix her own performance (what she characterized as “bullying”). The independent recommendation was to approve that person’s resignation with no further investigation required. Due to the sensitivity of the resignation, the briefing and necessary papers were prepared by, and signed by, the Assistant Director in charge of our unit. That was an unusual measure, bringing in someone that high up to do it. The Assistant Director’s report was then signed off by a Deputy Secretary (essentially, a second-in-command within the organization) before going to the Big Boss for approval. The snag is that all papers going to the Big Boss needed to pass through my former unit. Which placed Ms X in the position to proofread the documents before they went to the Big Boss for signing. Ms X, without consulting anyone, decided that the report would be very embarrassing to the person resigning if any of it ever became public. So she took it upon herself remove all the text referring to the results of the independent investigation, the falseness of the resigning person’s allegations and her wrongdoing. Seriously. The report now left in all references to the resigning person’s allegations of bullying, but omitted the fact that there was any investigation (independent or otherwise), as well as its conclusions. The report went up to the Big Boss, who sat on it. Confused about why there was such a long delay without the Big Boss signing off on the resignation, the Assistant Director who prepared the report made enquiries and was finally told by the Big Boss’s office that there was no way it could be signed off given the total lack of useful information and detail in it. It would first need to be significantly rewritten. The very reason why the Assistant Director insisted on drafting the report was to make sure it was sensitive while still containing the required detail. So that was confusing. The Assistant Director requested that the Big Boss’s office provide her a copy of the report they were provided. The AD was prepared to compare her copy of the report with the Big Boss’s copy word by word to see if any changes were made to it. It did not take more than a quick glance to realize that most of the text had been deleted. In the meantime, numerous other errors had mysteriously appeared on documents passing through Ms X. For example, when she decided that some letters needed to be reprinted because they were formatted as fully justified instead of left justified, she somehow managed to change all the letters (each similar, but some referring to different organizations than others) so they now all referred to the same organization — which meant about 50 of the 60 letters were now significantly incorrect. So when we received those letters back, signed by the Big Boss, and noticed they referred to the incorrect organizations, we had to get the Big Boss to sign 50 corrected letters. They weren’t happy about that. It meant more delays, more tedious signings, and if the letters had gone out as is that would have created a huge embarrassment to the organization. But never mind all of that. It was the fact that Ms X significantly changed a report that had already been signed off by a Deputy Secretary that got Ms X in biiiiiggg trouble. The rest was icing on the cake. Long story short — Ms X is placed on extended leave; independent investigation by an outside HR firm; attempts by Ms X to place the blame on the new employee (the only person who was holding the former unit together and was near quitting herself); testimony from myself, the new employee (including about bullying by Ms X), an Assistant Director and others against Ms X; testimony from myself (including records) exonerating the new employee; computer evidence that Ms X was indeed the one who introduced all the errors, etc. Ms X fired. In large organizations, no matter how many highly competent employees there are, some incompetent ones manage to sneak their way in and somehow manage to stay. There was one woman in our unit. I’ll call her Ms X. My coworkers and myself could never figure out exactly what her job was since she was always off on her phone making personal calls.

He had aspirations of doing a BTech from one of the premier colleges of India. He went a city called Kota (an educational town famous for coaching institutes for engineering exams). There he told me, he stayed with two people in the hostel who hailed from Bihar.  Now Bihar is one of India’s poorer states (24th in 28th in % of people below poverty line). There’s a big divide between the priveleged and the poor. What Bihar is famous for is rich historical culture (Buddha) and insane amount of hard work; especially when it comes to studies and clearing exams. In Bihar parents are obsessed for their kids to get into IITs (Top Engineering College), AIIMS (Top Medical College), or clear the UPSC Exam (civil services). In-fact Bihar has for long been one of the best performing states in majority of these exams. This is because the students here have been instilled with a lot of passion towards these exams; it’s a matter of immense pride for them. They go to immense lengths to achieve it as well. My mother keeps telling me about this uncle who’d sleep with a thin blanket in the peak of winters so when the cold woke him up, he’d study. I hear another story of another uncle who wrote “You’d kill yourself if you don’t clear UPSC” on his study table!!! Pretty extreme if you ask me. But hey, the first uncle went to IIT Bombay (the best Engineering College in India), and the other became an IAS officer (highest post you get by clearing UPSC). Now despite the above, Biharis (people from Bihar) are looked down upon in the rest of the country. Bihari is a slang for ‘uncouth’ in Delhi and most of North India. Since they make majority of the labour class in big cities, they are hated in most of them. Anyway, coming back to the interview. The candidate deemed it fit to mention that his room-mates in Kota were Biharis. He got into the wrong crowd, got into drugs, did pathetic in the exams and had to do a BSc instead of Engineering (BSc is comparatively easier to get into in India) as he couldn’t clear any entrance exam. When asked why does he think he messed up in life, he answered, “I was with Biharis! You know how they are.” I didn’t react, but my questions did get harsher. The profile he was applying for needed a pressure testing round and this interview was a guilty pressure that I thoroughly enjoyed. “You have wasted you life till now, you got a makeshift degree, didn’t do well there, got into drugs (stared at him and bluffed), probably still into it! Why should I select you?”… It came again, “Sir! I was with a group of Biharis! You know how they are!” “Did your room-mates clear Engineering?” “Yes, both of them did (from good colleges).” “Do they have a job?” “Yes.” “Then why blame it on them? Seems like they did pretty well for themselves!” What followed were basic questions regarding his resume and some basic math questions, “100 rupee item, I give a 10% discount and on the discounted price I give 10% more. Final price?” ——Him- 80!!!! Me- Hmmm…. The interview got over, I told him he’d get the result in a week. While he opened the door to leave, I asked him one final question, “Where do you think I am from?” I had trimmed beard and short hair (a slight North Indian stereotype), and have a fairly neutral accent in all the languages I speak. “I don’t know… Punjab (a prosperous North Indian State) maybe??” “I am a bloody Bihari!”, I said in the calmest voice I could manage. He left with his head down as the colour on his face faded! He left without another word. A very racist one!!! #Bihar #India This is going to be a slightly long answer.

There’s Continue ReadingFirst, there’s the tools. A computer, keyboard, foot pedal, audio software, and a word processing program. You also need to be semi-fluent in the language, understand the rules of punctuation enough to know where the written rules can be broken in regards to the spoken word. High awareness of homophones and their multitudes of spellings — there’s many instances in the English language and anglicized spellings. (Did the speaker say “bear in mind” or “bare in mind.” One is contemplating a hefty thought. The other is asking to open your mind to other possibilities.) Next, you need experience. There’s multitudes of nonprofits that need transcribers. (You get experience as well as doing something good for the world — but it’s on a volunteer basis.)Offer your services to people whose podcasts or videos you enjoy (Works well if they’re new, with low operating budgets. Transcripts can be used to boost their signal, increasing their revenue — eventually paying you out of gratitude. Could be a crap shoot. Could be a good investment.)Bug journalists, think tanks, professors, and struggling media production companies that you don’t want to see disappear.Researching who you offer yourself to is always wise. Research is a big, big part of transcribing — find people that you’re willing to expose your raw brain to.  It’s a job, like any other — these things are universal, whether an occupation or a relationship. Provide value.Complete goals — deliver the product on time and under budget.Adhere to structural guidelines.Build a brand/solid reputation.Market yourself.Exceed the expectations of the customer/client/supervisor.Do what you say you’ll do — don’t promise things you can’t deliver.Continuously strive for improvement. You’re never perfect. You can always be more efficient. One thing I’ve noticed about transcription — it seems that either people can do it, or they can’t. Many people can’t get past their first audio hour — too hard.Some people struggle with language and typing — even people who have PhD’s in English.You need to have the kind of ego that can transcribe polyglot PhD classical literature professors — without fear of correction or reprisal. Same goes with brilliant polymaths — they’ll scrutinize what your fingers have done. (I once transcribed that professor reading his own words from a transcript I created — funky language looping.) I frequently correspond with PhD folks — my highest level of education — certificate in gunsmithing.Be able to listen without judgment or bias — because it increases your error rate. If you’re an asshole, this will be a hard job. If you think you’re not an asshole — wait. (This is still a goal of mine. I’m an asshole.)Be able to sit. And sit. And sit — or get crazy creative with your workstations (I recommend the hammock as a pleasant workstation.) I gotta warn ya though. Transcribing will mess with your brain. It’s often a traumatic experience — some things can’t be unheard. The world is nothing like I thought it was compared to when I started transcribing. I’ve never kicked anything back because I couldn’t deal with the content. Kidnapping and gang rape, human trafficking, slavery, holocaust survivors, people trying to rebuild their culture after decades of destruction and theft of their children…if it doesn’t get transcribed, their voices will never be heard. …it sometimes leaves me vomiting and weeping. And then, when I think I’m getting a grasp of how things really are, how humans really behave, and how these things affect those things across the whole scope of content that’s come into my ears — and it just makes me sad. And sometimes the perspectives of the voices move in and you find yourself grappling with an ego that isn’t yours. I often lose my sense of self, forgetting who I am and what I’m supposed to be doing. My imagination has been cruising along some remote polluted and dammed Canadian river in a canoe, dodging sandbars, looking for hairless moose around tailings ponds — not the realities of my own life. My wife has no idea who she’s dealing when I’m done for the day. Some days, I can be a pissed off and angry medicine woman, or maybe a twitchy CEO of a famous publicly traded company…our universe is random and chaotic. And neither one of us has any idea what I’m talking about. Their language gets stuck in my head and it’s terrible. The voices kinda echo, ya know? I like the stuff that I do for free, but the stuff I do for money is often soul-crushing. If you have a religious affiliation — I recommend transcribing something there too. It’s good therapy. I transcribe dharma talks. It helps. Also, transcribe for the changes you want to see in the world… transcripts are the foundations of many, many, many projects that couldn’t happen without transcribers. In this day and technological age, transcribing is the foundation of storytelling. Anybody who wants to tell a powerful story, will appreciate transcripts. Be a part of the story you want to see told… And again, do diligent research to make sure your time isn’t wasted and you feel fairly compensated either in audio content or rates. (I once got paid to transcribe an upper level class in a university — a whole year’s worth of lectures. I felt like I cheated them. Good stuff!)

Whereas Commerce and arts students have limited fields.Nowadays,Everyone is looking for an employment as the condition of the country is this.Each and Every Graduate is looking for a job,like accounting,P.O,etc.Most of them are banking related.Now if Hiring is on just practically think who will get the job.The one who choose commerce took graduation or the engineer who have done a lot of hard work,uncountable assigments and heavy studies.If you choose science as your stream after 12th then infinite number of fields are available for you to make your carrer in future.But if you have average(45%–60%)passing in boards then choose commerce because science will not really help you but make you the worst(Depends how much hard work you do) If you are good in your ssc board then go on with science. No problem in that case. Still confused..? Here’s a solutionGo Home check out your class 10′th subjects.Now choose those subjects in which you are good at school,those in which you are intrested,in which you can easily score without taking much burden.Now take a sheet write that subjects down and then search for the field relating to those subjects and then according to the field choose your stream also. It’s not also compulsary to take science after 10th but its way far better than commerce.A1so choose your stream wisely not just because everyone is doing the same does’nt mean you also do that as it affects your future.Go with your fun subjects,stay away from the subjects you are not intrested in. Also keep your decision final.Listen to everyone but keep your vision diffrent.If you failed tommorow just because you listened to someone else today then everyone will blame you only and also if you succeseed tommorow just because you made a choice Yourself,again you will be blamed.Choice is yours to take blame due to others or take blame by yourself.

Maybe there is another, more efficient way to reach self-realization which doesn't require you to take such a big risk of wasting two years or more of your life and thousands of USD just to end up in another job than you have dreamed of due to an immense competition.  I can strongly recommend watching and reading anything from this young man who has put a lot of thought into such things as career and making a difference. This page might also be helpful.

The number of shipments given to logistics data should be captured daily with Order number etc. 1e. AWB numbers (AirWay Bill) are provided by logistics with Order number corresponding to each shipment.  1f. An outscan using barcode scanning or RFID is done at this point. This will mark the Order as Shipped. A trigger point can be configured here to send an automated mail to user that your order has been shipped. What happens next: (though you didn't asked) :) 1g. Website has an integration with courier partner through API exchange so that a shipment is marked 'Delivered' as soon as it is delivered as per courier tracking. 1h. In case, user denies item reception, or package is lost, or damaged user is sent a separate product post scrutiny. Logistic partner may be debited for this. 1i. In case of COD, logistic partner collects the COD amount from customers and remits you periodically with Order numbers, may be every 7 days. Remember COD is costlier than prepaid orders due to COD handling charges (~Rs.50 to 120/-)   Case 2: Drop shipment/ Vendor shipmentSome companies don't have their own warehouse or don't keep 100% inventory like: - Big home appliances are not stored in warehouse like Indiatimes shopping. - Vendor ships by himself like in ebay, shopclues. 2a. Orders are filtered by removing cases of payment not received, wrong information provided etc and forwarded to Merchant (like warehouse in case 1). 2b. Merchant is given access to order management panel with credentials and he marks an item shipped once he ships it. 2c. Customer receives an email containing AWB number. Rest is same as case 1.  Some logistic companies provide their own warehouses to you on lease where you can store your inventory. Merits/Demerits of case 1 vs case 2 Own warehouse gives you real time control over your inventory and reduces the cancellations due to 'Out of stock'.Product related complaints are high in case 2 since you don't have much control on what the vendor is shipping. Inspection is generally not done by them since your reputation is at stake and not his.Warehousing is huge cost so it may be avoided for big appliances like TV, AC, Refridgerators etc.Case 2 is suitable for Gold jewellery and other valuable items owing to security measures. You can guess why Cash on Delivery is much difficult in case 2 since you neither have your own warehouse nor logistics.",2021-03-06T19:12:55.895Z,"What is meant by a Communication Specialist in an e-commerce company?

We had a client specialised in boutique fashion. We setup her shop online on multiple places - Flipkart, Amazon and her own store on Shopfiy. To promote her shopify based site, we spread the word through FB and we ran an email campaign for about Rs.20,000/-. The net result was possibly one sale on the own website.

We setup her shop online on multiple places - Flipkart, Amazon and her own store on Shopfiy. To promote her shopify based site, we spread the word through FB and we ran an email campaign for about Rs.20,000/-. The net result was possibly one sale on the own website. Meanwhile, Flipkart (which was idle for almost 1 month) started to pick up sales. But returns were over 20%. Then we got a chance introduction in Voonik and setup shop there. This proved to be a breakthrough and orders started flowing in. And soon Amazon started delivering results as well. She also got articles featuring her designs in the metro section of the newspapers. That helps a great deal in recognising her work. The key learnings that can be relevant here: Traffic to website is a critical driver. One in 100 would end up buying…(assuming we have done very good pictures of the product and have a value for money pricing). And you may need to be present in popular marketplaces where footfall is huge.Brand recognition is a big driver. When you are selling niche products and havent built a brand, we need to find a way to ride on another brand. Voonik had a name in exclusive women’s wear.Offline word of mouth is critical: You got to get the word out. Limited adv budget is everyone’s challenge. But your time for the business is plenty. Keep pegging away at spreading the word.Do you have a story? This is the big question. Are you yet another store for the products? OR do you have some story that is unique and attention catching? For e.g. this could be unique chemical free stuff, unique as its made by self help groups or maybe something else. But you need to have a story. And keep sharing that on your website, share that with local newspapers, category magazines…somewhere you will get featured, soon footfall (or eyeballs) to your website will grow.The obvious ones - try Adwords and SEO: Google adwords are good way to find genuine leads. But simple ads taking people to home page of your website may be wasted money. There is an art and science to ad copies, to get some expertise (some FB friend will put their hand up if you can buy them beer and lunch :). SEO comes as a natural outcome of great content on your products and your customer needs. Try and get a good article out every week on your website.Any influencer friends around? If you have friends active in FB, Twitter - big fan base…maybe they can post/tweet about your product. That is possible if you ask. But before you ask, do you have a story for them to announce.BTW, no sale within first week…? Chill. We have had one to two months go super quiet and then things pick up. The key thing is taking some steps to improve footfall and spread the word. Keen to know what people think, will look forward to answers and comments.",2021-03-06T19:14:01.269Z,"How can I boost the sale on my E-commerce website? ",Quora
6043d48ded76476feda35abf,https://www.quora.com/What-B2B-services-can-help-increase-conversion-rates-on-e-commerce-sites?-,"Ankit Macwan The following six best practices will help you improve the conversion rate of your ecommerce store. 1. Use Visuals “People can’t touch, feel or sense what they’re buying online. Photos change that.” Product images are what your customers want to see. These images define your product. But every ecommerce store uses product images, right? What are you doing different? Use creative images and artwork. Or maybe try large product images. Optimics used two different variations of product image sizes to figure out which one generates more sales. The large product images resulted in a 9.4% increase in sale Continue ReadingThe following six best practices will help you improve the conversion rate of your ecommerce store. 1. Use Visuals “People can’t touch, feel or sense what they’re buying online. Photos change that.” Product images are what your customers want to see. These images define your product. But every ecommerce store uses product images, right? What are you doing different? Use creative images and artwork. Or maybe try large product images. Optimics used two different variations of product image sizes to figure out which one generates more sales. The large product images resulted in a 9.4% increase in sales. Nothing fancy, they just replaced the small images with large ones and it worked. Creative and inspiring images help build an emotional connection with your audience. However, not all the images can boost conversion rates. Some of them will reduce it. You have to carefully choose the right images for your ecommerce store to entice visitors to buy now. 2. Improve checkout process and cart abandonment Cart abandonment is a serious issue. The average abandonment rate is 67% as reported by Baymard Institute. The checkout process is the most crucial factor here. Poor checkout process means one or all of the following: Unexpected costsWebsite errors and bugsPrice in foreign currencyPayment declinedPoor website navigationTimeoutAt the end of the day, it irritates the buyers. Once they leave, they will not return, most likely – unless you contact them. Online stores can do two things to deal effectively with the checkout process issue: Improve the process, making it simple, sweet, and user-friendly. Capture the email address of the visitors so you can recover lost sales. If you do not have the email addresses of the abandoning visitors, you cannot contact them. Not capturing the email address itself is a major concern. Ecommerce Fuel generated up to 10.5% sales a month from recovery emails. This means a lot. The customers who abandoned the cart received three emails. The first email reminds them of the cart, the second email reminds them to complete the purchase, and the third email offers a discount to complete the purchase. Easy sales, right? Instead of using annoying exit-intent popups, a better strategy is to use a simple registration process for capturing email addresses. Do you have guest checkout? This increases the conversion rate. Eight out of ten US retailers use guest checkout as 27% shoppers say they will leave the cart if they have to register before buying. Make your customer’s life easy. It is more important to generate a sale than to lose a sale for an email address. 3. Use product videos You think product images are all what your store needs? Think again. Nothing beats interactive and professional product videos to convert visitors into buyers. Not just simple product videos, using 360-degree spin product videos will do the trick. Videos convert better than images. People want to see the product from every possible angle before paying for it. Do not make the mistake of not having product videos on your store. Start using videos now. Create videos for a few products and see how it goes. Businesses that use videos generate revenue 49% faster than the businesses that don’t. I’m not talking about poorly created videos. A low-quality video will not help much with conversion rate as 62% of customers develop negative perceptions about the brand if the video is of low quality. When creating product videos, do not underestimate its quality. Do it professionally or else you will end up wasting money. Product images work, product videos do it better, but 360-degree product images are best for conversions and revenue. 4. Free shipping Nothing hurts potential buyers more than a surprise shipping cost. Some 28% of online shoppers will leave a store if they see an unexpected shipping cost. In another study, 74% of customers reported that they would leave their shopping cart due to high shipping costs. There is a reason why Amazon offers free shipping for orders above a certain amount. As an ecommerce store owner, you can do two things: Go for free shipping. It is the best shipping cost strategy. Nine out of ten customers consider free shipping as the number one incentive to buy more than once from any given store.If you have to charge shipping, clearly communicate it upfront. Do not ever hit the customer with a surprise.Follow a transparent and honest approach to shipping and delivery fees. 5. Offer limited choices “More choices lead to fewer decisions.” Having a product filter on the product page or giving options to alter the current product will result in low conversions. People tend to lose their focus. It gets overwhelming for the shoppers. Keep it simple. Let buyers focus on one product at a time. 6. Encourage buyers to leave a review Over 60% online shoppers read product reviews before making a purchase online. According to another study, 50 or more product reviews per product could mean a 4.6% increase in conversion rate. The dead simple rule to increase conversion rate right now – encourage customers to leave an honest review. Around 88% of people say that they trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Reviews do not just increase conversion rate but they bring loyal customers. There couldn’t be any other easier technique to increase the conversion rate of your ecommerce store. Customers trust customers. The challenge, however, is to convince buyers to leave a review. Not all the buyers leave a review (due to different reasons). Offer them with incentives, freebies, or maybe a discount on their next order if they leave an honest review. Even if a customer is not satisfied with your product, you should still encourage him to leave a review. Do not worry about the negative reviews as these can increase sales. In any case, a review means business. If you are looking to create an eCommerce website or looking to enhance an already existing site. I recommend taking a look at BuildaBazaar. Online Store Builder, Ecommerce Solutions & Software Platform Provider is an e-commerce Saas platform built by Infibeam with operations in India and Middle East. The technology infrastructure of http://infibeam.com was extended as an e-commerce platform and launched as BuildaBazaar in 2011.

There is no quick and easy way to get traffic unless you pay for it. And building up a consistent stream of visitors takes time and effort.  I also want to clarify that the amount of traffic that you receive does not matter nearly as much as the quality. So while getting a sudden rush of visitors from social media might feel great, it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t lead to any sales. The best thing that you can do, is to be consistent, lay a solid foundation and your traffic will gradually increase over time. Beware of sites or people that promise you millions of hits overnight or fast SEO rankings. These are all scams. Don’t forget to Checkout: 20 Best WordPress WooCommerce Plugins (Free)28 best shopify apps to increase sales31 Free Ecommerce Tools to Boost Your BusinessHere are 8 things that you can do to get more traffic to your store in both the long and the short term. 1. Write Content Other Than Your Product Descriptions Most people launch their online stores with no additional content other than what’s written in their product or category descriptions. And if you stop there, your site is going to be stagnant in the eyes of Google and your customers. The key to a good content strategy is to write interesting articles that are related to what you sell. And as you start writing about your products or interesting applications of your products, people will begin to think of you as an authority in your niche. And the more of an authority that you become, the more likely that customers will purchase from your store. (Read on for some examples) Here’s what we do with our online store. Since we run a linens business, we write content pages on how to make arts and crafts with our linens. People are attracted by these craft pages which in turn leads to purchases of our products to make these crafts. Here’s an example of a content page that has generated a lot of sales for our store. Click here to see the actual page  First off, you’ll notice that this is a pretty darn cool craft for weddings. It’s cute, it’s innovative and it’s pretty inexpensive. Once you see it, you want to make it. And lo and behold, the materials for this craft are all directly linked at the end of the page. Depending on the day, we rank in the top 3 in search for this craft and it brings in a ton of targeted traffic that lead to purchases. 2. Leverage Search Engine Optimization  Now ranking for this craft isn’t a fluke and neither is our strategy for ranking our webpages. We use a tool called Long Tail Pro to find out what people are searching for at any given time. By providing Long Tail Pro with a seed topic or keyword, the tool not only gives us an idea of search demand but it also provides us with an accurate assessment of the competition as well. Typically when it comes to producing content for our site, we look for keywords that bring in a decent amount of volume but are very easy to rank for in search. But remember, SEO is a long term play. By picking long tail keywords that provide a small amount of traffic, it all adds up over time as your content portfolio grows. If you aren’t using any SEO tools for your site, then check out Long Tail Pro for free 3. Leverage Email Marketing In addition to attracting search engine traffic, we also use this page to increase our email list which we then use to market other products. Let’s break down a few key aspects of this page a little bit further. First off, we have an email signup link within the content as shown below  We also have a popup which looks like this  And finally, we also have a signup form at the end of the tutorial which looks like this  If you aren’t gathering emails for your online store, then you are missing out on a huge sales opportunity. With email you can market to… New customers who might not be ready to buy yetExisting customers who have purchased from your storeLost customers who may have abandoned their shopping cartsCurrently, we use Sendinblue to handle all of our email marketing. If you’re not leveraging email right now, go sign up and try Aweber for free. Once you’ve got an email list, use it to send out interesting content and sales and promotions on a regular basis for instant traffic! 4. Leverage Pinterest Let’s take our “Wedding Dress Hankie Craft” example one step further. Did you also know that we get a ton of Pinterest traffic for this craft as well? Pinterest starts with having great images so my wife put together the following image for this page. Isn’t she awesome?  Pinterest is our #1 social media site for sales and it generates a good amount of traffic for our online store. The key to Pinterest is to create great looking images that are both skinny and long. We generally try to use a 2:3 aspect ratio for our images. 5. Leverage The Comparison Shopping Engines  When it comes to shopping online, there are many sites out there that aggregate products to make it easy to find for customers. These sites are called comparison shopping engines(CSE). Here’s how they work using Google Shopping as an example. When a customer does a search, Google displays a picture of your product along with the price and store information. If the customer clicks on the photo, you are charged by the click and they are taken directly to the product page on your website. What’s cool about the CSEs is that they convert extremely well. Because a customer can see a picture of your product along with the price BEFORE they click, they have a much higher likelihood of making a purchase. 6. Leverage Search And Content Based Advertising Even if you have a tiny budget, pay per click advertising platforms like Google Adwords, Bing Ads and Facebook ads are a great way to drive targeted traffic to your site. In fact when we first started out, Adwords was one of the main ways we got targeted traffic to our store. We didn’t go overboard, had a modest budget, and tried to buy ads that ranked in the top 8 for our keywords. We also used Adwords to help fine tune our site for conversions. 7. Scout Out Your Competitors Make a list of all of your competitors and find out where they are advertising. Then go through all of these places one by one and evaluate whether these venues make sense for your store. This process is extremely tedious, but early on in the life of our shop, we took our top ten competitors and did this analysis for every single one. It’s valuable because your competitors are likely on a budget and have done some homework already. You can leverage their hard work! For example by examining a competitor’s backlink profile, we noticed that they were advertising their products at a local college. So we reached out to that college and got a rare “edu” backlink back to our online store. 8. Leverage The Forums  I’m not talking about just dropping links to your store on the forums. In fact, if you simply advertise your online store on a forum and then leave, you will probably be banned. Instead, focus your posts on the forums towards steering people to your content pages and have the genuine intention of helping them out. If you are helpful, over time you will establish a reputation and can then start recommending products in your own store. When we first launched our online store, I parked myself on the wedding forums trying to help out new brides to be. And occasionally if they asked for wedding favor ideas, I would casually refer them back to our website. To easily find forums in your niche, simply type forum:[your topic] into Google search. Conclusion As you can see above, I just rattled off 8 ways to get traffic to your online store without even blinking an eye. And believe it or not, there are a bunch more that I didn’t mention because they are more specific to our online store niche. But here’s the thing. The worst thing that you can do is to sit there and twiddle your thumbs. You’ve got to get out there and try different things and see what sticks. Not every method of traffic generation is going to bear fruit. All it takes is 1 or 2 good ones and you’ll start making sales. Good luck!

It is all-in-one because it is packed with features that most e-commerce business needs: conversion boosters, integrations, one-time and recurring billing management, affiliate management, reporting, and more. Some of PayKickstart's conversion booster features include: True 1-click upsellsWith this feature, customers only need to enter their payment information once, then purchase upsells or one-time offers with a single click. Other shopping cart solutions offer 1-click upsells only with credit card transactions. But with PayKickstart, it also works in PayPal purchases.Order bumpsThis feature allows customers to add extra products or services at the initial checkout. Order bumps boost the average transaction value of your business.Exit-intent popupsBefore customers abandon their carts and leave the page, an exit-intent popup will appear. PayKickstart's exit-intent popup is fully customizable. Vendors can place questions, or they can even offer discounts to entice customers to complete the purchase.Cart recovery emailsIf customers decide to leave despite the popup, they can be retargeted through cart recovery emails. Customers who abandon the cart will receive ""Pending Order"" emails (also customizable). When they decide to go back to the shopping cart via the email, all the fields that they previously populated in the checkout page will be pre-filled.Auto-complete addressThis feature increases the efficiency of the checkout process. When customers start to type their address, suggestions will appear. And with one click, all the address fields can be populated.Customizable checkout pagesPayKickstart has a checkout page templates library. All the single-step or multi-step checkout pages are customizable. Vendors can even add a countdown timer to the checkout page to create a sense of urgency for the customers.These are just some of the features. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that there a lot more. PayKickstart has a free 14-day trial. No contracts involved. You can avail that period to try if the platform suits your needs. Good luck!

So the first question that you need to ask before starting an e-commerce company is — Am I willing to put in the time and effort required? Make no mistake, there is nothing like easy success in this game. However, if you preserve you will find that the entity you create, is well worth the effort. Starting an e-commerce website isn't particularly hard. I mean it was hard when we started creating solutions that would allow retailers to sell their wares on all the e-commerce platforms out there, from a single platform. However, we have had a lot of time to practice and perfect them. And now, you can take your very own e-commerce store, or marketplace, online in just a few clicks. To understand this better, let us take a look at the product cycle, or the work flow of a common marketplace, say Flipkart — and compare them with the products we have created to automate the same process. To create a marketplace like Flipkart, or Amazon, or Etsy, you will need the following things: A platform where other sellers can sign up and start selling their goods.A system to manage customers and accept payments from them.A mechanism to ensure that goods are collected from vendors and are shipped to their proper customers.A return merchandise system to solve disputes between customer and vendor.Extensions that allow you to sell all the products listed on your own platform, to other platforms as well — including the likes of Amazon and Flipkart.A system to analyse all your leads and conversions and come up with instructions regarding how the same can be improved.These are the basic requirements, or the very least you will need to set up before you can start selling online. And that is of course, assuming that you already have the product you are planning to sell — that is, you either manufacture it yourself or source it from a reliable supplier. Here you have two options. You can either code all this yourself, or let a development agency, or a pre-ready solution handle it. Each of these options have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage with coding it on your own of course, comes in terms of price and personalization. But unless you are a pro-coder (and even if you are ) these advantages are offset by the amount of time and effort required by the project — and that is assuming that you are a pro and can code absolutely everything you need. If you decide to go with a development agency on the other hand, you will need to shell out some money, but it will likely be an investment worth itself. Apart from the fact that they will already have all the tools you are likely to need, developed — enabling you to go online in hours — it also means, that they can make suggestions regarding what more you can do to improve your prospects — things that you may yourself be unaware of. In you choice of platform, you have a few options as well. For instance, you can go with Shopify (Extremely easy to set up, live in minutes) or Magento (much greater functionality) or even a Wordpress+WooCommerce combination. Each of them have their own set of advantages and disadvantages and you are going to have to conduct some research on your own before you can decide which of these services suit your needs. You can read more about eCommerce and associated topics, right here. Keep trying and do not get disheartened if you don’t make much sales within the first couple of weeks. The trick to succeeding is to never give up and keep trying and increasing your knowledge base. Do that and sooner rather than later, you will find yourself succeeding.

After learning that we had to provide service to the already registered seller and acquire new sellers to use amazon to sell. During that work I grew closeness to some sellers. They were intelligent people. So they had invested a lot of money and time and had many refined and established products which were having a good margin and were selling in large quantities per month. But after a few months of success run Amazon started blocking their listings of these products without any specific reason. Even I, who learnt everything about amazon policies from themselves could not find any valid reason. Sometime they used to say that the product needs to be registered for branding sometimes some other bullshit. If you don’t know let me tell you, Amazon is good on the side of customer’s support but worst when it comes to support on sellers side. The support executives are few for sellers and stays so busy that they don’t even reply even after weeks. Meanwhile the seller keeps loosing money due to high stockpile of inventory. Now comes the part of Amazon Basics. So after blocking seller’s listing and not replying for months on seller’s mails………drum roll please……… Amazon started launching the same high grossing products with their brand name “Amazon Basics” with prime tag and free delivery. So this is what Amazon Basics is.",2021-03-06T19:18:52.471Z,"What is Amazon Basics? ",Quora

We have been testing it with 3 other solutions for some time and found out that B24’s engine overshadowed the rest of competitors as it had the most reliable search algorithm. Plus, it’s an essential instrument allowing identifications of industry’s influencers. If we talk about online customer support I recommend LiveChat.Our tool is a complete product combining all necessary features of solid chat and help desk software. It’s a marketing tool as it supports generating leads and boosting conversion. Statistically, only 2% of visitors become leads - you probably agree with me that isn’t much. The point is that you can change this low number by sending chat invitations or offering passive contact forms called TICKETS. How? Firstly, you provide a real help to your visitors and can positively influence their decisions. Secondly, they leave their emails in the chat window so you get a new contact without effort. As simple as that. Plus, we think that chatting builds reliability and creates a bond between customers and a company. Trust and loyalty of your customers - LiveChat will give you all of that. I could write an elaborate list of features this app provides but instead I just want you to know that we got our first 1,000 clients only by chatting. To be honest we have never had a steady sales team - our software and support heroes do the work the best. Surely, it’s a solution worth trying.  If you need to deal with your emails - try Mailchimp.It’s email marketing software which makes sending, designing and saving your emails a delicious piece of cake. It provides clear interface and a long list of practical options. It allows to build a list of contacts to whom you can send your messages and place them on file to use it in the future. You can even create newsletters and share them on social media. For sure, it will give your e-mailing a new dimension. In case of SEO - Semrush.This in-house toolkit is essential for companies who understand that a deep analysis of their performance is a must. CoSchedule will help you to manage your plans and social media. This marketing calendar will let you get your plans right in one place. Different icons and colours enable quick filtering of your content. Drag&drop scheduling will make your planning swift and smooth. Just drop your already existing content in a new place and the tool will plan and adjust it to its new time. Moreover, you can make your social promotion in the calendar and publish your messages on chosen social networks. It’s a very practical solution for those who like to be well - organised and are sick and tired of jumping between different tools.

This may be jeopardized by the lack of concrete costs for the development of e-commerce mobile applications. Retailers looking to break into e-commerce need to utilize the power of mobile apps at a lower cost and advantage. Today, more than ever, consumers are increasingly seeing what mobile apps offer. Shopping on the go with access to a wide range of options to choose from is a great incentive, as e-commerce sites can offer their customers a boost in mobile apps. Other obvious benefits are discussed below. Advantages of running a mobile app for e-commerce High utility Mobile phones are a powerful tool that facilitates everyday tasks in all fields. Excellent e-commerce mobile app development facilitates strong interactions between clients and the company. A company-owned marketing channel Because apps are specifically downloaded for use, marketing messages transmitted by these apps are more likely to receive better responses than those sent through other marketing channels, such as email. E-commerce sites can stimulate greater customer loyalty by sending offers and discounts to app users through push notifications. Data collection tool Businesses can gather useful data to determine user behavior from apps to deliver personalized promotions. Means to increase brand awareness Businesses can expand their brand visibility by using apps in ways that are not possible in other ways. With stylish and intuitive apps that deliver personalized promotional messages, businesses can easily connect with their clients on a deeper level. Standards that determine the cost of an e-commerce development app Platform Different app platforms, such as Android, iOS, etc., give access to different combinations of demographic variables. The venue selection must be determined by the target audience. Platform selection also depends on the type of application. There are three main types: native apps, web-based applications, and hybrid apps. Application type selection determines the content and framework of the application. Native applications can be installed and worked without direct network connection; Web-based applications can only run on devices with an active Internet connection, and hybrid applications have native and web-based application features. Of these three, native apps are the most expensive and the most functional in terms of functionality. To get the maximum utility guaranteed to increase the sales potential of the app, it is advisable to use native apps for e-commerce development. Activity Activity is the second primary determinant of e-commerce mobile app development costs. Activities revolve around coding and technical details. Application design App design makes for visual appeal. Design costs for the app average between $ 2,000 and $ 30,000. Design Cost covers the costs for screen design, app icon design and so on. The cost of the design depends on the platform choice as well as the type of application. Native apps are more expensive to design and hybrids are less expensive. In terms of platforms, iOS apps are the most expensive to design. The cost of creating e-commerce mobile app development As already noted, the native app is the most useful type for e-commerce developments. The various aspects of the cost of mobile app development for e-commerce are as follows: wireframe The wireframe is an aspect of the app that must be implemented first. It is a visual structure that maps the application layout, including physical makeup, page alignment, and so on. Generally, multiple wireframes are created for the mobile app development project and selected from the final wireframe collection.The cost of wireframes depends on the complexity of application development and the number of pages. The cost of wireframes for applications with 2-3 pages is less than $ 500, and costs up to $ 1,500, depending on the number of pages for applications beyond 3 pages.Design cost The next step in-app aesthetics is app creation centers. Users are more apt to use apps with impressive designs. This aspect of e-commerce application creation should be adequately funded to increase the usage rate.As there are many aspects of design, it is crucial to carry out the creation with attention to fine details. For example, Android e-commerce application development should be fine-tuned to Play Store Design Guidelines. As far as app models go, there are no one-size-fits-all models.The cost of designing applications also depends on the flexibility and versatility of the design. The higher the number of versions of the operating system, the better it is for design, the higher the design cost. In all, the average cost of app design comes to between $ 2,000 and $ 35,000. Development cost This is the point where coding takes effect. The cost of application development is mainly determined by the number of programmers who undertake the coding. Another key determinant of application development cost is the scope of operation. The same is true of the type of application that native apps have the highest development cost of the three. Depending on how these parameters are combined, app development can cost between $ 1,000 and $ 100,000. After the implementation of the development phase, it is important to conduct a comprehensive quality analysis to test for errors and shortcomings in development. The cost of this analysis is mainly determined by the type of application and the scope of operation. Analysis can cost between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000. Additional costs They can come in the form of: The cost of the software license of the platformEquipment costsThe cost of social media integrationDatabase and server costApp Store ChargesUpdate costsDirect support costSuch as marketing and advertising costs.On average, each of these parameters costs between $ 500 and $ 2,000.End On average, the total cost of e-commerce application development is between $ 30,000 and $ 170,000. As already noted, the level of complexity in development, the versatility of its design, as well as the type of application, are key determinants of app development cost. Depending on the billing method, the time it takes to develop an e-commerce application can also affect the cost. Android apps take longer to develop compared to the time they take to develop other platforms. This disparity is called an android tax.",2021-03-06T19:20:33.686Z,"How much will it cost to develop an ecommerce mobile app? ",Quora

In this particular case you question is a bit inaccurate. There are no differences between B2B and reverse data matching services because these two concepts cannot be opposed.  B2B( business to business) is the type of e-commerce in which services or products are sold to other businesses not to the customers. This type of e-commerce is more profitable because the products are often more expensive or sold in larger amount. B2B marketing , therefore, is more demanding. And here comes the turn of “reverse data matching services”. It is the tool of e-mail marketing which involves the usage of personal information about clients. If you doubt the efficiency of e-mail marketing, I will just tell you that 98% of users check their e-mails on a daily basis. The right e-mail to the right person can make a huge change for your business. In any case it's always preferable to hire a specialist to run you e-mail marketing campaign.  An effective e-mail marketing campaign is connected to the quality of information you have on your clients.

Consumers are tricked into clicking objects or services faster if they are personally relevant. This is only 1 aspect of web personalisation, showing the people what they might be interested in through past internet activity. I have a friend who just started a business who personalises websites for your company. The possibilities are huge, but a simple change in layout of your website for first time visitors and returning visitors has proven a great increase in conversion rates. There first client was a big Human Resources company, they wanted to test the start up and gave them a chance by getting a 6 month contract. The requirements for the Startup, called Taglayer, was to increase the conversion rates by a small percentage (confidential) each month. NOW, only 2 months into their subscription they have a conversion rate increase of 35%! This was tested by showing the normal website to 50% of the visitors and showing the personalised website to the other 50% of the visitors. Taglayer only made minor changes to their existing website, making it slightly personalised to their visitors, now they will show them that conversion rates can even be higher by personalising the website even more. Taglayer is a start up so they did not know what to expect at first and hoped they would have an increase in the conversion rates of their first client, but even they hadn’t thought the increase would be this great. By making a webpage personally relevant for each visitor of your website, they will be more eager on clicking links, products, other pages etc. Not only your home page has to be changed, you can change any page on your website to make sure every visitor gets to see what you want these specific target groups to see. Whether they are interested in a certain sport, whether they are first time visitors or returning visitors, whether they visit your website in the morning, midday or evening, there are plenty of possibilities. I did not write this to promote his product, this is purely because I greatly believe in the relevance of personalisation and because it is a great fit to your question.

These team members were in charge of setting up the actual step by step layout of each “sub-process”.Finally, each team member was in charge of slowly documenting the “best practices” of our processes into our knowledge management system (KMS). This allows us to document how to complete each specific process in the most efficient and uniform way possible.Once the documentation was to a point where it was easy to follow and recreate, it was shared with our team.Now that we have the majority of our info in our system and have provided it to our respective team members, we’ve minimized the problem of repeat or “how do I…” questions. We’ve also allowed the opportunity for our teams to add in comments to suggest updates to our content so that it’s constantly evolving and we’re learning together vs individually. If you’re looking to optimize the processes of your team, you must first make sure that they know what that information is. Additionally, optimization requires updates so you must make this available as an option.

Classified ads can direct people to a specific website or webpage (the word exists as one or two words, i.e., ‘web page’). They can also attract people who seek further information.

Classified ads can direct people to a specific website or webpage (the word exists as one or two words, i.e., ‘web page’). They can also attract people who seek further information. Social media In the world of Internet marketing, social media is a marketing tool where you try to develop an interactive online relationship with consumers. Your aim is not, for example, to surreptitiously mine customer data. Blogging, posting, sharing and tweeting are popular social media marketing tools. Media sharing, pinning, bookmarking, and commenting on social media websites are also popular. Internet marketing refers to marketing that only occurs online. Search engine optimization (SEO) and online advertising are examples of Internet marketing. There are several ways to increase your SEO. One of the first steps is to secure a reliable and simple domain name that is relevant to your site, industry, or keywords you want to match for. Search engine optimization refers to techniques to increase one’s website’s appearance on search engines. Surveys Surveys are useful for determining which products to create and also for improving or upgrading existing goods. The word ‘goods‘ in this context means ‘products.’ Surveys are also useful if you want to rate your and your rivals’ products. A survey can ask a representative sample of consumers what they like about your and your competitors’ products. You can carry out a survey face-to-face, on the telephone, by normal post, or online. Most marketing professionals will mention surveys when you ask them to list their most important marketing tools. Google Analytics If you have an online business or your company has a website, Google Analytics is extremely useful. It gives you an overview of where your visitors are coming from. It also tells you what type of people are visiting, and which content on your website performs best. You can also use Google Analytics to work out visitor conversions. This data will help you set up conversion goals. Direct mail Direct mail or direct mail marketing specifically targets potential customers. Traditionally, we have referred to the letters as ‘mailshots.’ Ever since the advent of the Internet and emails, we also have ’emailshots.’ Regarding emailshots, Media Training | Training the Content Creators | London says: “Designing an emailshot differs from creating a webpage or designing for print as you have to consider the specific needs of your target audience and the technical requirements of different email applications.” This brings us to modern-day email marketing tools which many marketers still consider to be more effective than other types of digital marketing. Media monitoring tools These marketing tools scan the web and inform you of conversations that are relevant to your company, product, or brand. These tools scan, for example, social media sites, forums, blogs, and videos. In a Huffington Post article, Matthew Collis, a marketing and communications professional, makes the following comment: “Media monitoring lets you discover what people are saying about you online so you can jump in and respond or react to conversations, decrease the spread of negative PR, and even help increase awareness of your product, service, or organization.” Customer loyalty programs Customer loyalty refers to the likelihood that existing customers keep coming back. In other words, how frequently customers come back for more again and again. It differs from brand loyalty. Among marketing tools that many small businesses overlook, customer loyalty programs are one of the most common. This is a pity. It is much cheaper and requires less time to get an existing customer to buy your products than new ones. Some studies suggest that it costs seven times more to get a new customer to buy from you than an existing one. Automation Automation tools are marketing tools that save a lot of time. Marketers can save time wasted doing those daily tasks like saving files and emails to spreadsheets. Some tools allow you to create chains of applets. In other words, simple conditional statements or ‘if this then that’ statements. IFTTT (IF This Then That) is one of those services. It works with Facebook, Twitter, Fitbit, Google Drive, and Gmail. There are hundreds of marketing tools out there. They all sound fantastic when you read about them. Many of them are fantastic! However, be careful. You will only need a few of them. Be selective.

Each paid channel has its pros and cons, so think carefully about your objectives before you reach for your credit card. 2. Get Social It’s not enough to produce great content and hope that people find it – you have to be proactive. One of the best ways to increase traffic to your website is to use social media channels to promote your content. Twitter is ideal for short, snappy (and tempting) links, whereas Google+ promotion can help your site show up in personalized search results and seems especially effective in B2B niches. If you’re a B2C product company, you might find great traction with image-heavy social sites like Pinterest and Instagram. Here's more advice on making the most of social media marketing. 3. Pay Attention to On-Page SEO Think SEO is dead? Think again. Optimizing your content for search engines is still a valuable and worthwhile practice. Are you making the most of image alt text? Are you creating internal links to new content? What about meta descriptions? Optimizing for on-page SEO doesn’t have to take ages, and it could help boost your organic traffic. 4. Target Long-Tail Keywords Got your high commercial intent keyword bases covered? Then it’s time to target long-tail keywords, too. Long-tail keywords account for a majority of web searches, meaning that if you’re not targeting them as part of your paid search or SEO efforts, you’re missing out. There are quite a few more tips, but it would take ages for me to write it all, so I’ll just recommend Babylon Traffic if all else fails, as they provide a great service for increasing your site traffic. 1.

I had these experiences and more over the past few years which has actually formed my opinion. Flipkart Flipkart (company) It was back in 2013 I think when my younger brother wanted to gift me something as I'd just got placed during my MBA college placement process. He knew I was fond of gadgets and hence decided to get me a battery bank. He bought it from Flipkart and the brand in question was Intex. I was delighted with it and immediately started using it. But to my dismay, though the rating was around 5000 mAH, the battery wasn't lasting even for 2500 mAH. It couldn't properly charge my phone once. And I'm a geek of sorts so I'm obviously aware that there is some loss of power when the battery bank is in use, due to power leakage etc. But the effective rating was still around 4000 mAH, and I wasn't even getting 2500. This was within 2 days and I called up the customer care number. When I related my problem I was rudely told that at most I can get a replacement. But I insisted for a refund. That was because I did not again want a faulty product and deal with the hassle of returning it etc. But I was told that I cannot get a refund. I fought my way through and finally got them agreed for a refund. The product was collected soon and I got my refund in about a week. Amazon Amazon India (amazon.in) The next year, 2014, I was looking to buy a new phone. Having already had some 'not so satisfying' experiences on Flipkart, Snapdeal etc I did not want to risk it with them. I zeroed in on the Nokia Lumia 1520 (an amazing piece of tech then) and looked for the best deal. Online was naturally cheaper than the brick and mortar stores. The phone was costing around Rs 38k. I made up my mind and ordered the same from Amazon. I also ordered a screen protector for the same from Amazon as I'm always particular about protecting my gadgets. I got the phone in 2 days and was it gorgeous. I fell in love with it quite literally! But I'm nothing if not a stickler for perfection when it comes to gadgets. I noticed within a few hours that there was a slight bluish stain on the screen. This was only visible when the screen was completely white so it would show on the screen, like setting a white theme or a light wallpaper. Now at first I thought it was an ink spot or something similar and tried to wipe it off with water etc. But to no avail. Then I thought that I can hardly notice it so why think of it much. And it isn't affecting the functioning of the phone in any way. Plus I really had to look for the stain on a white screen to even see it! I thought I was being paranoid and to just let it be. But a few days later and this thought always nagged at me that there was definitely some issue. So finally I decided to give in and call the customer care. But the main thing to note, it had already been a week since I got the phone. There was no way on earth that they were going to honour anything. And Amazon did not have that refundable or returnable tag on gadgets or appliances like it does nowadays. So I called up customer care with pretty much no hope and told them about my issue and how I tried to get rid of it but couldn't. I thought at most I could ask for a replacement. But the guy on the line told me that they'll collect the phone in the next 3 business days and I could have my money refunded and then buy the phone again if I wanted! I was flabbergasted. I first confirmed that that was what he said. Then I thought as I already had an advantage why not push it home. I told him that I had also bought a screen protector that was now applied on the phone and it actually had costed a 1000 bucks then. Nilkin frosted glass screen protector. He told me that they could refund that amount into my Amazon account and I could shop for whatever I wanted with that money. I was overjoyed, to say the least. The very next day the phone was collected from me and within 24 hours I got Rs 38k refunded back to my bank account. That really made me trust Amazon in a big way. Lessons to be learnt You can get all kinds of products on both retailers, but it is about the after sales service that counts. Flipkart hangs you out to dry if you buy a product from their platform. They are not responsible for anything. Amazon takes care and acts on what you say if it's a genuine concern.The above experience was just one example. I have had multiple experiences like these where Amazon has always come through and the experience with Flipkart has always been left wanting.Lastly whenever you speak with an Amazon customer care executive, they speak to you in a way that makes you feel you're in charge and that they're doing all they can to satisfy you. Flipkart on the other hand feels like you are requesting them to take a look at your issue with no guarantee that they will.I am aware that different people will have had different experiences, but this is based on what I have experienced for a very long time now. Amazon fan boy forever. Edit Amazon (company) Having shopped on Amazon India and having had a good experience, I also ventured into shopping on Amazon US for some products which either aren't available in India or cost a lot when you try to buy from India rather than from the original source itself. As it happened I had ordered the Nvidia Shield Android TV box from Amazon US as the seller on Amazon India was selling it for over 30k and I could get it from Amazon US for just over 20k including the shipping and customs. As it happened I opted for the standard shipping as I did not want to spend extra just to get my product a few days early. I could wait a week or ten days. On the day that the product was supposed to be shipped I checked my account but the product still hadn't shipped. I called up the Amazon US customer care and asked them the same. What I hadn't fully taken into account was the time difference between the US and India and hence it was still some time before the product would be shipped and all was on track. But the Amazon executive on the other end told me that, “As you are concerned about the product shipping and reaching you on time, I will move you up from standard shipping to our prime expedited shipping. This amount will be charged from your card initially but will later get refunded”. I was so pleasantly surprised. And it happened exactly that way. Around Rs 2.5k was debited from my card, I got the product within 2 days and then the 2.5k got refunded to my card in another 2 days. So I got prime shipping, not just at a discounted price, but free of cost! I'd like to mention a case in point for both the e-retailers.

There are a plethora of pricing-related software available for retailers to optimize their prices. For those who simply want important data analysis on pricing information, market conditions, and other important factors that go into making a pricing strategy, retailers can use price tracking software. This tool can go by several names, from market auditing software, competitive data, competitive analysis software, and more. They all essentially do the same thing; collecting important data on the pricing and sometimes non-pricing factors of key competitors and of the retailer, and analyzing it all to help the retailer better understand things like their price positioning, and show them potential opportunities to increase or decrease prices for better sales and revenue increases. You can go a step further and use price optimization software as well. Price optimization software typically uses advanced algorithms to give price recommendations for a retailer’s products. These price recommendations are based on several years of price and purchasing data, which are analyzed to produce increasingly accurate predictions of what the best prices could be for a given product. What makes price optimization software so efficient for retailers is that it can assess relationships between various products and their sales and many other details that are often missed when retailers attempt to optimize their prices manually. If any of these technologies sound interesting to you, I’d recommend you check out our company, Competera, which provides all of the aforementioned software for retailers both in-store and online. We even offer a trial of our products so you can try them out risk-free. You can also check out some reviews to see whether our solutions might be what you’re looking for.

In addition to these two drivers, online retailis also driven by traffic from search engines. It is not unusual for customers to follow a link insearch engine results, and land up on an ecommerce website that they have never heard of. This additional source of traffic can be the tipping point for some ecommerce businesses. 3. Lower Costs One of the most tangible positives of ecommerce is the lowered cost. A part of these lowered costs could be passed on to customers in the form of discounted prices. Here are some of the ways that costs can be reduced with ecommerce: Advertising and MarketingOrganic search engine traffic, pay-per-click, and social media traffic are some of the advertising channels that can be cost-effective.PersonnelThe automation of checkout, billing, payments, inventory management, and other operational processes, lowers the number of employees required to run an ecommerce setup.Real EstateThis one is a no-brainer. An ecommerce merchant does not need a prominent physical location.Ads HDFC™ Home Loan Online home-loans.hdfc.com/EMI_Calculator Lowest Interest Rates of 9.40%*p.a. Lower EMI of just Rs.834/Lakh! 4. Locate the Product Quicker It is no longer about pushing a shopping cart to the correct aisle, or scouting for the desired product. On an ecommerce website, customers can click through intuitive navigation or use a search box to immediately narrow down their product search. Some websites remember customer preferences and shopping lists to facilitate repeat purchase. 5. Eliminate Travel Time and Cost It is not unusual for customers to travel long distances to reach their preferred physical store. Ecommerce allows them to visit the same store virtually, with a few mouse clicks. 6. Provide Comparison Shopping Ecommerce facilitates comparison shopping. There are several online services that allow customers to browse multiple ecommerce merchants and find the best prices. 7. Enable Deals, Bargains, Coupons, and Group Buying Though there are physical equivalents to deals, bargains, coupons, and group buying, online shopping makes it much more convenient. For instance, if a customer has a deep discount coupon for turkey at one physical store and toilet paper at another, she may find it infeasible to avail of both discounts. But the customer could do that online with a few mouse-clicks. 8. Provide Abundant Information There are limitations to the amount of information that can be displayed in a physical store. It is difficult to equip employees to respond to customers who require information across product lines. Ecommerce websites can make additional information easily available to customers. Most of this information is provided by vendors and does not cost anything to create or maintain. 9. Create Targeted Communication Using the information that a customer provides in the registration form, and by placing cookies on the customer's computer, an ecommerce merchant can access a lot of information about its customers. This, in turn, can be used to communicate relevant messages. An example: If you are searching for a certain product on Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more, you will automatically be shown listings of other similar products. In addition, Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more may also email you about related products. 10. Remain Open All the Time Store timings are now 24/7/365. Ecommerce websites can run all the time. From the merchant's point of view, this increases the number of orders they receive. From the customer's point of view, an ""always open"" store is more convenient. 11. Create Markets for Niche Products Buyers and sellers of niche products can find it difficult to locate each other in the physical world. Online, it is only a matter of the customer searching for the product in a search engine. One example could be the purchase of obsolete parts. Instead of trashing older equipment for lack of spares, today we can locate parts online with great ease. 11 Reasons Ecommerce Is Taking the Retail World by Storm 1.

I’m going to try and give three advantages and disadvantages, and then give some use cases where competitor based pricing is a good idea. When people talk about “competitor based pricing” they usually mean that they’re going to look at a competitor’s website or catalog, write down their prices, slap on either a premium or discount from the competitor price, and call that their new price. A common twist is to look at multiple competitors and average their prices to come up with what you want to charge. Advantages It’s straightforward to explain. Everyone from the CEO down to the interns get the idea of benchmarking, so it is easier to get buy-in from various groups. The change management piece of any new pricing process is usually tougher than the math/statistics that go into setting the price. I’ve seen (and unfortunately been a part) of too many pricing regime changes that have fancy math but ultimately crash and burn because they can’t clearly be explained, thus they can’t get buy-in.It’s relatively easy to do. There are a host of tools and companies that can help automate the web scraping process. Or if you only have a handful of products you can look yourself, especially if you’re only looking once every quarter or less. Once you get the data it’s quick to make a determination on where you want to be priced relative to the competition.It places blame elsewhere. Ok, this point is uncharitable of me but I’m adding it anyway. Put yourself in a pricing manager’s shoes. If you benchmark the competition and lose a bid/quote, well then it must be some other department’s fault because it can’t be the price. Thus the pricing department is blameless and should keep their jobs.Disadvantages It assumes competitors are priced correctly. A few other people have already pointed this out, but it bears repeating. Using the competitor price assumes that they’ve priced correctly. How do you know that they’re even in the ballpark?! It completely takes pricing power out of your hands.It leaves money on the table. If you’re matching competitor pricing, then you’re implicitly saying you’re no different than they are and end up having to compete on price. You ignore everything else that makes up your firm’s value, such as fast turnaround time, seamless EDI integration, superior service, generous return policy, excellent technical support, etc. You’re not capturing the value for these positive attributes that you bring to the table. Moreover, you don’t understand what customers really value about you.The devil is in the details. It’s easy to fall down the rabbit hole when you get into the nitty-gritty of matching products to competitors. How do you match your private label to their national brand, or vice versa? What about if you have a different national brand than they do (such as Adidas vs. Nike)? What if you can’t match on a UPC or manufacturer part number? Do you need text-based machine learning to parse material descriptions to find matches? What if you have red and the competitor has blue? What if you charge for shipping as an extra line item whereas the competitor bundles shipping into the price of the item? The point is that there is a lot that goes on below the surface when it comes to benchmarking competitor prices. Many times the picture is not as clear as one would hope, even after you answer all of those little questions.Use Cases Cost Check - If matching a competitor’s price would put your margin very low or negative, then it could be an indication that they are receiving a better cost than you are. You would want to take it up with the supplier.List Price - In a list-and-discount model, where you use competitor list prices to determine the “starting point.” From there you would use your internal data to set appropriate discounts. Bonus points if you show your customer their negotiated price versus your list and the comp list upon logging into your site.Marketing Comparison - I’ve seen this done on flyers and marketing emails. It says something like “Seen elsewhere for $499” and shows your price at $399. I thought it was clever because it anchors the consumer’s frame of reference to $499, meaning your $399 is a bargain.Part of the Puzzle - Whether you hire someone onto your staff or farm the work out to a third party, benchmarking will cost a pretty penny. You need to make sure you’re getting enough value out of the effort. If you’re only getting price data back, it’s probably not enough to justify the cost. However, if you’re getting competitor part numbers, stocking levels, an understanding of competitor product breadth, etc., then it’s probably worth the effort to also collect price. One great use case I’ve seen is in alternate search. If a customer seraches for a competitor part number on your site, you can have one of your products as a result instead of returning a null.Part of the Puzzle, Part 2 - If you’re running a multiple regression model (probably to find price elasticity) you could use the spread between your price and a competitor’s price as one input variable. No guarantees that it will be statistically significant.Setting a Range - Saying that you looked at five competitors and see prices ranging from $150 to $185 is great because it gives a general idea of where you need to be to win. It gives you flexibility to price either toward the top, middle or bottom of the range. It’s vastly different from saying you looked at one competitor and need to be at exactly $162.25. What if you accidentally benchmark the outlier? How much can you deviate from that price?Starting Point - If you’re just starting out in an industry and don’t know where to price, might as well look at your competitors for guidance. The expectation is that as you get sufficient sales under your belt you will get a better feel for the niche you serve and will understand where you need to be priced to win.

I have selected the part relevant for the question but feel free to check out the full article in the link.  Cryptocurrency trading has exploded in recent years as it shows tremendous potential and opportunities. It is true that it is still in its baby form which means there are still many areas to explore and exploit. In this article, we will first understand the logic behind cryptocurrencies before creating an indicator and back-testing its profitability as a systematic trading strategy. Quick Introduction to Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies (Cryptography + Currencies) are a form of electronic money created with the intent to facilitate some tasks and transfers. As the name suggests, they are usually associated with the fact of hiding one’s identity. As there is no middle man between the transactions, the costs tend to be cheaper than government-issued fiat currencies. In order to ensure authenticity and avoid fraud, users can record and verify at the same time their transactions as well as the transactions of others. These recordings are known as ledgers and are public to everyone for transparency purposes. The first cryptocurrency is the well known Bitcoin, created by the simultaneously known and unknown Satoshi Nakamoto.  Bitcoin in USD terms -BTCUSD. (Image by Author) Nowadays, there are a lot of cryptocurrencies trading with the known ones such as BTCUSD and ETHUSD and the lesser known ones such as Cardano and Dogecoin.  The next part will discuss the indicator we will be creating from scratch before applying it to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Finally, we will be able to evaluate the efficiency of the strategy we have created. Creating the Indicator Crypto trading is constantly evolving and many traders are interested in diversifying their knowledge and portfolios by including cryptocurrencies. This has prompted an explosion in the number of trades, thus, lowering costs and giving way to more liquidity. We will present an indicator that I have found to work quite well on cryptocurrencies within given risk management conditions. Let us first present the intuition of the indicator. Every action must have a reaction and therefore an up move should have a corrective down move. The question is: When and what is the magnitude? The answer to that question is complicated but we can try to approach it with simple tools. Perfection is non-existent in financial dictionnaries but by time we can reach satisfactory strategies if we remain focused and disciplined. This formula can also be found when calculating the Relative Vigor Index and thus I take no credit in it, also I have named it temporarily the Real Range Indicator until I find out if it exists already or not (in that case, all credits go to its creator). The Real Range Indicator is calculated following this formula:  Image by Author. The function in Python is very simple. We have to use it on an OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) array, then the function will select a column using the where variable and then apply the formula. Remember that the fourth column Data[i, 3] refers to the closing price, the first column Data[i, 0] refers to the opening price, the second column Data[i, 1] refers to the high, and the third column Data[i, 2] refers to the low. This is because Python’s indexing starts at zero. [PYTHON CODE GOES HERE BUT DUE TO FORMATTING ISSUES CAN BE FOUND IN THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE LINK ON MEDIUM, SORRY]  BTCUSD versus the RRI. (Image by Author) It looks like we can form a boundary around 0.75 and -0.75 and this seems to work on other pairs as well. This is to be expected considering the formula of the RRI. Hence, the trading conditions can be the following: Go long (Buy) whenever the RRI reaches -0.75 with the previous value being above -0.75. Hold this position until getting another signal or getting closed out due to risk management mentioned above.Go short (Sell) whenever the oscillator reaches 0.75 with the previous value being less than 0.75. Hold this position until getting another signal or getting closed out due to risk management mentioned above.[PYTHON CODE GOES HERE BUT DUE TO FORMATTING ISSUES CAN BE FOUND IN THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE LINK ON MEDIUM, SORRY] Also, to make this a trading system rather than just systematic signals, I will add a risk management component using the Exponential Average True Range that we have seen together in previous articles. Back-testing the Strategy The way I use systematic strategies is to give the algorithms space to breathe and therefore I violate my very own first rule of risk-reward ratio. I generally target 1x eATR and risk 4x eATR as opposed to the normal target at 2x ATR and stop a 1x ATR. The entry triggers will be based on signals generated following the above conditions and the exit triggers are initiated whenever we reach the target, get stopped-out, or get another signal. The first back-test done on the BTCUSD using M15 data since November 2019 has given the following results:  Performance Summary Table. (Image by Author) Now, let us analyze more the performance. Given that we have imposed a low risk-reward ratio by forcing the stop-loss orders to be four times as big as the profit orders, the hit ratio is naturally high around 66%. The expectancy is a measure that takes into account the historical average gain and loss per trade weighed by the hit ratio and thus, every time we initiate a trade, we can expect to gain $3.42. The profit factor must be above 1.00 which is the case. It is simply the gross profit over the gross loss. The realized risk-reward ratio was 0.60 which is much lower than the minimum optimal ratio of 2.00. The trades were numerous with 6700 in a year. And finally, the break-even hit ratio is the minimum ratio we must obtain to be profitable. As long as it is less than the realized hit ratio, we can expect to have a winning strategy.

More than an investment, cryptocurrencies are an ongoing technology and socioeconomic experiment. As a result, the blockchain space is booming with new opportunities like being able to invest on Platform like Cryptobroker Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptobroker.store) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 30days. With an approximate market cap of $280 billion, rest assured that this industry is here to stay. This new industry is constantly evolving, therefore the earlier you get acquainted with it, the higher your chance are of benefiting from its future development. The most recent price rally was the most valiant effort yet by bulls, who for the first time since Bitcoin set its all-time high of $20,000 back in December 2017, painted a higher high on Bitcoin price charts. That higher high, according to one prominent crypto analyst, was the confirmation traders and investors everywhere were waiting for: a confirmation that the bottom is in.According to Dave the Wave, the long-term trend chartist says that the higher high was indeed confirmation that the bottom of the current bear market is in, and that a series of higher lows are expected in the coming months, until Bitcoin continues its ascent upward.Above here, Bitcoin’s next major resistance will be around $6,000 – resistance that was formerly incredibly strong support that was repeatedly tested throughout the bear market. Due to how much price action occurred around the range, the resistance will be insanely powerful. However, should Bitcoin breach $6K, most of the market will consider the bear market to be over.Analyst: Don’t Expect New All-Time Highs TomorrowWhile the analyst does appear confident in his assessment the bottom is in, he does warn investors not to expect new all-time highs “tomorrow.” If the current bear market plays out anything like the last one, Bitcoin should continue to range between here and the previous range for an extended accumulation period. Resistance at $6,000 will be the key to Bitcoin resuming a bullish trend, as investors and traders will view a break of the important price level as a signal bearish sell pressure is dwindling and that buyers have resumed control.From there, crypto investors expect that Bitcoin may some day reach hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars per BTC.

Bitcoin has continuously proven itself to be the greatest investment of the decade. Before you buy Bitcoin you need to make sure you are ready for it. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset and if you buy at the top and sell at the bottom you can lose a lot of money. For instance, if you bought Bitcoin in December 2017 at 19,223 you could have given up and sold it at 3,500 USD in December 2018; that would be an 82% loss. However, the market is now back up to 28,828 so if you bought at 19,233 you would have a 66% return on investment. My personal rule of thumb is that if you can’t afford to buy Bitcoin and hold it for five years or longer you shouldn’t buy it. If you end up needing extra money because of an emergency and have to sell your Bitcoin it just might not happen at a good time. What if someone put their whole life savings into Bitcoin on December 2017 and then desperately needed the money in 2018? They would have lost 82% of their life savings! If you don’t have enough money in savings to cover emergency expenses you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you don’t have healthcare you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you have a large and expected expense coming up you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you are not emotionally stable you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.If you can’t buy Bitcoin and hold onto it for years even though it’s losing value than you shouldn’t buy Bitcoin.I bought my first piece of Bitcoin on January 2018 at 10,000 USD. It took the market until June 2019 to get back to that price and there was no significant profit to make until December 2020. If you are buying Bitcoin you need to be OK with the fact that there will be another bear market and you will see your portfolio lose value.

No one can actually know the answer to this! However now you know why I went back and looked at the past, as we already have that historical data recorded, and can use it to our benefit. Its a very astute way to work out what could be coming down the track. Basically that means we can get a little looking glass as to what could be coming in the future. As you know nothing goes up in a straight line. There was a parabolic rise at the end of 2017 and what goes up, must come back down. Normally periods of horrific selling off, is when value investors come in and buy up bitcoin back on the cheap.

Today bitcoin is trading at - $10155 Bitcoin is still in its infancy, I can assure you of that but when BAKKT goes online later in the year, many institutes will start talking, and I feel in the future bitcoin could be a part of every institutional investors' portfolio.

Ripple currently relies on the power of the ISO20022 standardization within RippleNet.  Ripple is currently the second-largest fintech firm in the US, behind Stripe, which is valued at $35 billion. Ripple is ahead of Coinbase in terms of valuation, which is valued at $8.1 billion and stands in third place. The growth of Ripple has been due to the entrance in the market of the international transaction infrastructure, especially the global remittance market. XRP is currently held by Ripple and is locked in escrow, where one billion XRP is released to Ripple each month. This has been part of Ripple’s strategy that began in 2017 when the company decided it would not sell its XRP all at once. According to a well-known crypto analyst, the price development of XRP is extremely bullish, given that it is the only project that is relentlessly pursuing the regulation of cryptocurrencies. XRP may potentially benefit massively once a legal framework for cryptocurrencies has been set in place in the United States. The analyst said: “The only project in the entire market that is pushing for Crypto Regulations is $XRP. They know that once these regulations are added, it will completely annihilate almost every other altcoin, and make XRP’s demand skyrocket.” Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency has been continuously criticized by the crypto community for being “too centralized,” as Ripple holds too large of a share of XRP. Jed McCaleb, Ripple’s co-founder has sold 1 billion XRP, however, he still controls around 5 percent of the altcoin’s supply. Many have referred to Ripple to a PayPal account than to a cryptocurrency system like Bitcoin. The analyst added: “Many criticize XRP for being “too centralized”, although this transparency is what governments like. While other projects are focused on getting a quick batch of new investors to exit scam, Ripple has quietly been working with government agencies to ensure compliance.” Ripple has previously criticized Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism, proof-of-work (PoW), which has a major downside of contributing to the vast amounts of energy consumed for validating blocks on its network. To add more,many people do not know there are platforms that helps in the growth of cryptocurrency.For example,investing your coin on a platform like cryptomax(www.cryptomx.tech)where your invested coin will be doubled in 7 days.Try it and thank me latter. Ripple still lacks adoption Recently, Spanish bank Santander has been hesitant to adopt the XRP crypto on its international payment network due to the low adoption of the cryptocurrency. The Spanish banking giant has expressed concern about Ripple’s token, XRP, and its low usage saying the XRP token “was not actively traded in enough markets” to support the firm’s requirements for its innovative One Pay FX payments network.",2021-03-06T19:43:42.849Z,"What cryptocurrencies are on the rise now?

Investors Celebrate as Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Above $6,000 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up 2.6% at its current price of $6,080, up slightly from its daily lows of $5,900 which were set yesterday. Over a one-week period, BTC has been able to surge significantly, climbing from lows of $5,500 to highs around its current price levels, marking a major extension of the upwards momentum that the cryptocurrency incurred in early-April when Bitcoin swiftly surged from the low-$4,000 region and into the $5,000 region. Although the recent series of price surges have been undoubtedly bullish, analysts are still warning traders to express caution before “fomo-ing” into the crypto, as a retrace may be inevitable. Lucid TA, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, expressed this sentiment in a recent tweet, noting that traders should closely watch for the next retrace, as it may mark a great entry opportunity for fresh long-positions. “A reminder to those feeling fear and FOMO – $BTC always retraces. Major spills are par for the course. Expect them, and don’t be shaken by them. They can provide excellent buying opportunities for those who are able to retain their conviction,” he said, referencing the below chart.

 A Pullback May Ensue After BTC Hits $6,400 As for what price level may spark the next retrace, there is a general consensus amongst analysts that $6,400 will be the next level of strong resistance that BTC faces, which could lead to a drop that elucidates whether or not $6,000 has become a level of support. “$BTC > $6000. Mission accomplished. Next level is $6400, the most traded price of 2018,” Alex Krüger, a popular economist who focuses on cryptocurrencies, explained in a recent tweet.

 Twitter Ads info and privacy Josh Rager, another popular crypto analyst on Twitter, echoed Krüger’s thoughts, explaining that he believes $6,450 is an “epic” resistance level that, if flipped into a support level, would be “insanely bullish” for the cryptocurrency. “The most epic $BTC resistance awaits. Don’t think BTC blasts through this area easily, this resistance is bearishly strong.

Enthusiasts say buying bitcoin will become harder and therefore make it more valuable, but others say it will stop being decentralised. A bitcoin mining session originally created 50 bitcoins, then it dropped to 25 and then 12.5. Some forecast by 2020 it will fall to 6.25 bitcoins which will make mining unprofitable. Blockchain-analysis company Chainalysis estimates 2.78 million to 3.79 million bitcoins worth $50 billion at current prices have already been lost forever. But bitcoin enthusiasts say this will result in a rapid surge in prices to upwards of $100,000 per token.

The cyber currency is the most popular and most expensive coin on the market. Other cryptocurrencies ripple, bitcoin cash and ethereum are all valued between $238 and $2,347.  GETTY A bitcoin mining session originally created 50 bitcoins Experts believe one person may have been solely responsible for the massive surge in the value of bitcoin which saw its value increase from $150 (£108) to $1,000 (£720) in just two months. New research from economists Neil Gandal, JT Hamrick, Tyler Moore, and Tali Oberman indicates it is likely bitcoin’s price was manipulated by just one or two major players. The lack of regulation of the cryptocurrency means it has always been susceptible to manipulation.  On Tuesday the cryptocurrency was trading at $13,228 But economists indicate it could be possible a single player was responsible for the fraudulent trading, according to the Journal of Monetary Economics. The apparent increase in trading will have encouraged others to get involved in buying and selling bitcoin, despite many transactions not really existing.

It was rated 7.3/10 by IMDB and 61% by Rotten Tomatoes. The collections of the movie was $219.4 million. The story of the full 128 minutes movie ist that Viktor Navorski, a traveler from Krakozhia, arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid due to the sudden outbreak of a civil war in his homeland. As a result, the United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation, and he is no longer permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now considered to be stateless. Due to his inability to communicate in proper English, the airport's branch of the US Customs and Border Protection seize both his passport and airline ticket, whereupon its temporary director, Frank Dixon, makes him stay in the terminal he came through. Left with no other choice, Viktor decides to settle in at a closed off section of the terminal, Gate 67, with only his luggage and a peanut can, soon making a home out of it. Much to the frustration of Dixon, who is being considered for promotion to director of the US Customs branch, Viktor chooses not to break out of the terminal but wait patiently until he can legally enter the United States. Dixon, who wants him to illegally attempt to enter the country so he can deport him, decides to try finding ways to make it difficult for him to survive in the terminal, slowly becoming obsessed in doing so. During his initial days at the terminal, Viktor encounters and helps out a flight attendant named Amelia Warren after she slips on a wet floor and breaks the heel of her shoes, who assumes he is a contractor of sorts from the pager he was given by Customs but is surprised by his respectful kindness to her. When Viktor is unable to secure himself some food after Dixon cuts him off from an avenue of money, his plight is noticed by a food service worker at the airport, Enrique Cruz, who offers him food in exchange for helping in learning more about an immigration officer that he is infatuated with, Dolores Torres. After meeting with Amelia once again and wanting to take her out for a meal, Viktor begins improving his English while attempting to find work, and is soon hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation. During this time, he also befriends some of Enrique's friends whom he plays poker with, including a cargo handler named Joe Mulroy, and an Indian janitor named Gupta Rajan, learning from the latter that he had come to the States in order to avoid being arrested for assaulting a corrupt police officer back in India in 1979. When a Russian traveler creates a delicate situation when Customs try to remove the medicine he is carrying for his father, Dixon is annoyed when Viktor, whom he uses to persuade the man to leave the medicine behind, claims he misheard his Krakozhian dialect for ""father"" as ""goat"" so the traveler can leave with them. Shortly after the traveler leaves, Dixon strong-arms him over a photocopier, nearly blowing his chance for promotion, before later promising Viktor that he will never let him leave the airport. When the airport employees hear from Gupta of the incident in customs with the Russian and what Viktor did, Viktor finds himself respected and admired for his kind-hearted actions, with many stores showing off photocopied images of his hand that had been accidentally made. When Viktor meets with Amelia once again and takes her out for a meal, he slowly begins taking an interest with her, even wooing her, before offering to surprise her with a gift when she returns, based on his recent knowledge of Napoleon, soon creating a majestic fountain. After helping Enrique finally marry Torres, Viktor awaits the arrival of Amelia. Unbeknown to him, Dixon pulls her aside to question her about Viktor, revealing his true situation in the process. Feeling that he lied to her, Amelia confronts Viktor in Gate 67, shocked at his predicament, and tries to learn why he came to New York. Agreeing to tell her, Viktor reveals the contents of the peanut can he was carrying, explaining that his late father, a jazz enthusiast, had discovered the famous portrait, ""A Great Day in Harlem"", in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958, where after spending a week looking at it, he vowed he would collect the signatures of all 57 of the jazz musicians featured on it. Viktor reveals that the can contains not only a copy of the portrait, but the autographs of all the musicians his father received, but one - tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. After his father died, Viktor had promised to collect the last signature by coming to New York to find Golson. After hearing his story, Amelia kisses Viktor. After having spent nine months in the terminal, Viktor is awakened by his friends who give him news that the war in Krakozhia has ended. Overjoyed, he celebrates in an airport bar, where Amelia meets with him and explains that a man she had been having an affair with, a government official, helped her to secure Viktor with a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream. While delighted, Viktor is saddened when he learns that her ""friend"" did so in order to renew their relationship. Despite this, Viktor heads off to Customs with renewed hope of going to New York, only to find that Dixon must sign the visa. Seizing the opportunity, Dixon instructs Viktor to go home to Krakozhia, threatening to cause trouble for Viktor's friends by deporting them if he refuses. Unwilling to let that happen, he agrees to do so, despite his friends offering to prevent this happening. When Gupta, assuming he was acting a coward, learns of the situation he was put into, he decides to take the burden off Viktor by running in front of the plane to Krakozhia as it taxies to the terminal, choosing to let himself be deported back to his home country in order to let his friend go to New York. Dixon, shocked by this, attempts to stop Viktor leaving as he receives gifts from employees for his trip into the city, but is thwarted by his Custom agents, who allow him to leave. As Viktor leaves, seeing Amelia once more before taking a taxi, Dixon decides to finally not pursue him further. Meanwhile, Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing, and finally collects the last autograph. As he steps into a taxi and places the last signature into the can, he soon tells the driver, ""I am going home."" Thanks for reading.

No. If they are going to use this token as Ripple wants them to, they’ll cut a deal directly, buy over the counter and that won’t affect Coinmarketcap’s price, which is what you and I want.

Banks are testing out the network with Fiat currencies but there is no indication that they are settling any transactions using XRP. You’ll have guessed by now, I ain’t a fan of Ripple. They are a centralised entity. They hold over 60% of their Tokens. It’s a B2B coin not a cryptocurrency. If thats your thing, I respect it. I just wanted you to have a opinion that goes against what is mostly said on XRP and you’ll make up your mind. Wish you the best of luck. My answer to your question is : I don’t know if XRP will ever recover to it’s all time high, and frankly I don’t believe anyone does at this point. The cryptomarket is like virtual Vegas at the end of the day. I don’t know. The question I ask myself is why is XRP at this price level in the first place ? I think it’s hype. I see in the answers below, that the project hasn’t changed, and that the client-base is growing. Sure. The project is still to help banks handle transactions by using RippleNet. They envision banks using XRP as a “bridge currency” to settle their transactions faster. Personally I don’t believe they will use it. Why ? Banks are in the business of money transactions. That is what they have been doing this for 400 hundred years.

The hash rate refers to your miner’s performance (i.e., how many guesses your computer can make per second). Hash rate can be measured in MH/s (mega hash per second), GH/s (giga hash per second), TH/s (terra hash per second), and even PH/s (peta hash per second). Bitcoin reward per block: The number of Bitcoins generated when a miner finds the solution. This number started at 50 bitcoins back in 2009, and it’s halved every 210,000 blocks (about four years). The current number of bitcoins awarded per block is 12.5. The last block-halving occurred in July 2016, and the next one will be in 2020. Mining difficulty: A number that represents how hard it is to mine bitcoins at any given moment considering the amount of mining power currently active in the system. Electricity cost: How many dollars are you paying per kilowatt? You’ll need to find out your electricity rate in order to calculate profitability. This can usually be found on your monthly electricity bill. The reason this is important is that miners consume electricity, whether for powering up the miner or for cooling it down (these machines can get really hot). Power consumption: Each miner consumes a different amount of energy. You’ll need to find out the exact power consumption of your miner before calculating profitability. This can be found easily with a quick search online or through this list. Power consumption is measured in watts. Pool fees: If you’re mining through a mining pool (you should), then the pool will take a certain percentage of your earnings for rendering their service. Generally, this would be somewhere around 2%. Bitcoin’s price: Since no one knows what Bitcoin’s price will be in the future, it’s hard to predict whether Bitcoin mining will be profitable. If you are planning to convert your mined bitcoins to any other currency in the future, this variable will have a significant impact on profitability. Difficulty increase per year: This is probably the most important and elusive variable of them all. The idea is that since no one can actually predict the rate of miners joining the network, neither can anyone predict how difficult it will be to mine in six weeks, six months, or six years from now. In fact, in all the time Bitcoin has existed, its profitability has dropped only a handful of times—even at times when the price was relatively low. The last two factors are the reason no one will ever be able to give a complete answer to the question “is Bitcoin mining profitable?” Once you have all of these variables at hand you can insert them into a Bitcoin mining calculator (as can be seen below) and get an estimate of how many Bitcoins you will earn each month. If you can’t get a positive result on the calculator, it probably means you don’t have the right conditions for mining to be profitable.",2021-03-06T19:48:49.161Z,"Is Bitcoin still profitable in 2019?

I love questions like this. I spent the first decade of my career analysing, profiting from and getting mildly traumatised by wild swings in financial markets — especially swings based less on fact and reason than on raw human emotion. There is no doubt that Bitcoin is currently in the final stage of a bubble (an “Elliott wave 5” to get technical). In a bubble, people switch off the rational side of their brains and buy based on two simple but powerful emotions: FEAR and GREED In a bubble, those who haven’t yet bought fear they’re missing out on an opportunity to get rich quick. So they buy, whatever the price. Because it can only go up, right? In a bubble, those who bought early and already made a paper profit are reluctant to sell. In case they miss out on MORE gains. So selling pressure dries up. Because it can only go up, right? More buyers and fewer sellers is what causes the price to rise so sharply. All conventional investments carry an idiot-proof warning: Past Performance Is Not Indicative Of Future Results. But in a bubble, FEAR and GREED mean that more and more buyers get sucked in. At gradually worse price levels. Otherwise intelligent people start behaving like complete idiots once their emotions take over. You start to hear people talk more about the inevitability of further price rises than about the value of the underlying asset. This is happening with Bitcoin in 2017. People buy not because they believe in the asset itself but because—they are certain—they will be able to sell next week or next month to a ‘greater fool’ at an even higher price. Even though buyers talk casually about Bitcoin being the future of money, without really knowing what they mean by that, nearly all buyers today are impulsive buyers. They decide they want to buy (out of FEAR) and then invent a coherent-sounding rationale after the event. (“It’s going to be ubiquitous by 2020”) Which is what generates price charts like the one below. (Thanks, Yahoo! Finance) See how the price rose so sharply from 1500 to over 5000.  Wait a minute, you may be thinking, Bitcoin hasn’t breached 5000 yet. That’s because this isn’t a Bitcoin chart. It shows the NASDAQ during the late 90s Dotcom bubble. In early 2000, people were buying Dotcom stock not because they believed that the internet was the future of business (which was true in 1996). People were buying from 1500 to 5000 because they were experiencing FEAR and GREED. When everyone else around you appears to be getting rich (on paper), it’s very hard to be the party pooper who shouts out “SELL!” But this is exactly what you should be doing if you’re lucky enough to have ridden the Bitcoin wave. It’s impossible to time the exact end of a bubble. But based on the current psychological signals, the Bitcoin bubble will pop soon. So what to do? Don’t be greedy: Convert your paper profits TODAY into cold hard cash gains and count yourself lucky. I’ve learnt this lesson the hard way too many times. Don’t assume it’s different this time. It’ll feel good, I promise. And if you haven’t bought yet and you’re fearful of missing out on Bitcoin, spare a thought for those who thought they were missing out on the NASDAQ boom in early 2000. The subsequent Dotcom crash wiped people out financially. Yes, the internet was the future of business. (It’s now the present.) But you had to get in early. The NASDAQ didn’t recover its 2000 levels until 2013!  There’s an easy parallel to be made: In the hope of making a quick buck today, do you want to end up sitting on your Bitcoin losses until 2030?

It isn’t a craze. Here are 15 Q&As to understand crypto well. Here is how to respond to those who are ignorant of the future, ranging from well-meaning family members to Nouriel Roubini types. 1. If they say: Crypto is for drug dealers. You respond: In the early days of the internet, many people had older relatives who listened disapprovingly to talk about “that internet thing” and declared that the internet was mainly about pornography (sure “hotmail” accounts are for exchanging information …) and declared that the only people who would adopt the internet would be perverts. The same mindset exists today for crypto. Remind them of these early day views and ask them: do you use the internet? Does that make you a pervert? If you want to buy drugs you are much better off doing that with money that is anonymous, like US dollars in cash. Say to them: let’s go do a little experiment. We’ll find some seedy inner-city street corner and find a drug dealer. I’ll try to pay in bitcoin and you offer dollars and we’ll see who gets the drugs. (And, make sure you livestream this on the internet so we can all watch the results). 2. If they say: But, you can buy drugs on this “dark web” I have heard about that is anonymous and cannot be traced by law enforcement. Terrible. You respond: Using a crypto currency is technically pseudo-anonymous, not anonymous like cash. And, use your brain: even if you did manage to buy drugs online, where are you doing to have them sent? To your home? Some “secret” mailbox? You think that is anonymous? Illegal transactions can certainly be traced; the simple proof is that a number of people have been arrested for these activities, just like in the physical world. Blame human nature if you want, not crypto. 3. If they say: Crypto does not meet the definition of money. You respond: It sure does. Essentially, money simply reflects the memory of something valuable that was created by our efforts, like selling your time to an employer or making shoes. Historically, money allowed us to specialize and exchange items of value, so we were all better off. Money is often defined using complex language (with lots of adjectives by pretentious economist-types), but it only has two, simple, common-sense characteristics: Money needs to be scarce.Money needs to be accepted by others as having purchasing power.That is all that money is. 4. If they say: Crypto currency has no intrinsic value. You respond: Wake up! No money has any intrinsic value! US dollars, gold, bitcoin, etc. have value only to the extent that they are scarce and are commonly accepted to purchase goods and services. Money is a symbol, a representation of purchasing power; it is not valuable in itself.[1] If aliens show up tomorrow and want to sell us a cure for cancer, they are unlikely to take our money in payment. It is unlikely anyone on their home planet takes US dollars or gold or bitcoin. That is all that money is: a symbol that is scarce and has purchasing power. Don’t be misled by anyone to think it is more complicated than that. If you want to know more about money, read this: https://medium.com/@res_reassure/our-ancient-ancestors-and-money-5048554d9307 5. If they say: Well, the US dollar is backed by the “full faith and credit” of the US government. What is crypto backed by? You respond: Well, I have two points: 1. The US dollar has lost just over 95% of its value over the past 100 years. You know why? Because you can print more US dollars. You know who benefits from money printing? Debtors, since the amount they need to repay is less than before. You know who are the largest debtors in any economy? The government and the banking sector. You know who is in charge of creating more money? The government and the banks. See any conflict? 2. Here is what backs crypto. Ready? I’ll tell you in two words: “fixed supply”. That is what causes it to preserve its value: you cannot just print more of it. Sure, its price varies in the market, but it doesn’t lose purchasing power due to money printing (inflation). Here is what the “full faith and credit” of the US government has got you over time, in one illustration.  6. If they say: Crypto is a fraud. You respond: No, it is the current banking model (based on the fractional reserve principle) that is a fraud. It is simply a fact that fractional reserve banking involves a lie at its core: the depositor is told that their money is safely held in the bank while, at the same time, the bank lends most of this money to borrowers or uses it for its own purposes. Similarly, the banking process involves a number of misrepresentations, including: that depositors are told that the money in the bank belongs to them when, legally, it is an unsecured loan from them to the bank; that the “deposit” is insured when, in fact, there is no insurance fund whatsoever. That is the fraud. Crypto was created in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis, to counter institutional fraud and protect people from being preyed upon by banks. If you want to know more about crypto compared to the banking system, you can read this: https://hackernoon.com/crypto-and-the-banking-system-966981b5cbc. 7. If they say: But, people like Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet call crypto a fraud. You respond: Jamie Dimon is CEO of JP Morgan, one of the world’s largest banks. Warren Buffet has made a meaningful part of his fortune by investing in the financial sector. As of the most recent filing for Berkshire Hathaway, 7 of his 10 largest holdings were in banks or relations/enablers. They both enormously benefit from the fact that the banking sector takes a little bit from everyone to accumulate enormous wealth at the top. It is the main cause of inequality in society. The root cause of many protest movements, from Occupy to the Arab Spring to yellow vests frustration in France is because of the inequality created by the banking industry. Also, banks create most of the money in society, not the state. You, the crypto denier, need to understand that crypto is an existential threat to the banking system … and to these bank shareholders and the rest of the 1%. So, asking Jamie Dimon or Warren Buffett what they think about the crypto system is like asking a taxi driver what he thinks about Uber. 8. If they say: Crypto is used for money laundering. You respond: Crypto runs on a public architecture called the blockchain, which is simply a lot of databases, holding unchangeable records. In the same way, nation state issued currency runs on a private architecture of banks, central banks, Visa/Mastercard payment systems, courts, law enforcement, etc. Yes, crypto accounts are (semi) confidential, just like your bank account, but the information is recorded forever in these databases, for everyone to see. Who would use something like that for money-laundering?? If you were a criminal and know technology and are smart, you would never use the crypto system to launder money. If you really want to launder money, you call your friends at a traditional bank, like HSBC. Refer the crypto denier to the Netflix documentary on HSBC’s money-laundering, if they really want their eyes opened about basic money-laundering through banks. If you want to get sophisticated, like Malaysian politicians who engaged in some serious criminal activity … well, you call Goldman Sachs and get the president on the line. You don’t set up a crypto wallet on the blockchain. It is just common sense: bad idea to launder money on an unchangeable database held by thousands of people. 9. If they say: Crypto is a get rich scheme for scammers. You respond: Crypto currencies are not-for-profit. It is the banking and payments system that are operated for vast profits. That is one of the main points with crypto: to prevent banks from preying on people. With crypto, a user only pays a small fee to the community that provides security and maintains administration. However, on top of crypto currencies, some unscrupulous people have, indeed, tried to use the potential of crypto to scam people and get rich. It just seems to be human nature that when there is excitement about what a technology can do for humanity, from railroads to the internet, that some people try to take advantage of this. But what these people tried to do does not take away from the core underlying benefits of crypto. The scammers were trying to do something on top of the crypto currency layer, not change the principles of crypto. Anyway, we can agree with the crypto deniers that anyone who tries to deceive people and pervert something intended for the common good should burn in hell. But, let us also be honest: at its core crypto is a not-for-profit system and is intended to make the world a better place. The banking system, at its core, is based on a fundamental untruth, involves the few profiting from the many, and it underlies much of the malaise that exists elsewhere in society. 10. If they say: Crypto is bad for the environment. You respond: That is an egregious lie. Crypto uses electricity for its two basic functions: administration and security for the entire system. Much of this comes from renewable sources that are not otherwise utilised. Imagine adding up the costs, globally, for how much bank and payment infrastructure costs? It would be a vast amount; the crypto expense is a small fraction of these costs. In addition, as crypto allows for secure payment with finality, there are no enforcement costs required. So, for a fair comparison, add in the costs in the traditional system of lawyers, courts, police, auditors, regulators, etc. and then make the comparison. The main (and only) “report” on crypto electricity use is completely unscientific (it infers technical inputs from assumed financial outputs), the “researcher” has no background in energy economics or systems modelling and he blogs from home. His methodology and conclusions have been completely discredited by real scientists, including environmental research scientists. Crypto electricity costs will undoubtedly come down as the technology evolves. The crypto industry should try to reduce electricity consumption, for sure; but to suggest crypto is a serious environmental issue is absurd and must raise questions as to motive. If you want to know the real story, you can read this article: https://hackernoon.com/the-reports-of-bitcoin-environmental-damage-are-garbage-5a93d32c2d7 11. If they say: Give me a tangible example of what crypto is good for. You respond: The UN’s World Food Programme uses blockchain technology to provide identity and has distributed millions of dollars in food to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees in Jordan since May 2017. The major benefit to the food program so far is “a large drop in payments to financial services firms”, the usual middlemen for transactions. Such fees have dropped “significantly,” according to Houman Haddad, the WFP executive leading the project.[2] 12. If they say: Crypto is just a fancy database, which serves no purpose. You respond: Crypto makes it as quick and easy to send money as you can send email. But, with email, you can send multiple copies. With money, you don’t want to allow this. So, the multiple database structure is required to solve a difficult computer science problem: preventing sending the same money many times. So, it has a clear purpose. 13. If they say: The price decline shows that people don’t want crypto. You respond: No, actually the number of transactions across crypto has increased every year and keeps growing. More people used crypto to make payments last year than Paypal. The main reason that the price has declined is that there are not enough real-world opportunities to use crypto. This is partly because the banking industry does everything it can to prevent crypto from being adopted. Once there is a genuine crypto banking system in place, adoption of crypto will increase significantly. Here is what the crypto needs to spread adoption, which will lead to a significant price increase.  14. If they say: Why is crypto better than paper money? You respond: 1. Lower cost (transaction costs much lower than bank transfers). 2. More convenient (you transact directly, cuts out the bank/credit card company middlemen). 3. Fixed supply. 4. Greater alignment with our better human values. Tell them that the crypto system is digital technology. Traditional banking/payments is analog technology, that cannot be upgraded; the entire architecture is antiquated 1970s technology cobbled together in a fit of absent-mindedness. Crypto is your smart phone. The banking system is like using a Blackberry. The payments system is like using a rotary dial fixed line phone. If you want a comparison of crypto and the payments system, read this: https://medium.com/coinmonks/crypto-and-the-payments-industry-c4d76e108125 15. If they say: Why do people really get involved in crypto? You respond: People get involved because of value and values. Crypto is a system of money that corresponds to how humanity has exchanged value for most of our history. Technologically, this system is based on mathematical formulae and a straight-forward verification and record system. The implications are spectacular: you can now trust exchanging value with another person or institution directly, even if you don’t know them.

The cons though if you ask me is that sometimes the technical aspects of keeping up with the changes in cryptos can be a put-off for non-techies. This is because one needs to keep up to date with industry changes such as regulations introduced as crypto legislation is still in its infancy as well as keeping up with changes that may cause significant price changes such a hard-forking[2] of a cryptocurrency etc.  But if you ask is it profitable and can you make money from trading in bitcoin or cyrptocurrencies, then yes the answer is ABSOLUTELY ! Don’t just take my word for it though, watch my LIVE Bitcoin (BTC) trade video here to see how I made USD 170 in 1 hour trading Bitcoin.

Strong fundamentals - long term. It is something that is probably obvious to most of the crypto investors, however, big percent of people are still getting into this trap. You should ask yourself a few very important questions before investing in the project: - Does it really need a blockchain to solve the problem or traditional database will do it better? - Does it really pioneer or there are strong competitors already? Why don’t consider them instead? - Last and most important: Is there any problem at all? 2. Greed kills. Strategy heals Even though it may sound a bit funny - I learn this lesson the hard way. Almost everybody in the space is trying to sell you the idea of a multi-millionaire future. In fact, only 5% of investors are successful. Remember what Buffet once said? ""Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1."" It applies perfectly to crypto space. Money management and risk estimations are probably the most valuable skills I've mastered along the way. Start from putting your Stop-losses and Take-profits and learn more about the risk-reward ratio. As time flies you will find yourself profiting on larger time frames and not giving a *** about what's going on daily. 3. Not to see the wood for the trees. There are always winner coins and loser coins in crypto. Among 5000 cryptos there're probably 30-50 which are addressing REAL problems. The main idea here is: Why bet on a single coin when you can bet on the whole industry? For example, I really believe that the gaming industry will be among the first ones to adopt blockchain widely. Eugene Chygyryn's answer to If one had to buy and HODL 3 altcoins for 2020, what would they be? I'll invest, let's say, 1000 USD in the top 3 projects. Even if one out of 3 succeeds, I'll take 10-100 times more than I've put in. But if I bet 1000 USD in a single coin. I can be either a winner or a loser. That's called gambling. Conclusions Cryptos are here to stay. There always be opportunities in the market. IMO, only disciplined, criticizing and patient investors will be rewarded in the long run. If you stop treating crypto as a get-rich-quick scheme but rather a long, adventurous journey - you have my word, you will see some magic happening to your portfolio :)  P.S: This and many other interesting topics are being discussed daily in our Quora Inner Circle cryptocurrency group.

The best thing about Bitcoin is that it is controlled by a decentralized network having a transparent set of rules. Therefore, it presents an alternative to fiat money (which is the government-issued currency controlled by the central bank). Is Bitcoin Safe and Secure? Bitcoin is underpinned by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which is known as the most secure technology currently. If you are asking whether Bitcoin investment is safe or not, the answer is yes. You can safely invest in Bitcoin as a medium of investment. However, just like any market-dependent financial asset, BTC’s price is also determined by multiple factors. However, the best thing about Bitcoin is that it has a sound and predictable monetary policy, which you can verify anytime. You can always check the number of Bitcoins in circulation. When a transaction is created, you can always check whether any new Bitcoin is created. The entire system of Bitcoin is very transparent. Bitcoin is a safe and secure medium of exchange and a viable investment class, which you can trade and gain profits. However, you may even accrue loss time and again if you mistime your entry into the market. Should I invest in Bitcoin? Yes, you should invest in Bitcoin and keep it in your portfolio to earn higher returns. There are many reasons for you to invest in BTC and some of them are: The Price will always go upThere are only 21 million Bitcoins available and the demand for this leading crypto coin is increasing at a very fast pace. With more and more institutional investors buying and a possible mass adoption in the coming times, there will always be excess demand that will push the price up in the short, medium, and long term. Increasing Influence in The Cryptocurrency MarketBitcoin’s influence is increasing rapidly. Its crypto market share has increased from 62% to 79% currently. Robust Performance in 2020Bitcoin price has increased by 170% till-date in 2020, which is 10-times more than the 17% YTD growth rate of gold.If the yearly lows are considered after the COVID19-induced crash in March 2020, Bitcoin has rallied more than 400% till now.BTC price has increased by 37% in November 2020. It is almost 3-times more than the 13& growth rate of the MSCI World Index in November.BTC/USD has achieved new high on December 1, 2020 and the analysts believe that US$25,000 is the next viable target. Many crypto analysts also believe that the Bitcoin price will become US$50,000 by the end of 2021.Increasing Adoption by Big Companies and High-Profile InvestorsMainstream payment companies like PayPal and Square are increasingly using Bitcoin.PayPal has recently announced (in October 2020) its plan to support Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Square has earned a record US$1-billion revenue through its CashApp mobile wallet in Q3.Many high-profile investors like BlackRock’s Rick Rieder, Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller have already started investing in Bitcoin.If you are thinking of investing in Bitcoin, 2020-21 is a good time to enter the market. However, at the time of making entry, always check the resistance and support levels and then make your entry accordingly. You can also use a unique trading bot platform, NapBots, that designs profitable trading strategies and makes them available in a unique marketplace.

For instance, Bitcoin has a marketcap of 434 billion Dollars. The way to calculate the marketcap of any company, commodity, cryptocurrency is to multiply the number of coins (or shares, or other units) by the price of the coin. To calculate Bitcoin’s marketcap multiply it by it’s current price of 23,412 by it’s current supply of 18,579,256 and you will get 434,471,511,730 US Dollars.

To calculate Bitcoin’s marketcap multiply it by it’s current price of 23,412 by it’s current supply of 18,579,256 and you will get 434,471,511,730 US Dollars. How Does Marketcap Affect the Bitcoin Price? The Bitcoin price is determined by it’s supply and demand. Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins minted by the year 2140. That means the main factors that determines it’s price is demand related and how many people choose to hold Bitcoin and not sell it; in other words demand. I want to point out that the marketcap only affects Bitcoin’s price as much as it affects the psychology of Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Here are some ways the Bitcoin marketcap can affect the price. Ranking. Major cryptocurrency websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko rank cryptocurrencies by their marketcap. The higher up the list a coin is the more attention it will receive. There’s an old joke that goes “Where’s the best place to hide a dead body? On the second page of Google!” The same thing applies to sites like CoinMarketCap; if a cryptocurrency is at the top of the list it will get lot’s of attention. If a coin is on the second or third page it won’t get as much attention. More attention means more investors and more investors means a higher price!Impressed by the Big Number. The bigger the number the more impressive it is. When I see that Bitcoin is worth 424 billion US Dollars it’s a big deal. When I compare Bitcoin with a smaller coin like Verge which has a marketcap of 98 million Dollars Bitcoin just seems more important. If a coin seems important it will get more investors and more investors means a higher price!Network Control. If I owned 1% of all the Bitcoins I would be worth 4,240,000,000 US Dollars. I owned 1% of all XVG tokens I would be worth 957,477.07. To become a XVG “whale” would probably only cost 1 million Dollars or so (the price would rise when a whale comes in to buy that much of the network). To become a Bitcoin whale will cost billions of Dollars. Becoming a whale is a big deal because whales can easily manipulate the price of a coin and influence developmental decisions for certain coins (this does not apply to Bitcoin). Because Bitcoin is so large and expensive it’s much harder to become a Bitcoin whale than it is to break into a small coin. A large marketcap signals that a coin won’t be easily manipulated. A small marketcap signals that it can be. A larger marketcap signals it’s a safer coin and a safer coin get’s more investors which raises the price!These are the main ways I can think of how the marketcap of a coin affects it’s price. Please let me know if you can think of some others. What is Marketcap? Market cap is the total value of a company, commodity, or currency.

I think when we are looking out, and we are looking back at about 40 years of data, the stockmarket has seen bad things happen in OCTOBER< but we are not sure what happens next, but Im sure that if we get more downside action on bitcoin, more people are going to come out of the woodwork, and again call BITCOIN a scam, and a ponzi and that is dead. In my own mind, bitcoin goes through periods of boom, and bust, and right now we are obviously going through a period of lagging and negative situation, but that does not mean its dead. In fact some people would call this a good opportunity to get prices on the cheap. Time will be the judge of that, but hopefully this helps you.

Only a week after the launch, the contract hit $22.5m, with more than 50,000 ETH deposited. On December 17, there was more than $1bn-worth of ETH locked in deposit contracts.  In the meantime, Ethereum is standing at the forefront of the decentralised finance (DeFi) boom. There is now $16.24bn locked in DeFi applications. The figure is 2,300 per cent higher than the number seen at the start of 2020. If the trend is to continue, it could drive interest of both individual and institutional investors in ETH even higher. For investors, there are always opportunities in the crypto market and that is why I often recommend that investors should look into investing in crypto interest account with companies such as the Coinpaq (www.coinpaq.tech) company, a service company that gives investors huge returns on their investment in days, giving investors the opportunity to profit from market strategies utilized by the company to generate profit.  Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by both market capitalization and daily volume. The introduction of listed Ether futures to our time-tested, regulated CME Group derivatives marketplace will help to create a forward curve, so Ethereum market participants can better manage price risk. What do all these developments mean for the Ethereum price in 2021? While nothing can be known for sure when it comes to such a dynamic market such as cryptocurrencies, successful Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, increasing adoption rate and growing DeFi popularity will likely support the coin’s price going forward.

The above image depict the bitcoin during its inception. Bitcoin in 2008. Bitcoin was just a few cents when it was introduced or since its inception and the concepts was very good to trade the transactions is ease and simple way,it was only with hackers and the underground network.Piggy Banking: People started to save there money as the system is better than federal reserves.Secured transaction: Bitcoin was not traceable as it was the main reason, lot of folks opted for it.Wallet : It doesn’t need any KYC(Know your Customer) for activation. Just install the wallet and we are ready for the transactions.Global Network: Transactions are seamless across the world without any hurdles.Network: Only few nodes are enough to get the transactions verified. There were no massive BTC farms or any other mechanism is required to validate it.Blockchain: This is not a new technology, blockchains are being used to link each and every transactions so that any rogue server cannot modify the legitimate transactions.Trading / Merchandise: The value is quite stable in earlier days where the BTC is not booming or exploding as we are witnessing it.Anonymity: The popularity of the bitcoin was due to the anonymous nature of the transaction and tracing bitcoin addresses was a nightmare. Spammers and hackers used this network for ransomware and other illegal transactions.Code: bitcoin/bitcoin The code is available for accessing it and can be modified with our own options.Now, analyze the Bitcoin version in 2021.  1. Value: Bitcoin value as of today (5:40 PM- Jan 17th 2021 is $35,260. We can do a normal transactions(groceries or any house hold items). If we have the wrong address or if the transaction is halted or paused in the network then it will be in black hole. The value it has back then was due to legitimate network and the value was not just like pump and dump. It was the adoption that skyrocket the price till $900. After the price is being pumped up from fake exchanges it further gained popularity. Let say Bitcoin is still a rare thing that exist on this planet. But, we have more than 100+ of Bitcoin wallets and networks (Currencies ) . So, there is no scarcity in these type of coins. If companies want to adopt the Bitcoin then they can chose any of the below networks that are the derivatives from the Bitcoin.  First myth about the scarcity is busted. 2. Piggy Banking to 24/7 Trading: Earlier it was piggy banking now it is being traded around the clock. Neither stocks nor commodities are traded around the clock. What will happen to the price while we are sleeping or if we are in the off business hours the fluctuation in the price will eat up everything that is kept in our portfolios. The reason behind the price hike is due to the stable coins that are stormed into the exchanges without any regulatory body or there were no audit compliance that were being followed. That is why we can see only bitcoin gets pumped to keep the dominance in the crypts. Below are the list of stable coins that are used to pump the bitcoin.  3. Not secured: Earlier the transactions were secured, if they are compared with the current mode of operation. There are enormous tools that can be used to see or trace the Bitcoin wallets. 4. Wallets: Trading wallets should be KYC compliant. The idea behind Cryptos is stripped off by doing the KYC of the wallets. Only the old bitcoin addresses are not KYC compliant, all the new traders should be KYC compliant. Blockchain.com Explorer | BTC | ETH | BCH 5. Global Network: As the network grew humongous and there is no impact on the availability of nodes. 6. Network : All the nodes(Full and partial) can be traced and the transactions can also be tracked. 7.Blockchain: This technology is used only when we have a trust issue in the business. There were no major companies that have adopted this technology yet. But, if corporate or Multi national companies ventured to start a new crypto with fiat pegged or asset based cryptos then the whole crytpos will fall apart as bitcoin would crash. Hence the Libra project is scrapped. 8. Trading / Merchandise: Even though we have enough exchanges or merchants or businesses that are accepting bitcoin. But, this is not a viable solution for transaction. 9. Anonymity: Bitcoin doesn’t provide any anonymity anymore. Below are crytpos that were emerged to patch the anonymity in the blockchain or Crypto field. We have 50+ privacy cryptos that fulfill the vacuum that bitcoin created. Privacy Cryptocurrencies | CryptoSlate  10. Code: Code of bitcoin developed with the help of community. But, still the code is open to every one and it available on github website. Conclusion: If I want to create a new variant of Bitcoin. You just need to hire a computer graduate and tweak the code of the bitcoin. Take the subscription from the prominent cloud vendors(Amazon, Alibaba and Azure) and your Coin or Token is live. I will leave up-to the reader to calculate the Bitcoin price on there own now.

It seemed like altseason, right? I suspect prices went up that fast simply because more money entered the markets. $150 billion, to be exact, over about 2 months, into a $250 billion market. That’ll send the markets higher every time, bitcoin and alts. Stablecoins, too! I need to see something a lot bigger before I call “altseason.” If you liked the gains of August, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Look at the chart of bitcoin dominance, and you’ll see bitcoin dominance falling. In the image below, the squiggly line represents bitcoin’s percentage of the market over the past year:  As you can tell, it’s going down. While it’s leveled off in recent weeks, altcoins continue to make a larger and larger percentage of the market. That’s a prelude to altseason but not altseason. Altseason looks more like the circles on this chart, which shows bitcoin dominance over the past 4 years, with altseasons circled:  Put in terms of absolute market cap, the left-most circle (early 2017) was a 1,000% gain for alts (total), the next circle (July 2017) represented little gains because bitcoin’s price fell as alts stayed even, and the third circle was a 300% gain for alts. Altseasons are pretty powerful stuff. We haven’t seen one in a long time. When will alteason come? I’d guess end of 2020, beginning of 2021. Maybe not 1,00% overall gains, but it’ll be significant. That’s a six month swing in terms of timing — I guess my crystal ball’s a little foggy — but there’s a lot of reason to expect an altseason sooner than later. As you can see in this chart, bitcoin’s dominance has gone down for a while.  Yet, no altseason. In fact, bitcoin has recently fought back and gained dominance in recent weeks (slightly). Peel back the curtain and look at the pattern from May 2018, when bitcoin really asserted its dominance, to today.  You can see two trends over that time. Since its peak dominance of 75% in summer 2019, bitcoin’s dominance gets less and less powerful each time it moves up. That’s the black arrow.The 62% level marks the swing between bitcoin gaining momentum and alts fighting back. That’s the black line.Not only is the upper trend intact, but the lower trend broke in July. This signals alts have gained momentum. As long as these trends continue—and there’s no evidence they won’t—we can expect alteason sooner than later. As of this post, bitcoin is fighting back and will probably push alts to the 62% or maybe even back to the upper trend line. This is normal. Once bitcoin’s dominance hits the 62% or 65% (ish) area, we’ll probably see alts fight back. That’s when alteason will begin. Here’s what it looks like:  All speculative, of course. It’s just looking at patterns and trends and projecting them into the future. The real fun is seeing whether things play out the way you expect. If you have about 6 minutes, watch the end of this video, which is admittedly a little old, but offers my view on the overall flow of money in and out of alts and why I expect a proper altseason around the end of this year.  — Mark Helfman publishes the Crypto is Easy newsletter.

ICOs incur a huge liability risk if based in the US especially with bad legal advice (i.e. SAFT), and most of the big ones are in the US. These ICOs are seemingly under severe and costly legal risks. The big successes are most likely the exchanges, because Binance charges 3M per ICO listed. Binance is the fastest unicorn to date. That’s often more than the average no-name, but “successful” ICO, upfront and guaranteed listing fees. It’s a business expense for liquidity, and Circle just recently bought Poloniex for ~400M. There were more exchanges bought out before by investment firms such as BTC-C for ridiculous amounts. There are also big successes in Bitcoin/mining/arbitrage and there is a finite chance there will continue to be. Public blockchain companies are mostly pivoting to this niche, and Overstock still keeps 50% of the accepted Bitcoin as investment purposes. The CEO claims Bitcoin will be at $1 million, and the Soros Fund has bought into Overstock with a major stake. I am not aware of US public companies that keep any other cryptocurrency directly as investments besides Bitcoin. But then that depends on your definition of “big success”, and a whole lot of other uncertain factors.

Today, we accept any fiat currency in exchange for goods or services as we understand that in turn, the fiat currency can be traded again to obtain other goods or services.  Well, certain currencies that are backed by precious metals like gold and silver have an intrinsic value. But, today most of the global currencies are Fiat Currencies. A commodity to be valuable hence needs to be exchangeable for a similar value. The commodity also must be able to hold or store this value so as to be traded in the future. Add to that, if the commodity in place is limited in supply then its value increases over time with demand. To exchange Bitcoin, visit: BTC to INR converter What is a Fiat Currency? Fiat money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government. It is important to understand here that this demand and supply is decided by the participants of the network who are bringing a fiat currency into use. For example, within a network, I trade a $100 note for a mobile phone, I am essentially exchanging value worth $100 for the phone. The store-keeper, takes the $100 note and buys his meal with the same or invests it to create more value. Fiat currency or money establishes the exchange of value with the help of the government’s backing Here is the Value! Similar to Fiat currency, Bitcoin (or most of the cryptocurrencies) is also not backed by any gold or silver hence does not have any intrinsic value. The value of any currency comes from the backing of the state and the trust that people have over the government. Hence, for any money to be established as an exchange of value within a network, it is important for the network to trust it regardless of who (or what) is backing it.

All I can say that if your a short term trader then you probably need to be very careful about your short term exposure. However if your in this for the long haul this might be the time to start adding to your long term exposure. The bottom line is that Crypto has honestly suffered much more serious issues in the past and emerged a much stronger beast as a result of them. This will be no different.

The villagers knew that there were sooo many monkeys in a nearby forest, therefore, they stopped their usual work and started hunting and catching monkeys. The businessman purchased 1000 monkeys at the rate of 10$. But the number of monkeys started to decrease and it became quite difficult to catch them. Then, the businessman announced to buy monkeys at 20$/monkey. This once again, created a thrill in villagers and they again stopped their usual day-work and started hunting monkeys. Very soon, the number of monkeys decreased enough and villagers could barely catch them. So, by and by, they started to return to their fields and got to usual activities. Then, the businessman announced to buy monkeys at the rate of 50$/monkey. But soon after, he had to leave the village for a very urgent meeting in a nearby city. Therefore, he left his assistant in the village and set off for the city. His Assistant gathered all the villagers and made an offer to them: “Look at all those thousands of monkeys in cages, which you already caught and sold to the businessman. I am ready to give you a good deal of 35$/monkey. When the businessman will return to the village, you can easily sell them back to him at 50$/monkey as he announced recently”. The villagers discussed this issue with each other and then started to collect all their money, some took loans, others sold valuable belongings and finally they managed the amount of 700 millions dollars to buy these monkeys from the assistant. After that, the villagers never ever saw that businessman or his assistant. And all of them were left with debt of millions of dollars and thousands of monkeys, which they never needed at all.  This is all about sales/purchases of Bitcoins. Good luck guys…",2021-03-06T20:05:05.515Z,"Should I buy Bitcoin now or am I too late? ",Quora

With an approximate market cap of $280 billion, rest assured that this industry is here to stay. This new industry is constantly evolving, therefore the earlier you get acquainted with it, the higher your chance are of benefiting from its future development. Those people are wrong. Unless you want to call the Industrial Revolution a phase. Unless you want to call the Information Age a phase. Unless you want to call the internet a phase… The American press, long under the thumb of the government, has decided to deal with it by telling lies. They are listed, most of them, on the stock exchanges. Money moves out of stock, as money moves into cryptocurrency. But also I believe that the US government has decided to treat crypto as though it were a threat to national security. Thus, they control the news. Is it a threat though? Well, it is a threat to the establishment, and the establishment have only two choices, they can either embrace it, or they can oppose it. If they oppose it, they will inevitably lose. Some governments have seen the sense of this and are themselves enabling the technology, reasoning that the wealth pouring into their country through cryptocurrencies will in the long-term be for the benefit of all. Try to impose your New World Order on a country that is powerful in blockchain technology, and you will inevitably fail. Governments are going to start accepting Bitcoin for tanks and warplanes. They will be able to use Bitcoin to influence decision makers, anonymously, wherever they are. It’s a great leveller, Bitcoin. But back to the ‘man in the street’. The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is actually a new revolution, and a powerful one, allowing people to get away from the control of central banks. And it is a disruptive force in the world. Imagine being able to buy or sell a house or car without any middle-man. Imagine making a crypto transfer for business goods to India or China or Russia, and the transfer of funds is free, or close to free; you can mutually agree what cryptocurrency to deal in, and almost as soon as you press the button, you’ve done the deal. Imagine getting paid instantly instead of waiting for days for your funds to clear. Or your funds being blocked while investigations are made by the government. Imagine buying your shopping using a cryptocurrency that you know is going up in value as you shop, and that your shopping is actually helping it to gain value, and when you get back home and check your cryptowallet you find that your cryptocurrency value is worth more than it was before you spent some of it on your shopping, so you’ll be eating for free that week! All of this, and far more is happening right now. It is mainly happening to clever people. Early adopters. To people willing to risk a little for the possibility of gaining a lot. To people with a level of focus that allows them to learn some new things that are not really that difficult to learn. It is happening to those who would rather do something than watch reality TV. }It is happening, currently, to just a fraction of one percent of people, but word is spreading, and the revolution is gaining force. Even the couch potatoes are beginning to notice. Because they see their neighbour in the same job as them buying a new car, or taking a cruise, and they ask the question, “How did you manage to afford that?” I’m not saying that there are not people resisting this revolution, but the movement is unstoppable. It’s as unstoppable as an earthquake or a tsunami. The floodgates have opened, and cryptocurrency is an unstoppable force because of many factors. Just to take a brief sampling of those factors in a very non-comprehensive list, there are a given a number of facts: a) There are already hundreds of millions of people stocking and using cryptocurrencies;b) The distributed nature of blockchain technology makes government control next to impossible – you can shut down one exchange or platform in your jurisdiction, and another two will spring up in its place in areas where you have no jurisdiction, and those holding or wanting to buy or exchange cryptocurrency will just go elsewhere, even if they have to do it through proxy servers to remain anonymous. Even if they have to emigrate to do it.c) The anonymity of blockchain transactions means that your private keys are yours alone, and unless you give them up, nobody, from a central bank to a government agency can touch your coins.d) People like having and using cryptocurrencies! They like looking in their wallets and seeing the value of their investments rising. They like that their profits cannot be monitored. I mean, when you buy coins from all over the world, certified by anonymous blockchain miners who could be anywhere, nobody – not even the NSA, who probably know when you last had sex and with whom, can track your transactions. This is the big chance for ordinary people to get away from the system of never-ending debt. And whilst it is true that the most popular new coins or ‘tokens’ have been designed with a purpose in mind, whether that purpose is to enable companies to make instant anonymous transactions without a middleman, or whether that purpose is to replace ‘fiat currency’, with its systemic flaws, unpayable debt, and government-controlled interest rates, the fact is that whilst two or three out of every ten new cryptocoins coins will stagnate or fail over the next five years, the majority will succeed, making those who bought them early very wealthy, as their prices and values rise. So to answer the question, ‘How Long will the Cryptocurrency Revolution Last?’, my answer is that cryptocurrency is the future. It will outlast every fiat currency. It will become an everyday thing for everyone. It is the new international currency, and it breaks all the rules, whilst writing its own new ones. It will last as long as our civilisation lasts. As always, don’t do anything without due diligence! Some people worry that cryptocurrencies are a phase that the world is going through. Other people want that to be the case and hope cryptocurrencies are just a phase that will pass. Cryptocurrencies are an ongoing technology and socioeconomic experiment.

That said, the score that really matters isn’t the overall number, but instead is a specific composite score that depends on the MOS you want. The scores are broken down into different categories, such as Clerical and General Technical. According to this (ASVAB Scores and Army Jobs) you’re looking at an Skilled Technical of 101 or more. You’re looking at general science, math, and verbal comprehension for that score. My advice would be to brush up on your basic algebra if you haven’t done math in a while. Then just take the practice test. Your recruiter can help you out with that. That will tell you exactly what you’re lacking in and where you need to improve. Beyond that, you’re going to need to qualify for a clearance. For that, stay out of trouble and make sure you don’t have a ton of debt (like high balance credit cards). Finally, to head off the inevitable “dumb infantryman thinks he smart guy and gives advice” jokes: I got a 99 on my ASVAB and I’m a nuclear engineer, so I’m not an idiot when it comes to tests.

Tell me that something with lots tribalism, religiousness, cultish behaviour, technical problems, lack of innovation will be incredibly successful with a straight face, it doesn’t make a compelling argument.

Bakkt might actually spur a last minute boost in the price of Bitcoin, but that’s more an ‘end of year’ sort of thing. The Lightning Network is currently only two years away from viability, and I expect in one year’s time it will only be three years away from viability. I don’t really see any particular reason the mainstream news media would heavily cover Bitcoin again—most people who were going to learn about Bitcoin in the first world have. The stories of those who mortgaged at 20k are still pretty fresh in people’s minds. People haven’t forgotten that 2018 is pretty much a year of nothing but crypto analysts swearing the price would double or triple ANY DAY NOW YOU GUYS, while it sank from 20k Most of the criminal underworld has moved on to Monero by now, since the FBI’s got pretty robust blockchain-tracing technology. Who’s even left to pump the price? That’s the main thing here. I keep seeing people screaming that The Golden Bullrun is coming, but for that to happen, SOMEONE has to want to put the money in. At that point, they say institutional investors—except banks aren’t stupid. Crypto’s a zero sum game. They would put in their money BEFORE the mainstream rush—which was late 2017. Remember, banks aren’t interested in hodling coins until Bitcoin somehow becomes ‘the world’s reserve currency’ or whatever. They want to make a reasonable investment, now. Which means if they’re going to invest, they intend to sell the speculation at the next highpoint. The only people who care whether banks invest in Bitcoin are people already invested in Bitcoin…who want to sell to the banks to make mad cash.

The form of the Wave Principle reflects the progress not of each man or company but of mankind as a whole and his enterprise. Companies come and go. Trends, fads, cultures, needs and desires ebb and flow with the human condition. Therefore, the progress of general business activity is well reflected by the Wave Principle, while each individual area of activity has its own essence, its own life expectancy, and a set of forces which may relate to it alone. Thus, each company, like each man, appears on the scene as part of the whole, plays its part, and eventually returns to the dust from which it came. These lines are from the Elliot Waves book, which I liked pretty much. And now coming to the Bitcoin, well it certainly represent the cryptocurrency market and all other coin seems to follow it. And if we see the market from now, there are too many currencies out there and many more to come, but most of them are going to eliminated a few will remains and Bitcoin is going to lead them. Because Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone and its growth is all natural. So it should follow the natural laws. That’s why I think that Bitcoin follows the Elliot waves pretty well. I have tried to count all the Elliot wave till now or from the point data exists on Tradingview, and this is my idea about the Bitcoin right now. You just have to have the basic idea about the Elliot waves to understand this Idea. If you don’t went through this: Elliott Wave Basics 1st wave was started from April 2015 and completed on June 2016. It was started with 100 USD and completed with around 800 USD, and that 1st wave also had 5 sub waves, not going to explain in detail you can clearly see it in the chart. 2nd wave was the correction for the 1st wave, which almost retraced around 50% of the first wave which lead it to around 450 USD. (June 2016 – August 2016). With 3 sub waves (correction waves)  One wave I left which is from August 2016 to January 2017, because it was a sideways action and doesn’t fit in the wave count. 3rd wave was started from January 2017 (750 USD) and completed in August 2017(5000 USD) with 5 sub waves. 4th wave was the correction for the 3rd wave which almost retraced 50% of the 3rd wave and ended up at around 3000 USD.  And now comes the most interesting wave, 5th wave And I am going to explain it in detail. So here we goes, 5th wave has 5 sub waves, let’s see them in detail: 1st wave of 5th wave was started in 11th September 2017 from 3000 USD and completed at 7650 USD on 30th October. 2nd wave was started on 30 October 2017 from 7650 USD and completed at 5200 USD on 6th November 2017 with 50% retracement of the first wave. 3rd wave, which was very strong wave was started on 6th November 2017 from 5200 USD and completed at around 20000 USD on around 17th December 2017. 4th wave which retraced around 60% of the 3rd wave was completed at around 11300 USD in the next week. 5th wave was very interesting, it was a truncated (failed) wave which is theoretically correct, because truncated waves form due to the strong previous wave and because 3rd wave was too strong. So the 5th wave(truncated wave) was completed at around 17300 USD.  And this is how the 1st bigger wave or 1st wave of the super wave was completed in Jan 2018. Then started the 2nd wave or correction wave, which also have three waves (ABC). A wave completed with 5 sub waves, in which 5th wave was a truncated wave due to strong 3rd wave. Right now we are in B wave, for which A and B waves are completed and we are now in the C wave. Which is supposed to complete in July 2018 at around 12000 USD. But there is a strong resistance line at around 9000 USD so there is a possibility that the C wave of wave B completes at 9000. I have tried to plot it this in charts but this will make it too messy, so I am not doing that.  Then we will go for the C wave which may end up at around 5000-6000 USD in the end of 2018.

The potential gain in BTC is more than the potential loss; and this is because several crypto-analysts have speculated that bitcoin could become a global currency in the future though it is very hypothetical. If this becomes reality, then it will stimulate international trade all around the world. In turn, economists have speculated that the price would hike to 20,000 times its value, which will make each $1 worth of current BTC would (hypothetically) be worth $20,000 in the future. However, this will only happen if bitcoin was recognized as legal tender for both international and domestic trade. This forecast is one made by experts who believe that investing in bitcoin will deliver a $200 return for each dollar you invest. Though this is just a prediction and it still remains a relatively risky investment owing to its decentralized nature, it is not impossible to expect these kinds of profits because the rewards are expected to be higher when trading commodities.

Over the past two weeks Bitcoin fashioned an M-top at $13,739 and $13,177 earlier than shedding to the neckline round $9,600. Most traders assume that Bitcoin will retrace to the 61.8% and 50% Fibonacci Retracement level which is also near the CME futures gap. It’s possible that the group assume surrounding the CME hole is causing it to characteristic as a magnet, drawing BTC charge nearer to the $8,500 — $7,500 range.  BTC/USD Traders will additionally have stated that Bitcoin has dropped out of the broadening wedge that had carried it from $4,000 to the 2019 excessive and the parabolic trend is long negated, consequently the likelihood of a revisit to the 61.8 Fib retracement. So, the short-term outlook is bearish. Yet countless analysts across the region remain extraordinarily bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term price action. Let’s have a seem to be at some of the key elements which are influencing their opinion. Dormant Bitcoin wallet address hit new all-time high Earlier this week Coin Metrics launched a record displaying Bitcoin’s untouched provide accomplishing a new all-time high of 21%.  BTC Untouched Supply The quantity of unmoved Bitcoin has extended significantly over the past 5 years and cash falling into this class have been held in the same pockets address for 180 days to 2 years. This suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a keep of fee instead than a medium of exchange. One may want to anticipate that if Bitcoin’s charge continues to rise, so will the wide variety of unmoved Bitcoin. Not every person helps this conclusion, however. Adamant Capital founding companion Tuur Demeester countered pronouncing that: “I’m not so sure […] 5 years barring updating your bloodless storage method is a long time in Bitcoin. Imo most of these cash are possibly lost.” While Demeester may want to be right, taking a deeper appear at the Coin Metrics chart shows that the range of untouched cash on the 1800-day and 1-year time frame has notably expanded with compared against longer-time frames. This expand also aligns with Bitcoin’s rate extend in U.S. dollars. Ultimately, the given report shows a correlation between increases in Bitcoin price and the quantity of wallet addresses maintaining the digital asset as a store of value. Start of new bull markets coincides with miner capitulation, statistics shows On Saturday specialist crypto-analyst PlanB tweeted a alternatively intriguing chart that he and ParabolicTrav worked on.  Bitcoin bull markets start at challenging bottom According to the analysts, after a BTC/USD rally reaches its peak, a big quantity of Bitcoin is available at decrease prices. The start of new Bitcoin bull markets have coincided with miner give up and Bitcoin price tends to upward jab from these bottoms to develop 100 times. According to PlanB: “We noticed challenge bottoms (miner capitulation) in Dec 2011 ($4.6), May 2015 ($230) and Dec 2018 ($3,896). Price continues to upward shove from these bottoms till ATH round 100x […] Implying a persevering with uptrend until $370,000 ATH.” Closer investigation of the chart shows a decreasing proportion rate of Bitcoin fee positive aspects from every successive rally and loose interpretation of the chart shows the present day bullish vogue maxing out round 1,000%. PlanB explained: “It ought to be a signal of a maturing Bitcoin market with decreased volatility. More money is wanted to go markets now than it used to be in 2010–2011. Or, it could simply as without difficulty be 100x again, due to the fact Bitcoin markets are nonlinear power regulation disbursed with black swans typically taking place [as opposed] to being outliers.” Bitcoin’s cutting-edge price motion clearly seems to be mirroring preceding cycles and given that bottoming in February, the digital asset has already rallied to the tune of 300%. Pre-halving hype should push Bitcoin closer to $20,000 A few weeks ago popular crypto-analyst Filb Filb reached an equal conclusion. He is satisfied that no matter the contemporary correction, Bitcoin rate won’t revisit its 2019 low of $3,120. Filb Filb explained that: “Miners promote into market demand everytime the revenue per Bitcon rises above mining prices and he expects that they will ‘limit selling’ as the pre-halving match processes to invoke the new halving bubble.” Simply put, the basic rules of grant and demand determine Bitcoin fee and Filb Filb believes that “what happened in 2018 used to be miners promoting off their Bitcoins at marginal costs.” “Only the most efficient miners survived, while their inefficient competitors bought eliminated,” he added. Similar to PlanB and Parabolic Trav, Filb Filb agreed that miners are currently retaining on to new mined Bitcoins as they wait for the 2020 halving event. If this crew of crypto-analysts are correct, then we must begin to see miners promoting fewer coins as Bitcoin fee beneficial properties in the near future. Selling will then resume as buying stress decreases. As for the future of Bitcoin’s price, this trio of analysts see BTC/USD following the customary trajectory of momentary consolidation observed with the aid of pre-halving hype main Bitcoin lower back to $20,000.  12 Month Forecast by means of Filb Filb In the match that Bitcoin does take a look at its all-time excessive price, it’s totally feasible that long-term holders who purchased BTC near its ATH top around $20,000 could exit their positions and produce a selloff. Of course, all of this is based on the digital asset’s technical setup as it processes these highs. From a technical standpoint, the most possibly state of affairs should involve endured decline till $7,500. This would be followed by a lengthy length of consolidation as reaccumulation takes vicinity and Bitcoin’s each day fee fluctuations tighten. But as the pressure around the 2020 halving tournament builds, most analysts count on miners and investors to hold onto their coins. Alongside the anticipated influx of retail traders and the debut of institutional investing services from the likes of Bakkt, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity Investments, the stage may want to be set for a new all-time high.

Let's understand this further. Challenges For cryptocurrencies to take over the entire market, it needs to satisfy the following challenges: The crypto adoption rate is low. This can be estimated from the number of crypto wallets in use that amounts to a mere 50 million.Cryptocurrencies are still (unfairly) associated with illegal activities like gambling, money laundering, or associations with the dark web. Digital assets need to counter this stigma that is still strongly ingrained in people owing to Bitcoin's dubious relations in its early years.Cryptocurrencies require strong technological systems that can counter any problem right from hacking to protection from data deletion threats. While there are strongly guarded crypto assets out there, this desired version of cryptocurrencies is simply eutopic.For cryptocurrencies to take over the market, it should eliminate the need for cash or simply any fiat currency. There is no such cryptocurrency in the market that can successfully substitute the cash component of the financial system.While the presence of cryptocurrencies is still being acknowledged around the world, it still finds itself at loggerheads with administrative systems owing to its uncontrollable nature.While solutions to some of these problems may appear easy at first thought, their practical adoption will be extremely difficult since the world is not ready for crypto solutions yet. VerdictSo cryptocurrencies have a long journey before the possibility of an entire market takeover can become real and tangible, which is great news, to be honest. Because it means we are still in the very early stages of adoption! Those who decide to understand, trade, invest, and hold cryptocurrencies right now, are certain to have a clear advantage over their peers who may join much later.

We just saw a relaxation rally and the real sub season will be in the first quarter of next year. A number of crypto-asset markets saw significant gains on Saturday, as a myriad of digital assets spiked between 4-40% in value during the last 24 hours. The entire crypto market capitalization had risen above $540 billion, as top-ten coin values from the likes of bitcoin cash, cardano and XRP jumped massively in value. On Saturday, November 21, 2020, the overall market valuation of all 7,000+ crypto-assets in existence is around $520 to $540 billion. At the time of publication, there’s also around $20 to $32 billion in global trade volume as well. The top digital currency in terms of market cap, bitcoin (BTC) jumped over 1% today and coasted along at a daily high at $18,840 per unit. BTC’s modest gains today is nothing compared to a number of coins that have jumped significantly in value. The altcoin spark has caused a number of speculators to believe that a highly anticipated ‘altcoin season’ is looming on the horizon. For instance, the third-largest market cap today is held by XRP and the asset saw a 33%+ spike on Saturday driving the price up to $0.42 per unit high. The second-largest crypto by market valuation, ethereum (ETH) traded for $540 per ether at its high and is still up over 4% today. Chainlink (LINK) jumped over 8% and LINK now trades at over $15 per coin. Litecoin (LTC) has seen a phenomenal week gaining 38% during the last seven days. LTC is up over 7% on Saturday afternoon (EST) and had traded at a daily high at $87.46 per coin. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 14% this week and most of that stems from the 18%+ jump BCH experienced this Saturday. BCH is was swapping for $303 per coin, as the crypto asset crossed over the psychological $300 resistance zone. Currently, BCH is trading between $296 and $301 at the time of publication. Polkadot (DOT) bounced 6.9% and the crypto asset BNB gained 5% on Saturday. The tenth position in terms of market cap, cardano (ADA), leaped over 17.6% this weekend and was trading at a $0.128 per unit daily high. The biggest gainer on Saturday is Crypto.com - The Best Place to Buy, Sell and Pay with Crypto’s MCO coin, which gathered 109% in value and the biggest loser is indorse token (IND) which lost 59% today. According to a number of posts on the Reddit forum r/cryptocurrency and trending conversations on Twitter, numerous individuals believe “altcoin season is back,” because of Saturday’s altcoin market performances. Other notable gainers today include; EOS (15%), XLM (20%), VET (19%), IOTA (19%), DOGE (18%), and ALGO (14%). “November 2020: Official Altcoin Season Starts.

6043e358ed76476feda371b9,https://www.quora.com/Are-blockchain-and-Bitcoin-definitely-going-to-blow-up-in-the-future?-,"Some economic analysts predict a big change in crypto is forthcoming as institutional money enters the market. Moreover, there is the possibility that crypto will be floated on the Nasdaq, which would further add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative to conventional currencies. Some predict that all that crypto needs is a verified exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF would definitely make it easier for people to invest in Bitcoin, but there still needs to be the demand to want to invest in crypto, which some say may not automatically be generated with a fund. After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now (total volume over 120 million dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that it has a really nice UI and support. The future outlook for bitcoin is the subject of much debate. While the financial media is proliferated by so-called crypto-evangelists, Harvard University Professor of Economics and Public Policy Kenneth Rogoff suggests that the “overwhelming sentiment” among crypto advocates is that the total “market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies could explode over the next five years, rising to $5-10 [trillion].” The historic volatility of the asset class is “no reason to panic,” he says. Still, he tempered his optimism and that of the “crypto evangelist” view of Bitcoin as digital gold, calling it “nutty,” stating its long-term value is “more likely to be $100 than $100,000.” Rogoff argues that unlike physical gold, Bitcoin’s use is limited to transactions, which makes it more vulnerable to a bubble-like collapse. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s energy-intensive verification process is “vastly less efficient” than systems that rely on “a trusted central authority like a central bank.”",2021-03-06T20:17:28.553Z,"Are blockchain and Bitcoin definitely going to blow up in the future?

Unfortunately, with every great invention, there is always a downside. The problems creeping up into bitcoin payments has been the inability to trace or recall a payment once the payment has been issued. For instance, if you paid the wrong person using bitcoin, it is impossible to recall that payment and the money you paid is usually lost forever. Trading scammers have caught onto this fact and are getting clients to buy a cryptocurrency and then transfer the crypto to a trading platform. What exactly do the scammers do? A person will get a random call from a broker saying that he can make a 30% return every single week trading Forex. All he has to do is open a Luno account; a crypto wallet that enables you to store various cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and buys 200$ worth of bitcoin and then sends it to a particular trading platform to start making some money. Once you deposit the cryptocurrency you might find yourself unable to access your trading account, or, even if you are able to access your account, they do not let you withdraw your funds. These trading platforms sometimes claim that in order to withdraw your funds you need to first deposit an additional 200$ in order to start the withdrawal process. why would you have to give someone more money in order to withdraw money that you put there in the first place?! Why paying with crypto makes it very difficult to recover your fund and how a crypto transfer differs from a bank transfer The way the algorithms work behind crypto is each cryptocurrency has a special code and once you transfer that ‘code’ to someone else it is almost impossible to retrieve it. You are not transferring money or anything tangible to the trader, you are transferring the code into someone else’s account and it now becomes his.  When you do a bank transfer to someone, the bank has that transfer on record and can recall that exact transfer to your account if they want. Cryptocurrency works differently. When you buy crypto, you get a specific code and when you transfer this code it is impossible to trace. The only way to get your money back is if the company decides to offer you a refund. The refund that they give you is not the initial cryptocurrency that you gave them, rather they will give you cash with the same value of the crypto you lost. Lost about $45,000 to crypto investment scam just recently. The company posed as an investment company that could deliver a certain percentage in returns if you deposit your Bitcoin with them. At first, it seemed real, it worked twice. I didn't realize they set up a bot(robot) that will completely shutdown your account after you have decided to invest high. I suddenly couldn’t access my profile, I complained to the admin, he gave a excuses that they had a downtime and needed to upgrade their website, this took over 2 months. Within that period,I begin to suspect i have been scammed. I contacted my bank to see if they could do anything about this situation, they couldn’t. Local police say it’s impossible to get my money back.got in contact with a certified recovery specialist (RecoveryEx.com) who helped me with refunds.",2021-03-06T20:17:47.854Z,"What are the ways to recover money from crypto currency?

We have seen a number of exchanges being hacked which has led many to sell their Cryptos as they fear they will be taken by hackers. Exchanges need to do better in keeping Cryptos safe and this is an area where regulation could actually help. As time goes on we will see better exchanges, easier to use and more security. PRICE MANIPULATION. We seen recent news that the price of Crypto, and Bitcoin in particular were manipulated. Tether and Bitfinex have come under scrutiny and in an apparent price manipulation, this has again contributed to a big down turn in the price. CRYPTOS RISE AND FALL TOGETHER.

It happens every time, without fail. I’m not complaining, I think more people in this market should go out of their way to help new investors—it’s the only way this market will grow: which is in our best interest as current investors in the market. What exactly has caused the recent correction in Bitcoin is hard to pinpoint. There are several new developments regarding cryptocurrency regulations that may be affecting the price. Whatever the catalyst is, this is a normal & healthy market correction, that if anything, should bring you a sigh of relief. Don’t Panic. Bubbles don’t have healthy market corrections. Bitcoin (and the majority of other cryptocurrencies) just finished a historic bull market cycle. No financial market in history has ever had as profitable of a bull run as cryptocurrency as a whole has had in the past few months. If the price of Bitcoin were to continue rising at the rate it was—I’d get out as fast I could. That’s how bubbles burst. I’m going to drastically oversimplify this for the sake of keeping it under 100 pages—but the recent drop in Bitcoins price can be attributed to the following factors. 1. NEGATIVE NEWS It all starts with a little panic. Do you notice a theme here? To my knowledge, there have been three major negative catalysts that have largely aided in the downward spiral Bitcoin seems to be in. Confusion Surrounding Indian RegulationsIn my opinion, people have given this news a lot more weight than it should have. India is simply going through the process that every country will have to when their population starts to adopt cryptocurrency more and more. Much like the U.S., India is trying to determine how they want to regulate this market—but due to some statements from their Prime Minister regarding Bitcoin never being a part of their payment systems, people have started to panic. [1]Chinese CrackdownThere are also rumors of another Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO’s. The Financial News released an article stating that the Peoples Bank of China would no longer be providing services for accounts tied to cryptocurrency exchanges.Keep in mind that China has tried to ban cryptocurrency over 3 times. It always bounces back. [2]Credit Card Crypto Purchases Now Classified as “Cash Advance”The U.S. recently made it so that if someone purchases cryptocurrency with a credit card, it is considered a “cash advance”. Which is not very favorable to those taking the advance to say the least. [3]2. INVESTORS TAKING PROFITS/CLAIMING LOSSES BEFORE TAX SEASON Going back to my previous statement about how we just came out of a historic bull market, people are taking their profits. Bitcoin went from around $5,000 to $20,000 in an extremely short period of time. While people who bought in closer to $20,000 are panicking at the moment, investors who got in only a couple short months ago are still in the green. We’ve seen a huge amount of profit taking—as well as investors claiming losses. Claiming your capital loss offsets your capital gains tax and allows you to pay less to Uncle Sam. 3. PANIC This is the biggest contributing factor to the recent Bitcoin crash. Cryptocurrency is unique in the sense that it is the only financial market that is made up primarily of new investors, or investors that haven’t been trained in finance. Which means, this is the most emotional market in existence. I’ve found that Elliot Wave theory is the best tool in my Technical Analysis arsenal for predicting price action in Crypto. The underlying concept behind Elliot Wave is that markets move in these “psychological impulse waves” which continuously go up and down as old investors claim profits\losses and new investors buy in. I could go on and on for hours about Elliot Wave, but I’ll save that for another day! Long story short; we’re in an extremely emotional market. So when a catalyst occurs such as negative news about regulations in India, we see far more drastic price movement than we would see in a seasoned and developed investment vehicle like a traditional stock or security. Many people who trade cryptocurrencies, have never traded before. When you combine negative news, with the fact that tax season is coming and institutional investors/high net worth individuals are claiming their losses to offset capital gains taxation—you create mass hysteria for the not so seasoned investors that make up the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market. One thing I want to reiterate, this is completely normal. It would be extremely worrisome if Bitcoin didn’t retrace its price to allow new investors to come in, and let the last wave of investors who have seen enough percentage gain to be happy make their exit. I like to think of Bitcoin like a rubber-band, the lower it corrects, the higher it tends to catapult. Some would call me naive for thinking like this, I’m young enough that I’ve never lived through a multi-year bear market—but all I know is: Buying the dip in Bitcoin has been a winning strategy since 2009. By the way, not to sound like a crazy tin-foil hat wearing kind of guy, but it’s a pretty crazy coincidence that Bitcoin dropped in price to almost exactly where most large investment groups and financial institutions said that the risk/reward ratio would be favorable enough to enter long positions.

If you still don’t quite get what Bitcoin is, you may wish to defer to the plethora of videos online and articles on this site in order to get a clearer understanding. So, when you finally decide to invest in crypto, you are essentially buying a currency like the US Dollar or Euro. However, there are also some specific strategies for investing in BTC. Believe it or not, there seems to be the best day of the week, and the best time of day, to buy Bitcoin. Is now a good time to buy BTC? Let’s see how professionals will answer this question. Economists from Yale University have come up with a technique to predict the price BTC based on the cryptocurrency’s past behavior. Yukun Liu and Aleh Tsyvinski analyzed seven years of BTC price data to figure out which indicators can be used to determine the future price of BTC. Their findings, published in The National Bureau of Economic Researh, established that all cryptocurrencies are entirely distinct from stocks, currencies and other commodities in terms of factors affecting their market movements. “In contrast, we show that the cryptocurrency returns can be predicted by factors which are specific to cryptocurrency markets,” the study explains. “Specifically, we determine that there is a strong time-series momentum effect and that proxies for investor attention strongly forecast cryptocurrency returns.” This momentum effect was found to strongly affect cryptocurrency, meaning that if Bitcoin is performing well then it is likely to continue doing so, at least in the short-term. According to their strategy, an investor should buy BTC if its value increases more than 20 percent in the previous week. The best thing you can do is to adopt three incredibly simple principles before buying any coins: educate yourself, buy the dips, and never sell. Educate yourself If you don’t understand what cryptocurrency is, you should not buy it. Do not frantically chase quick profits or parabolic price patterns. Nowadays, there are multiple resources available on the Internet including our website that can help you gain all the necessary knowledge. Yes, it may take time. But this is the only right way to start crypto trading. To learn about Bitcoin, visit James Lopp’s website and browse this list of reading materials from the Nakamoto Institute. Watch any of the videos on Andreas Antonopoulos’ YouTube channel too. As well as YouMeAndBTC and Noded podcasts for entertaining and high-quality crypto discussion! Buy the dip Playing the price to find an ideal entry point burns more people than it benefits. And we, therefore, offer no opinions on when to buy it. Never sell Part of this philosophy also requires anyone buying BTC to only spend as much money as they are entirely comfortable losing completely. Some crypto investors only nominally accept this idea. We recommend serious consideration. Holding Bitcoin long-term is the best strategy. Why not sell and take profits? Because Bitcoin is a commodity in the process of monetizing. It has been a long process with many ups and downs, but it would be foolish to accumulate fiat profits which end up worthless. Conclusions When is the best time to buy cryptocurrencies? Despite many theories, efficient markets do not exist in the real world. Human habits, regulations or manipulation can result in recurring disparities in price patterns. Statistical oddities and many other patterns can be quickly found with the help of the Seasonax app on Bloomberg or Thomson-Reuters systems. Unlike stocks, bonds, or buying fiat, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, much more so than traditional investments. This can be both good and bad: on one hand, you can make some quick and easy profits on a good day, but you could also lose your entire investment in the next. I encourage you to look and research further than the data available in this post if you ever decide to buy some BTC. One golden tip I learned throughout the years, never invest more than what you are willing to lose. While many of us are lucky to have the means to experiment with 50 USD, you should never feel pressured to invest beyond your comfort zone. Many people don’t know but it’s absolutely not necessary to buy 1 whole Bitcoin. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin as divisible into small amounts, so you can just buy a fraction.

Now, one bullish Wall Street researcher and advisor is predicting the recent bitcoin price rally is just the beginning, forecasting bitcoin could be about to hit a near 200% surge—making each bitcoin worth a staggering $13,500. The New York-based Fundstrat Global Advisors found that bitcoin closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a year on Tuesday, thanks to its huge price rally. “Based on bitcoin’s trading history, a move above the 200-day moving average for bitcoin is meaningful statistically,” Fundstrat Global Advisors researchers wrote in a note to clients. “When bitcoin is above its 200-day moving average its win-ratio is 80% compared to a mere 36% when it is below its 200-day.” The bitcoin price has been on a downward trend since it peaked in late 2017, dragging the wider cryptocurrency market with it and wiping billions from the value of major digital coins—some of which have lost nearly 100% of their value. bitcoin, bitcoin price, chartSince Fundstrat released its report, the bitcoin price has moved higher again, ticking up from $4,620 to around $5,000—signalling that rally to $13,500, a price not seen since January 2018 may have already begun. “Six-month forward returns average 193% compared to a measly 10% when below its 200-day moving average—hence, being above the 200-day moving average is a big deal,” the analysts said. Though the bitcoin price has been trading flat for a number of months now, bold bitcoin bulls have continued to talk up bitcoin and cryptocurrency prospects, with the founder and chief executive of crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz saying the next move bitcoin makes will be “higher.” Novogratz added his voice to other bitcoin and crypto wealthy, including billionaire Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao, EOS co-founder and BlockOne CEO Brendan Blumer, and the billionaire Winklevoss twins of Facebook-founding fame, who went on to create the U.S. Gemini crypto exchange, who have said they still have strong faith in bitcoin and crypto despite the downturn—and are betting prices will move higher.

The DigiShares Platform DigiShares provides a white-label platform for digitizing securities (shares, bonds, etc.), issuing these in order to raise funds for a project, and the longer term management of a group of tokenized investors. DigiShares' platform can be used for any type of fund-raise (STO) but as a company DigiShares is focused on real estate projects. This document is as well focused on this industry. The DigiShares platform is ""white-label"" meaning that it is often sold to partners who offer the platform under their own brand-name. The DigiShares platform can be used in connection with fund-raising but it can also be used in connection with the tokenization of existing real estate funds, in order to create more liquidity among existing investors and make it easier to on-board new investors. The DigiShares platform provides a lot of functionality, however, the most important to mention is that it supports two main processes: (1) the issuance process where tokenized securities are issued in order to fund-raise for the project, (2) the longer term management of a group of investors who are holding tokens to document their ownership of securities within the project. For the issuance process we support a customized on-boarding process where KYC and AML options can be adjusted to the specific jurisdiction of issuer and investors. The investor has his own dashboard where he can view his token holdings, communicate with the issuer, vote on relevant issues such as how to renovate a building, purchase more tokens, etc. Check more for real estate tokenization For the issuance process we support a customized on-boarding process where KYC and AML options can be adjusted to the specific jurisdiction of issuer and investors. The investor has his own dashboard where he can view his token holdings, communicate with the issuer, vote on relevant issues such as how to renovate a building, purchase more tokens, etc. The issuer has a dashboard where he can verify investor provided KYC documentation and approve investors to participate in the STO. Once the investor is approved, he can buy tokens with various payment options. The solution has an e-signature module such that the contract workflow can be automated and digitized as much as possible. For the management of token holders over the longer term, many functions are provided to ensure communication with investors, to conduct token holder (shareholder) meetings, to conduct votes, pay out dividends (possibly with stablecoins), maintain a token holder (shareholder) register, etc. In addition, the solution supports various corporate actions giving the administrator (normally a top executive of the issuer) the right to forcefully transfer tokens from one investor to another, or back to the company – and to reissue tokens in case an investor lost access to them. The platform also provides an internal OTC-like (Over The Counter) trading exchange that works within a single project. This means that existing investors within a project can trade tokens with each other. They can issue buy and sell orders and can match these on their own in a manual manner. It is also possible for new investors to be white-listed and invited into the exchange such that they can buy tokens from the old investors. This function provides increased liquidity within a single project and will provide an extra value for investors. The platform is ""multi-STO"" meaning that it can handle multiple STOs in parallel, at the same time. Each STO can have its own URL for investor on-boarding and will have its own graphical content, presentation and content. This makes it possible for the real estate developer to have several ongoing real estate projects being active simultaneously in the platform. The platform is increasingly integrated with payment providers, custodians and third party KYC / AML providers. The DigiShares platform is highly suitable for real estate tokenization as it allows the issuer to manage and automate many of the processes relating to fund-raising and ongoing fund management. The platform works with different security token protocols and we prefer to work with those that are open and do not enforce any kind of vendor lock-in. While DigiShares is ""bullish"" on real estate tokenization, we do realize and acknowledge that not all investors understand and accept blockchain and indeed are prepared to hold a security token in a crypto wallet. For these investors we cater in two ways, one is by working with custodians who can hold the tokens for these investors (at a cost), the second is by enabling the platform to also support non-tokenized investors, that is, investors that do not receive tokens to represent their ownership but rather are registered within the platform as normal/traditional investors. The DigiShares platform is constantly being updated in order to reflect changing and evolving market needs and the agile approach of DigiShares help our clients to stay up to date and relevant. DigiShares is focused on being a leading technology provider for real estate tokenization. We are working on: - Front-end interfaces based on WordPress for easy management by the client and for highly attractive presentation of properties - Platforms for real estate issuance, fund management and trading - Real estate issuance and trading protocols and smart contracts with built-in governance - Global investor databases focused on real estate - Increased regulatory clarity in different jurisdictions - Creating awareness within the traditional industries with industry events, such as this one: Blockchain, the Technology Revolutionizing the Real Estate Industry Tokenization of Real Estate – Best Practices Contents:(1) Real Estate Tokenization – Why?(2) The DigiShares Platform(3) Real Estate Tokenization Processes 2.

According to a report, a Bitcoin (BTC) whale just moved Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $250 million. The fund was moved from a very old Bitcoin address. A move of such magnitude could have a huge effect on the value of the digital currency. Nevertheless, orders of this nature don’t go through normal trading platforms. This would greatly disrupt the price of the coin in the market. Hence, they adopted another route in the movement of the fund. Bitcoin is yet to start a major bullish run. A lot of investors and traders are patiently waiting for the sharp recovery of the crypto market. However, no one knows how huge the next recovery would be and when it would be. Here are some Bitcoin expert predictions about 2019: Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Exchange “Our 2019 outlook for Bitcoin is far more constructive than what we had been projecting for 2018. As 2017 came to a close, we had warned Bitcoin had rocketed ‘past the point of rational appreciation’ and highlighted massive downside risk in a bubbling market with far too many holes (regulation, development, hard forks). “As we head into 2019, Bitcoin has retraced that move and then some, with a recent breakdown below the $6,000 area, opening this next downside extension that targets a bigger drop towards the September 2017 low at $2,975. “While we wouldn’t rule out a downside extension that takes Bitcoin through $2,000, we don’t believe the price will spend too much time below this barrier and will start to find renewed demand ahead of an eventual push back to the topside. “As much as the crypto market would like to make the argument for Bitcoin as a store of value asset, at this stage in the game, Bitcoin is not yet mature enough in its ten year life to be taking on such a role as a harbor for flight to safety. Ultimately, we believe risk markets are still quite exposed to the reality of exhausted monetary policy accommodation, and investor profit taking in elevated equities, will likely lead to a flight to safety bid that has a lot of that speculative money in Bitcoin, heading for safer horizons into traditional risk off plays. “But we also believe there is tremendous potential that comes with decentralized, digital, peer to peer currency, and as we begin to see the possibilities more clearly, Bitcoin will regain its footing and get back to trading to the topside. “This leaves us with an outlook for Bitcoin in 2019 that could see a continuation of weakness in the first half of the year, before the market finally stabilizes and starts to make its way back up in anticipation of what should be an impressive second wave for crypto assets. “We’ll look for Bitcoin to round out 2019 trading back in the $5,000 to $8,000 region, after recovering from lows that may have extended below $2000 between now and the end of H1 2019.” Kevin Murcko, CEO of CoinMetro “Despite Bitcoin’s fairly limited use cases, and even though its technology may be less sophisticated when compared to some other projects, it will likely continue to remain the market leader in 2019. Bitcoin still has the reputation and the liquidity that make it preferable to other cryptos. “It’s difficult to put my finger on a price, however: Bitcoin’s value will continue to be driven by a great deal of financial speculation. “It’s important to remember that the crash we saw with Bitcoin this year doesn’t indicate lack of long term value. The bubble may have burst in 2018, but there’s still enormous substance and potential in the crypto market at large. “The dot-com bubble was a great example of this in action. What old school analyst saw tangible value in the internet? Amazon’s stock dropped to a low of $6 when the .com bubble burst, and today, the company trades at $1,500 per share. “The cryptos that survive this crash will continue to gain strength next year, and in the years to come. Like Amazon and eBay, out of a collection of cryptos that fail, a small but significant minority will succeed.” Mitch Blakeway, Head of Trading at Quantatex “We expect a high degree of volatility in the very near future. “A high level of Bitcoins has recently been moved from cold storage to hot storage by significant influencers in the cryptocurrency market. What this means is that investors who have the ability to move the market are gearing up to trade. This could mean moves greater than 10% in either direction. “There are notable levels of support and resistance with support around the $2,850 level for Bitcoin and resistance around $4,000 therefore a break either below $2,850 or above $4,000 could lead to momentum in that direction. “We believe that Bitcoin will eventually shrug off the recent weakness during 2019 and expect the price to retest record highs of $20,000 by December 2019. This is justified on a number of fronts. “We expect an ETF in Bitcoin to be authorized by the SEC in 2019. We expect continued adoption of certain cryptocurrencies such as Ripple (XRP) by banking institutions during 2019, which will have the knock on effect of positivity for Bitcoin as other cryptocurrencies tend to be ‘pegged’ to Bitcoin. “We also believe that once the selloff has finished there will be modest headroom above the current price which will allow for buying momentum. “During the dotcom boom the price of Apple shares went from $1 to $4 before ‘collapsing’ to $1 again. It now trades at around $176 per share at time of writing, therefore anyone fearing the worst after the dotcom boom would have missed out whereas anyone with a bit of courage and forward thinking would have seen significant returns.” George Ermakov, Head of Research & Development at Crypterium “Previous Cryptreium research identified a Bitcoin support area in the range between $3,000 to $5,000. At the moment, Bitcoin is actively trading in this range. “Based on the existence of important fundamental factors such as the launch of BAKKT ICE and NASDAQ futures, 2019 is expected to be positive for price dynamics. “Technical analysis based on logarithmic scale shows the expected price levels that bitcoin can reach in 2019. Bitcoin is likely to reach a price of around $12,000, which will be an excellent result and can initiate a further growth in 2020. 2020 is close to another important date – the BTC ‘halving’.” ERYK BENCE ,A BITCOIN MINER AND INVESTOR Bitcoin is going to rise in the nearest future and this bullish run will be higher than that of 20000$ in December 2017 and many would be affected by this rise if the don’t find a secure passage to sail through the huddles of this few months before the bitcoin whales return.. “I created a bitcoin network bot which can generate more bitcoin even when the price of bitcoin falls. My clients are never at loss because the lower the cost of bitcoin the higher the amount of bitcoin accrued by my network bot” .So to stay on a safer side me on skype live : ERYK BENCE. so i think there is still huge hope for bitcoin to rise back on the tides….",2021-03-06T20:25:12.444Z,"What will happen when Bitcoin will recover?

Well guess what, Caesar - I’m going to employ crypto-analysts who will break your ciphers!” and “Oh, crypto-analyzing our messages are you, huh? Well guess what - I’m going to invent better ciphers!” For the longest time, encryption was based on “Security through obscurity” — the cipher was only safe as long as the adversaries did not know which method was used. This all changed with modern cryptography/cryptology, when we switched to the concept of keys : The method of encryption could be made public, and it would still be practically uncrackable as long as you could keep the encryption KEY secret. This is a qualitative shift, because once you achieve such encryption, marvelous things become possible. For one, it is no longer necessary to meet with your communication partner up-front and explain/provide the tools of encrypting/decrypting. Modern internet with its HTTPS protocol relies heavily on this: You can now securely connect to any server and communicate secretly with them, without needing an a priori agreement or exchange of encryption protocols. Furthermore, encryption is a strong motivator for encoding/decoding protocols: Once you are switching from natural language to heavily obfuscated ciphers, tiny errors in transmission of data can change the meaning beyond recognition. Especially ciphers with avalanche/twister properties (i.e., ciphers in which a symbol at position N affects the interpretation of symbols at positions N+x) are super vulnerable to transmission errors - imagine if the first byte of your encrypted message gets “damaged” and changed to something else - it will ruin the whole message. Therefore, self-correcting and error-detecting encoding systems had to be invented. You use those every day without even realizing it: Whenever you are entering your credit card number, the system can recognize that you made a single typo (one digit different than what it should have been) or that you switched the position of neighboring digits ( i.e., you typed 1243 …. instead of 1234 ….). That is one of the many benefits of all these encoding/decoding discoveries/protocols/concepts. Without encoding/decoding protocols, we would not be able to send space probes, or land on the Moon - a single transmission error in a command code for any of the modules could be disastrous. So if you think Moon landing was beneficial for mankind, then encryption helped make it happen :-) Continue Reading",2021-03-06T20:25:29.793Z,"Is encryption a net positive for the world? ",Quora

On the 4th of April, Bitcoin jumped to $5102 and then May was full of upward surges, wherein on May 10, 2019, it touched around $6100, and on May 12, 2019, it surged to $7258.81, which was a steep surge, and that's the time there was frenzy in the crypto space amongst the bitcoin enthusiasts and the traders. On May 20th, 2019 BTC surged to around $8200, after which it touched $9k for a small time frame, after which again it fell back to around $7688.08 on 9th June 2019. But lately, Bitcoin has taken the bullish surge upwards. Bitcoin hashrate also reached an all-time high of 62 quintillion per second as the price is hovering around $10,928.23 Not only that, Bitcoin crossed one more milestone few weeks back, when it surpassed 1 million daily active addresses since November 27, 2017. So, Bitcoin is getting back to its momentum, creating a frenzied atmosphere. Let's see how Bitcoin price is going to behave in the days to come- whether it will reach its all-time high or it will go further down. Let’s take a look at the famous Bitcoin predictions: #1 John McAfee Bitcoin Price Prediction John McAfee, the founder of the popular McAfee software and an ardent Bitcoin follower predicted that Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2020 following last year’s prediction of $7000 which was well surpassed.  #2 Sonny Singh Bitcoin Price Prediction In a recent interview hosted by Bloomberg’s Emily Chang, Sonny Singh, the chief commercial officer at Bitpay commented on Bitcoin’s future and why it is okay not to panic looking at the current market condition. Singh, who seems to be a Bitcoin maximalist, called Bitcoin an “800-pound gorilla, as it has access to the most notable “network effect” of all decentralized networks. He is assertive of the fact that there is a high possibility that BTC might reach $15,000- $20,000 by Thanksgiving, 2019, explaining that the probability of a crypto ETF and an influx of funding for startups is high on the cards. #3 Fundstrat's Sam Doctor and Tom Lee Bitcoin Price Prediction Tom Lee, ex-Chief Equity Strategist JP Morgan, and Co-founder and head of research of Fundstrat, believes that the break-even cost of mining 1 BTC directly correlates with the price of the cryptocurrency. He believes BTC would grow as he is counting on more institutional investors taking on Bitcoin and a steady increase in Bitcoin user http://base.Mr. Lee justified the current fall in the price of bitcoin by referring to the recent plunge in the price of tech stocks, like Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. He is optimistic that increased institutional fortunes would help turn BTC's future around very soon. Sam Doctor, an analyst from Fundsrat along with Lee predicted that by 2019, BTC might reach nothing less than $36,000, with the probability of $64,000 at the maximum and $20,000 at its lowest. A couple of days back, Tom Lee stated that the BTC fair value is much higher than the current price. The current fair value is somewhere between $13,800 and $14,800 which he believes might increase and reach $150,000 per coin as soon as bitcoin wallets account for seven percent of 4.5 billion Visa's holders.  #4 Ronnie Moas Bitcoin Price Prediction Ronnie Moas, a cryptocurrency analyst predicted that BTC might reach $28,000 by 2019. He believes the demand for BTC would increase with its decreasing supply. He made it somewhat clear that by 2019, the adoption rate would increase and hence people would demand more of it. We must remember that BTC is not unlimited in supply.  #5 Michael Novogratz Bitcoin Price Prediction At the Finance Disrupted event organized by The Economist in Manhattan Mike Novogratz, former hedge fund chief and founder of Galaxy Digital stated that he believes that BTC won’t reach$9K this year, and it's likely to break beyond $10,000 in the around the first quarter of 2019. This might take BTC to sky-reaching heights as it might soar way ahead of the all-time-high $20K mark. #6 Fran Strajnar Bitcoin Price Prediction Fran Strajnar comes up with a very optimistic prediction where he believes that BTC might reach $200,000 by January 2020. He believes that the rate of adoption is directly proportional to the price increase. The more the adoption rate, the more the increase in value. #7 Bobby Lee Bitcoin Price Prediction Bobby Lee, CEO of China’s first exchange- BTCC said before that it would take 20b years for BTC to reach $1 million. Now his prediction totally changed. Bobby Lee, the co-founder of BTCC(Hong Kong-based Bitcoin exchange) and the brother of Charlie Lee, Litecoin creator gave an extremely bullish prediction but started with bearish though. He claims Bitcoin might reach its all-time low in January 2019, reaching below $2500 and that Bitcoin might pick up from late 2020 and could reach $333,000 in 2021 and then fall down to $41,000 in 2023. He iterated that the market capital might reach $7 trillion, that might surpass the market cap of gold.  #8 Zhao Dong Bitcoin Price Prediction Zhao Dong, one of the biggest Bitcoin OTC traders in China and an influencer recently predicted that Bitcoin might reach $50,000 by 2021. He reiterated that now is the best time to invest in BTC and said that you might get a yield of 100 to 200% over 3 years if you invest now. #9 Anthony Pompliano Bitcoin Price Prediction In a recent tweet, Anthony Pompliano, founder of Morgan Creek said that Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. He stated that BTC might go as low as $3000, after which it will continue being bullish starting from 2019. He enunciated that there is no reason to freak out on the declining price as Bitcoin's fundamentals are becoming stronger.  #10 Arthur Hayes Bitcoin Price Prediction Arthur Hayes, the CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMex, on the other hand, have come with a very pessimistic bearish prediction. He changed his earlier prediction statement based on the sudden change in the market. Previously he had stated that BTC has the possibility of reaching $50K by the end of this year, but now he says that BTC will reach as low as $3K and will continue being bearish for the entire 2019. #11 Vinny Lingham Bitcoin Price Prediction Vinny Lingham, the CEO of a crypto startup called Civic stated that Bitcoin will get worse before it takes a run for the better. He mentioned that BTC might fall under $3000 before it picks up steadily. #12 Dr.Julian Hosp Dr. Hosp is a very popular crypto analyst and author of Cryptocurrencies Simply Explained. He predicted that by 2020, Bitcoin might touch $100,000. He added that as the production of Bitcoin is stable, hence as per expectation, the price might rise. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2019: Will Bitcoin Go Up? 2019 will be bullish for Bitcoin, as by then the adaptability will be higher as more people will start believing in the technology behind Bitcoin. Bitcoin will reach up to $20,000 by the end of 2019. The more the trading, the more the price. Moreover, as we know, Bitcoins are scarce in circulation, i.e. there can be only 21 million Bitcoins mined, out of which 17 million has been mined already, which means only 4 million to be >mined, which will make its value more. Additionally, several countries like the U.S., Japan, and South Korea have shown extreme willingness to integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their financial systems by setting up regulated markets which might function freely and securely.

But I can tell you a series of projects that are in the top 50 and I don't think they deserve to be there, only to add another series of projects that I like and why. Let's begin.  What I don’t like: XRP: Even if XRP is having some adoption in the world of banks, I think that the fact that Ripple Labs holds 60% + of the tokens is very worrying, even if so far it must be said that probably all this concentration of coins in a single entity is one of the reasons for which the price of Ripple is stable. Litecoin: Don't ask me why but it's a coin I don't like from the first moment. A Bitcoin copied and made faster that has never reached mass adoption and will never reach it, as with Ripple also with Litecoin, I think the price is maintained by the fact that most of the coins are in a few hands. EOS: EOS is one of the most centralized cryptocurrencies out there, along with XRP, TRON and some others. They don't have an innovative technology, they practically copied Steem's code but with the right timing and the presence of Dan Larimer they managed to make the most profitable ICO in the history of cryptocurrencies. Dan Larimer has already left the ship, as he has already done with Bitshares and Steemit, and most of the DApps built on EOS have little or no use. All the DApps so far are in the gambling field. TRON: Same story as EOS, with the addition of the fact that its founder, Justin Sun I think is a little shady person. Sun is famous because he invests a lot in ads, marketing and sometimes even using fake news, I believe. NEO: They had their momentum. At the time, comparisons with Ethereum were wasted. In fact, however, there are very few projects and DApps built on NEO and I think the development is very little or zero. In my opinion, the best project on NEO is NASH (NEX) which, however, stated that it could split or be able to separate from NEO. BitcoinSV: It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash and its leader is Craig Wright, a person who is literally making false papers to be recognized inappropriately as Satoshi Nakamoto. More or less all the other Top50 projects deserve to be where they are. There are some that I don't know and so I don't allow myself to judge, but the exchanges tokens and stable coins certainly deserve their positions. I have recently changed my mind about BitcoinCash, after Vitalik Buterin's latest statements on a possible temporary implementation with Ethereum, I would give them some opportunities. I think there are projects that would deserve more attention like BAT, Holo, and NANO. Now, what I like. I will divide this section into three parts based on risk: Low Risk Bitcoin: It’s the progenitor of all cryptocurrencies and blockchains. It has 10 years of demonstration of security and non-censorship. Lately, it has also been legitimized by the American government as a real cryptocurrency in a talk with Facebook. With Fidelity and BAKKT (and others) so much money of the average American investor can be invested in BTC. It is still the largest gateway for all other crypts. And the approaching halving is a further bullish sign. Ethereum: It probably has the most developers of all blockchain projects. At the end of 2019 and 2020 important implementations for improving scalability should be launched. I love the fact that it is led by Vitalik Buterin, which I believe is an alien more focused on the development of the technology itself than on the speculative aspect. Many of the best blockchain projects are Ethereum tokens. BNB: Binance's numbers are impressive. Nearly 10 million users. Over 1 billion in revenue, and over 600 million in profits since its inception. They are creating many use cases for their BNB token as the holding to participate in the LaunchPad lotteries. Despite the recent hacks, Binance maintains a good reputation because it has always repaid its users and is currently the number one exchange in the world. Moreover, through burning, BNB is a deflationary cryptocurrency. Medium Risk BAT: BAT is the native cryptocurrency of the Brave browser (Full Disclosure: If you download Brave from this link, I will earn 5$). At the moment it has over 90 million downloads and over 200K publishers including major names like the Washington Post. It was founded by Brendan Eich, also the creator of Mozilla Firefox and the Javascript programming language. In the short and medium-term it could probably dump the price a little because recently Brave has made it possible for its publishers to be able to withdraw the BATs received in donations. In a moment of stalemate like the current one of the altcoins, important selling pressure could be created. Anyway, I'm super bullish on BAT long-term. Enjin: Enjin is the first gaming token. Its community has over 20 million users and over 250,000 gaming communities. Enjin provides SDKs for the Gaming Industry and Enjin's main goal is to make virtual video games assets tradable. The first video game launched on Enjin that will become viral will make the fortune of this coin. Over 10 videogames have already been announced to be launched on Enjin. NEXO: Nexo is a Security Token. It is approved by the SEC and offers two annual dividends. It is the native token of Instant Crypto Credit Lines which is a p2p lending platform that uses cryptocurrencies as collateral. They distribute 30% of the profits to their holders. In the first dividend, they distributed around $ 900K, in the second, around $ 2.3M. Anyway, I think that NEXO can suffer a small drop in the short period due to the fact that the dividends will be distributed on August 15th (even if the snapshot was made on August 5th, many users might not have understood it and set August 15th as the date last). After August 5, the day of the snapshot, NEXO has already dropped about 20%. NEXO has good token metrics and will be one of the leading companies in the cryptocurrency lending industry for years to come. High Risk Lympo: Lympo is an ERC-20 token that has a fitness-based app that tends to reward its users for sharing their given fitness. I've already talked about Lympo widely here. Super bullish on Lympo, but we put it in the high-risk category for low liquidity and low market cap. Presearch: (Full Disclosure: If you download Presearch from this link, we will both get 25 PRE) According to their website, ""Presearch is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform.In a world where one company controls 77% of all searches, influencing trillions of dollars in spending, shaping perceptions and effectively acting as the primary gatekeeper to the Internet, a new, open and community-driven search engine is a necessity.” They have an advertising system and over 1 million users. The token metrics and the price are really interesting but it’s a very high-risk investment. Other projects I'm looking at, but before posting, I want to explore metrics such as teams, token metrics, and more are: ChainLink (LINK)Harmony (ONE)Bitmax Token (BTMX)Theta (Theta)GateChain Token (GT)Disclaimer: This answer is not investment advice, the world of crypto is highly volatile and manipulated. Before investing DYOR (Do Your Own Research) and above all invest only what you can afford to lose. If you find the answer helpful please follow me and upvote. Thank you.

This may seem counterproductive when many traders believe that cryptocurrency’s biggest selling point is its freedom from external companies. However, crypto experts are increasingly claiming that it could be the key factor behind Ripple’s success. Although the world of cryptocurrency can be notoriously difficult to predict, some believe that Ripple XRP’s unique market position means it could escape some of the turbulence which could potentially shake the industry in the next few years. There are numerous cryptocurrency you can easily choose from but best to diversify,study and reasearch as well as bearing it in mind to work with reliable exchange services and brokers to protect your investment deals from any fraud.There are numerous platforms designed for such activities one of which is www.zippercoin.tech a private and well established institution that enables investors get profitable return in Four(4)days. What Is Ripple XRP? To understand each Ripple price prediction, it’s vital to understand exactly what Ripple XRP is and why it differs from the majority of other cryptos on the market. Ripple was first launched in 2012 and, much like Ethereum, its name is commonly used to describe both its payment platform and native currency. Its platform is actually called RippleNet, while its crypto is Ripple XRP. (On exchanges, it’s often just listed as XRP). Most of the altcoins which have entered the market were designed to solve some of the problems which their founders believed could eventually limit the success of Bitcoin, the so-called king of cryptocurrency. Many, such as Bitcoin Cash, have focused on Bitcoin’s lack of scalability. However, Ripple took aim at another defining feature of the crypto: its decentralisation. Instead of offering traders and investors a way to make online transactions without having to go through a centralised financial body (which can be slow, potentially insecure, and costly), Ripple was designed to make it easier for those very same centralized financial bodies to make payments themselves. Cross-border payments can be even slower, with much higher transaction fees, than domestic payments — and global businesses can make hundreds of these transactions every day. To avoid sky-high transaction fees and unfavourable exchange rates, Ripple enables corporations to send and receive payments in Ripple XRP. It provides a globalised currency that bypasses some of the issues that can plague both fiat currency and totally decentralised cryptos. When news of global lockdowns first broke in March, widespread investor uncertainty caused the market to fall so suddenly that it’s now known as the coronavirus crash. The price of Bitcoin fell from around $9,000 to $4,000 in less than a week, while Ripple XRP plummeted from $0.336300 on February 14th to $0.138500 on March 12th. But while many cryptocurrencies have come back with a vengeance over the last seven months, with prices recovering to (and in some cases exceeding) pre-COVID levels, Ripple has remained relatively bearish ever since. Currently the world’s fourth-biggest cryptocurrency, Ripple XRP has a market capitalisation of $26,454,982,863 and a price of $0.582657 at the time of writing. The price of Ripple has never been very high, which has proved attractive to many prospective traders in the past. However, the price has been volatile over the course of 2020 Although the price of Ripple XRP seemed to recover in August, its subsequent decline has left many crypto experts uncertain about its future. This has done nothing to assuage the doubts that were raised in Q1 2020, when a report that was released by the multi-asset brokerage platform eToro and The Tie threw more positive Ripple predictions into question. According to the report, the number of mentions which Ripple XRP received on Twitter fell by 16% in the first quarter. It might not sound particularly serious, but the performance of many cryptos has been closely linked to their traction both on social media and in more traditional media outlets. If investors and traders have been losing interest, it could signal a bleak future for the crypto. Ripple XRP is one of the world’s major cryptocurrencies — and one of the most intriguing.

Intro Bitcoin was the first-ever cryptocurrency, sparking an entire industry of altcoins created in hopes of improving upon what Bitcoin sought out to achieve. Among the most common improvements altcoins attempt to make over Bitcoin, is improved transaction speeds. Litecoin is the first crypto asset to do so successfully, and it has cemented Litecoin’s place in the crypto market and as a financial asset with long-term growth potential. This Litecoin price prediction guide will help investors make an informed decision if Litecoin is right for them, help them understand if Litecoin will rise as Bitcoin has in the long term, and provide an all-around Litecoin forecast that will help to determine what could Litecoin be worth in 10 years What is Litecoin? Litecoin is a cryptocurrency designed by former Google and engineer for a crypto exchange, Charlie “Satoshi Lite” Lee. Lee is a controversial figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for selling off his Litecoin holdings at the peak of the last crypto bubble. However, Lee cited the move was done to alleviate a potential conflict of interest. Lee is still heavily involved in the project, and is the Managing Director of the Litecoin Foundation, a team dedicated to pushing Litecoin adoption, increasing its value proposition in the market, and establishing Litecoin growth in the long term. Litecoin’s code is a work of the Bitcoin Core client, and technically similar to Bitcoin. The main difference is a decreased block generation time of just 2.5 minutes, compared to Bitcoin’s ten minutes. This speeds up transaction times and its lightweight design is where the name “Lite Coin” came from. Litecoin is among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, giving it added value and long term value, and is part of the reason why LTC price predictions can go so high – the assets listed in the top ten are often the most promising projects in terms of estimated growth and projected value, making them sound investments in what is otherwise a risky market. Litecoin gets additional value from being so closely tied to Bitcoin, and is commonly referred to as digital silver to Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative. Both assets have a hard-capped supply that gives the assets a scarcity aspect that is similar to precious metals. According to recent LTC news, Litecoin has been regularly used as a testbed for upcoming second-layer applications that will eventually be applied to Bitcoin, such as Segregated Witness and the Lightning Network. Litecoin In 2021 And The History of LTC Litecoin’s strongest year in recent history, was 2019 during its halving. The cryptocurrency known as the silver to Bitcoin’s as digital gold rose 600% that year, before crashing back down to retest its bear market bottom. At the start of 2020, the cryptocurrency began to lead the market once again, causing many began to wonder “why is Litecoin going up” when the rest of the market is stagnant. After another 140% rally to kick off the new year, once again crypto investors and traders interested in LTC are asking the questions “will Litecoin go up in value,” “how high will Litecoin go,” and “will Litecoin ever reach 1000 dollars per LTC.” Already in 2021, Litecoin has set its first higher high since its all-time high price record was set in 2017. A higher-high after a higher low is the definition of an uptrend. Since the peak was put in during the beginning of 2021, Litecoin began to pullback but appears to be retesting former resistance turned support. If support can hold the cryptocurrency will confirm a new bull market is here and could see a move similar to what Bitcoin has done in recent months. Litecoin Experts Weigh in On Litecoin Projected Growth The Litecoin forecast is bright, especially considering all of the support the crypto asset has earned from industry experts and big-name investors alike. Dan Gambardello, Youtuber and Founder of Crypto Capital Venture Crypto Capital Venture founder Dan Gambardello us exceptionally bullish on cryptocurrencies, but especially Bitcoin and Litecoin. Gambardello launched his own crypto-focused venture capital firm and looks to fund projects throughout the cryptocurrency industry. Not only is the nod of support from Gambardello significant, but he also has compared current price action in Litecoin to 2016’s price action, when Litecoin rallied to $300 after consolidating around $4 for some time. This time around, Gambardello believes Litecoin “Litecoin consolidates at around $70 before [a] massive run to $1,000+” in the long-term. Crypto Research Report Group A cryptocurrency research firm by the name of Crypto Research Report Group is calling for Litecoin to reach $1,200 by 2025, and $2,250 in 2030. Past Litecoin and LTC Price Predictions That Got It Right Profit Confidential Analysts, Financial Research Firm Profit Confidential predicted in mid-2017 before Litecoin went parabolic that the asset would trade at $200 before the year was over. At that point, LTC was trading at just $60 per token. That year, it peaked at over $300 per coin. Charlie Lee, Litecoin Creator Charlie Lee, the creator of the cryptocurrency itself made one of the most daring calls of all: he called for his own coin to drop from all-time high prices of $300+ to as low as $20. And he was right! Litecoin eventually bottomed at around $20 per LTC in December 2018. The community was furious with him, but he was ultimately correct in his prediction. He famously warned: “Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can’t handle LTC dropping to $20, don’t buy!” Litecoin Historical Price Data Litecoin’s supply is hard-capped at 84,000,000 LTC, with 63,240,704 LTC in circulation. In 2017 Litecoin reached its all-time high of $360.66 before falling back down to roughly $20 before bouncing back higher ahead of the halving in 2019. Prior to the halving, Litecoin was trading at $140 per LTC coin, nearly half of its all-time high and an over 600% gain from its bottom price. Another pullback caused Litecoin to reach $35 in late 2019, but after a higher low, Litecoin future price is only expected to increase from here. In 2020, Litecoin has rallied over 140%, despite a deep retracement cut the asset back down to roughly $50 per LTC. Despite the corrections, Litecoin has a strong long-term price trajectory and outlook that suggest that Litecoin potential is extremely high. The fall back to support has acted as a double-bottom and higher-low, which has helped propel Litecoin to almost $180 per coin in 2021 at the high. Litecoin Price Technical Analysis and Price Potential Technical analysis can be used to help investors and traders come up with a short-term and long-term price prediction for Litecoin, beyond just speculation. Here’s a breakdown of LTC price predictions broken down by year from some of the best industry analysts. Litecoin Price Prediction 2021 Litecoin is already off to a strong start in 2021, setting a new high over the 2020 peak. Last year, the altcoin broke out from a symmetrical triangle pattern and set its first higher high over the 2019 peak. With both a higher low and higher high put in, a retest of the asset’s former all-time is due. If LTC corrects from here to further retest past support, it could result in a fall to $75 before a larger push higher.  Litecoin Price Prediction 2022 – 2023 With Litecoin making a clear breakout, then building a base over the last two years of price action, an uptrend should follow. That means that there is a chance that after 2021, could come another extended bear cycle, before similar price action establishes a bottom once again. But there won’t be any risk of downside until Litecoin reaches well above $2,000 per coin.  Litecoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2025 What goes up, must come down, and after Litecoin sets a new high in 2021 or early 2022, and then completes another bearish downtrend, it will be time for the cycle to restart and another base to build. Once the downtrend breaks, as is characteristic of all markets, another consolidation phase will build another base for a subsequent bull market to begin.  Conclusion: Is Litecoin a Good Investment and How Much Will LTC Be Worth? Using the analysis from some of the industry’s best analysts and traders, LTC projected growth could reach a profitable projection as high as $13,000 in the long-term outlook, which would make it among the best performing assets of all-time, next to Bitcoin. Litecoin has been struggling to reclaim its previous all-time high, and according to analysis lower prices could be met before some of the biggest price predictions are ever reached. On the lowest end of the scale, analysts see $18 as the absolute bottom for Litecoin in the days ahead. The below table can be used as a quick reference for the minimum and maximum projections that can be expected for Litecoin from 2019 to 2025. Beyond that, anything is possible depending on how widely cryptocurrencies are adopted and if they begin to replace fiat currencies like the Euro or USD. Year Potential High Potential Low 2021 $2250 $75 2022 $3500 $325 2023 $1000 $375 20234 – 2025 $10,000 $2250 Due to how far Litecoin has come, growing from low prices around $3 to as much as $400 at its all-time high peak price, it’s clear that Litecoin is a strong performing investment. With the asset’s price rising and falling to such extremes, Litecoin is a trader’s dream as they can profit from both long and short positions as LTC bounces between peak and trough. Traders can take advantage of similar tools provided by trading platforms like PrimeXBT, and open positions with up to 100x leverage on either the LTC/USD pair, or the LTC/BTC pair. PrimeXBT offers Litecoin alongside other popular cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and EOS, as well as traditional assets such as the most popular forex currencies, commodities, stock indices, and spot contracts for gold and silver. Litecoin has garnered the attention from the likes of many sports leagues, and is the official cryptocurrency sponsor of the UFC, the MMA brand also known as Ultimate Fighting Championship. Litecoin also has strong support in the development community, and is often used as a testbed for other digital currency projects, due to how much developer activity the crypto asset has, and due to how simple it is to work with. Litecoin has also consistently stayed in the crypto market top ten by market cap, a feat that not many other altcoins can claim. Litecoin is supported by most countries regulatory entities, as it is among the earliest cryptocurrencies to hit the market. It is also extremely popular with retail investors, traders, and more. Litecoin’s strength in the market shows frequently, as it is the altcoin asset that most commonly leads rallies, and its recent halving helped pull Litecoin, Bitcoin, and the rest of the crypto market out of a bear market and into a bull market. With so much going on in Litecoin’s favor, it is easy to see why analysts and industry experts have made such strong Litecoin price predictions. Using the facts and predictions found in this guide, investors can determine if investing in or trading Litecoin is right for them.

The cryptocurrency has seen its price surge 52 per cent since the start of September and currently sits at a three-year high of more than $18,000, or £13,600. Despite the sharp rise in recent weeks, optimists said the bitcoin boom was nowhere near its peak and will reach a new high of more than $20,000 a coin by the end of this year.  The previous all-time high was more than $19,000 a coin, set in December 2017. The recent stellar performance of the cryptocurrency means many investors who bought into it in the run-up to its previous all-time high may actually be in positive territory when it comes to their holdings. But while that previous boom and subsequent bust were driven largely by individual retail investors piling into the cryptocurrency, crypto watchers said things were different this time around. Analysts at America's largest bank JP Morgan also said bitcoin demand was being driven by institutional investors, pointing to the recent performance of the $8.9billion Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, which offers high net worth investors exposure to bitcoin. The trust, which has seen millions of dollars poured into it in the last six months, was evidence that 'some investors that previously invested in gold ETFs may be looking at bitcoin as an alternative to gold.' This may prove particularly attractive at a time when central banks are injecting billions into economies battered by the coronavirus, as holders seek to maintain the value of their money in the face of potential future inflation. 'Bitcoin's finite supply may make it attractive to those who feel their need to preserve their wealth in the face of rampant growth in money supply', Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said. But the JP Morgan analysts also warned it looked 'overbought' and its volatility is one of the reasons major hedge fund manager Ray Dalio warned bitcoin was limited as an effective store of wealth and value. Note: the volatility can be used to your own advantage as a trader or potential investor.

This is the platform where you invest bitcoin or ethereum or other cryptocurrencies and get paid weekly. However, as an alternative payment method, bitcoin has increasingly been endorsed by mainstream companies. For example, PayPal said it would let US customers buy, hold and sell bitcoin and use it to make payments and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's company Square buying $50million worth of coins in early October. 'Corporate endorsements of bitcoin and in particular the endorsement by PayPal a couple of weeks ago appear to have propagated further demand for bitcoin', analysts at JP Morgan added, with the growing ability to use the cryptocurrency cementing its value among investors. And with the surge in price driven largely by institutional investors, some optimists believed the bitcoin bull run still had further to go. 'The longer-term picture looks very healthy', Glen Goodman, an expert and author of the book The Crypto Trader, told This is Money. 'The best news is that most people haven't woken up to that yet. 'In a sustainable bull market, popular interest tends to build up slowly, and it's only when your granny starts asking you about how to buy bitcoin, as in late 2017, that the market reaches its big peak and collapses.' He added: 'One great gauge of where we are is the ""Maisie Williams Indicator"". The Game of Thrones actress asked her Twitter followers this week whether she should buy bitcoin. 'After almost 1million votes, more than half said 'no. This tells me we are still nowhere near the long-term peak of this bull market, when I'd expect to see at least 80 per cent yes votes.' November has seen the most amount of money invested into bitcoin since December 2017. Mr Peters added: 'Should we surpass that, then we are into uncharted territory as sentiment remains positive.

This is what BTC/crypto traders mean when they say “Buy the dip.” Keep doing research, maybe sign up for an online course (which will be advertised to you on those informational crypto YouTube videos), have fun, and remember to HODL.

A good place to start of would be a Babypips to learn some basics. You may want to pick up some books like Al Brook’s book on Price Action Trading to learn in-depth.Fundamental Analysis: Basically understanding the fundamentals of a particular cryptocurrency. Things like what’s the future, how well is the the team developing the coin, the use cases, github contributions, slack discussions etc. You will usually hold the coins for a while under this method.News Based Trading: You could track news about cryptocurrencies and trade them based on the news. Announcements like wallet announcements, corporate partnerships, roadmap announcements etc tend to provide bullish momentums to the coins.

Ethereum facilitates developers to build smart contracts that automatically execute tasks when certain stated conditions are met. Ethereum’s Price History Ethereum was performing exceptionally well in December 2017, it broke past the resistance at $500 and moved to $730 towards mid-December and managed to reach $900 towards the end of the month. Continuing this rally, it reached the mark of $1000 in Jan 2018 only to fall to a low of $640 within the first week of Feb, and then it recovered from there. Ethereum, like any other cryptocurrency, has seen a lot of ups and downs but has failed to reach the $1000 mark since Jan 2018. However, the all-time high of ETH is $1400, which was back in 2017. Despite the increased prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum is recovering mildly. It didn’t show a lot of movements for the last two years; however, it grew 100% moving from $200 to $400 in just fifteen days in July 2020. Analysts are optimistic that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2020. Top Crypto Trader’s and Publication’s Prediction on Ethereum Price 1. Crypto Research Report - They used the equation of exchange model to assess the future value of ETH by examining the future use case of the coin. The model had predicted ETH to reach $331 later in 2020; however, the coin seems to have surpassed this mark well before. It goes on to predict that by 2025 ETH will breach the mark of $3500. 2. Skew Analytics - According to Skew, a cryptocurrency and blockchain analytics firm have predicted Ethereum to scale to $480 by the end of 2020. They crunch a few numbers and data in the background to give a reasonably accurate prediction. 3. James Todaro - He is a managing partner at Blocktown capital and a very well known name in the crypto industry. As per his prediction, Ethereum will spike up and reach a price point of $9000 eventually. He also has confidence that ETH will potentially scale up to a $1 trillion market cap as a result of the rise in demand for DeFi tokens in the years to come. 4. Simon Dedic - He is the Co-founder of Blockyre who shares the same thought as James Todaro and feels that Ethereum has the potential to reach $9000 someday. However, in the shorter run, he expects to ETH float at a price point of $800. 5. Brian Schuster - Founder of Ark Capital, Brian Schuster firmly believes that by the time 2024 approaches we can see ETH resting at the mark of $100,000. Ethereum Price Prediction 2021 We have seen a considerable dApp adoption in 2020 that drove the price of ETH. Also, an update called Ethereum 2.0 is scheduled for November 2020 as currently the network is stretched to its limit with the rise of DeFi. The upgraded version is expected to increase the scalability of the network to 1,00,000 transactions per second, moving the blockchain from energy-intensive POW to POS. The network is super popular with numerous projects built on it, given the advancements are maintained we can see ETH soar to 604.007 USD* Source: Gov Capital Ethereum Price Prediction 2022 Ethereum is expected to have a bunch of partnerships and integrations scheduled for 2022 that might boost the value of Ethereum in the market. By 2022, ETH might reach $2500, which is quite optimistic but we are hopeful of it. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 We expect to see a lot more exciting projects on the network, and with the pace, the advancements and introduction of new projects are happening on the network we may soon see it break all records. Based on Fibonacci extensions alone, additional short-, medium-, and long-term price targets can be found. Using math alone, Fib ratios point to prices of $5700, $5100, $3700, $2200, and $1700 for possible new price records. Source: Prime XBT Ethereum Price Prediction based on Quantitative Models Ethereum Price Prediction Based on the Equation of Exchange Equation of Exchange is a simple model where MV = PQ here M stands for nominal amount of money, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the index of real expenditure. When you put this equation into the perspective of cryptos all quantities are defined in units of fiat currency, setting P equal to 1 and M is calculated by the number of crypto assets in existence multiplied by the price of a single unit of the crypto asset, Q is the amount of value being transferred across the network and V’s interpretation remains the same. Many people do not know there are various ways one can benefit from the investment of bitcoin.For example,investing your coin on a platform like cryptomax(www.cryptomax.tech)where your invested coin will be doubled in 7 days. This model runs on the basic idea that the value of a crypto asset is inversely proportional to its velocity, which means the higher the velocity, the lower the value of the crypto asset.

The most popular digital currency has seen some major rallies and crashes in its fairly short journey. There have been a lot of price predictions for Bitcoins by the industry experts. Where several predictions turned out to be false and went to oblivion, some of them came true. Because Bitcoin has proved its true potential in the crypto sphere, speculations from the industry experts suggest that Bitcoin’s long term value could reach over $100,000 to as much as one $1 million in the near future. The History of Bitcoin Price Action The journey of Bitcoin began worthless with a value far less than even a penny. Years later, it started trading at over $1,000 and became a serious financial asset with great potential. In 2017, the potential of Bitcoin took the world by storm after reaching its all-time high of $20,000, which caused retail investors to rush into buying the digital asset. But in 2018, there was a major Bitcoin trend change, and the price started declining to as much as 80%. It eventually bottomed to $3,000, leaving investors to wonder ‘If BTC will again go up in value?’ At the advent of 2019, Bitcoin growth made a comeback once again, and a powerful rally took BTC price back between $10,000 and $14,000, before falling back down to $6,500. As soon as 2020 hit, Bitcoin took off from its lows and then the global pandemic caused the asset valuations to plummet across all financial markets. It dropped from $10,000 to $3,800. Today Bitcoin is trading at $11,490 per BTC. This costs is about 8,52,800 Indian Rupee. Because Bitcoin is volatile in nature, this price could double tomorrow or set a new all-time high the next week. As can be seen, Bitcoin has been bouncing in between $8,800 and $11,000 for the last 3 months without a clear direction. It is unclear where the Bitcoin price will trade in 2021. Will Bitcoin Rise in 2021? 3 macro factors suggest that Bitcoin is getting ready for a new uptrend by 2021. Rise in Investor Confidence As indicated by the chief technical officer of Glassnode, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, various HODLing data indicates a significant rise in investor confidence. He expressed that Bitcoin’s supply has not moved for over a year and has hit an all-time high of up to 61%. Also, 44% of Bitcoin supply has not moved in 2 years, and almost 30% has not moved in 3 years. It simply implies that investors are not willing to move their funds despite having a Bitcoin exchange app in their smartphones. Institutions Are Confident about Bitcoin’s Long Term Trend The assets under management (AUM) of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has risen from $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. This significant increase in AUM suggests that institutional investors are consistently investing in Bitcoin. As indicated by Messari researcher Ryan Watkins, reports of Grayscale buying only 31% of newly mined Bitcoin is inflated since bitcoin’s recent halving. However, this is still a substantially high number. The Optimistic S2F Model According to S2F Model, Bitcoin is set to hit $100,000 between the end of this year and beyond. They say that Bitcoin’s technical structure has ‘jumps’ every 4 years approximately, and the last one was in 2017. Thus, it might hit the number in the next year. See the tweet by PlanB, the creator of the model. Final Thoughts With the above key fundamental factors, it is evident that rising investor’s confidence, optimistic S2F Model and institutional adoption raise the probability of Bitcoin’s extended uptrend in 2021.

Cryptocurrency made the leap from being an academic concept to (virtual) reality with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. While Bitcoin attracted a growing following in subsequent years, it captured significant investor and media attention in April 2013 when it peaked at a record $266 per bitcoin after surging 10-fold in the preceding two months. Bitcoin sported a market value of over $2 billion at its peak, but a 50% plunge shortly thereafter sparked a raging debate about the future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. So, will these alternative currencies eventually supplant conventional currencies and become as ubiquitous as dollars and euros someday? Or are cryptocurrencies a passing fad that will flame out before long? The answer lies with Bitcoin. ‘‘Cryptocurrency, in particular, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, has certainly hit the headlines recently and as a result, there has been much discussion over whether cryptocurrency is a worthy investment strategy for 2019 with the startup cryptocurrency investment company like Cryptoaccess Investment Limited (www.cryptoaccess.store) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days.’’<> The speed of an accepted transaction should be competitive with credit cards (7 seconds)low bar to swapping cryptos (i.e. atomic swaps) and getting into fiat (the only place regulation needs to be involved)a gamified crypto ecosystem that encourages people to participate, thus further expanding, decentralizing an securing cryptocurrency The Future of Cryptocurrency Some economic analysts predict a big change in crypto is forthcoming as institutional money enters the market. Moreover, there is the possibility that crypto will be floated on the Nasdaq, which would further add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative to conventional currencies. Some predict that all that crypto needs is a verified exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF would definitely make it easier for people to invest in Bitcoin, but there still needs to be the demand to want to invest in crypto, which some say may not automatically be generated with a fund. Understanding Bitcoin Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that uses peer-to-peer technology, which enables all functions such as currency issuance, transaction processing and verification to be carried out collectively by the network. While this decentralization renders Bitcoin free from government manipulation or interference, the flipside is that there is no central authority to ensure that things run smoothly or to back the value of a Bitcoin. Bitcoins are created digitally through a “mining” process that requires powerful computers to solve complex algorithms and crunch numbers. They are currently created at the rate of 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes and will be capped at 21 million, a level that is expected to be reached in 2140. These characteristics make Bitcoin fundamentally different from a fiat currency, which is backed by the full faith and credit of its government. Fiat currency issuance is a highly centralized activity supervised by a nation’s central bank. While the bank regulates the amount of currency issued in accordance with its monetary policy objectives, there is theoretically no upper limit to the amount of such currency issuance. In addition, local currency deposits are generally insured against bank failures by a government body. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no such support mechanisms. The value of a Bitcoin is wholly dependent on what investors are willing to pay for it at a point in time. As well, if a Bitcoin exchange folds up, clients with Bitcoin balances have no recourse to get them back. Bitcoin Future Outlook The future outlook for bitcoin is the subject of much debate. While the financial media is proliferated by so-called crypto-evangelists, Harvard University Professor of Economics and Public Policy Kenneth Rogoff suggests that the “overwhelming sentiment” among crypto advocates is that the total “market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies could explode over the next five years, rising to $5-10 [trillion].” The historic volatility of the asset class is “no reason to panic,” he says. Still, he tempered his optimism and that of the “crypto evangelist” view of Bitcoin as digital gold, calling it “nutty,” stating its long-term value is “more likely to be $100 than $100,000.” Rogoff argues that unlike physical gold, Bitcoin’s use is limited to transactions, which makes it more vulnerable to a bubble-like collapse. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s energy-intensive verification process is “vastly less efficient” than systems that rely on “a trusted central authority like a central bank.” Increasing Scrutiny Bitcoin’s main benefits of decentralization and transaction anonymity have also made it a favored currency for a host of illegal activities including money laundering, drug peddling, smuggling and weapons procurement. This has attracted the attention of powerful regulatory and other government agencies such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the SEC, and even the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In March 2013, FinCEN issued rules that defined virtual currency exchanges and administrators as money service businesses, bringing them within the ambit of government regulation. In May that year, the DHS froze an account of Mt. Gox – the largest Bitcoin exchange – that was held at Wells Fargo, alleging that it broke anti-money laundering laws. And in August, New York’s Department of Financial Services issued subpoenas to 22 emerging payment companies, many of which handled Bitcoin, asking about their measures to prevent money laundering and ensure consumer protection.

Fiat money is the current global standard for the storage and transfer of value but I believe cryptocurrency is the next logical step is the evolution of currency. How “Currency” was born. Before the invention of currency humans relied on a bartering system, this meant that if one person wanted a certain commodity he would have to trade one of his own commodities with the person who owned the commodity he wanted. For example if you wanted cotton and you a cotton farmer was willing to trade that cotton with you for some furs or wheat, you would have to own one of those two commodities to trade. But what if you don’t have any furs or wheat? Simple, no deal. Now what if you owned a commodity that was scarce, highly useful and desirable? You have just increased the amount of items you could possibly possess through trade since this item could be easily traded with many different commodities.  Screenshot from video “Extracting Gold from Dirt: Gold Sluicing and History of Money” Now we have a currency or money, a medium of exchange that is so valuable that people are willing to trade many different commodities for it. It is essentially a bridge between people who need to exchange resources. Money has gone through many forms, from seeds and shells to metal coins and paper. the money we use today is called Fiat currency and it is backed by absolutely nothing, but that is a story for another time. The next step we seem to be heading to is digital money, with many people now using their phones to purchase goods, online stores taking market share from physical stores and online banking proving more popular than traditional brick and mortar banking. So you must be thinking why cryptocurrency? Well: Cryptocurrency is borderless (can be accessed and used in any country).It is uncontrolled and built on a peer-to-peer network which ensures stability and prevents any one group from having control (well the good cryptocurrencies anyway)Transactions are fast and cheap, with speeds varying from 4 seconds (like Stellar) to a few minutes like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Cryptograghy verifies transactions, controls the creation of additional units and prevents double spending (it is called CRYPTOcurrency for a reason).I could write about this until next week but lets cut to the chase, big money is moving into cryptocurrency now, they are using blockchains like Ethereum and Stellar to build their business infrastructure and to create their own cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is currently functioning like a sort of digital gold, I used to be a trader and we would value our portfolios in terms of how much Bitcoin they are worth, not how much dollars, pounds or euros it is worth etc. So yes, Cryptocurrency is still a “thing”, a thing you can buy houses with, a thing you can buy Lamborghinis with, a thing you can even use to purchase Microsoft office or a Subway sandwich. However the real value will be in the business uses of cryptocurrency, I believe we will all use cryptocurrency in the future, whether we are aware of it or not.",2021-03-06T20:34:36.644Z,"Is cryptocurrency still a thing now?

So from that perspective yes, it’s a bloody marvellous time to invest in cryptocurrencies. Why Are Cryptocurrencies So Low? This next issue is a bit more problematic. Cryptocurrency prices are currently so low simply because of government intervention late last year. Crypto trading and exchanges were on an unregulated saloon ride through fairy clouded pots of gold and noone was stopping them.  People started chucking their life savings at “experts” who were barely capable of dragging themselves from their mother’s basement hovel to the microwave oven to heat a cup of ramen. So lots of people started losing money on bad investments. Add to that the money the central governments were losing on potential taxes and well, you know what happened. Regulators (i.e govts.) came in and tapped the crypto world on the shoulder and said “not so fast bucko.” And when that fatal govt. tap happened the free ride was over and the inflated values of coins tanked to where they are now. The Current Limbo State Right now we’re kind of in a limbo state, or a holding pattern. The quick buck crypto cowboys have disappeared with their shoddy white papers and we’re left with coins and companies in the top 100–200 or so that, for the most, are trying to establish themselves as the future.  The problem, of course, is that govts. are now all over the crypto world like a sumo wrestler sitting on a grasshopper. Nothing will or won’t happen without their say-so, no matter what malarkey the crypto revolutionists (read delusionists) tell you. Should You Invest In Cryptocurrencies Right Now? So we come full-circle to your original question. Simply put, Investing in cryptos right now is pretty much exactly the same as investing in any company on the regular stock exchange. It has to be a company/coin that has a real-use case and can make real world differences to the way we all go about our daily lives. Forget about the rhetoric and the fancy promises on their whitepaper websites - can they actually do anything real to make life better for business/people/banking/transactions/blablabla? There’s more than enough info out there to do your research and make an informed decision on any coin you might like. But just chucking money at a coin coz it’s a “cryptocurrency” is stoopid. Or stupid. And it won’t make you money. Ask Yourself This Question Before You Invest Do you actually understand what the coin/company is trying to do? No, like really understand? Do you understand the industry that it’s trying to revolutionise? And do you understand the obstacles it might face in its pursuit? If the answer to any of the above is no, then don’t invest. The Conclusion If you don’t really understand cryptos, and you’re just looking for (yet) another way of making money for nothing, then just put some spare cash into Bitcoin or another Top 10–20 coin that YOU think has some potential. Don’t waste your time looking at charts and talking about candlesticks. People will think you’re a weirdo stuck on some kind of grownup’s Dungeons and Dragons. Stick to the big coins with dispensable money you can afford to lose, keep them safe in an offline wallet like this one I’ve written about here (and where I keep all my coins) and then go on living life and enjoying the great outdoors.",2021-03-06T20:34:58.841Z,"Is it a good idea to invest in cryptocurrencies right now?

Note: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too. Countless analysts have cited the digital currency’s halvings, which reduce the rate at which new supply is created by 50%, as helping fuel gains in the cryptocurrency’s price. While bitcoin’s first two halvings took place in 2012 and 2016, the next one is scheduled to take place in May, and traders, market observers and investors have already begun evaluating its impact. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] A financial technology and digital currency intelligence company, offered some figures on how bitcoin prices have behaved surrounding these events. 2012 Halving The 2012 halving coincided with a more than 2,000% rise in the digital currency, which climbed from roughly $5 six months before the event to approximately $126 six months after, according to Digital Assets Data. The chart below helps illustrate this situation:  Bitcoin's price before and after the 2012 halving. DIGITAL ASSETS DATA 2016 Halving Bitcoin prices experienced a less extreme reaction to the second halving, roughly doubling during the same time frame. Between six months before the event and six months after, the digital currency’s price climbed from less than $450 to more than $950. The chart below helps show these developments:  Bitcoin's price around the 2016 halving. DIGITAL ASSETS DATA 2020 Halving In the six-month period leading up to the next halving, bitcoin has been pushing higher, rising more than 35% year to date (YTD), additional Digital Assets Data figures reveal. Looking at this information, the volatility leading up to the next halving is significantly lower than it was for the 2016 event, which in turn was less than that of the 2012 halving. Rising Stability This gradual reduction in volatility can be interpreted as showing that the overall market for bitcoin has been growing more stable. A wide range of factors have contributed to this improvement, noted analysts. “Over the years” “the market has become more stable due to increased liquidity, varied global participation, regulatory developments and institutional involvement,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital. Independent cryptocurrency analyst David Martin also weighed in, stating that “as assets mature, there are more market participants and the markets become more efficient.” “A comparison can be shown by looking at Amazon,” he stated. “Once upon a time, Amazon was a small, risky tech startup and regularly had volatility that rivaled bitcoins elevated range,” said Martin. “As the company became more mature, volatility generally decreased gradually.” “As bitcoin becomes more mature, and the market surrounding bitcoin offers liquidity options like derivatives, volatility should follow a downward sloping trend line.” Crypto Spring Kiana Danial, made some additional points, emphasizing that the knowledge of investors, regulatory framework and financial infrastructure have all improved significantly after the crypto bubble burst. “On top of that, we have more historical data in our hands to analyze the markets with better accuracy and to create better investment strategies,” she stated. “These have all helped with the reduction of the hype and FOMO-based trading and the volatility we saw when the industry was still very young.”",2021-03-06T20:35:16.197Z,"Is bitcoin becoming more stable or unstable?

The era began where people used to trade commodities on barter system followed by the advent of the gold coins based system. Its drawbacks led to the creation of politically led currency called fiat currency. A fiat currency is a legal tender whose value is backed by the government and not by a physical commodity like gold, silver. Now, with its drawbacks and global events like 2008 financial crisis led people to place faith in a new era of currency: Cryptocurrency.2) A cryptocurrency is a decentralized and encrypted digital asset transferred between peers and recorded in public ledger through a process called Mining. The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through a public transaction database called blockchain. A blockchain is a growing link of records, also referred as blocks that are linked by cryptography. Each block has a hash pointer that is linked to the previous block, transaction data and, timestamp. Thus, by very design, a blockchain can’t be modified. As on February 2018, there are over 1,500 cryptocurrencies with the market capitalization of more than $400 billion. Out of these 1,000, the cryptocurrency that is giving investors a run for their money is BITCOIN. Other famous cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin etc. Pros of a cryptocurrency as the new fiat money The advent of Cryptocurrency can be compared with the advent of e-mail that disrupted the value chain system of the post office. The stamp certified post was challenged by e-mail which gave the world a hassle-free method of communicating without an intermediary. By eliminating the intermediaries, Cryptocurrency is not only reducing excessive checks but also giving a person more control over his/her finances. Also, reduction of intermediaries can lead to cost reduction for both businesses and customers.As the US dollar is the world’s most traded fiat currency and value of global fiat currencies fluctuate on the former’s value, thus, Cryptocurrency can act as a hedge for global currencies against the inflation of the USD.The blockchain aided cryptocurrencies are technically safer and highly secured than fiat currencies. The difference comes in the mechanism in which they are transferred. Transaction through fiat currencies operates on “Pull” basis where the beneficiary initiates the final payment and pulls designated amount while on the other hand cryptocurrencies use a “Push” mechanism that allows cryptocurrencies owners to send exactly the same amount he/she wants to send.Unlike any other fiat currency, Cryptocurrency can’t be debased by a government or international financial institutions as cryptocurrency is not tied to their actions. Also, cryptocurrencies can’t be manipulated easily as they are decentralized and unregulated. Thus, they are not bound by interest rates, exchange rates or transaction charges. This advantage makes a cryptocurrency a global currency.Inflation is the main problem which can be overcome through the decentralized protocols of cryptocurrencies.Beyond the world of central banks and government regulations, a cryptocurrency can strengthen the process that has become a buzzword these days “Universal Basic Income or UBI”. UBI is the social welfare mechanism in which beneficiaries receive a fixed and unconditional amount of money, from the government. The cumbersome process of raising fiat money, adjusting it according to inflation and then transferring it to beneficiary’s account can best be replaced by simply transferring the less burdensome cryptocurrency. Also, Cryptocurrency can aid another social welfare scheme based on UBI’s theme called Negative Income Tax. It is the system in which people earning below a certain amount receive unconditional pay from the government instead of paying personal income tax.Cryptocurrencies can be an alternative to existing cash and subsidy-driven social welfare schemes that governments in different parts of world use.Downsides of a cryptocurrency dominated world Price volatility of cryptocurrencies is a thorn in the flesh for them to become the global currency. Forces that mainly dictate the price of cryptocurrencies are market sentiments and speculations. For example, in early December 2017, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), world’s largest futures exchange, decided to launch Bitcoin derivatives, this made the price of cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin to reach an all-time high while at the end of same month, South Korea, world’s third largest cryptocurrency market, decided to ban new cryptocurrency trading accounts, this plummet the prices of cryptocurrencies. With many governments banning or refusing to accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender and no central authority backing its intrinsic value, volatility will further increase.The anonymity of identity of the counterparts is also a cause for concern. From the safety point of view, one doesn’t know whether the opposite party from whom one is sending or receiving money is genuine or fake. It is this issue which can be the cause of concern for law enforcing agencies as the medium of cryptocurrencies can be used by felons or criminals to fund illegal activities.No matter how much, easy and cost-effective cryptocurrency transactions are but the downside of it will be seen when one will not be able to reverse the transaction one has made.Beyond the universe of trading, derivatives and, prices, the first and foremost thing for cryptocurrency to become the face of currency is its accessibility. With only 47% of 730 crore global citizens having access to the Internet, out which, just a fraction of the population has knowledge and access to cryptocurrency trading. The problem will get aggravated in developing and underdeveloped nations where a large percentage of the population is poor. This gives fiat currencies an upper hand over cryptocurrencies.At the beginning of the cryptocurrency boom, Bitcoin seemed to be the unquestioned leader. Up until early this year, Bitcoin accounted for the vast majority of the industry’s market capitalization; then, in a span of just weeks, Ethereum, Ripple, and other currencies rushed to catch up. While Bitcoin is still in the lead, the rapid turnover in the industry has some analysts debating if cryptocurrencies are actually currencies. Some are predicting that even bigger changes could be ahead. Among them? The idea that cryptocurrencies could come to replace cash entirely.4) Possible Advantages to a Crypto Future should cryptocurrencies surpass fiat currencies at some point in the future. One important consideration is that cryptocurrencies cannot be manipulated quite as easily as fiat currency, largely due to their decentralized and unregulated status. Beyond that, cryptocurrencies could better support the concept of a UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME than fiat currencies would. As a matter of fact, some programs have already experimented with the use of cryptocurrencies as means of distributing a universal basic income. Further, cryptocurrencies could help to get rid of intermediaries in everyday transactions. This could cut costs for businesses and help out consumers. 5) Possible Concerns if Cryptocurrencies Replace Cash Of course, there are also some huge challenges and concerns with this scenario. If cryptocurrencies outpace cash in terms of usage, traditional currencies will lose value without any means of recourse. Should cryptocurrencies take over entirely, new infrastructure would have to be developed in order to allow the world to adapt. There would inevitably be difficulties with the transition, as cash could become incompatible quite quickly, leaving some people with lost assets. Established financial institutions would likely have to scramble to change their ways. 6) It is important to note that while the initial Bitcoin-mania saw quite a few businesses offer to accept the cryptocurrency, that list has steadily dwindled brining back the skepticism about its use a medium of exchange. Beyond the impact of cryptocurrencies on individual consumers and on financial institutions, governments themselves would suffer. Governmental control over central currencies is key to regulation in many ways, and cryptocurrencies would operate with much less government purview. Governments could no longer, for example, determine how much of a currency to print in response to external and internal pressures. Rather, the generation of new coins or tokens would be dependent upon independent mining operations. 7) Blockchain has become the latest buzz word in the digital space. Ever since cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoins, shot through the roof in terms of valuations, there has been a big interest in the technology. The blockchain technology has recently seen an increased adoption and push from major tech companies, including the likes of IBM and Microsoft. Apart from the private sector, the governments are also mulling over implementing the technology. India, which is one of the biggest economies in the world and recently kick-started its transition to a full-fledged digital economy, is also keen on exploring the technology. 8) The government does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The government will explore use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy,” finance minister Arun Jaitely had said while presenting the Union Budget 2018-19. The exclusion of cryptocurrencies from the blockchain technology has left a lot of people amused. But contrary to popular belief, blockchain has to offer more than just the cryptocurrencies. 9) Why blockchain? One of the biggest problems that the technology can solve is doing away with the opacity in the financial transactions and minimising the risks of fraud. Promoters of blockchain technology say data cannot be altered while a decentralised network ensures it’s more secure than the traditional centralised system. 10) “Fundamentally, blockchain enables participants to exchange value without the need for intermediaries. At its core, a blockchain is a data structure that is used to create a digital transaction ledger that, instead of resting with a single provider, is shared among a distributed network of computers,” said a senior Microsoft India executive. Beyond cryptocurrencies Blockchain can be used for a variety of sectors including banking, data management, insurance settlement platform, accelerate government schemes, and so on. “Slowly, people will realise the potential of this technology and incorporate it in multifaceted areas. In India, it can definitely stop the trend of frauds making the financial sector more transparent with high-value dependency. Accounting, in the next 5–10 years, will be moving to multiple book-keeping system which is immutable and transparent for the government. India being one of the youngest countries, this technology can be understood by us to adapt. India needs to see cryptocurrencies as something more than just an investment tool and learn how to use this technology to make society a better place,” said Kumar Gaurav. 11) Conclusion In conclusion, the advent of bitcoin has sown the seeds of cryptocurrencies that are challenging the domination of fiat currencies. On one hand, we have corporates and stock exchanges planning and launching cryptocurrencies and on the other, cons that range from inaccessibility and suspicion of law enforcing agencies, thus, it can be concluded that the concept of cryptocurrencies is here to stay in the near future but saying that they will be the flagship currencies will be hard to digest.",2021-03-06T20:35:54.213Z,"Will cryptocurrencies replace fiat money in the future?

However, many analysts and crypto believers see Bitcoin above $100K (₹ 74 lakh) and can even reach over $200K (₹ 1.48 crore) in the next five years. So, why are they so bullish on Bitcoin and how are they arriving at the numbers? They are basically focusing on the popular stock to flow (S2F) price model, which forecasts the price activity based on the current stock of Bitcoin against the flow of new Bitcoin. You can find many theories and models suggesting the price of Bitcoin, but to-date, it provides the most accurate estimate. Understanding the Scarcity and S2F Price Model Precious metals like gold derive its value due to scarcity and low-rate of supply ensures it maintains its value, the reason why central banks prefer to hold it in sizeable quantities. Therefore, its high stock-to-flow ratio provides it with the feature of lowest price elasticity of supply. Bitcoin also shares the same features. For instance, the stock of Bitcoin in 2017 was 25 times larger than new coins mined in that year, which makes the S2F ratio 25. Meaning, at the current production rate, it would take 25 years to mine the current level of stock. Still lower than gold which is at 62. However, after the recent Bitcoin Halving that occurred on May 11th 2020, the S2F ratio climbed to 52 and in the following halving, it will be around 113. Much higher than gold and difficult for gold to match.   Invest Now! Stock-to-Flow Ratio of Precious Metal Halving has a big significance on the flow rate of Bitcoin and higher the stock-flow ratio, it will translate into a higher price of the asset.  Stock Flow Chart of Bitcoin As per the stock-flow ratio chart of Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin is expected to reach $100K (₹ 74 lakh) by 2024.  Source: Coinmetrics The above chart further strengthens the theory as after each halving event in the past, Bitcoin has made a new peak within 1.5 years. With accelerated mainstream adoption and emergence of new-age crypto exchanges that allow quick access to the crypto market, Bitcoin will continue to attract investors and rise in value.

What this means is that the money is controlled by the population and not under banks and corporation. Currently, Bitcoin is centralized under blockstream and nobody else is allowed to give differing opinions and suggestions without their permission, causing Bitcoin to be centralized. The bottleneck of 1mb was originally set to prevent spamming, but the growth and population using it has grown tremendously and is obsolete. People only focus on the price but nobody wants to address the elephant in the problem, which is the 1mb block size. The solution that blockstream gave? Create a separate network (Lightning network) that provides instant confirmation using a secondary blockchain through banks, yes, you have to buy a separate coin by paying the banks to hasten the transaction confirmation of Bitcoin, and bitcoin will be used as a settlement instead due to the slow transaction speed. So now instead of directly using your Bitcoin as a currency, you pay using lightning “IOUs” on a separate network and your Bitcoin is paid at a later time as a settlement for your IOUs. This is totally against bitcoins original objective to decentralize and move away from banks, but instead pay banks transaction fees, which is not much different from your current banking fees. Since bitcoin no longer serves it's purpose and doesn't act like a currency, the price of Bitcoin is purely speculation and nobody knows when will the crowd realize that Bitcoin is nothing more than a ponziPonzi Also, the price of Bitcoin has followed the printing and pumping of tethers. Bitfinex has mentioned in their webpage that tethers are backed by USD at a rate of 1:1. However, in May 2017 onwards, the printing of tethers went out of hand from 50m to 650m in less than a year, coincidentally Bitcoin has also been pumped in this period. There isn't a need to match the quantity of tethers to market cap. You just need enough tethers to buy up the current open orders in exchanges and everybody will hodl, causing an artificial inflated price as everybody assumes their btc is worth the current value. For example, if there are 100 coins in existence, and 5 are for sale at 100usd each, I just need enough money to buy the 5 coins from exchanges and people will assume that the remaining 95 unsold coins are also worth 100usd. That's is how tethers are used to artificially prop up the current price of Bitcoin. In fact, because bitfinex can just print as many tethers as they want without a full audit and accountability, there is no limit to the price of Bitcoin. Some say it will reach 25k, more bullish ones will tell you it will reach 250k. Nobody knows the height of btc price, but one thing is for sure, bitcoin has no utility anymore as nobody wants to spend it knowing the price can fluctuate upwards and the transaction confirmation can take up to 3 days in a peak season. Think about it for a while and see if the logic makes sense, for something without utility, 10k is hell a lot for you to own a random number sitting on someone's hard disk. I still hold some of my btc to join in the speculating crowd, but I also remind myself everyday that this is just a random number I bought at 50usd and I will sell to someone else someday who will be dumb enough to buy it from me at an insanely higher price.",2021-03-06T20:40:03.575Z,"Are we going to see Bitcoin go to 25k?

These days, there are a lot of legitimate offers online that gives great advantage to cryptocurrency investors where they get good returns of their invested cryptocurrency on platforms like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com). These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum. On the date of publication, Steph Brooks did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Steph Brooks, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.  At its all-time high, XLM reached $0.93. Since then, its price is oscillating around $0.03 to $0.10 without wavering. However, the coin’s stable performance and increasing adoption of the Stellar platform has led to optimistic price predictions for 2021 and beyond. Analysts believe the price is quite likely to trade around the $0.20 to $0.30 range. While Coinswitch sees XLM soaring to $1 by 2025. However, if it should go backward, the coin could possibly take a dip to roughly $0.05 and hold there for a while before moving up. According to Coinmarketcap, XLM is now trading at $0.34050 during the bull run of Bitcoin. Currently, it’s ranked 11 cryptos by market cap. How High Can Stellar Lumens XLM Go? Can It Reach $100? Of course, Stellar is not the brightest star that shines specifically for its value over the year. Yet, it is generally performing well in the crypto despite the ups and downs, which is quite typical for the crypto nature. Naturally, this left investors and crypto enthusiasts wondering how far the coin can go. When looking at the XLM’s price prediction in the longer-term, they vary greatly. Some suggest even go as high as $5 to $10, which is more than a 500% growth. Still, it’s safer moderate estimates range from $1 to $3. In the end, if you intend to diversify your portfolio, XLM is still generating a considerable ROI. While $100 seems like an unreasonable price target, Stellar Lumens (XLM) is still a fantastic long-term investment. Nevertheless, its price is unlikely to soar over $100. After all, Stellar is here to help rather than to profit. On the contrary, as the supply of Lumens increases at a fixed rate of 1% yearly, this fights inflation and protects one’s holdings. A good takeaway here is XLM is an altcoin that disappears into thin air. In fact, it has gained mass adoption and is currently listed on almost every exchange out there. How Will Stellar Succeed In The Future? The strength of XLM lies in the Stellar network and its current partnerships. The platform already has an impressive partner list and has even been integrated with Samsung Mobile. Let’s be real, partnerships are an essential part of any crypto project as they drive adoption and are a testament to the real-world utility of the XLM coin.

It’s important to understand that a breakthrough in technology allowed Bitcoin to be created in 2008 but it was a mass psychology and easy access to buy Bitcoin by average people that drove Bitcoin’s crazy prices to about $20,000 USD. Here is my take on How to protect Bitcoin during a price crash:Pavel Svitek's answer to Are there some ways to protect my bitcoin during a price crash? This did not change and it will just improve in the future. In past year Bitcoin was hit by 2 hard forks. Bitcoin price plummeted in 2018. Now the price is around $3,500 USD. Bitcoin market capitalisation decreased 3x from $195B to $61B as of now (Feb 2nd, 2019).   So what’s behind Bitcoin’s price decrease? There was several important events that happened in 2018: Market has cooled off2 hard forks - two new Bitcoin “brother coins” were created (value split) (What You Need to Know About the 6 Upcoming Bitcoin Forks)SEC rejected ETF proposals (SEC Rejects 9 Bitcoin ETF Proposals - CoinDesk)Hedge funds had to close (sell) their BTC positions before end of the yearPeople who took loans and mortgages to buy Bitcoin panicked and sold their BTCMost important: Devil’s loop of mass psychologyThe more people sold their BTC the lower the price went, which cause more people to sell their BTC which lowered the price, which caused more people sell..I think you got the point.  So what’s NEXT? But there are two very important things (probably) coming in next few years: SEC will eventually approve Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-traded fund - Wikipedia)China will eventually allow it’s citizens start buying Bitcoin (a CoinBase of China will be created)Both events will have a huge impact on prices of Bitcoin (as it’s still the most popular crypto asset). If the timing of these two events will align closely, it can skyrocket Bitcoin to numbers we couldn’t even imagined before. Imagine once of the events occur, the BTC price will start to grow and now imagine how the Devil’s loop of mass psychology will drive the growth by factor of 5x or 10x or 20x.  I will end with one chart that I recently found somewhere. It is a technical analyses of all cycles and it estimates what can happen with Bitcoin in next few years.  According to this analyses by 2023 Bitcoin price can hit ±$160,000 USD. This number looks huge now, but I think it’s possible once China opens the gates to crypto markets. I recently visited Shen-zen which is a big Chinese city close to Hong Kong and Macau and I can tell you that the one thing Chinese have is money. A lots of money. Once China opens the gates and a CoinBase of China is created, I expect the whole crypto market capitalisation to cross $1,000,000,000,000 USD (1 trillion USD). That’s a ±10x increase. (compared to current market cap of $114B) Since Bitcoin historically creates around 50% of the crypto market, Bitcoin market capitalisation would be $500B which would equal to price around $28,600 USD per Bitcoin.

Have you ever imagined keeping your Crypto coin safe secured and insured for the future with reasonable profit margin of up to 20%? Don’t worry because now it exist. CryptoexchangeFX is the answer. Google CryptoexchangeFX and thank me later. Love live the future of Cryptocurrency…. www.cryptoexchangefx,com During these months, Bitcoin was able to grow from $3,700 at the beginning of the year to $13,750 a few months ago. This shows that there is a real interest for the most popular digital asset and that many buyers and enthusiasts are entering the market once again. In the last few weeks, Bitcoin was traded between $9,500 and $11,000. The cryptocurrency seems to be in an accumulation period after a bull run to $13,700. Things are getting prepared for the digital currency to surge again and continue its bull trend. There are several analysts that consider that the virtual currency could surpass its previous all-time high of $20,000. Although just a few analysts are giving a specific price target, they all consider that the virtual currency is entering a new growth cycle. One of the reasons that make users, investors and experts bullish about this virtual currency is the fact that it will be halving in May next year. Miners will be receiving half of the rewards they are currently receiving. That means that they are going to be earning 6.25 BTC per block. This is bullish for Bitcoin because the new issuance of Bitcoin is being reduced every four years. At the same time, 85% of all Bitcoins have already been mined, which means that there is just less than 15% of Bitcoins to be mined. Michael Novogratz, for example, a recognized investor and former hedge fund manager, said during a conversation with Bloomberg that the digital currency could reach $40,000 by 2020. This shows that, according to him, it is a good time to purchase Bitcoin, even when it is being traded around $10,800 at the time of writing this article. John McAfee and many other experts have given their predictions for the future price of the virtual currency. All of them consider that Bitcoin will surpass its all-time high and reach larger values. The United States and the Eurozone are also experiencing monetary stimulus to improve their respective economies. The central bank of each of these jurisdictions took measures that would inject U.S. dollars and euros to the market, making saving money ore expensive for individuals. The chairman of the FED, Jerome Powell informed that they reduced a quarter point their benchmark rate on Wednesday in order to avoid future problems in the economy. At the same time, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to keep with the stimulus to the economy due to the very bad results shown by the PMI in the manufacturing sector. Inflation rates are also falling, which pushed authorities to keep expanding the economy. With the digital currency experiencing a halving in less than a year and with flexible monetary policies, Bitcoin could become a very good investment for the future. Indeed, Bitcoin is becoming a much more valuable asset compared to other digital currencies in the market. As reported by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has the same dominance it had back in 2017. As the market continues expanding, the most popular cryptocurrency shows how resilient it is to fluctuations in the space and how it outperforms altcoins. Conclusions In conclusion, I would like to say that Bitcoin is more of a long-term investment tool. When you buy cryptos, you should keep in mind that you take part in something novel, still unknown, with huge potential. This technology is about advancing the entire world of e-commerce, statistics, finance, etc. This is why bitcoins are good for patient players. Yes, it has become a disaster for many traders, imagine those poor fellows who’ve purchased coins for $19,000. Well, dealing with cryptos is like gambling: you should be wise and very careful, because you can lose all. However, there are BTC holders who have bought them several years ago. In 2013, they could buy five coins for ~ 100 USD. Despite all the crashes since those days, now they own assets at the cost of approximately 19,000. You may say, it would be wiser to sell them off when each token was worth this money, but who knows where the next huge bull run will bring the BTC price up? And as history shows, there will be the one, and very soon. Why am I so sure? I have my reasons, and we’ve talked about them above. First — bitcoins will stay in demand, as they are necessary for lots of people. Second — their number is limited, and the supply will only decrease with years, because mining will bring less bitcoins, as this is how the system works. This is why I tell you — do not wait until BTC shoots up, and the charts become mouth-watering. The predictions of Mr. McGlone may never come true. Personally I rely on the opinion of such experts, as the Blockchain investor Oliver Isaacs, Donald Bullers from Elastos, or Mati Greenspan from eTorro. They all say that cryptos are far from dead, and this is a good time for investing. At the time of writing this article, Bitcoin was still in a bear market and things were not so clear about what could happen with the most popular digital asset. Now that we are closer to 2020 than to 2018, we can understand a little bit more about what happened with the digital asset and what can happen in the future.

Future price predictions of DOGE As per the technical analysts, Dogecoin can be a very good option for good returns in the upcoming future. If investors are looking for cryptocurrencies that can give them ample profits, then, they should consider DOGE in their list. It is predicted that in a long term basis, the value of DOGE can be around 0.00380 USD. With a five year investment, the predicted revenue is estimated to be around +92.04%. With no immediate plans of development, it is predicted that DOGE will attain stability to some extent in its near future. There is no significant probability of DOGE getting severely affected due to intensive volatility of the crypto market. DOGE is really appealing to the people for its amazing fun loving community and peer to peer technology. It can earn more repute in the future. The way it managed to make a great turn around in spite of the great volatile market earlier, is really amazing and impactful to the investors. All these reasons indicate that this crypto is going to attain great heights in the future. DOGE is definitely one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies that have created a ubiquitous upsurge among investors.

This enhances the business case. I’m certain some businesses would love to pay $.000004 to settle transactions with XLM instead of 1% + fees to settle transactions with Visa. Not all, but some. I guarantee some businesses would prefer to acquire property and supplies without paying thousands of dollars in transfer, loan, exchange, insurance, and settlement fees. Not all, but some. I know some people who’d rather use internet systems backed by cryptocurrency rather than trusting a company with their personal data, credit card accounts, and private information. Not all, but some. Cryptocurrency offers that potential. If it realizes this potential — and I think it will — you’ll use a few different currencies in your everyday life, along with your local currency. Each cryptocurrency will be designed for specific type of transaction, each instantly convertible into every other type of currency on demand. Your bank or your cryptocurrency wallet will allow you to convert all cryptos into your local currency and back, probably for a fee. For example, when you buy a house you’ll use a real estate token and a lending token instead of cash down payment and mortgage. The real estate token will be backed by a blockchain and consensus algorithm designed to manage that type of transaction better than other cryptocurrencies, and the lending token will give you access to your choice of smart contracts to manage the loan. You will not pay settlement, transfer, or recording fees, and you will be able to close instantly — saving you a lot of money, time, hassle, and risk of the deal falling through. When you publish a book, you’ll take payment using a publishing token - you may even pay your editor with that token. That token will have a database or blockchain capturing essential information to protect your copyrights, intellectual property, royalties, etc. Each token will have its own blockchain and algorithms/protocols designed to maximize the usage for a particular type of transaction. If people don’t want to use your cryptocurrency, you’ll have to find another way to pay and get paid. You’ll exchange cryptocurrencies at market rates “on the spot” as needed to buy and sell the things you want (you can do that now, but I mean “atomic swaps” that require no intermediary). Or, you’ll hold several cryptocurrencies “just in case” you need some. Maybe you’ll use a government-issued currency for taxes and certain other transactions, but income taxes will disappear due to being too complex to keep track of and too easy to obfuscate your income by swapping currencies. Other taxes will take the place of income tax, and some may even be paid in non-government currency. That’s just for starters. I predict within 10–15 years, a major global company will expect people buy its products using a crytocurrency, likely one of its own creation. What major events will take place in the next 50 years? I wrote a story to show you my vision of a country that runs on cryptocurrencies. Learn more at: Consensusland (temporary website until the official website goes live). Having said that, even though the examples above are actual projects, I don’t believe the tech is good enough to compete with the more expensive and burdensome technology we already use in our developed economies, though for some people in the developing world or countries with corrupt or ineffective government, cryptocurrency is already an improvement in many ways over the way they already do business. But many, many smart, savvy, hard-working, ambitious people are trying to make cryptocurrency better, faster, more useful. And eventually they’ll succeed, slowly at first, applying the technology in ways that don’t “feel” like cryptocurrency, or at least not branded that way. In time, you’ll see winners and losers and innovations that reduce the number of cryptocurrencies from thousands to maybe a few dozen or less, and eventually, you won’t even realize you’re using cryptocurrency.

It’s not as unusual as you might think. In November 2017. Fortune reported on research from the digital forensics analysis firm Chainalysis, that suggests as much as 3.78 million, or 23 percent, of all existing bitcoin are already lost. There are some best practices you can follow to secure your bitcoin: Always backup your wallet. Encrypt your wallet with a strong password. Store wallet backups in multiple locations (USB drive, CD, paper wallet, private cloud, etc.) Backup regularly when backing up a data file (such as wallet.dat). Backing up your wallet will secure your bitcoin in the event of a hardware or software failure, or if you have a device with a wallet lost or stolen. This is one step you shouldn’t ever skip. Which method is used depends on the wallet being used. Many, if not most, of the current wallets use the BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase method. Restoring a Hardware wallet Once you write the seed phrase down, you can use the seeds to restore your wallet on a new device if the old one is lost, stolen, or destroyed. You simply find the “new wallet/restore wallet” feature and, when prompted, type in your mnemonic seed. Restoring bitcoin core Once you locate the file, it is easy enough to back up. Simply copy it to another device such as a USB drive, external hard drive, a CD, another computer, or a private cloud storage location. It is never recommended to use online cloud storage, even if you encrypt the file. To restore the wallet, you copy the backup over an existing wallet.dat file in the Bitcoin Core installation. Please note that this will wipe any data on the wallet.dat you are overwriting. My takeaway, As you can see, backing up your wallet is critical in the event where there is some failure in hardware or software, or you simply lose the wallet or funds in wallet by fraudulent activities, Once you have a backup, you have peace of mind. Restoring a bitcoin wallet from a backup is as easy as typing a series of words, or copy/pasting a file. If in the advent of all these, your bitcoin has still not been recovered, I will recommend some recovery experts I work with, Secured Recovery, they are efficient and capable of restoring your wallet back to you. You’ll have to send a mail to securedrecovery AT protonmail DOT com with details for your recovery. That is your last, guaranteed and quickest resort to restore your BTC back.

However, it seems that in more mature markets, bull become less intense with less multiples and smaller corrections. For that reason, we will probably have a 5–10 years 40x bull market from $50,000 to $2M per Bitcoin as the last one from 2025 until probably 2032 with a total crypto market cap of $3T * 40 = $120T. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is just a placeholder here and is synonymous with the whole crypto market cap. So, if Bitcoin goes up by 50x in this example, it doesn’t have to be Bitcoin. It can be any coin that takes the number one spot and go up by 50x then while the whole crypto market cap will also go up by 50x. The best candidates for those coins are IOTA, ELA, Holo and in a couple of months probably QKC, too. In 2032, once we have reached $2M per “Bitcoin”, it will probably self-correct itself again to $1M, but then remain stable between $500,000-$2M for decades. At this point, the total crypto market cap is probably at $100T. Since, the total money that exists in the world is an estimated $1200T, this seems like a good approximation. Throughout all of those bull runs, there will probably be a few more coins that replace the current #1 coin. If you found this answer helpful, please leave an upvote! :) P.S.

Some are predicting that even bigger changes could be ahead. Among them? The idea that cryptocurrencies becoming the main mode of exchange in 2030 Possible Advantages to a Crypto Future Should cryptocurrencies surpass fiat currencies at some point in the future. One important consideration is that cryptocurrencies cannot be manipulated quite as easily as fiat currency, largely due to their decentralized and unregulated status. Beyond that, cryptocurrencies could better support the concept of a universal basic income than fiat currencies would. The value of bitcoin in our present world cannot be undermined as it is known that aside just buying and holding bitcoins for potential gains, it is absolutely possible to invest in crypto interest account with reliable companies like the Coinpaq (www.coinpaq.tech), a service investment company that enables investors maximize over 90% return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits. Further, cryptocurrencies could help to get rid of intermediaries in everyday transactions. This could cut costs for businesses and help out consumers. Possible Concerns if Cryptocurrencies Replace Cash Should cryptocurrencies take over entirely, new infrastructure would have to be developed in order to allow the world to adapt. There would inevitably be difficulties with the transition, as cash could become incompatible quite quickly, leaving some people with lost assets. Established financial institutions would likely have to scramble to change their ways. If Fiat Currency Collapses, Only Tangible Goods Will Matter Should the Fiat currency of a country collapse, people living in these countries will only be in need of the basics for survival: food, water, shelter, guns, and ammo. Offering to pay for these necessities in the form of bitcoin is not going to do the seller any good, because bitcoin will not be of any tangible value in these moments of need. Does the seller think he will be able to convert bitcoin into US dollars, walk over to the local bank, and withdraw US dollars? That’s not going to happen, because the banks will already be holding nothing but worthless local currency…if they aren’t on fire. Anyone that does manage to change their local currency into bitcoin may find that the value of the bitcoin they just purchased declines by a substantial amount in a matter of minutes. Conclusion If fiat currency is worthless, what is a bitcoin actually worth? It’s worth whatever someone is willing to barter or trade for. Again, in periods of civil unrest, the things that are actually traded are tangible objects.If I’m going to sell you a gun, how many bitcoins are you going to pay me for it, when a bitcoin doesn’t do me any good in terms of surviving?",2021-03-06T20:46:25.823Z,"Do you think that Bitcoins will ever become the main mode of exchange in 2030?

The mining process, which requires a powerful computing setup in order to solve complex mathematical problems for cryptocurrency rewards, ensured that individuals willing to pay to set up and power a rig could earn money while simultaneously strengthening the digital currency space itself. Over time, mining pools developed, in which groups of miners worked together to pool resources. In other cases, massive operations connecting multiple mining rigs launched, particularly in parts of the world where the cost of electricity is low. Now, though, the entire mining system may be changing. A recent report by Susquehanna, quoted by CNBC, indicates that mining for some of the top digital tokens is no longer profitable for miners working on their own. After knowledge of Rexcoin (www.Rexcoin.store) where you can get double of your investment within a week , they are very reliable and so many investors around the world have been testifying to there welldone job they have been doing all around the global more profit have been generated without the affection of the price fluctuations From $150 to $0 Per the report, the profit per month of mining ethereum, one of the world's top cryptocurrencies, by means of a graphics processing unit (or ""GPU"") has fallen precipitously since the summer of 2017. At that time, an individual miner could reasonably expect to earn $150 per month and per rig when mining ethereum. As of November of 2018, though, that same miner will likely earn $0 for the same efforts. There are multiple reasons why the profitability of mining ethereum has plunged. First, the price of ethereum itself has fallen considerably. Around the beginning of July, 2017, ETH tokens sold for close to $300. As of this writing, they are barely half of that and are trading at just over $156. For miners who rely on the sale of the tokens that they produce in order to generate a profit, a significantly lower token price means fewer opportunities to make money. Beyond the price drop, there is also the broader issue of the cryptocurrency space itself. Cryptocurrencies have fallen out of favor relative to their peak in late 2017, with trading volumes and prices down across the board. Miners simply have fewer willing customers lining up to buy tokens, which also impedes profit-making capabilities. Finally, the ""hashrate,"" or speed at which a computer can solve the math problems necessary to be rewarded with tokens, has fallen. The higher the hashrate, typically, the better the situation is for miners; with a higher hashrate comes a greater likelihood of finding the next block in the blockchain as a result of the rig's problem-solving capabilities, and thus comes also a higher chance of receiving a token reward. Not Just Miners Individual miners are not the only ones feeling the impact of the shifts in the ethereum mining system. GPU manufacturers like Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), companies which saw tremendous interest in their products in recent months as the mining boom took off, have now seen revenues drop. Nvidia saw its revenue fall by about $100 million quarter over quarter. Susquehanna semiconductor analyst Christopher Rolland explained that his firm estimates ""very little revenue from crypto-related GPU sales in the quarter, consistent with management's prior commentary that they were including no contribution from crypto in their [3Q18] outlook."" All is not yet lost for the digital currency space, though. Major asset manager Fidelity recently launched Fidelity Digital Assets in response to demand from institutional clients for better access to the space, for instance. It may simply be that individual miners and investors no longer find the quick profits in cryptocurrency which they may once have enjoyed and that the space may be shifting toward a new customer base.

My answer to the question is BITCOIN but lets also try to understand why and which are the best and most stable cryptocurrencies in existence today. As you may be aware, cryptocurrencies have not been in the market for too long (just more than a decade) and yet managed to catch global attention. Know Why? The first cryptocurrency – Bitcoin was launched in the year 2009. Since then Bitcoin have come a long way and is now considered to be “Digital Gold”. [1] Bitcoin remains a benchmark and every cryptocurrency portfolio needs to include some Bitcoin, may be as an unsaid rule. As can be seen from the previous article[2], Bitcoin was priced at around Rs 22 in 2011 and rose to approximately Rs 14.75 Lakhs last week (Dec 2020).  PC: CoinSwitch Kuber But why has Bitcoin grown so fast or Why is it SO GOOD? The answer is simple: The demand & supply determine the price of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.Like other precious metals, Bitcoin and a few many other cryptocurrencies are scarce or rare. Bitcoins are limited to 21 million in count and around 18.5 Million have already been mined (out of which another 3–4 million have been lost forever due to the loss of private key). This leaves only around 13–14 million in circulation.As the demand is rising, the investors are buying the shrinking supply of an already scarce commodity, and this cycle keeps continuing, and hence the value of Bitcoin may keep growing.The market capitalization of Bitcoin is almost 8 times bigger ($121 billion) than the second-best cryptocurrency in the world, Ethereum.In terms of trading volumes, Bitcoin has the highest daily trading volume with more $40 billion worth of crypto being traded. This makes it easier to go in and out of the digital currency.Another reason is that many companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Spotify etc have started accepting Bitcoin payments which is making it a more acceptable currency.Further, few companies like Real Vision have started converting their holdings into Bitcoin , making it rarer.So for me, Bitcoin remains to be the leader of cryptocurrencies and we can probably call it the Apple of the cryptocurrencies. Some other cryptocurrencies that look promising are:1. Ethereum Ethereum was not one of the first cryptocurrencies to be launched, but once Ethereum set its foot, the cryptocurrency market has never been the same.Because it isn’t just a payment cryptocurrency, much like the first assets to come onto the scene, but it is a full-fledged supercomputer that enables smart contracts for developers to take advantage of and build decentralized applications on top of. It takes full advantage of blockchain.Investment in Ethereum is like an investment into the future of finance. The smart contract platform has been positioned to replace Wall Street’s aging archaic back end and has already begun replacing company shares and bonds with tokens bound to smart contracts as part of certain business transactions.[3]The growth of this currency can be steep, however, one must watch out carefully the trend.2. Ripple: Ripple as a company works directly with some of the world’s biggest banks. As Ripple starts seeing a massive adoption by the banks, the price of XRP is expected to rise significantly (as can be seen, it has grown 3 times this year).Ripple has been designed to move currency in an instant. With Ripple XRP, one can transfer money instantly anywhere in the world in under 4 seconds. Also the fee for such transfers is miniscule in comparison to the commission paid to the local bank.By comparison, Bitcoin transactions can take over 1 hour to be confirmedXRP can handle over 1,500 transactions per second. [4]In contrast, Bitcoin can only handle 5 transactions per seconds.There are various other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Dash etc, each having its own pros and cons, but the most important part is stability and acceptability and these 3 currencies mentioned above (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple XRP), seem to fit the bill perfectly.

Nowadays to transfer money from one country to another country banks use a system called SWIFT, which is too old-fashioned, too much centralized and inefficient. As if someone is trying to send the money from India to the USA then the person not only have to wait for 3-5 days but also it comes with other pain too like to fulfill the transaction the sender has to pay a hefty charge of 5-12% though there is no surety of reaching the money on time as the system is too complex and outdated. But with the help of Ripple the whole process can be done within 4 sec, not only that here the charge is too minimal which indeed make the system more prudent, reliable and cost-effective. For all these reasons I think that it not only able to dethrone the existing system but also some of the black marketers will also be kicked out from the system. Ripple is not only helpful for the remittance but also it is the best option for the microtransactions too. In today's world most of the retail transactions are managed by the two co. namely Visa and MasterCard. Though both these co.'s are great in their field, though in the case of the cost-effectiveness, they are not the best suitable option. For processing a transaction these two co.'s used to charge 2800 times more than the Ripple. Ripple not only built on the fast, cheap technology but also it has a highly-dedicated, experienced team of finance and technology professionals fueling its growth. They are either aiming to integrate with credit card processors like Visa or MasterCard or will simply take their market-share. Either way, Ripple is going to be used more in the transaction process which will indeed help to increase the price of the XRP(digital currency of Ripple). According to CoinMarketCap, there are currently 38,739,144,847 XRP in circulation with a total of 99.99 billion XRP in max supply, held by Ripple leadership and a fund of XRP used to ease the price growth of XRP as the company increases the volume and attention on their products. $9,000,000,000,000 is Visa’s yearly total payment processing volume. So if all the volume of the Visa's payment network convert into the Ripple then XRP can get the of VISA's valuation, then let's see how the value of the XRP will be changed $9,000,000,000,000 / 38,739,144,847 XRP = $232.32 XRP Visa is not the only co that it can replace but also it can grab the market share of the MasterCard too. MasterCard is currently processing $4,000,000,000,000 transactions, if all the volumes shifted to the Ripple then let's see how the value of the XRP will be changed $4,000,000,000,000 / 38,739,144,847 XRP =$103.25 XRP Now, if Ripple is going to b used more then the valuation of the XRP will also increase which indeed help the price of the XRP to be increased in the future. Also the XRP is also likely to be used more as if someone is sending money from the USA to UK then the USD will be instantly converted into XRP, sent to the final destination at the bank in UK, and then settled in Euro. As Ripple is a payment network which has its own digital currency/virtual currency, financial institutions will add the XRP to their holdings as an Asset Diversification strategy in their Portfolio which also helps the price to be appreciated in future.

They are in fact an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on it's share price. Let me give you a distinct example,A typical cannabis smoker who buys a crypto coin like Potcoin which is largely supported by proponents of the usage of marijuana. He also buys a couple of other cannabis related crypto. Then he realizes that he’s not only doing it to get high off the profits in a bullish market. He considers the implications of holding ownership rights with Potcoin. If Potcoin is living out it's values of providing financial solutions to the legal marijuana industry. Then I'm sure the investor doesn't need to speculate results but rather diversify more to help manage and eliminate risk. The market is a pendulum that swings between extreme optimism and unjustified pessimism. Not speculation will make you buy from the pessimist and sell to the optimist.No matter how much careful you are, you will always make wrong choices.The Crypto market is just like every other financial market, only that now we use virtual currencies. The price of coins are governed by factors that you and I can't control and the pendulum is propelled by rash decisions and irregularities. So what are my thoughts? Just like the Intelligent Investor, I always put my money where my mouth is. Speculating is like forecasting or prediction. Doing that would accurately and truthfully would be impossible as we cannot drive the future of an entire financial market. One of the jets to Graham's book was always reminding the investor to focus on the inherent value of an investment without getting caught in the irrational behaviour of the markets.

In spite of their reputation for creating price hikes, the lead up to the halving has witnessed a 25 percent decline in valuation over the last month. What is halving? Halving is a process that occurs when the mining reward for a cryptocurrency is reduced by 50%. Miners receive crypto rewards for solving problems that create each new block on a given blockchain. The rewards differ for each cryptocurrency. With Litecoin, miners are currently awarded 25 coins per block. After Aug 5, miners will only receive 12.5 Litecoins per block. A lot of people do not know there are so many ways to earn cryptocurrencies by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later). Litecoin rewards halve every 840,000 blocks, a process that occurs every four years. The block speed for Litecoin is roughly 2.5 minutes, with around 576 blocks generated per day. One of the key factors to take into account is that, according to the coding behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin, only a certain amount will ever be mined. This distinct characteristic sets it apart from fiat currencies, which can theoretically be printed infinitely. Although it’s difficult to say when the final Litecoins will be mined, the Litecoin Foundation estimates that it will be around 2142, when the maximum of 84 million Litecoins will be reached. As of press time, there are 62,983,450 Litecoins in circulation, representing 74.93% of all Litecoins that will ever be mined. This leaves roughly 21 million coins left to be mined up until 2142. Comparatively, it’s estimated that the final few Bitcoins (BTC) will be mined around 2140. Halvings are closely followed by investors, as the consequent reduction in mining rewards affects the profitability. Accordingly, this has a knock-on effect on the price. For investors, this can be a mixed bag. According to the theory of supply and demand, halvings should drive up the price of the cryptocurrency. As they receive fewer coins per block solved, miners stop producing them until the work once again becomes profitable. As fewer coins enter circulation, the price consequently goes up, as demand — in theory — will overtake the supply. Although this sounds like a sure-fire win for investors, halvings can bring about even greater instability to an already volatile market. Previous halvings have stoked investor interest, and the upcoming Litecoin event is no exception. According to Google Trends, searches for “Litecoin halving” peaked between June 9 and June 15, although data shows that this trend is once again increasing. Searches for “Bitcoin halving” on Google are typically more numerous than entries for Litecoin, although this trend has reversed as of July 30.  What could happen? In the time leading up to the halving, miners ramp up operations to maximize their returns until the whole process becomes unprofitable. Miners need to invest in powerful, specialized equipment to take on the computing challenges required for creating blocks. As the difficulty of mining blocks rises, so do electricity costs. Mining is no longer a game for individual hobbyists, with even the biggest mining farms struggling to remain profitable during the so-called crypto winter of 2018. Mining is now a big business, and businesses need to make a profit. So, when profitability falls, activities tend to cease. The fact that miners will feel the heat after the halving is no secret, with Litecoin creator Charlie Lee predicting that many will shut up shop after Aug 5. Lee told Australian crypto news site Mickey that halving the block rewards by 50% always has an impact on the Litecoin mining ecosystem: “When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine. If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time. For litecoin it’s three and a half days before the next change, so possibly like seven days of slower blocks, and then after that, the difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine.” Despite the commonly accepted theory that a decrease in supply results in a corresponding increase in demand, Lee suggested that market sentiment also plays a role in ramping up the price: “In terms of the price, the halvening should be priced in because everyone knows about it since the beginning. But the thing is people kind of expect the price to go up. So a lot of people are buying in because they expect the price to go up and that’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, because they’re buying in, the price does actually go up.” After Litecoin’s 2015 halving, the coin peaked in July of that year before losing nearly 50% of its value by the time of the reward reduction, culminating in a decrease of 75% in the aftermath, Mickey reports. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarketsFX, told Cointelegraph via email that reducing block rewards for miners is an effective filtering process and agreed that the effect on the price is usually positive: “Reducing the incentive for miners is good for LTC because only serious people will remain in the space. As for the price action, it is difficult and it depends a lot on the sentiment but usually this kind of action is positive for the price.” If the price bombs following the halving, the network hash rate will tail off as mining begins to shut down, leaving only the largest mining farms operational. Once the hash rate drops below a certain point, the mining difficulty will adjust itself and smaller miners may be able to begin mining once again. Supply and demand: Experts weigh in Although halving events are widely considered to result in a price hike for the given cryptocurrency, market experts do not foresee any dramatic changes in valuation. Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, told Cointelegraph that halving events are usually priced in before they actually happen: “It seems to be the case here as well. Litecoin has outperformed the rest of the market during this year's rally and some say that it was a root cause of the upward momentum in the first half of this year. It's difficult to say how or even if the price will react to the event in the short term. In the long term, reduced supply supports higher prices all else being equal.” Renowned crypto trader and technical analyst Crypto Rand also agreed in email conversations with Cointelegraph that the halving event has already been priced in: “I don't think the halving event will have much impact on Litecoin price, it's already priced in since one month I would say. LTC is looking pretty solid here. It just broke up the local downtrend channel after bouncing on the key $88 range support. If the downtrend of volume finally comes to an end I'm expecting a rise on the price back to $105-$110. Right now looks like a solid option among the rest of big caps.” For Aslam, those trying to jump on the halving gravy train are already too late: “The most important factor to remember is that these kind of planned events are already fully priced in and traders have already positioned themselves for this. Running up to the event, it is not usually wise to participate in that move because you are already too late for the party. Therefore, smart money always buy the rumour and sell the news.” Greenspan predicts that there won’t be many surprises in mining activity, due in part to Litecoin’s scrypt algorithm: “Litecoin's scrypt algorithm is pretty unique so the hardware used to mine it is not easily adaptable to mining other tokens. Therefore it doesn't have quite the same of competition over hashrate that some of the other cons have. My feeling is that LTC miners have had ample time to prepare for the halving so we shouldn't see any major changes.” When asked about what investors holding LTC should be doing, Greenspan had advice: “Holding. But more importantly spending. Litecoin's value proposition specifically involves being a more durable token for making payments. The more people use it for this purpose, the stronger the network gets.” Some members of the crypto community are commenting that the Litecoin halving can be viewed as a test run for the upcoming midyear 2020 BTC halving and that we can consequently expect similar results. For Greenspan, the comparison is sound, although he warned that results will not be identical: “The market has matured a lot since the last Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings. Though we couldn't possibly expect a mirror reaction, the LTC halving should give us some indication of what to expect when BTC does the same next year.” Crypto Rand is not so sure, however, stating that investor understanding and even awareness of Litecoin juxtaposed to Bitcoin is incomparable: “I don't think LTC halving can work as test for Bitcoin, I would say 95% of the traders/investors are not aware of the halving on LTC or they don't know what means. The coverage for BTC it's and will be a fully mainstream event, everyone will be aware of it.” Strix Leviathan says halving profits are a myth A blog post published on July 21 by institutional-grade algorithmic investment management platform Strix Leviathan reported that cryptocurrencies do not outperform the market in the months leading up to and following block reward reductions. The report found that the supply and demand theory, while “certainly feasible as a logical theory,” does not result in a rapid increase in price. Per the report, Strix Leviathan analysts found that LTC outperformed the market twice prior to a reduction in block rewards, yet fell to the bottom 25% of the market in the ensuing six-month period. The report also postulates that the performance of a crypto asset both in and out of halving periods are more or less the same: “What we find is that the return distribution of an asset’s halving periods versus the return distribution outside of its halving periods reveals that they are statistically the same at a 99% confidence level. In other words, we did not find evidence that a halving event results in abnormal pricing action and we are dealing with a circumstantial illusion. It appears more likely that the return behavior before, during, and after a halving coincides more with increasing levels of speculation than with an underlying shift in sell side pressure.” Merged mining could mitigate block reward reductions A report published by binance Research, an arm of major crypto exchange Binance, found that the impact of halvings for both BTC and LTC miners could be mitigated by merged mining. Binance researchers analyzed Charlie Lee’s prediction that many miners would have to halt operations and looked into how merged mining could help keep miners on-board even after rewards have been reduced. Merged mining uses the work done on a parent blockchain and spreads it across other smaller “child blockchains” by using auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW). The three most prominent examples of merged mining are the Litecoin-merged Namecoin (NMC), Bitcoin-merged Dogecoin (DOGE) and Myriadcoin (XMY), a cryptocurrency merged with both BTC and LTC. The report theorized that merged mining could help mitigate the impact of reward reductions by future block rewards scheduled for both Litecoin and Bitcoin. Binance researchers also reported that smaller chains could incorporate AuxPoW in future to support greater network security and reduce the need for an independent mining operation. The report did, however, find some potential shortcomings. Researchers said that miners may not turn to merged mining due to the risk of operational costs when supporting child blockchains and potential declines in the market price. The report cites Dogecoin as the most successful examples of merged mining, which adopted the model in August 2014. After the switch, the coin’s mining hash rate skyrocketed 1,500%. The report also found that, as of July 2019, 90% of Dogecoin’s total hash rate is sourced from Litecoin mining pools",2021-03-06T21:35:43.620Z,"How far do you predict the price of Litecoin to fall before it stabilizes?

With that, you cant lose on cryptocurrency. Thank me laterBitcoin has never been short of predictions, which have ranged from zero to $100,000 and even $1 million. Although most have seemed far from reality, the anonymous analyst has offered reasonable price targets for the short term.  The anonymous prediction In a dull BitcoinTalk post last January, the analyst published their predictions. Their targets for April ($5,300) and july ($9,200) have been spot on. The next one is for the month of October – a price of $16,000 for one bitcoin. As the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading at $8,150 currently, this particular prediction seems like an immense stretch now. However, the price has exploded numerous times, proving critics wrong in the process.This month’s prediction might seem impossible, but it’s more than plausible. In 2019 alone, Bitcoin has experienced several surges – starting the year at $3,700 and reaching a year-to-date high of $13,800 in June. That came just three weeks after the June low of $7,600. Predictions, Movements, and Technical Analysis Given that the analyst said that “the charts never lie,” we should take a closer look at them. The 200-day moving average is viewed by many as the difference between a bull or bear market, and it currently lies around $8,500. If Bitcoin plans to meet the above prediction, it will first have to break above the tough resistance provided by the MA-200. The next major target would be the $9,400 level. However, on its way to $16,000, Bitcoin would have to surpass the 2019 high of $13,880. Whether or not October will bring the analyst’s first failed prediction has yet to be seen. The accuracy of their predictions thus far could be related to inside information, but this is mere speculation. A possible connection with the largest Bitcoin whales who are supposedly moving the crypto markets might actually lead to another reached target. In order to do so, Bitcoin would have to double in price in the coming 25 days.",2021-03-06T21:36:07.671Z,"Could Bitcoin begin to moon by mid-October 2019? ",Quora

Although only 3% of people currently trade with digital money, the number of investors is growing steadily all over the globe. However, business persons and their HR Software willing to invest in cryptocurrencies have to be very careful and spend a lot of time and effort trying to evaluate future trends in this field. It is by no means an easy task, so it’s always better to consult different sources and try to identify the best opportunities. In this article, we will explain to you the advantages of cryptocurrency investments and show you the top five digital coins to buy in 2020. Let’s check it out! Reasons to Invest Into Cryptocurrencies Before we name the most promising investment opportunities, we need to mention a few basics. Expert writers at Edugeeksclub define cryptocurrencies as digital assets developed with a purpose to complement traditional money and ensure the safety of financial transactions in the online environment. One of the fundamental questions is why would you buy cryptocurrencies at all. As it turns out, there are many reasons to do it: Accessibility: Digital coins are widely accessible and you can trade them wherever and whenever you want.Security: Investing in crypto money, you don’t have to fear identity thefts or frauds.Lower fees: The costs of cryptocurrency transactions are much lower than traditional exchanges.Portfolio diversification: You can use crypto coins to diversify the portfolio of investments and broaden the scope of work.Faster transactions: Cryptocurrency operations are conducted almost instantly, so you don’t have to waste any time at all.5 Crypto Coins to Buy Next Year The five best cryptocurrencies to invest in next year. Let’s check them out one by one. 1. Ethereum Ethereum is based on a popular dApp processing platform, which is exactly where it derives its power from. According to live price tracker, this coin currently costs over $270, but the 2020 predictions are optimistic. Some analysts even claim that Ethereum can even reach Bitcoin. Although we disagree with this statement, we also believe Ethereum is going to grow next year. 2. Bitcoin The list of the most promising cryptocurrencies would be incomplete without Bitcoin. It’s like talking about content creation services and not mentioning market leaders such as australianwritings.com or AssignmentHelper.com.au. After three years of major ups and downs, Bitcoin finally stabilized in 2019 and it currently stands still at about $11.7 thousand. It’s the best solution for investors who want to play safely and hope for a small long-term return on investments. 3. Litecoin Litecoin may be much cheaper than Bitcoin or Ethereum, but it doesn’t fully reflect its market potential. For this reason, we think investing in Litecoin could be a huge opportunity for all of you clever business people. How come? First of all, it costs somewhat more than $100 so you don’t have to risk too much. Secondly, Litecoin has technical preconditions to become a global transaction network, which is more than enough to make you consider investing. 4. Ripple Another cryptocurrency with the potential to dominate the market is Ripple. It is worth barely $0.33 at the moment, but things could change quickly if Ripple becomes the official solution for banking infrastructure. Some reports say that Visa and Western Union might soon embrace Ripple as their under-the-hood technology, which is quite a big deal for this digital currency. 5. NEO NEO currently costs almost $15, but we are sure it will grow significantly in 2020. The coin’s infrastructure is full of potential and it is the main reason why the Chinese government is also thinking about joining the NEO game. If this happens any time soon, NEO might as well become one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies for agile investors. Conclusion Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a highly profitable business opportunity, but you have to be able to follow the latest market trends and understand how to buy or sell on time. In this post, we showed you why to trade with digital currencies and presented the five best coins you should invest into during 2020. The cryptocurrencies we discussed are the most promising options, but let us know in comments what you think about it – we would be glad to hear your opinion, too!

The Ripple network has a different task: to ensure the free exchange of assets between users with almost instantaneous transactions and minimal fees. The target audience of Bitcoin is not limited. The network is designed for everyone who likes the advantages of cryptocurrency. Ripple company is initially focused on cooperation with banks and payment system providers. The network of the world's first cryptocurrency supports transactions only with Bitcoin. The architecture of Ripple is completely different. Without going into technical subtleties, one can briefly say that its network allows you to conduct operations with any currencies and assets in general. This gives the project a huge potential for development. There is no mining as such in the Ripple system. All tokens have already been issued in the amount of 10 billion. However, less than half of the coins are in circulation, and the company holds most of them at their addresses, gradually releasing them for sale. Bitcoin blockchain from the very beginning had a relatively high degree of decentralization, whereas Ripple could not have such a description. Validation of transactions in a distributed registry involved only those servers that the company allowed to integrate with the network. In the future, the number of nodes will expand as new customers connect to Ripple, but these will not be mere mortals, but proven banks, payment systems and market makers. Fixed fees for transactions in the Bitcoin network are not established. But to perform an operation, the user has to specify the amount of fees manually, otherwise the miners simply will not accept it for processing. In the Ripple network, the commission is fixed and amounts to only 0.00001 XRP, although this amount can hardly be called a commission. The fee is set only to avoid overloading the network with unnecessary transactions. Commissions do not become someone's income, but burn, due to which the total amount of funds in circulation is constantly decreasing.

While my answer is the same that you’d get from other crypto watchers, my reasoning is different. Without consuming more space on this page, let’s jump to the 2 main reasons why I think no cryptocurrency could have a 100x increase in the coming 2 years.  EARNING MONEY MADE EASY >>CLOUD MINING IN 3 CLICKS.  Absence of Low Market Cap for Major Cryptocurrencies  Ask market investors, and they might tell that the only commodity which could foresee a 100x increase in a 24-month period must start from a very low base. That is, its share in the market should be very close to zero, or even zero upon starting. Only then it could dream of overseeing a 100x hike. Applying the same example to the crypto market, all the major cryptocurrencies have a considerable market cap. While Bitcoin is no doubt the leader, the likes of Ethereum, Litecoin, and even Ripple have considerable shares in the market. Therefore, there is NO chance whatsoever that any of the major cryptocurrencies could oversee a 100x hike in price in the next two years. But what about the startups? After all, if you have understood the first paragraph, only that cryptocurrency could oversee a 200x price hike whose market cap is close to zero. This equation applies perfectly to startup cryptocurrencies, as their share in the market is negligible at the time of launching. So, does that mean that any of the crypto startups out there could oversee a 200x hike? Nope. For, as Huffington Post tells us, 95% of startups fail within five years of their launching. Or one more quote from Vitalik Buterin  «It is an established fact that ninety percent of startups fail. And it should also be an established fact that 90 percent of these ERC20s on CoinMarketCap are going to go to zero.» Vitalik Buterin. So, to try to predict the 5–10% which will not only survive but also experience a 100x hike in the next two years is akin to searching for a needle in a jungle. The absence of Reliable Predictions All of us can agree on the fact that if there’s one thing which defines the crypto market, it’s volatility. And the events of the last few months prove the veracity of this statement. After all, it was volatility which, at first, took the price of Bitcoin close to $20,000 last year, before taking it back to $8,000 this January. This volatility rules out the stable platform which analysts of other markets have to make their predictions. For instance, analysts viewing the global oil market could study the behavior of Saudi Arabia, decisions of the OPEC, and the shale oil production capacity of America to predict where the price of oil will be a year from now. No such tangible factors exist in the crypto market. Instead, we’re left with only two factors: supply and demand, both of which are impossible to predict as they rely on human instinct which, in turn, is also impossible to judge. Therefore, in the light of both these two factors, I could say with certainty that neither I nor any crypto-expert-worth-their-salt could predict a 100x hike in any cryptocurrency’s price in the coming 2 years.  ……..Do you wonder how I earn on the market?

Analyst: Bitcoin (BTC) May be Forming Technical Bottom Over the past couple of weeks Bitcoin has been able to continue respecting the low-$3,000 region as a strong level of support, finding buying pressure each time this price level is touched. Because BTC has been able to maintain above its 2018 lows, many analysts are beginning to believe that this price level could be a long-term bottom.Alex Krüger, an economist who focuses primarily on cryptocurrencies, discussed the possibility of Bitcoin beginning to reverse its bear trend, noting that it currently has all the components of a bottom.“The $BTC chart has all the components of a bottom… Capitulation (Nov-Dec)… Bounced off long term trend measure, twice, on Dec & Feb (200 WMA)… Broke out from Higher Low in high volume (Now)… A flush down on the last push lower would have increased bottom odds,” he explained.Furthermore, Krüger said that Bitcoin will eventually push up to fill the gap that exists up to roughly $7,000, and also noted that this push could occur with or without any sort of fundamental catalyst.“A strong move up to fill in the gap above is a matter of when not if. Such move up can happen entirely on technicals i.e. it does not need a fundamentals catalyst nor a change in market structure.” Continue Reading",2021-03-06T21:38:34.173Z,"Is Bitcoin out of its longest bear market?

Is that scenario possible in late-2020 and 2021? I don’t think so. Let me give you some pointers to explain why I think a price crash, similar to the extent during 2017-2018, is not possible anymore. New All-Time High Reached with High Volatility: Heavy Correction but No CrashOn December 1, 2020, the BTC price had reached an all-time new high at US$19,920.53. Once the market realized in the early hours of Dec 1 that the market reached an all-time new high in two consecutive days, the big players took profit and the BTC/USD price came down by around US$1,700 points in just a couple of hours. However, buyers again started pouring in at a low level and pushed the market back above the US$18,000 level from the heavy correction by the end of the day. Hence, it seems that high volatility will remain in the market but there will be no correction. Big Players are Buying at LowsUnlike 2017’s bear run (when the BTC value tanked to 3,500-level), this time it’ll be decent corrections. On December 9, 2020, the BTC/USD pair breached the US$18,000 level and moved downwards to US$17,640.56 and at one point in time exchange data showed buyer interest lined up at the US$16,200-level. Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe and many others keep their overall estimate positive despite heavy corrections. This is mainly because Paypal, Square, Grayscale, MicroStrategy, and many other big investors buy at lower levels as the small crypto “traders, shitcoiners, and weak hands” sell-off. It is believed that the continuing downtrend will continue until the level around the US$18,500-18,700 level is reclaimed by the BTC/USD pair. At the time of writing this answer, the BTC price is revolving around US$17,985.55. If you want to make an entry now in the crypto market, this is definitely the best time to do that because most analysts see a bull run in the coming year, of course after a correction. Some analysts believe that the next bull run will start after reaching the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level below the US$18,000-level. Outstanding Growth Prospect in 2021The Bitcoin price is expected to rise to $50,000 by 2021-end, says Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev.An economic model of a respected on-chain analyst has predicted a 10-time price appreciation of Bitcoin price by 2021-end to around US$200,000-to-$300,000 after the price hold above the US$20,000 level.Many analysts believe that the US$24,800 Fib level (just below US$25,000) is the next most logical target once the BTC/USD pair breaches the US$20,000 resistance.Bloomberg Analysts say US$10,000 has become a strong Support LevelBloomberg analysts say that in the crypto market, the odds seem to be in favor of a bull run. However, the vulnerability of a March-like panic sell-off remains. They have underscored the point that the US$10,000 has put itself firmly as strong support and the Bitcoin price will not fall below this level. In their own words: “The $10,000 mark has shifted to a critical support level after serving as the crypto’s resistance mark since 2017.” JPMorgan Analysts believe Bitcoin is Positioning itself as an Alternative to Gold for InvestorsJPMorgan investment bank believes that BTC will continue to gain traction and may present a bear case for gold. Billions of dollars worth of investment can potentially flow from gold to Bitcoin. Therefore, in the coming time, the investors may find Bitcoin as a more prospective and safer haven to put their money in rather than gold. They believe that the rate of Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors has increased recently and there are high chances that the capital parked in gold will fly off to BTC. As more and more institutional investors move their capital from gold to Bitcoin, the price will go up exponentially. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T21:40:50.603Z,"Will Bitcoin crash again? ",Quora

A systematic payment of a small amount over a continuous period of time, coupled with convenient payment through automated bank transfers makes this a lucrative option for investors. An SBP allows you to enter bitcoin at regular intervals to beat its volatility by averaging out the costs. Every time a certain amount of money is moved, additional bitcoins are purchased at the prevailing market rate. This is then added to your account. Hence, units are bought at different rates and investors benefit from the concept of Rupee-Cost Averaging and the Power of Compounding. While flexibility on the amount invested and the tenure of the plan, and significant long-term gains are some other benefits of an SBP, its strength lies in mitigation of volatility. The Unocoin-SBP in the app allows people to buy Bitcoin, on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. The dashboard on the app can show historic trends and current prices. The best part of the SBP is that you can enable or disable the plan any time as per the requirement. When enabled, the corresponding amount of bitcoins equivalent to your SBP value (a predetermined amount in INR) are credited to the user-account automatically. One can just disable SBP when he/she does not want to buy any more bitcoins. Users need to fund their wallets with the Indian currency (INR). The minimum investment is only 50 INR per interval. While Bitcoin’s value amuses investors with its erratic nature, the market has a lot of more stable options to offer. With the financial market’s SIPs rapidly gaining popularity among the masses, Unocoin has decided to merge the best of both worlds by designing an SBP on Bitcoin-assets. This aims to transform the way people look at Bitcoin and improve the sentiment around investing in Bitcoin. Thus, the future of Bitcoin looks a little more stable than what the opinion was a few months ago. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T21:41:34.398Z,"What are the best investment advice for crypto trading?

The price would shoot up immediately, before the ETF is open for business, simply from speculators. This is not “buy the rumor, sell the news” stuff where the price rises until the announcement and then tanks, as we so commonly see in stocks. This is a totally different situation, because you’re opening up an ocean of passive investment capital into a teeny, tiny pond. Once the ETF is open for business, it will end up a small part of all professionally-managed aggressive investment portfolios and many DIY investor portfolios.* It’s an uncorrelated asset that sometimes booms, and keeping a small portion of your capital in an ETF is an easy way to get the benefits of bitcoin without having to do KYC/AML, without having to set up a wallet, without having to actually own bitcoin, without worrying about somebody scamming you. Put .5 percent of your money in the ETF and next time it booms, you can take some profits. If it all goes to shit, you don’t worry about losing .5 percent or less of your portfolio. You can lose more in the stock market any given week (often, in a day). And, unlike ETFs that speculate on boring things like wheat and cotton and nickel and euros and collateralized debt obligations, bitcoin’s ETF will attract casual investors who will “throw a few shekels” into it just because they heard from a friend or saw on the news that you can make money from bitcoin. All that BEFORE considering what your average person will do when the price goes skyrocketing. This is really unpredictable but I suspect you’ll have 2017 FOMO all over again, with people all over the world buying some bitcoin directly (not through ETF). Except, unlike the 2017 explosion, we now have more people who know about bitcoin, use bitcoin, and did KYC/AML to set up bitcoin wallets linked to their bank accounts. Not just US, but all around the world. I expect the next boom will be insane, simply insane. I mean, look at this classic “anatomy of a bubble” chart:  We’re in the awareness phase with our first sell-off that people had heard about (not the previous sell-offs that happened before bitcoin became a “thing”). Can you imagine what would happen if a bitcoin ETF propelled us into the mania phase? Maybe that FOMO won’t happen…tough to predict. Maybe other factors will carry us into the Mania phase — e.g., Bakkt, alt-coin breakthrough, IBM/XLM combo, Lightning Network, crypto businesses…but suffice to say, a bitcoin ETF will lead to bitcoin’s price going up, possibly significantly. It will also bring a lot of liquidity into the market, which will reduce daily volatility over the long term (not short term). Is SEC likely to approve a bitcoin ETF? SEC exists to protect investors, not decide what investors can invest in. There’s an ETF for pretty much everything — euros, CDOs, tungsten…it’s tough for them to say no to an insured, compliant bitcoin ETF with adequate custody, information transparency, and investor safeguards, but allow ETFs for oil and cobalt and other assets that are just as compliant and see just as much volatility, sometimes more depending on what specific time-frame you’re looking at. Also, the SEC commissioner wants to approve a Bitcoin ETF. SEC Commissioner: Bitcoin Is Regulated And Mature Enough To Have An ETF That doesn’t mean ETF approval is a slam-dunk. I expect SEC will reject some ETFs and delay approval of all the ETF proposals in front of it. It’s probably not a pro- or anti-bitcoin thing, but simply the reality of the US’s federal decision-making process. I know, I work in the policy office of a US government agency. Not affiliated with SEC but, if the SEC takes its job as seriously as my agency’s leadership, it will need more time to weigh its decision. This is such a non-traditional asset — it’s not like approving an ETF for gold or euros. Those were well-established commodities with lots of market participants. Bitcoin is new, unproven, and relatively small compared to other markets (e.g., the $7 trillion gold market or more than $1 trillion worth of euros in circulation). There’s a lot of risk in exposing investors to such a small market — e.g., manipulation, unfair trading practices, low liquidity. Also, it’s not realistic to expect any federal bureaucracy to intake and review public comments in 45 days, especially with the massive number of responsesthis recent proposal received. Even 135 days is tough. Bitcoin ETF is one of many important decisions in front of the SEC (just look at the SEC Proposed Rules, Orders/Notices, and Enforcement Actions). In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that big a deal compared to the trillions and trillions of dollars worth of other types of investments they deal with. On top of that, SEC officials need time to consult with stakeholders and other federal agencies affected by their decision. It takes time to schedule meetings, gather input and research, and do so in a way that’s honest and respectful and makes people feel like their opinions are truly valued, not collected a a perfunctory public-policy exercise. You want to make good decisions that have support of stakeholders, or at least clear rationale for your decisions. Wouldn’t you want that from your government? It takes time to do that well. SEC doesn’t exist in a vacuum and millions of people are affected by its decisions, even small ones. That said, even if SEC rejects all bitcoin ETFs as currently proposed, somebody else will succeed eventually. Each failure is a learning opportunity and there are many rich, well-connected people who want a Bitcoin ETF and will continue to press the SEC to allow one. *Assumes ETF’s minimum shares are small enough to allow small investors. CBOE’s VanEck/SolidX proposal, for example, requires 25 bitcoin minimum share, making it inaccessible to small investors. If that’s the only ETF approved, then bitcoin will end up a small part of all big professionally-managed aggressive investment portfolios and few DIY investors. But that will be enough to send the price higher, probably significantly higher, and sets the precedent for new ETFs geared for smaller investors.

6043f790ed76476feda3821f,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-future-in-the-cryptocurrency-market?-,"A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is created and managed through the use of advanced encryption techniques known as cryptography. Cryptocurrency made the leap from being an academic concept to (virtual) reality with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. While Bitcoin attracted a growing following in subsequent years, it captured significant investor and media attention in April 2013 when it peaked at a record $266 per bitcoin after surging 10-fold in the preceding two months. Bitcoin sported a market value of over $2 billion at its peak, but a 50% plunge shortly thereafter sparked a raging debate about the future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. So, will these alternative currencies eventually supplant conventional currencies and become as ubiquitous as dollars and euros someday? Or are cryptocurrencies a passing fad that will flame out before long? The answer lies with Bitcoin. There are so many cryptocurrencies that people do not tend to pay much attention to. Investing in these cryptocurrencies would bring about maximum profits and also would bring less worries in the fluctuations of their prices as they have really stable prices. Cryptocurrencies like ripple,monero,dash,binance coin,bitcoin cash,bitcoin sv, litecoin,ethereum and so many more can be invested on the platform (www . libraforex .io) where you get from 25% to 100% ROI on whatever is invested. The Future of Cryptocurrency Some economic analysts predict a big change in crypto is forthcoming as institutional money enters the market. Moreover, there is the possibility that crypto will be floated on the Nasdaq, which would further add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative to conventional currencies. Some predict that all that crypto needs is a verified exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF would definitely make it easier for people to invest in Bitcoin, but there still needs to be the demand to want to invest in crypto, which some say may not automatically be generated with a fund. Understanding Bitcoin Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that uses peer-to-peer technology, which enables all functions such as currency issuance, transaction processing and verification to be carried out collectively by the network. While this decentralization renders Bitcoin free from government manipulation or interference, the flipside is that there is no central authority to ensure that things run smoothly or to back the value of a Bitcoin. Bitcoins are created digitally through a “mining” process that requires powerful computers to solve complex algorithms and crunch numbers. They are currently created at the rate of 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes and will be capped at 21 million, a level that is expected to be reached in 2140. These characteristics make Bitcoin fundamentally different from a fiat currency, which is backed by the full faith and credit of its government. Fiat currency issuance is a highly centralized activity supervised by a nation’s central bank. While the bank regulates the amount of currency issued in accordance with its monetary policy objectives, there is theoretically no upper limit to the amount of such currency issuance. In addition, local currency deposits are generally insured against bank failures by a government body. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no such support mechanisms. The value of a Bitcoin is wholly dependent on what investors are willing to pay for it at a point in time. As well, if a Bitcoin exchange folds up, clients with Bitcoin balances have no recourse to get them back. Bitcoin Future Outlook The future outlook for bitcoin is the subject of much debate. While the financial media is proliferated by so-called crypto-evangelists, Harvard University Professor of Economics and Public Policy Kenneth Rogoff suggests that the “overwhelming sentiment” among crypto advocates is that the total “market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies could explode over the next five years, rising to $5-10 [trillion].” The historic volatility of the asset class is “no reason to panic,” he says. Still, he tempered his optimism and that of the “crypto evangelist” view of Bitcoin as digital gold, calling it “nutty,” stating its long-term value is “more likely to be $100 than $100,000.” Rogoff argues that unlike physical gold, Bitcoin’s use is limited to transactions, which makes it more vulnerable to a bubble-like collapse. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s energy-intensive verification process is “vastly less efficient” than systems that rely on “a trusted central authority like a central bank.” Increasing Scrutiny Bitcoin’s main benefits of decentralization and transaction anonymity have also made it a favored currency for a host of illegal activities including money laundering, drug peddling, smuggling and weapons procurement. This has attracted the attention of powerful regulatory and other government agencies such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the SEC, and even the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In March 2013, FinCEN issued rules that defined virtual currency exchanges and administrators as money service businesses, bringing them within the ambit of government regulation. In May that year, the DHS froze an account of Mt. Gox – the largest Bitcoin exchange – that was held at Wells Fargo, alleging that it broke anti-money laundering laws. And in August, New York’s Department of Financial Services issued subpoenas to 22 emerging payment companies, many of which handled Bitcoin, asking about their measures to prevent money laundering and ensure consumer protection. Alternatives to Bitcoin Despite its recent issues, Bitcoin’s success and growing visibility since its launch has resulted in a number of companies unveiling alternative cryptocurrencies, such as: Litecoin – Litecoin is regarded as Bitcoin's leading rival at present, and it is designed for processing smaller transactions faster. It was founded in October 2011 as ""a coin that is silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” according to founder Charles Lee. Unlike the heavy computer horsepower required for Bitcoin mining, Litecoins can be mined by a normal desktop computer. Litecoin’s maximum limit is 84 million – four times Bitcoin’s 21-million limit – and it has a transaction processing time of about 2.5 minutes, about one-fourth that of Bitcoin.Ripple – Ripple was launched by OpenCoin, a company founded by technology entrepreneur Chris Larsen in 2012. Like Bitcoin, Ripple is both a currency and a payment system. The currency component is XRP, which has a mathematical foundation like Bitcoin. The payment mechanism enables the transfer of funds in any currency to another user on the Ripple network within seconds, in contrast to Bitcoin transactions, which can take as long as 10 minutes to confirm.MintChip – Unlike most cryptocurrencies, MintChip is actually the creation of a government institution, specifically the Royal Canadian Mint. MintChip is a smartcard that holds electronic value and can transfer it securely from one chip to another. Like Bitcoin, MintChip does not need personal identification; unlike Bitcoin, it is backed by a physical currency, the Canadian dollar.The Future Some of the limitations that cryptocurrencies presently face – such as the fact that one’s digital fortune can be erased by a computer crash, or that a virtual vault may be ransacked by a hacker – may be overcome in time through technological advances. What will be harder to surmount is the basic paradox that bedevils cryptocurrencies – the more popular they become, the more regulation and government scrutiny they are likely to attract, which erodes the fundamental premise for their existence. While the number of merchants who accept cryptocurrencies has steadily increased, they are still very much in the minority. For cryptocurrencies to become more widely used, they have to first gain widespread acceptance among consumers. However, their relative complexity compared to conventional currencies will likely deter most people, except for the technologically adept. A cryptocurrency that aspires to become part of the mainstream financial system may have to satisfy widely divergent criteria. It would need to be mathematically complex (to avoid fraud and hacker attacks) but easy for consumers to understand; decentralized but with adequate consumer safeguards and protection; and preserve user anonymity without being a conduit for tax evasion, money laundering and other nefarious activities. Since these are formidable criteria to satisfy, is it possible that the most popular cryptocurrency in a few years’ time could have attributes that fall in between heavily-regulated fiat currencies and today’s cryptocurrencies? While that possibility looks remote, there is little doubt that as the leading cryptocurrency at present, Bitcoin’s success (or lack thereof) in dealing with the challenges it faces may determine the fortunes of other cryptocurrencies in the years ahead. Should You Invest in Cryptocurrencies? If you are considering investing in cryptocurrencies, it may be best to treat your “investment” in the same way you would treat any other highly speculative venture. In other words, recognize that you run the risk of losing most of your investment, if not all of it. As stated earlier, a cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value apart from what a buyer is willing to pay for it at a point in time. This makes it very susceptible to huge price swings, which in turn increases the risk of loss for an investor. Bitcoin, for example, plunged from $260 to about $130 within a six-hour period on April 11, 2013. If you cannot stomach that kind of volatility, look elsewhere for investments that are better suited to you. While opinion continues to be deeply divided about the merits of Bitcoin as an investment – supporters point to its limited supply and growing usage as value drivers, while detractors see it as just another speculative bubble – this is one debate that a conservative investor would do well to avoid. Conclusion The emergence of Bitcoin has sparked a debate about its future and that of other cryptocurrencies. Despite Bitcoin’s recent issues, its success since its 2009 launch has inspired the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Ripple and MintChip. A cryptocurrency that aspires to become part of the mainstream financial system would have to satisfy very divergent criteria.

The term ""Bitcoin bull market"" is a state of market where BTC's price value is just increasing in a particular time frame. During a Bitcoin bull run, you’re likely to see mostly green signals and indicators on your charts, and it is indeed a beautiful sight to behold for investors since investing. Some would say investing before a Bitcoin bull run is like being in a diamond mine - grab whatever you can. Because of the Bitcoin halving event in May and the recent price plunge (in September), we may again be in one of the most anticipated bull runs in Bitcoin’s history. Apart from these basic observations, let us look at some of the factors that show the right time to invest in Bitcoins. Signs of a Bitcoin bull market Increasing hash rateHash rate is an estimation of how much computing strength miners are dedicating to process Bitcoin transactions. A higher average shows a stable and increasing mining industry, which states that miners have more faith in profitability, and their activity strengthens the network. Bitcoin altcoin correlations Image credits: InvaogroupsGenerally, price fluctuations in Bitcoin and altcoins go hand in hand. But, at that moment, when the bull run is approaching, Bitcoin frees itself from other altcoins and gears up at its own pace. So when the relationship between BTC and altcoins transposes, resulting in growth in Bitcoin dominance in the entire cryptocurrency market. Increase in popularityAn increase in popularity indirectly means an increase in user volumes, which increases the probability of a steady price rise. An increase in popularity can be measured by several simple observations - from an increase in mentions of Bitcoins in your generic telegram crypto discussion groups to increasing recirculation of money from zombie protocols are some of the signs of an anticipated bull run. There is a proverb that says, ""A trend is your friend until it's not.” Investing when the price is going upstream is bound to give you good returns, provided you sell your Bitcoins in time. Investing just before a bull run may be like investing in a lottery but other traders would advise booking your profits on appropriate times without being a bagholder.

At any given time the price per Bitcoin cannot fall below the energy required to mine that, or Bitcoin itself will not be able to function at all because miners are required for all transactions. In addition to this rule, the price cannot fall below the energy and hardware cost combined for very long. Since a profit is expected it rarely hovers along the base price. Of course, there are insulating mechanisms in place. If the price drops down below this point and people shut off hardware the difficulty will adjust allowing the people who remain to profit, but this would end up contributing to a decreased ability to process transactions, which is also bad. So if we operate on the assumption that Bitcoin will survive through 2020, and if we assume that the mining rewards cut in half again around that time (which may or may not), and also assume that energy costs remain approximately what they are today, we can calculate a new base line price. Prior to the last halving event the base price was around $300 USD and only fell close to the base energy price of $200 briefly. As tge halving rate approached the price increased towards the base price of $600 and went beyond it. Therefore I can reasonably conclude that the next base price will be approximately $1200 reflecting the real mining costs. What generally happens though is that speculative bubbles push prices up and diwn, along with global financial markets. Despite this the average price throughout a cycle tends to be the base price of the next cycle. So last cycle had a base price of $300 and an average price of $600 and this cycle has a base price of $600 and already hit $1200 and only went down because of sell pressure. Based on this my general assumption is that the average price in 2020 will be $2400, but will be capable of being as low as $1200 Of course, people tend to buy more and sell more during certain market conditions depending on the price trend so I wouldn't be surprised if during the current cycle the prices reaches $2400 to $5000 which i base in part on what happened between the last 2 cycles. Of course, with numbers that high the price changes will be more dramatic with more people exploiting the price difference of hundreds of dollars between days - something that's already happening - and this in turn will affect businesses who might want to accept Bitcoin directly, but make businesses who guarentee the prices by handling an exchange for fiat on the spot. This would be good for Bitcoin overall, since it will have more investment and more spending. Based on my understanding of the speculative averages coupled with my understanding of base prices I predict that in 2020 the minimum price will be $1200, the average pricess will be $2400, the price will peak above $4800 early on for sure and might go as high as $10,000 but I would not expect the price to stay above $5,000 during that cycle very long. Of course, just by writing this I fuel speculation and may in turn influence results. Obviously if bitcoin ceases to exist, or if we get a revolutionary new technology that improves energy production, these predictions will be altered. If Japan's typhoon generator, for example, lives up to the hype and is deployed by then they would have so much cheap energy that Japan would become the leading producer in Bitcoin and the base price will become much lower regardless of the energy costs elsewhere. Most predictions are speculative, but there are hard figures to work with, most notably the cost of mining.

According to Tom Lee in an article on modernconsensus.com - Bitcoin will hit $10 million, predicts Wall Street strategist Thomas J. Lee Lee notes that the 2016 rally in bitcoin began as Millennials started reaching their peak income years. That generation has a fondness for bitcoin; a recent survey conducted by Harris Poll showed nearly a third of Millennials prefer investing in bitcoin over stocks or bonds. They are also skeptical of financial institutions, Lee says, citing a Facebook showing 92 percent of the generation doesn’t trust banks (check out a pdf of the study here). “At the end of the day, the easiest explanation of why crypto is going to turbocharge the next 10-20 years is that Millennials are comfortable with digital businesses,” Lee told the audience of financial analysts. “Trust is important and I think a decentralized digital currency is a great way to express trust.” Lee then posted a chart (which we would have posted here but the photo came out blurry and, besides, we didn’t get rights to it) titled “Millennials LOVE Bitcoin and Blockchain” showing a logarithmic chart of bitcoin against the number of generations in their prime earning years. Lee projects a $10 million point by the middle of the 2030s, multiples of his previously stated long-term target of $100,000 just two months ago. “Bitcoin could be a $10 million token before Millennials start to retire,” he enthused. “And they’re all going to retire because they can buy planets with all that money.” Also, according to an article on Fox (Baby boomers to hand down $68T in great wealth transfer), the millennial’s, stand to inherit massive sums over the next quarter-decade — sparking the greatest wealth transfer in history. And according to Tom’s research (see pic below) they aren’t buying gold...  … which, to Tom’s point, means large amounts of fiat could ultimately be flowing into BTC and other great crypo projects like BAT, ENJ, DENT, IOTA, VET, QKC, ETH… etc, making today’s prices look like nothing.

But still I would like to mention it in this answer as it makes this answer smooth. Cryptography is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Hence, in short, cryptography is a technique used to hide the original information from others. I needed to mention this because most of people in here will directly relate the word cryptography with encryption. They think that cryptography is same as encryption. But this is not true. Encryption is a part of cryptography - a technique used in cryptography. Cryptography includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers. This was the short introduction to cryptography. Now, I will tell you the prerequisites to learn cryptography. Firstly, you need to sharpen you mind as this is the only way one can learn something new and hard. Then, you need to understand the binary (or hexadecimal) language clearly and get practiced with it. It is because, in cryptography, we hide information. Information is nothing but a sequence of bits for the computer or any other machine. To hide the information, you need to alter the position of bits or introduce some new bits. This way the information is altered. But you don’t need to go in that deep because of advancement in technology. Now, the functions we design are executed by the computer itself. But a clear understanding of binary (or hexadecimal) language is needed. The next thing you want to learn is Mathematics. Yes.. All this time we were thinking that what is the importance of maths in the field of computer science. But it is of great importance here. In cryptography - mainly in encryption techniques, you need to find a function which encrypts the data passed to it and that encrypted data can only be decrypted by the key returned by the function. Also, sometimes we need to find a function which encrypts the data but doesn’t decrypt it. Hence, the function cannot perform the decryption or else the reverse task. In short, a function whose inverse function doesn’t exist. Hence, everything in cryptography is done with the help of functions designed by cryptographers and this is nothing but mathematics. The next thing you have the learn is data structures and algorithms. You need to understand how data is actually stored and how can it be modified so that we can hide something inside it. Suppose, when we open an image in computer, the image viewer displays it on the screen. It is because image viewer knows how the process the bits stored in the image file. If you know this, you can modify the bits to display a different image..right? And if someone knows the way you modified the image, he/she can bring the real image back. Its kind of cool!! But for this you need to study algorithms. Algorithms are a way to understand how data is stored and processed in an efficient manner. Hence, to understand processing of data, you need to study algorithms. The above was a list of prerequisites needed to study cryptography. The answer was very long but this is only the beginning. Cryptography is a deep well and this is only a bucket of water from it. Stay motivated and learn hard.. Thank you..

If someone wants to get at your data, they'll resort to hacking methods (keyloggers, re-using one of your other passwords, etc) not brute force attacks on the crypto.

Here is a command line using gpg that'll do the trick for you:% gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --output test.gpg --symmetric test.out This will take the file test.out and encrypt it to the file test.gpg using 256 bit AES.

Game theory is concerned with optimization of the result involving two or more well defined parties where behavior of each party is very well defined.  Each of the parties has a very specific set of instruction to follow in the game and a set of desirable properties.  According to  Myerson Rodger B  game theory is a ""the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers"". The objective can be to minimize or maximize certain variable. Nash equilibrium is an important aspect of game theory that focuses of mutual benefit of the parties involved. What is not defined in game theory is the actionable condition or the stages of the game i.e. the uncertainty of the operational scenario.  In cryptography also the objective is to achieve secure transfer of the message among authenticated and authorized parties. Multiparty computation is a specific cryptography protocol where preciously unknown parties can compute a certain function. Or they can verify the content without revealing any information of the content. This is analogous to game theory concept of achieving mutual benefits. Similarly to game theory , all the parties have a specific set of behavior defined while applying the protocol. Such as the parties are probabilistic polynomial in nature. And analogous to the operation condition, cryptography does not define the possible methods of an attacker who wants to break the system.There are a few restriction on the operation criteria of the adversary referring to whether they are passive or active, there is no restriction on how an adversary can mount an attack.  . Ideas from both disciplines have been combined to obtain old goals, to draw new ones, and to gain better overall understanding of the nature of collaborative interaction with conflicting interests.

In short, it's all math. The goal is to use math to transform an input (say a series of letters and numbers) into a message digest, one that is complex to the point where humans (and ideally computers) cannot reverse the process. From the wiki on cryptographic hash functions:  ""The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties: it is easy to compute the hash value for any given messageit is infeasible to generate a message that has a given hashit is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hashit is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.""To break that down, the ideal hash function is easy to compute (just a series of mathemetical operations on an input, not too intensive). The ideal hash cannot be easily guessed from an input. The ideal hash has few collisions, meaning that when fed two inputs they are unlikely (to the point of impossibility) to produce the same output. It must be complex (as aforementioned). It must be irreversable (one-way), such that mathematically the function only works in one direction, so one cannot perform math to get the original input from the message digest output (unlike the caesar cypher, more generally rotation cyphers). See Cryptographic hash function for details. RSA encryption (as we have today) generally uses a public and private key (asymmetric keys), and then uses math to perform a computation that only one with a public key would know without exposing the private key, but the Enigma, being an early, crude form of this (known as a stream cypher, see Fish (cryptography) for more details), used symmetric key encryption (see Stream cipher), that was easily brute-forced, was the enigma encryption that the Nazis used (for which Alan Turning most famously developed the Enigma machine).",2021-03-06T21:54:45.154Z,"How are cryptographic hash functions developed?

In cryptography this is an important issue for two reasons: high entropy in keys makes them hard to guess, and high entropy in messages makes it hard to know when your guess is correct. Technically, entropy is the sum over all events of the probability of each event times the log probability of that event. You can read about this in Entropy (information theory) - Wikipedia but it is easier to give some examples. If you consider a 8-bit byte, if all 256 values are equally likely, then the byte contains 8 bits of entropy or equivalently, 8 bits of real information. If some bit patterns are more likely than others, for example the bit pattern for the letter ‘e’, then the byte will contain less than 8 bits of entropy or information. Running English text is pretty low entropy, at about 2.3 bits per byte. This is why compression algorithms work well on text files. Consider an 8-byte password. It could have up to 64 bits of entropy, and realistically you would have to randomly try half of them, or 2^63 different cases, or 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 tries before you guess it! However, if you have reason to believe that 8 character password is a dictionary word, then there are only a few hundred thousand of them - much much less real information in the password! Now suppose you are trying different passwords to see if they are correct. How can you tell? If the message is totally random, then one number looks about as “correct” as another. If the message has high entropy, it is hard to tell when your decryption is correct. On the other hand, if the message is English text, once you hit on the correct password, the plaintext will have a lot of ASCII dictionary words in it, which is easy to recognize. From the above, we can now see why one-time-pads offer perfect security. A one time pad is simply a key that is (a) as long as the message and (b) used only once. Because the key is as long as the message, there is always a valid key that will decrypt the message to <ANY> plaintext. There is no way to tell when you have guessed the right one. All valid plaintexts are there as are all garbled versions. If you do use a one-time pad key more than once, they are easy to break, See Venona project - Wikipedia Entropy is a measure of how unpredictable something is.

6043faeeed76476feda38781,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-cryptographic-protocols-in-wide-use?-,"I see two major reasons. 1) Cryptography is a hard problem. Not so much in a ""hard to understand"" way (although some of the algorithms do seem to go out of their way to be pretty convoluted) but in a ""hard to do optimally"" way. There's no ""right answer"" for encrypting something - the more CPU and data and algorithm you throw at the problem, the better the resulting encryption, and generally, the more CPU and algorithm it'll take to decode on the other end. So, for some needs - say, ensuring that text isn't accidentally viewed ""over the shoulder"" - something as simple as ROT13 will suffice.  For other needs, such as protecting your password keychain, a military-strength encryption algorithm is appropriate. 2) Security professionals understand single points of failure. Software has vulnerabilities.  It's not a matter of if a particular piece of logic has a bug -- it's a matter of when it'll be found.  Security professionals understand this, and they don't put ""all their eggs in one basket"" for that very good reason. So, they'll implement multi-layer security mechanisms.  For example, first a dual-factor authentication using RSA tokens.   Once the end user has authenticated using (a) the passcode from their token, (b) their own private PIN number, and (c) their username, they're then able to access the corporate network. However that just lets them get in the door.  Each system they interact with may well have a username/password mechanism distinct from the RSA token mechanism, which the employee will have to navigate separately. By employing multiple layers of security like that, the security team can minimize the exposure resulting from vulnerabilities at any given layer.",2021-03-06T21:58:06.152Z,"Why are there so many cryptographic protocols in wide use?

Both cryptographic and non-cryptographic hash strive to provide results that have strong collision avoidance and avalanche avoidance. In fact the properties in these regards maybe very similar between a crypto and a non-crypto hashing function. This is not the difference between them. The difference between crypto and non-crypto functions is related not directly to these properties, but instead is related to the difficulty of reversing these properties. In a cryptographic setting the ability to force a collision or force an avalanche has a devastating effect. Because of this it is imperative that a hash function intended to be used in a cryptographic setting be very difficult to force collisions or an avalanche. The easiest way to make it difficult is to make it computationally expensive. So the real difference between a cryptographic hash and a non-cryptographic hash is that it is computationally expensive to find collisions or avalanches with a cryptographic hash. This does not directly mean that a non-cryptographic hash has more collisions, or that it will be more likely to avalanche, but rather it does mean that it is not difficult to create an artificial situation in which a collision or avalanche occurs. Which hashing algorithm is best for uniqueness and speed? It does however mean that cryptographic hashes will be slower, and when speed is important, and the specific properties of a cryptographic hash are not important, a non-cryptographic hash should be used. In fact an improvement was made to Bitcoin performance, by changing a sha hash in a case where it was not needed to a more performant non-crypto hash.",2021-03-06T22:02:17.258Z,"What is the difference between cryptographic and noncryptographic hashes?

This is the hash - usually calculated from something like a password (though several other things are also used). Then at the decryption end that same hash is calculated and used to reverse this process. The more random this hash is the better it allows to encrypt. Meaning the encrypted data looks more like really random stuff, thus making it ever more difficult to crack. Also if someone has this hash, it should not be possible to reverse it so you can see what the original password was. In layman’s terms, those are the requirements to turn a “hash” into a cryptographic hash. There are some more detail aspects, but those are the most important. That last part is where authentication comes to play. I.e. when you login to some site / server / machine / etc. your username and password (as well as something like a salt) is run through the hashing function. Then that resulting hash is compared to the one stored on the server. If they match you can then continue working, else you’re not logged in. This is the major reason the hash should not be reversible - else the server remembers something from which it could calculate your password.

The term means, literally, “black phonics”. The term never became mainstream. Black English Vernacular (BEV) was commonplace when I was taking linguistics courses in the ‘90s. Today you’re most likely to see African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) referring to the Black dialect group of American English. The term Ebonics was adopted in 1996 as the term for a scientifically incorrect concept put forth by the Oakland School Board in California that African-American speech was its own language rooted primarily in African language rather than English. This assertion was made in an effort to increase school funding. At the time, school districts received additional funding for each student for whom English was a second language. By classifying Black students as Ebonics speakers according to the OSB definition, they became ESL (English as a Second Language) students, providing a base for requests for more funds. That move pretty much put the kibosh on Ebonics as a term for Black dialects. AAVE is not a set of cryptographic dialects. Just because an accent can be difficult to understand, that doesn’t mean it’s intended to keep outsiders from understanding. There are White dialects where I live that can be equally difficult for outsiders to understand as some Black dialects are. Of course, there are some Black dialects which are intended to block outsiders from understanding, but these are better described as argots rather than dialects, i.e., shared systems of jargon and slang. So, for example, Black gangs (like other gangs) often develop their own argot. But in terms of actual dialects, there can be a great deal of misunderstanding. I’m reminded of the case of trial testimony in which a Black witness testified “his partner been transferred”, but the transcript read “his partner, Ben, transferred”. The error lies in the existence of a tense marker in AAVE that doesn’t exist in most white dialects. In that witnesses’s dialect, there is a significant difference between been with a short e (b’n) and a long e (bi’in). [These are not phonetic renderings, I’m just trying to give a sense of what I’m referring to.] His partner b’n transferred means “his partner was transferred”, with the implication that this happened recently. His partner bi’in transferred means “his partner was transferred some time ago”, not recently. So if I ask “Hey, why’s Joe riding with Amy?” the answer might be, “Oh, his partner b’n transferred”. But if I say, “Did Joe’s partner get transferred?” the response might be, “Oh man, his partner bi’in transferred. You just now noticing?” These differences are not cryptographic.

Ability to apply computer code that dictates movement / adjustment of balances. The disruptive impact of the financial internet follows from points 2 and 3. Stock brokerages and stock exchanges provide the service of exchanging currency for shares. This model will probably be disrupted by the Financial Internet. Same argument for currency exchanges and futures exchanges (the part where contracts are being traded, not generated). All this follows from point 2. Point 3 is harder to appreciate and more interesting. Consider the game of online Roulette. It consists of generating randomness through spinning of a wheel; and the alteration of value balances between player and house based on the result. An online Roulette service can be represented as computer code running to alter participant balances. Therefore, online Roulette will be implemented as code on top of a cryptographic ledger, and this will reduce execution costs. All online gambling like Poker and Blackjack will be in for a round of disruption because they share this characteristic with Roulette. A futures contract is also code running to alter value balances. The code is of the nature: If price of Commodity X is Y on date Z, alter balances of parties A and B as specified. The financial internet will make the creation of Futures, Options, Swaps and other derivatives child's play, so multiple business models in the Investment Banking side and the exchange side could face disruption.  My hunch is that the Tax preparation and Filing industry will need adaptation as well. If a consumer's money, shares, contracts etc. are on a cryptographic ledger she will prefer to use automated services that compute and file tax returns on her behalf.  Banking and Credit cards as concepts will survive. Changing cost structures may imply some players will lose markets, but the concept itself will flourish. There is another school of thought that believes financial services will be decentralized or operated in a way no individual institution retains full control (in addition to all the above).

Crypto, in a very real sense, won the war for the Allied powers after they successfully compromised German and Japanese code systems (if this is an area of interest to you, I highly recommend Leo Marks’ Between Silk and Cyanide). After WWII the US and other Allied Powers kind of stepped back and said “holy sh!t!” The value of being able to intercept (and analyse) encrypted data, in addition to making sure that no one could intercept/analyse ours, became a huge matter of national security. Hence the creation of the CIA, NSA, NRO, and the intelligence community in general (about 15 agencies). Since the early 1990s, the focus has been less on the crypto controls than the data encrypted. Anyone with access to the Internet (at least in the US and other “free” countries) can access robust cryptography. A majority of the cryptographic suites already have known vulnerabilities anyway - cryptography is not inherently secure, but a matter of making it “computationally infeasible” to gain access to the encrypted payload. With the advent of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), many thought that we’d nailed crypto so that it would essentially take a million processors a million years to break the crypto scheme. We’ve since proved that to be false. So, basically, you can have all the crypto you want. It’s all legal (although selling it to rogue states and known enemies can get you into trouble).

There are a million stories like this less well known because of the nature of the threats and the people who defend against them. Activists in Syria avoiding Assad’s forces aren’t likely to come forward and give interviews, as an example — and you are not going to read stories in the news about war correspondents who get training in using Tor from Reporters without Borders or the Committee to Protect Journalists, or from Tor’s outreach group, who I am proud to say are never caught short in their work because unlike drug dealers and kiddie porn yahoos, they care about operational security like they care about a precision lens on a camera in a desert war zone, are perfectly disciplined, and we keep them safe. That, my friends, is why I became executive director of Tor. But how about a personal story. 2006 Thai coup d'état In the summer of 2006, The Economist had interviewed me for a feature on Tor. So in September, when Bangkok blew into a coup, the executive editor called me (well to early in the morning, lol, waking me up — a combination of geek hours, daylight savings, and urgency) asking if Tor had anyone it Thailand. He explained that his reporter in Thailand was a bit of a luddite with computers, but that the foreign correspondents in Bangkok really did live in this one hotel, rather like My Life of Living Dangerously, and that the state controlled and monitored the state-owned internet there. So as each journalist was filing stories on the coup, a pair of strapping young army officers with side-arms boldly displayed was appearing at their doors, knock-knock, “Good evening, sir, we just noticed you filed a story on the coup — have a good evening. Sir.” Hand on sidearm. Click heels. Wheel. Terribly chilling. Not what you’d call encouraging a free press. So he asks me, “Is there anything you can do to set my man up, on his computer, with Tor? He’s no us with installing software at all.” We put out a call and found a volunteer, got a set up where a person could run a secure set up entirely off a USB stick, a thumb drive, and not only set up The Economist’s reporter, but set up a clinic with a whole box of these duplicated thumb drives for all the foreign press corps and enough that they could have them in their pockets to give away. Two months later, I read a story in the Bangkok News, an English-language paper from the city, reporting on how the region was reacting to the new censorship laws since the new administration. They did a “boy-on-the-street” interview with three young men outside an Internet cafe, the sort of place where working men and boys go to play computer games and surf the web on computers they can’t afford at home. “Are you concerned about the new censorship laws?” asked the reporter. The three boys made derisive noises. All three pulled out thumb drives from the pockets of their shorts. “No one cares,” they told the reporter in adolescent world weary tones. “Everyone uses Tor!” I could just imagine their teen age tone, even in Thai. Hasn’t it always been like this? Hasn’t everyone always known about Tor? What kind of idiot are you? lol… There are dozens, probably hundreds of stories just about Tor use. But that doesn’t even start to get into all the stories about field agents in our military, intelligence services, and law enforcement (for whom Tor was originally designed), who use Tor and many other cryptographic tools as field agents. But you are far less likely to hear their stories here. You are less likely to hear stories here from other people at Tor who are not retired, heh.

Actually, SHA-256 is preceded by other algorithms like SHA-1 and so on. Also, there are some algorithms that maybe you've heard of or maybe that are a bit lesser known like RIPEMD, BLAKE, and Skein and others. Now, cryptographic hash functions are basically used as critical building blocks in many applications and really, the first motivating application, the first historical application of these types of hash functions was in the context of what's known as Digital signature These digital signatures are used in so many different cryptographic applications today. They're the cornerstone of many eCommerce protocols. They are used in doing things like bitcoin generation and so on. Cryptographic hash functions are also used in things like message authentication protocols, in pseudo-random number generation, password security and even encryption to some degree. In fact, aside from their use in digital signatures, these hash functions are also used in other places in the bitcoin protocol as well. First of all, let me talk about what a cryptographic hash function actually is and of course, as the name implies, the first thing it is, it's a hash function and by a hash function, I basically mean that it will take input. It is a mathematical function, a transformation, if you will, that takes a particular input and let's call this input a message. The message can be of arbitrary length and the hash function basically applies a mathematical transformation or maybe a set of mathematical transformations to this input to produce a single output. We typically call this output a digest. Although, sometimes you will see the output referred to as a tag, or as a hash or as a fingerprint but digest is sort of the most common nomenclature. In fact, MD5, which was one of the earlier hash functions, stands for message digest 5, and MD4 was message digest 4, and so on, and so forth. Now, the message, as I mentioned briefly can be of arbitrary size. It can be as long as you want or as short as you want but the output, the size of the digest or the size of the tag is going to be fixed in length. For example, in the context of a hash function like, let's say, SHA-256, the digest will actually be exactly 256 bits in length. It's going to have a fixed-length output, but an arbitrary-length input. The other thing I want to point out about these cryptographic hash functions is that the function here is a deterministic function, and by that, is that the output will always be the same for a given input. So if you have a given input, you're going to see the exact same output. You won't have a situation in which, maybe, a given input will have two different possible outputs. It's going to be consistent. Now, traditional hash functions have been used in computer science for quite some time and they are used in many computing applications, so, for example, you may have heard of something like a hash function used in something called a hash table. But the kinds of hash functions that are used in hash tables, and I want to stress this, they aren't necessarily the same as cryptographic hash functions. The qualifier ""cryptographic"" here is very important, and it usually means or implies that that hash function has to have a certain set of critical design goals and maybe some particular properties in mind that make it suitable for use in applications that use cryptography or cryptographic applications areas where perhaps security or privacy or confidentiality or authentications are a serious concern. First and foremost, maybe in describing some of these properties is that, and maybe this almost goes without saying, one of the first properties you want of a cryptographic hash function is that it should be computationally efficient, and by that, I mean that it shouldn't take a lot of time to compute the output from a given input. If you're given a message and you want to apply this set of transformations on that message to get a digest, that set of transformation should not take a long time to implement on a computer. It should be very fast, or relatively fast. It almost goes without saying, but I think it's important to stress and point it out because I've seen people come up with grossly inefficient hash functions sometimes, and those would not be considered suitable in the context of when typical cryptographic hash functions are used for cryptographic applications. The second property you typically need in the context, and this is especially in the context of digital signing, is that you want it to be the case that it's hard to find two inputs that actually map to the same output. And I mean two distinct inputs whose corresponding digest is identical. This property is typically referred to as collision resistance. That means it's hard to find a colliding pair of input, so in other words, if you have two inputs and let's say you have a message M1, and you have a message M2, their output under the application of the hash function should not be the same. You won't ever have it be the same. You won't even have it be the case, rather, that the output of M1 and M2 under an application of the hash function is the same. They should never be the same. It should always be different. Now, I should take a step back here and point out that, of course in practice, given that messages can be of arbitrary size and given that the input or the output, rather, is a fixed size, it's not mathematically possible to guarantee that the output will always be different for two distinct messages. But what you typically want is not that the outputs are necessarily different, but that it's hard to find two distinct messages that produce the same output. We know they exist by virtue of the fact that there are many messages that can be hash and only a finite, small number, relatively small number compared to the number of messages. A smaller number of possible digest values. But aside from that consideration, it should be hard. It should take a long time, and by long, I mean an astronomically long time to find two distinct messages that would result in the same output under the application of the hash function. Now, the third thing that I want to point out is that in many cases, you might want, also, in the context of a hash function for the hash function to be able to hide information about the inputs. In other words, given the output, it should be hard to glean anything useful or interesting about the input. Anything, any relevant detail and I don't just mean the whole input, but maybe even something as simple as was the input an even number or an odd number? I mean, that should be the kind of thing that should be hard to infer when you see the output. Even something as simple as the evenness or oddness of the input. Now, a fourth property I want to point out is that you typically want the output to be well distributed. In other words, the output should look random. In other words, it should look like a set of coin flips took place. Not that there was a predictable way in which the output was created. You can think of it maybe more conceptually as it's almost as if you flipped a bunch of coins to get to the output. It should look just that random. And so what you can maybe think of cryptographic hash functions as it's, perhaps, maybe the mathematical equivalent or mathematical analog of a meat grinder of a sort. It can take inputs and apply these mathematical transformations to them such that the output looks for all intents and purposes completely random and unrelated to the original input. I do want to make a few quick remarks about these particular properties. First of all, they are interrelated. For example, if you have a situation where the outputs appear to bear no relationship to the input and the outputs also look random, then that will, in fact, give you to a large degree, a lot of the collision resistance properties because just the fact that you can’t predict the output and the fact that it hides all this information implies that it's going to be hard to find two inputs that are distinct, that map to the same output. And so sometimes, you get one property in exchange for the others. The second thing I want to point out is that typically, these properties in practice or maybe in the underlying mathematics, are things that you hope for but you can't always guarantee that they'll always hold. It may be entirely possible that you could design a hash function that you think is completely collision-resistant, but someone might come along a year from now and come up with a more clever way for finding a collision. Maybe they'll find a clever shortcut that does not involve doing a brute force search of any sort. It turns out that cryptographers, for better or worse currently do not have any mathematical techniques. They haven't developed techniques for being able to work around some of these limitations. So we often do take it on face value that these schemes are secure based on how long they've been around. Now, I also want to point out, and the last thing I want to point out is that this treatment that I've given is not meant to be mathematically rigorous by any stretch of the imagination. There are far more precise ways to describe these underlying properties but my hope, instead, is that this answer gives you, maybe, a bit of a flavor for what is required of a cryptographic hash function without maybe getting bogged down in some of the mathematical minutia and formalism. Cryptographic hash functions are basically fundamental building blocks that are used within many cryptographic algorithms and protocols. They have a number of very important applications in the context of information security as a whole. Now, some of the more common algorithms in this category that are known as cryptographic have functions including things like MD5, and also some predecessors like MD4 and others, as well as algorithms like SHA-256. Actually, SHA-256 is preceded by other algorithms like SHA-1 and so on.

Cryptography is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Hence, in short, cryptography is a technique used to hide the original information from others. I needed to mention this because most of people in here will directly relate the word cryptography with encryption. They think that cryptography is same as encryption. But this is not true. Encryption is a part of cryptography - a technique used in cryptography. Cryptography includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers. This was the short introduction to cryptography. Now, I will tell you the prerequisites to learn cryptography. Firstly, you need to sharpen you mind as this is the only way one can learn something new and hard. Then, you need to understand the binary (or hexadecimal) language clearly and get practiced with it. It is because, in cryptography, we hide information. Information is nothing but a sequence of bits for the computer or any other machine. To hide the information, you need to alter the position of bits or introduce some new bits. This way the information is altered. But you don’t need to go in that deep because of advancement in technology. Now, the functions we design are executed by the computer itself. But a clear understanding of binary (or hexadecimal) language is needed. The next thing you want to learn is Mathematics. Yes.. All this time we were thinking that what is the importance of maths in the field of computer science. But it is of great importance here. In cryptography - mainly in encryption techniques, you need to find a function which encrypts the data passed to it and that encrypted data can only be decrypted by the key returned by the function. Also, sometimes we need to find a function which encrypts the data but doesn’t decrypt it. Hence, the function cannot perform the decryption or else the reverse task. In short, a function whose inverse function doesn’t exist. Hence, everything in cryptography is done with the help of functions designed by cryptographers and this is nothing but mathematics. The next thing you have the learn is data structures and algorithms. You need to understand how data is actually stored and how can it be modified so that we can hide something inside it. Suppose, when we open an image in computer, the image viewer displays it on the screen. It is because image viewer knows how the process the bits stored in the image file. If you know this, you can modify the bits to display a different image..right? And if someone knows the way you modified the image, he/she can bring the real image back. Its kind of cool!! But for this you need to study algorithms. Algorithms are a way to understand how data is stored and processed in an efficient manner. Hence, to understand processing of data, you need to study algorithms. The above was a list of prerequisites needed to study cryptography. The answer was very long but this is only the beginning.

A hash function takes some input of arbitrary length and generates a fixed length number (in this case a 256-bit number, that’s a very large number) from this input. Because SHA256 is a cryptographic hash function, it has the key property that you cannot feasibly invert it. That is, you cannot generate or guess an input that yields a given output when hashed. So in order to use SHA256 as a proof-of-work, the bitcoin protocol demands that miners find an input (which has to be a valid block header including a random value - nonce - that the miner varies) whose SHA256 output number is less than a certain target number. Because SHA256 cannot be inverted, the only way to find such a header is to try and hash different nonces until you hit the target. Once somebody gives you the correct input, however, you only need one SHA256 calculation to check it is below the target. For technical reasons, SHA256 is actually used twice in bitcoin, so SHA256(SHA256(block_header)) needs to be smaller than the target. The number of expected trials until somebody finds a valid proof-of-work can be calculated as 2^256/target. So the algorithm can adapt the target every 2016 blocks to keep the expected time until a new block is found around 10 minutes even as more and more miners employ more and more hash power.

Now, only what QuAIL employees claims in this leaked report is that they were capable to successfully demonstrate that a processor with programmable superconducting processor (“quantum computer”) is able to create quantum states on 53 qubits. Basically, it means that they’ve used the so-called “random circuit sampling” (exploring the Hilbert space — a space with any finite or infinite number of dimensions) to prove that quantum computer is more efficient than the most powerful of existing supercomputers for that specific set of computational tasks (or, in fancy terms, “achieving quantum supremacy”). Citing: “While our processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of the quantum circuit 1 million times, a state-of-the-art supercomputer would require approximately 10,000 years to perform the equivalent task.” Does that create a “clear and present danger” to ECC? Of course, it does not. Citing the authors of this paper themselves: “However, realizing the full promise of quantum computing (e.g. Shor’s algorithm for factoring) still requires technical leaps to engineer fault-tolerant logical qubits”. Might secure algorithms we all use be breached in a future? According to authors — possibly, providing more resources and time are devoted to this objective. Citing: “We expect computational power will continue to grow at a double exponential rate [Moore’s law]. … to eventually [reach] the computational volume needed to run … the Shor or Grover algorithms the engineering of quantum error correction will have to become a focus of attention.” Should we be worried? IMHO, we have many much more important priorities than that.

For every a and b and whole number x there exists a finite number of y (points on the xy plane) that are also integers. A computer can easily spit out such a calculation and generate a table of coordinates on an XY graph where the curve intersects integer coordinates. a=1,b=3a=1,b=3 13+1(1)+3=1,513+1(1)+3=1,5 23+1(2)+3=2,1123+1(2)+3=2,11 33+1(3)+3=3,3333+1(3)+3=3,33 43+1(4)+3=4,5543+1(4)+3=4,55 53+1(5)+3=5,13353+1(5)+3=5,133 ...... Now if you take a number pp (prime), apply it to the curve as a modulus, you willgenerate a finite list of y coordinates that naturally repeats. p=13p=13 y2=(x3+(1∗x)+3)mod13y2=(x3+(1∗x)+3)mod13 first 52 results: 5	0	7	6	3	4	2	3	0	12	6	1	3		 5	0	7	6	3	4	2   3   0   12  6	1	3		 5	0	7	6	3	4	2	3	0	12	6	1	3     5	0   7	6   3   4	2	3	0	12	6	1   3    You get a finite list of y coordinates: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,120,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12  The curve of an ellipse naturally runs through all the integers twice as it loops around its focal point. The interesting property is that you may develop a mathematics such that adding two integer points on the curve generates a vector that intersects the curve at another integer coordinate point. Every different elliptic curve has a unique set of these integer to integer, that repeats, forming a finite set. So you pick two huge prime numbers, and you add them according to the idea above, and you generate a set of integer points from there. But given a set of integer point coordinates, it is extremely difficult to guess the original points that were used to generate the set, unless you have both numbers.One becomes the public key, the other the private key.  Take a point PP on the curve (with integer coordinates), make a tangent line to another point (also integer coordinates) on the curve, and reflect the intersecting point on the Y axis and arbitrarily “call it” P+P=(2P)P+P=(2P) (it will also have integer coordinates). In this way you develop a mathematics of multiplication on that Curve. Do it again, get 3P3P.  Do it repeatedly until you come back to the original P, and you will, it is a property of elliptic curves. A simple version of this generates a rotating system of 17 points on a 3rd order elliptic curve: y=x3+0x+7y=x3+0x+7  G is a point on the curve, So is PP . P=6×GP=6×G. It is very fast and easy to calculate P = k * G. (public key) It is very slow and hard to calculate k = P / G. (private Key) In fact the above curve generates the following from G. (13,15)  P=5,8P=5,8 . It is 6×G6×G. But it also could be any number kk where (k×G)mod17=P(k×G)mod17=P. k=6,23,40,57,74,91,108,125,142,159,176,…(n∗17+6)k=6,23,40,57,74,91,108,125,142,159,176,…(n∗17+6) Files or messages re encrypted with the public key P (in reality 512 bytes long — big).If you do not know the contents of the file beforehand, you cannot do anything but try to brute force kk(which is 256 bits long 256256−1256256−1 possibilities ….) and recover the message. You can’t. Only if you know kk can you do EM=PM=(kGmod17)MEM=PM=(kGmod17)M M=EM(kGmod17)M=EM(kGmod17) to recover M.  17 is not enough to do much with cryptographic-ally, but you could set up a system whereevery letter A-Z is a unique combination of 2 points, instead of 1 point, and then have 136 choices. Instead what is done is a large prime is chosen. BUT the point is, you may use a much smaller key than with RSA and still get the same “hardness” that the RSA key presents as a math problem to solve. Typical elliptical key lengths vs RSA key lengths are: Ell  :  RSA 160  :  1024 224  :  2048 256  :  3072 512   : 15360",2021-03-06T22:35:46.517Z,"What makes the shape of an elliptic curve suitable for cryptographic algorithms?

But using two different functions it’s closer to a 1 in (4000 million squared) possibility that the same data would calculate to the same hash value in both. So actually there’s a much bigger probability that one hash function would calculate the same hash from two different data inputs than two separate hashes from the same data.

This gets down to some of the really core issues of cryptography, coding theory, and information theory. From one perspective, we can ask the question: how much information is in a word or text? A naive approach will tell you that 10GB of data is worth 10GB of information. But if you fill 10GB with the letter A, then we can maybe reduce this a little. As proof, I just transferred to you that 10GB of data in a one sentence description! Natural language is an incredibly powerful tool for generating information. Considering just the information value, conservatively with your method we can 1) preserve the original message, while 2) potentially adding a subtext. The size of that subtext is somehow derived from the jumbled letters, and with different combinations of character substitution, addition, omission, or rearrangement we can derive several characters of information from each word. At another angle we can try to think from the perspective of steganography. If nobody notices your typo, then how are we to be certain that any secret was actually transferred. This approach can also be arbitrarily secured to provide any level of plausible deniability. This reminds me of a clever trick used to take truly anonymous polls. Imagine we have an audience, from whom we want to ask a very incriminating yes-or-no question. So we want to make the results anonymous. How can we ask our question such that we can estimate the true ratio of yes/no, but that no individual's answer could be determined with certainty? The trick is to instruct everyone to probably answer truthfully or otherwise randomly yes/no with some split. If 9/10 people answer truthfully, then we can get very accurate statistics. This will also still protect individuals from being held to their answer. We can adjust the ratio 9/10 to trade confidence for anonymity. Similarly you can use any deformities in plain text, such as ""typoglycemia"", to transfer information under the radar. The ratio of these ""mistakes"" can be tuned to produce lightly encoded text that would still get passing grades in an English class, or something so horrible that everyone but the intended recipient will start to doubt your sanity. Stronger encodings can transfer more information at the cost of more obvious manipulation. Lighter encodings can still be used to transfer any message as long as the document length can vary and that you are willing to write a novel. Then going all the way to full cryptographic protocols, we can add old tools like shared secrets or public-keys to negotiate ""sessions"" across these public channels. Or start sending bitcoins through tweets or what have you. When you have established the bandwidth, you can start to do anything really. Going from the other direction, what can't we do with ""typoglycemia""? It is a text-only phenomena, so we need to be typing or writing. Verbal communication does not have this property and would also be incredibly difficult to do anything similar in practice with any utility. The method also has the property of potentially inflating the size of the message, though we may gain the ability to use communication channels that are otherwise unavailable. So clearly there are tradeoffs, but it is definitely an interesting topic. Or should I say itneseritnig?",2021-03-06T22:37:21.399Z,"Does Typoglycemia have cryptographic uses? ",Quora

The code - made famous by films like “The Imitation Game” and by the electromechanical encrypting and decrypting machine Enigma - was highly sophisticated. Simplifying somewhat - Enigma was like a safe with 150 million million possible combination numbers - and the combination changed every 24 hours. The problem with these insanely large numbers is that our brain struggles to understand them. So let's try to visualise how massive the number is. If you had 1,000 people with each person trying one combination at a time - say one combination every 1 second - it would take this group of 1,000 people approximately 4,757 years to try all the 150 million million combinations. And this assumes that these 1,000 people do not sleep and do not die for 4,757 years !!! So - here are the two cryptographic failures: Mathematical Failure Once the rotors were set, the Emigma machine scrambled messages by changing one letter into another letter. The little flaw - though - was that the encrypted letter could never be the same as the letter in the original message. Let me show this with a quantified example. Take the word “DOG”. Let’s say I use the Enigma machine to encrypt it, and the Enigma machine gives me the encrypted word “XRQ”. Now if I am the cryptanalyst trying to crack the code, I know that the word I am hunting for does not have X in the first position, does not have R in the second position and does not have Q in the third position. In other words I am hunting in a space of 25*25*25 words, which is 15,625 possible words. But - if the machine had made it possible to encrypt a letter as itself, than I would be hunting in a space of 26*26*26 words, which is 17,576 possible words. So, for a 3-letter word the code “is leaking” an amount of difficulty equal to [17,576–15,625]/17,576 which is approximately 11%. For a 10-letter word the “leakage” would be [26^10 - 25^10] / [26^10] which is approximately 32%. In summary - cryptography is a game in which you need to maximise the complexity for the enemy. Counterintuitively to some, a system that allows you to encrypt the word “DOG” as “DRQ” is stronger than a system that prevents you from encrypting a letter with itself. The remarkable mathematician Alan Turing exploited this weakness in his successful efforts to break the Enigma code. Human Behaviour Failure Many messages to be encrypted started with the words “Heil Hitler” - this peculiarity offered another line of attack for Alan Turing and his team.  The Enigma code was broken in stages by a team led by Alan Turing, in 1941/1942. Alan Turing was operating in Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England. Alan Turing is one of the most brilliant mathematicians the human species has ever produced.

If true, then all practical encryption is broken. P = NP would imply a polynomial time (fast) solution to SAT, the problem of determining for any Boolean logic circuit whether there is a set of inputs that outputs a 1. If that were possible, then you could learn the key to any encryption algorithm using a known plaintext attack by building a circuit that decrypts and compares your output. You set one of the key bit inputs to 0 and ask your SAT server if there is a solution. If not, then change the key bit to 1. Then repeat for each bit of the key.

Essentially, features to prevent counterfeit currency are needed. (I am not addressing the financial backing of the currency, just the security aspect of the coin or note.) In physical currencies, features are built in to make counterfeiting difficult are built into most paper notes. Coins are generally considered to not be valuable enough to be worth the time to counterfeit so not really worth the effort to protect. In crypto currencies, the term coin is usually used for everything. What is called “blockchain” is the key technology in crypto currencies that makes counterfeiting difficult. I won’t give an in-depth tutorial on blockchain, you can Google that - but a good high level visual description can be found here. The key crypto function to understand in blockchain is the hash function. Hash functions are algorithms that take long messages or records and reduce them into shorter “hashes” to be used as unique identifiers. blockchain hashes are 256 bits or 64 8 bit characters long. So, a record of the creation of a coin which might be thousands of characters can be represented by a 64 character hash. Anyone can compute the hash of any given record and compare it to the published hash value for that record. If it matches, you have high assurance that the record is valid. If it doesn’t match, probably not valid. Simplifying again, blockchain uses distributed storage of records and hash values so it is difficult for someone to change records and hashes. This redundancy and the properties of hash algorithms make it difficult for a coin to be counterfeited. Think of the hash code for a crypto coin kinda like the serial number on a physical bill and the blockchain features kinda like the various features built into the ink and paper on a physical note that make it hard to counterfeit - hard to have two or more instances of note with the same serial number or a never issued serial number.

One can derive that ϕ(p1∗p2)=ϕ(p1)×ϕ(p2)ϕ(p1∗p2)=ϕ(p1)×ϕ(p2) but it is hard to compute because it relies on prime factorization, except for primes, in which case ϕ(p1)=p1−1ϕ(p1)=p1−1 where p1p1 is a prime. Letting kϕ(n)+1=e×dkϕ(n)+1=e×d will prove that Alice’s decryption for Bob’s encryption works, where kk is an integer such that dd is an integer, as shown in the following. It follows that to compute Alice’s private key d=(k∗ϕ(n)+1)/ed=(k∗ϕ(n)+1)/e for retrieving Bob’s message mm, one has to compute ϕ(n)ϕ(n), which only an efficient prime factorization would be able to crack.

Usually when we want to make a large random piece of data like key, we’ll instead take a small random number (called a seed) and push that into an algorithm like Monte-Carlo to generate a larger number. Depending on how you generate that small random number, this process is either called a Pseudorandom or True Random Number Generator. The mechanisms to generate that data vary. In some systems that random number is generated by an amalgamation of keystrokes, mouse clicks, and voltage oscillations over the processor over some observed time. Extreme TRNGs create seeds by observing electrons falling off of a radioactive substance. What method you choose will vary depending on cost, hardware, and the OS you’re using to generate that number. Similarly, the criteria of whether a process to generate a key comes from a PRNG or TRNG varies depending on who you’re taking to. In the US, NIST has a document called FIPS 140–2 that clarifies some of this. But the criteria on whether a number is random enough (something we call “entropy”) varies depending on region and audience. HSMs are valuabke because they have very high entropy TRNGs. Some employ atomic clocks that generate numbers from radioactive decay - a process that is universally seen as very random. Combined with intense physical and software security, good HSMs can use their TRNGs to create a randomly chosen key and give that key to a user or application over a protocol like KMIP. However, as advances in computing and software have started to make TRNG easier and cheaper, HSMs that do not employ powerful TRNGs with very high entropy are starting to become less valuable. Cryptography suites based in software like KeyWhiz, OpenHSM, and HashiCorp Vault (full disclosure: I’m the PM for Vault) can generate and protect keys as/more secure as any low to medium security HSM. They are also a lot cheaper to use - free if you’re using the open source variants of each. Some, like Vault, can even import cryptographic processes from HSMs to further improve security. Overall, HSMs have an important role to play in how keys are created and managed. But as technology improves, that role may change over time.

I will answer the actual question below. a blog snippet which shows the degree of difficulty breaking the encryption as a function of the length of the password used. Sorry, no. Your password length wont do anything at all if you use a weak encryption. With weak encryption there is no need to brute force the password space, instead one can bruteforce the much smaller keyspace. RC4, the proposed encryption technique while not inherently unsafe has come under suspicion of being easily broken, though only by state sponsored actors. Your private diary should be safe. However RC4 is a stream cipher, its not made for block based stuff like files, and a diary will be saved as a file somewhere, but for continous data streams. If by write you mean generate an encrypted message and by “no one” you mean no government or agency now and forever into the future, you’re out of luck Allow me to quote Edward Snowden, the guy who worked for years at the NSA and who thus should know it best: “Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it.” From a slide in the material he leaked we find the quote by someone in the NSA:  Tor Stinks This means that the NSA, certainly one of the most well funded and well staffed agency on this planet, cannot break encryption when its properly used. (the “tor stinks” evidently refers to the situation from their perspective, not from that of a tor user) Your best bet is a one-time pad but then you have to keep the key secure, and you can’t reuse the key. Again, I have to disagree. OTPs are simply not worth the trouble. Aside from having a key that is as long as the message, the whole key must be perfectly random. For a file of any significant size you will quickly be looking at hardware based sources of randomness, those are expensive and provide little benefit compared to ditching OTPs and using state of the art “normal” encryption. Enigma: You can make an Enigma machine out of a couple of pieces of paper. Enigma does not count as unbreakable, seeing as it was broken over 70 years ago. Finally, my answer to the question: I assume your journals are computer based, i.e. not on paper. The easiest way would be to write and safe them like any normal file at first. Lets say your journal contains a fair bit of graphics, formulas and formatting, you would most likely use LaTeX to lay them out and pdf for the output. Now you can put those files through any encryption program of your choice. How to chose the right encryption program: First of all, inventing your own encryption algorithm is an exercise in futility, you can only fail. So lets not concern ourself with that. However even trying to implement an existing algorithm yourself can be very challenging, so lets drop this idea too and simply look for programs that meet certain criteria. We would like our program to have the following features: Open Source. On itself not a guarantee for lack of backdoors or bugs, but it reduces the probability of encountering them drastically. A million eyes simply see more than only a few.Tested independently if possible. A program that has been tested and certified by a company whose only job it is to do that will add even more credibility and reduce the numbers of critical errors even more.Available on your OS(es). Sure you can have one program for Linux, one for Windows and one on your iPad, but would it not be better if you had the same everywhere?Use safe and modern algorithms in a secure way. A certified open source program that only uses DES in ECB mode is not worth anything. AES in GCM on the other hand is much safer. (Block cipher mode of operation - Wikipedia , Data Encryption Standard - Wikipedia , Advanced Encryption Standard - Wikipedia )This list of features does not leave many candidates standing. One of the most prominent ones would be VeraCrypt, its the successor of TrueCrypt. It meets all our demands and has a few extra capabilities on top of that, such as the ability to create hidden volumes on your disk. Meaning that no only will your data be impossible to crack, it will not be easy to find in the first place.

First, there are tools out there for examining distributions, randomness and so on. You probably want to build a decent collection of those, because there is no other obvious way to test for randomness. Second, there's the characteristics needed. To be cryptographically secure, there should be no finite string of output that gives enough information to know the internal state and therefore the next number. Nor should an attacker forcing errors in the encryption (thus causing more random data to be requested) result in any exploitable patterns. The generator must also not allow timing data to expose anything. These obviously have to be proved mathematically, but how is a question I can't answer. So we've now got a test suite. That's good. Typically, prng systems work by iteratively applying one-way functions and then getting the output by applying another one-way function to the output. The better systems seem to use two or three core functions, rotating data between them. You need to be a bit careful, such functions usually don't like short inputs. Linux uses hardware information as an extra source of randomness, to ensure it's as hard as possible to predict subsequent values.

If you want to send a secret message to me, we need to both know the key. If you suspect that the key is compromised, how do you safely send a new key to me?Public key cryptography is a new advancement. In public key cryptography there are two keys, not one. A message encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other. That means that I can generate a pair of keys and use them very differently. One key is my “public key”; I can shout it to the world. The other key is my “private key”; ideally I share it with no one. If you know my public key, you can use it to encrypt a message and send it to me. Even though you don’t know my private key, you can be sure that I’ll be able to decode the message.You can stop here, but there’s one more detail you may find interesting. In pretty much any encryption scheme (either symmetric or public key), If I send lots of messages to you encrypted with the same key, and if those messages have a predictable format (like English text), then at some point it starts being possible to decrypt parts of the message even without knowing the key. So most secure encryption methods these days actually combine symmetric and public key cryptography. If I want to send you a message, here’s what happens: My encryption software generates a brand new key (which I’ll call “the message key”). This key will only be used for this message.My encryption software encrypts the message I’m sending using that message key, and using a symmetric cryptography scheme.My encryption software encrypts the message key itself, using a public key cryptography scheme and your public key.My encryption software sends you both the encrypted message key and the encrypted message itself.Your decryption software uses your private key to decrypt the message key.Your decryption software uses the message key to decrypt the actual message.Since the message keys have no pattern at all to them, it doesn’t get any easier to decrypt them, no matter how many messages I send you using your public key. And since I’m never using the same message key twice, it doesn’t get any easier to decrypt the contents of the actual messages either, even if the messages have lots of patterns to them.",2021-03-06T23:01:45.345Z,"What is 3GPP symmetric key cryptographic system?

In ancient times, they had what was called the Caeser cipher, which comprised of substituting each letter of the alphabet with a different letter. During the second world war times, a machine called Enigma with a complex code was used. When my father was a bank branch manager in eastern India, he used to maintain a secret code book in his banks vault. Every word that was required to be telegraphed to his head office was encoded with a different word in that code book. When I was introduced to cryptopgraphy in my first job in 1987, I started learning about stream ciphers. The concept is to encode an alphabetical message as a stream of 1s and 0s, which are then substituted with other 0s and 1s according a sequence of pseudo random bits generated in what is called a finite field. Cryptopgraphy has two sides to it - cryptography, where one designs good unbreakable ciphers and cryptanalysis, where one tries to break the codes. Until the 90s, cryptopgraphy and cryptanalysis both used to be art, in the sense that, there were not strong mathematical foundations behind both disciplines. Today, cryptography is a very well established subdiscipline of both applied mathematics and computer science. In fact, cryptopgraphy breathed a new vigor into the otherwise attenuating activity in the discipline of designing efficient algorithms and order complexity. So what are the major inflections in cryptography since the 90s: Stream ciphers with their basis and foundations in Galois FieldsThe RSA and Diffie Hellman protocols with their foundations in classical number theory.Elliptic curves over number fields , with mathematical roots in number theory and algebraic number theory.AES algorithm , again based on Galois fieldsTheory of random numbers.Encryption algorithms based on more esoteric mathematical objects called codes, lattices and rings.Homomorphic encryption where the idea is to compute over encrypted numbers without impacting the results.Quantum computing, where idea is the duality of a subatomic particle state could be exploited to solve some seemingly impossible problems like factoring very very large numbers ( useful in breaking RSA).That's just one small list of various mathematical theories and artefacts used to construct many of the current crop of crypto algorithms in use. So, to become a cryptographer is a reasonably long grind in applied mathematics , computer science and algorithms. An aptitude, interest and zeal to learn are critical to pitch oneself in the center of this field. Cryptanalysis is an even harder discipline. In that, knowing the above might be sufficient to design or at least critique existing algorithms, breaking codes requires a different level of involvement and hard work. A cryptanalyst is like a guerilla warrior. He not only needs the mathematical skills to fight, but also needs to strategize and conserve his energy to face a mighty opponent. He needs to understand the mathematics behind the algorithms to a reasonable degree - this will empower him to understand the extant of the search space when trying to reverse a code. More importantly, he needs intuition into the context and usage of the encryption algorithms. This involves applying an arsenal of techniques that are not necessarily related to mathematics. For example, it is well possible that many people choose their password as the name of their favorite music star. Going by this, a good fraction of the world passwords would be either Elvis111 or Beatles123. Or that the application of a weak or defective random number generator could be generating weak RSA keys. In summary cryptanalysis requires knowing cryptography and a whole lot more about the common errors, mistakes, oversights, application errors, human errors which tend to weaken the intended mathematical strength of the algorithms.

If the barriers to establishing a new profitable business are easy to overcome, then the market is seen as having a low barrier to entry (i.e. a new eBay business). If the barriers are very difficult to overcome, then the market is seen as having a high barrier to entry (i.e. a new airline business). If you are an existing business in a market, you want high barriers to entry to keep new entrants out and so secures your existing profits. See, high barriers to entry are an important characteristic for the sustainability of attractive economic profits because it equips these businesses with inherent strength, durability and flexibility. On the other hand, if you are a new entrant, you want low barriers to entry so that you can easily get into a market and establish your business. There are many barriers to entry that don’t affect every new entrant to the same degree, but here they are: Economies of Scale - this barrier has to do with the fact that a business needs to produce significant quantities right from the outset in order to keep the unit cost down to ensure a sustainable profit margin. The existing businesses are producing at a low unit costs due to their large production volumes and the new entrant needs to match it on day one to be competitive. i.e. computer components and peripherals.Existing Brand loyalty - this barrier has to do with the fact that the market has such strong existing brand loyalty, that a new entrant just can’t get traction. i.e. Coke in the cola marketCapital intensity - this barrier has to do with the fact that the new entrant need to spend a significant amount on infrastructure in order to trade. i.e. Power and telecommunication businesses.Buyer switching costs - this barrier has to do with the fact that the market has prior learning, habits and a deep relationship with existing products and so are reluctant to switch to a new entrant even with better features and performance. i.e. Software switchesIncumbent advantage: Incumbents have advantages in the market that new entrants don’t. Incumbents tend to have already formed deep relationships with the best suppliers, they have an understanding of optimising existing resources and have already established high quality and efficient processing benchmarks from years of business operations.Access to distribution channels – this barrier has to do with the fact that new entrants can’t access the key players (Buyers) in a market because of existing relationships and contracts with existing businesses. i.e. Supermarket shelf space.Proprietary factors – this barrier has to do with the fact that the existing businesses have Intellectual Property and patents that are required by the new entrant to operate. Maybe they already have the prime retail sites secured forcing the new entrant into the margins. i.e. fast food chains.Government Regulations – this barrier has to do with the fact that the government controls the market with licenses that the new entrant must obtain before they can operate. i.e. Liquor LicensesIndustry hostility - this barrier has to do with the fact that some industries do not welcome new entrants and will be hostile with price cuts to put them out of business before they can gain a foothold. i.e. Airline industry.Barriers to Exit: Some industries are very difficult to exit in the event of a less than optimum entry, so these types of industries become less attractive for new businesses to enter. i.e. specialised equipment in manufacture",2021-03-06T23:04:11.665Z,"Is there a great reference and low barrier to entry to write performant QuickAssist cryptographic code?

If this is not the case, then some other hash value will be “overweighted” and finding collisions for it will be easier. You can think of the hashing function in operation like a state machine (one state transition per block.) Because it’s a finite state machine, there must exist at least one input sequence QR such that the state after Q and the state after QR are identical. This can be used to create an infinite sequence of collisions, because QA, QRA, QRRA, etc. will all have the same output. So we can create an infinite set of inputs of this form, all of which have an infinite family of collisions. It is not, however, guaranteed that there exists such a sequence such that A and QA are the same output for a given A, or that A is the prefix of some repeating set of inputs. We can also reason about probability. If the hash function distributes nn-bit outputs randomly, then given a sequence A, there is probability 2−n2−n of a collision with another input. If we try all 2n2n-bit outputs the probability of finding no collisions if very low (the expected number we will find is 2n2n, in fact!) Then we can try all 3n3n-bit outputs, 4n4n-bit outputs, etc., to create an infinite sequence that has probability 0 of being empty. But, real-world hash functions may have exactly the sort of limitations that makes the distribution of bits less than perfectly random. It may be that there is no input that returns SHA-256 to its initial state, or that some output is only reachable via “short” inputs but not long inputs. But there can be only finitely many such cases.",2021-03-06T23:07:52.488Z,"Theoretically are there an infinite number of collisions possible for each input to a cryptographically secure a hash function like SHA-256?

60440dafed76476feda3a490,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-design-and-implementation-issues-of-a-cryptographic-system?-,"The direct answer is none. A cryptographic system is generally not something that is useful on its own. Generally cryptography is part of a larger system, other maybe than some rather theoretical examples. Besides that, there is the question what a system comprises off. There are things like a hybrid cryptosystem which is just the combination of an asymmetric algorithm and a symmetric one - originally just for purposes of encryption to achieve confidentiality. There are also systems like a complete certificate authority, which it highly complex and can be worth billions of dollars. Systems that are largely using cryptography do have some differences when it comes to design though. The use cases aren’t that different, but for crypto systems you have to also indicate the perceived threats and attack vectors. In other words, you are not just designing for use, you’re also designing against abuse. Attack vectors may for instance include side channel attacks, oracle attacks, fault injection and so on. These are rather specific attack vectors for cryptography, which come on top of other attacks that are not specific to cryptography such as buffer overruns etc. Of course with cryptography it is vitally that a protocol or a set of protocol is established. For that you need rather intricate knowledge of cryptography. Generally, the more specialized the protocol, the more knowledge is required. One thing I’ve also noticed is that, even more so than with other systems, it may require a lot of bottom up design. Generally there is e.g. already a key management scheme in place which needs to be used. This leads to design and implementation requirements for the system. And yes, key management is one of the most important aspect of any cryptographic system. Without good key magement (key lifetimes, key revocation, correct backing up, valid generation) any cryptosystem may end up on the loosing side.",2021-03-06T23:18:07.659Z,"What are the design and implementation issues of a cryptographic system?

The odds of you attracting enough professional attention to seriously review your creation are easily calculated: slim to none. That leaves you stuck in “virtually 100%” land.)

AES The Advanced Encryption Standard, AES, is a symmetric encryption algorithm and one of the most secure. The United States Government use it to protect classified information, and many software and hardware products use it as well. This method uses a block cipher, which encrypts data one fixed-size block at a time, unlike other types of encryption, such as stream ciphers, which encrypt data bit by bit. AES is comprised of AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. The key bit you choose encrypts and decrypts blocks in 128 bits, 192 bits and so on. There are different rounds for each bit key. A round is the process of turning plaintext into cipher text. For 128-bit, there are 10 rounds; 192-bit has 12 rounds; and 256-bit has 14 rounds. Since AES is a symmetric key encryption, you must share the key with other individuals for them to access the encrypted data. Furthermore, if you don’t have a secure way to share that key and unauthorized individuals gain access to it, they can decrypt everything encrypted with that specific key. 3DES Triple Data Encryption Standard, or 3DES, is a current standard, and it is a block cipher. It’s similar to the older method of encryption, Data Encryption Standard, which uses 56-bit keys. However, 3DES is a symmetric-key encryption that uses three individual 56-bit keys. It encrypts data three times, meaning your 56-bit key becomes a 168-bit key. Unfortunately, since it encrypts data three times, this method is much slower than others. Also, because 3DES uses shorter block lengths, it is easier to decrypt and leak data. However, many financial institutions and businesses in numerous other industries use this encryption method to keep information secure. As more robust encryption methods emerge, this one is being slowly phased out. Twofish Twofish is a symmetric block cipher based on an earlier block cipher – Blowfish. Twofish has a block size of 128-bits to 256 bits, and it works well on smaller CPUs and hardware. Similar to AES, it implements rounds of encryption to turn plaintext into cipher text. However, the number of rounds doesn’t vary as with AES; no matter the key size, there are always 16 rounds.",2021-03-06T23:25:47.872Z,"What are the most secure cryptographic systems and how do they work?

There are two main classification of SCA invasive and non-invasive. An invasive SCA is modifying the layout or structure of cryptographic-device to reveal the secret information embedded inside the device, such as reverse engineer, de-layering and fault injection. A non-invasive attack is much more efficient than an invasive one in terms of technique or cost to get the secret information. A non-invasive such as EM based attack, analyzing the correlation between EM signal generated during the encryption and plaintext/ciphertext. The SCA is much more efficient to reveal the secret key compared with brute force attack, particularly for AES-128. In AES-128, by means of SCA (correlation based analysis), it requires only 16x256 trials to break all secret key while brute force attack require 2^128 trials. However, in some implementations, the SCA is not applicable to be performed, such as breaking the pass-code of the phone using EM attack. This is due to accessing the EM is somewhat limited. Another implementation such as smart card (debit card, credit card) is feasible to perform SCA, since the EM or power dissipation of the smart card chip can be accessed during the transaction in ATM machine. The research in this field is still popular and so far, no fixed countermeasure technique yet to prevent the SCA.

Over the past century, computer scientists have come to believe, without proof, that anything a conventional computer can compute can also be computed by the Universal Turing machine and vice versa. In 1985 Physicist David Deutsch, a quantum computer pioneer, proved this to be true in his landmark paper (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~christos/classics/Deutsch_quantum_theory.pdf). More specifically, he showed that there is nothing in the (quantum mechanical) universe that cannot be simulated by his “QTM”, a quantum generalization of a UTM. He also showed that a UTM can perfectly simulate a QTM. Thus quantum computers cannot get outside the limits of what conventional computers can do and the UTM is now the gold standard for what is computable in principle. So why all the hype about quantum computing? Nothing stated above says anything about how long it takes to solve various problems. Quantum computers, because they represent multiple logical conditions in entangled quantum states of matter, can manipulate those conditions in parallel, allowing them to get to a final answer in many cases much faster than conventional computers can. Factoring large numbers is a great example of a problem that takes a long time with conventional computers. Such a long time that they are the basis of modern encryption. But Shor's algorithm for use on quantum computers is supposed to be so fast that, if and when real quantum computers can factor sufficiently large numbers, encryption techniques will have to change. To conclude, what conventional computers can do in principle, they may not be able to do in practice if their best algorithms take too long. Quantum computers operate as super-fast parallel machines in principle, but may not be able to scale up in practice due to the fragility of entangled quantum states.

This is why there is absolutely no way for you to define a “random” number using a list of computer instructions [with a caveat, see below]. Any PNRG has an internal state and an update equation, and together they define the next number that will be returned by the PRNG. If you know the internal algorithm of the PRNG and the current state, you can predict without any uncertainty the next number that it will return. Of course, you can’t use just any function as a PRNG, because the result should “look” unpredictable, so a PRNG must respect some very strict mathematical properties [1]. For example, the following question is quite common: Is pi a good random number generator? The only way to circumvent these problems is to use an external program which claim to produce random numbers: They rely on unpredictable processes like thermal or atmospheric noise rather than human-defined patterns. The results might still be slightly biased towards higher numbers or even numbers, but they’re not generated by a deterministic algorithm.

Theoretically speaking, the keys and the secrets should be secure from local (and remote) access in the kernel’s memory as it’s a memory protected by the CPU itself. Read more here.LUKS: it’s related to the keyring, but you will find LUKS used for whole disk encryption. By using LUKS and the keyring, the kernel can transparently encrypt and decrypt files to and from the disk, using, why not, cryptographically secure algorithms that uses hashing at some point. As LUKS is a security feature, the kernel is forced to verify the integrity of the physical media.",2021-03-06T23:47:10.748Z,"How do operating system kernels use cryptographic hashing algorithms to ensure integrity?

Encryption is a part of cryptography - a technique used in cryptography. Cryptography includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers. This was the short introduction to cryptography. Now, I will tell you the prerequisites to learn cryptography. Firstly, you need to sharpen you mind as this is the only way one can learn something new and hard. Then, you need to understand the binary (or hexadecimal) language clearly and get practiced with it. It is because, in cryptography, we hide information. Information is nothing but a sequence of bits for the computer or any other machine. To hide the information, you need to alter the position of bits or introduce some new bits. This way the information is altered. But you don’t need to go in that deep because of advancement in technology. Now, the functions we design are executed by the computer itself. But a clear understanding of binary (or hexadecimal) language is needed. The next thing you want to learn is Mathematics. Yes.. All this time we were thinking that what is the importance of maths in the field of computer science. But it is of great importance here. In cryptography - mainly in encryption techniques, you need to find a function which encrypts the data passed to it and that encrypted data can only be decrypted by the key returned by the function. Also, sometimes we need to find a function which encrypts the data but doesn’t decrypt it. Hence, the function cannot perform the decryption or else the reverse task. In short, a function whose inverse function doesn’t exist. Hence, everything in cryptography is done with the help of functions designed by cryptographers and this is nothing but mathematics. The next thing you have the learn is data structures and algorithms. You need to understand how data is actually stored and how can it be modified so that we can hide something inside it. Suppose, when we open an image in computer, the image viewer displays it on the screen. It is because image viewer knows how the process the bits stored in the image file. If you know this, you can modify the bits to display a different image..right? And if someone knows the way you modified the image, he/she can bring the real image back. Its kind of cool!! But for this you need to study algorithms. Algorithms are a way to understand how data is stored and processed in an efficient manner.

Monero’s anonymity means it offers improvements to bitcoin — like privacy for all of Monero users. With Bitcoin you can send money to anyone in the world without a middleman (e.g. You can send money online with a free open source bitcoin wallet and without having to involve a bank). But Bitcoin’s can’t offer anonymity because: a. Bitcoin is traceable — Every bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger. You can’t see the sender and recipients names, but you can see their wallet addresses. So bitcoin is not fully anonymous, most people refer to Bitcoin as being pseudonymous (or mostly anonymous). . b. Bitcoin is not fungible — What does it mean to be ‘fungible’? “Fungible: The property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable.” The US dollar is mostly fungible. For example, you and I could exchange 1 US Dollar, and each dollar is equal. 1 dollar = 1 dollar. Although because Bitcoin is traceable, there have been attempts to block, or blacklist bitcoin that comes from addresses where Bitcoin has been stolen, or gained illegally. 3. Monero’s technology is impressive: Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Monero is not a fork of Bitcoin, it is a fork of the CryptoNote protocol. The Monero team has created three new technologies in order to make Monero transactions completely anonymous: Ring signature — keeps the sender’s address privateRingCT — keeps the transaction amount privateStealth address – keeps the receiver’s address privateI teach about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies at Columbia University’s Business School.

From the link you’ve added it seems you’re referring to using some quantum storage for this. That would just be an extra complication. The trouble is that encryption itself isn’t conducive to long term anything. The longer the term, the less secure it becomes since cracking it is just a matter of time. That’s ignoring any issues with bitrot and damages causing loss of data. Rather a periodic re-encryption using new keys would be much more secure as well as providing better robust storage. From the storage side, there’s also only a handful of devices which can reach longer time frames than a decade. Things like M-Discs come to mind. But even with those, the fear is that in 50 to 100 years from now their read/write devices would have become discontinued. Meaning even if the storage medium did keep the data for that long, no-one has the ability to read it anymore (or at best not easily). And it’s not something extraordinary, even in the last 20 years we’ve seen numerous storage devices come and go, forget floppies and stiffies, even worse are things like Bernoulli and Zip drives. So in both camps (encryption as well as storage) the ideal thing to do is to re-store everything periodically instead of relying on one copy for ever. It also helps because nearly all data is live data, meaning you’ve got one archive from 10 years ago - but nothing in between has been added to it. With periodic re-copies it’s inherent to update the archive each time. Thus (my opinion) is to forget “weird” long term storage. Use whatever you want, HDD, SSD, tape, optical, etc. etc. etc. But copy those across every one or two years to a new set while you also update the content to include anything new since the last copy. I.e. your archive just becomes the last step in a multi-tiered backup regime. In which case you’d apply a new encryption to the new copy and thus you don’t need to worry about the encryption key either.",2021-03-07T00:01:25.294Z,"What is considered best practice for long term storage of cryptographic keys?

Quantum computing doesn’t solve every computing problem. It is neat though (source: XKCD). Quantum-safe cryptography (or what we’ve now given the term Post-Quantum Cryptography as it sounds way cooler) refers to ciphers and cryptological systems that are either enabled uniquely by quantum computing or resistant to quantum cryptoanalytical attacks. In simpler terms: post quantum algorithms are cryptography that can stand up to the rigor of attacks that any quantum computing system could throw at them. Many post-quantum algorithms are common symmetric crypto algorithms that don’t rely on math problems that are more easily solved by quantum computing. For example, symmetric key algorithms like AES can be considered post-quantum because there isn’t a “trick” that using quantum computing gives you to solve it extremely quicker than you otherwise would with a traditional computer. This isn’t to say that attacking AES and other symmetric key algorithms are left completely unaided by quantum computing. For example, in the late 90’s a mathematician created a quantum computing algorithm that allowed you to search for the inverse of a function from a data set of its outputs quickly known as Grover's algorithm. Grover’s can be applied to help speed up brute force efforts in attacking symmetric key cryptosystems by looking at enough outputs of a single key - something we assume a sufficiently well resourced attacker would have under Kerckhoffs's principle. But increasing the speed of brute force doesn’t necessarily yield a shortcut to break algorithms like AES, it just makes that problem slightly less hard.  Non post-quantum algorithms like Diffie Hellman (above) rely on math that is uniquely addressed by quantum computing algorithms. Compare this to non-post quantum algorithms like Diffie-Hellman. The security of DH relies on something called the Discrete Log Problem (see: Discrete logarithm - Wikipedia). In order to search for a or b in DH, we need to take a discrete log of the overall key k = g^(ab) mod p. Traditionally this is a computationally intractable problem, which means that there isn’t a “trick” to efficiently calculate these exponents without exhaustively searching for them. But with Shor's algorithm we can take a discrete log in BQP (Bounded Quantum Polynomial Time) which is orders of magnitude faster than the sieving algorithms we would use today to attack this problem - algorithms with sub-exponential time Big-O that’s much slower than their polynomial counterparts. So while we can speed up some attacks against algorithms like AES, quantum computing doesn’t reduce the overall complexity of contemplation. As such these symmetric key algorithms are post-quantum. There also exist some quantum encryption techniques that rely on quantum computing and are post-quantum because they’re similarly resistant to quantum cryptanalysis. Quantum key exchanges like BB84 (see: Quantum key distribution - Wikipedia) which rely on entangled photons and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to ensure that eavesdropping doesn’t violate the encryption’s security are currently post-quantum because breaking them mathematically would require us to somehow find a loophole around quantum uncertainty. That seems pretty impossible, all things considered. But whereas the mathematic scrutiny around AES is very mature, some of these techniques are still in their infancy of being studied and implemented. As such, most post-quantum crpytography is focused on symmetric key algorithms like AES.",2021-03-07T00:04:20.775Z,"Which parameter reduces the performance speed of the cryptographic algorithm?

I will answer to this question, but let me first clarify some things about Facebook AI Research (FAIR). Clarification : Facebook hasn't shut down AI research. They only shut down one experiment. They are working on an AI which could communicate with humans (Obviously, that is the prime goal after all). To develop this, bots were given some tasks which required bot-to-bot communication in English. They started talking to each other in simple language, as FAIR scientists didn’t want to confuse bots with complex language. After conversing some sentences, they lost command over English and started repeating words in way that we, humans cannot understand. Example: Bob: “I can can I I everything else.” Alice: “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.” This is the reason they shut down the experiment (not research). They are busy finding some other ways to complete the task. Tell me one thing.

No. You will have to practice it, don’t you? Well, autonomous helicopters succeeded to do so in first attempt. Isn’t it smart? Searching results by text (Google search) or telling a bot with computer commands (FAIR) to complete particular task seems easy compared to this AI. I mean, you somehow give indirectly commands. Either AI should receive and follow direct verbal commands or do it themselves by understanding nearby situations and environment,right? This AI fits the criteria.

I assume that with performance you mean the speed? In general the speed of a cryptographic hash function as long as it is not impractically slow, does not improve the security. It may even reduce it as it may be possible for an attacker to run more attempts to find a hash collision per second than a slower hashing function. Finding a hash collisions, that is finding two different values that yield the same hash value, or finding, by random chance and brute force one possible input that yields to a known output, is what is commonly meant when people talk about cracking a hash. Far too often attackers are able to steal databases with the hash values of passwords in them. Finding the bytes that lead to the hash value can mean that those bytes were the password. The risk with hashed passwords getting found out in this way have lead to the creation of dedicated password hashing algorithms whose primary goal are not speed of execution (unlike general purpose hashes like the SHA family) but security at a reasonable runtime tradeoff. some examples are: Argon2 - Wikipedia The winner of the 2017 password hashing competition scrypt - Wikipedia bcrypt - Wikipedia PBKDF2 - Wikipedia one of the older dedicated password hashing functions",2021-03-07T00:12:56.366Z,"Does the high implementation performance of a cryptographic hash function improve security?

You can’t engage in the discipline in any meaningful way without doing mathematics.Cryptographic engineering, which is the craft of building secure systems out of cryptographic primitives and mitigating their risks, requires a deep understanding of the security environment and the requirements of the system. Because of its focus on reasoning to necessary conclusions from unambiguous, well-understood assumptions, mathematics training is somewhere between very useful preparation and indispensable foundation for this discipline, depending on whom you ask and what level of assurance you seek in the correctness of your work.To say more about point 1, the cryptology side: Cryptology recruits a huge variety of forms of mathematics to accomplish its goals, from construction through attack. Very rudimentary set theory is used to construct trapdoor functions that are easy to compute but very hard to invert, which is the most foundational logical building block for things like hash functions. Basic information theory is needed to appreciate why the one-time pad is (uniquely) perfectly secure, to appreciate how the poorer alternatives can stack up, and to provide a few lemmas or reasoning about the security of systems in relation to their parts. Most of the basic security arguments also turn in key ways on the basics of computational complexity theory. You definitely need concepts like BQP to understands quantum attacks on asymmetric cryptosystems based on factorization problems. A basic grounding in probability theory undergirds nearly all of the arguments for the security claims that cryptologists make, and without these kinds of claims, we’d have no confidence that modern cryptological design should withstand attack. While it’s technically not essential to building some rudimentary cryptosystems with good security properties, modern algebra (or abstract algebra), the language of vector spaces, groups, rings, and fields, is indispensable to pursuing cryptography in the generality and with the expressive power needed to do interesting things and avoid common mistakes. Probably the first obvious place this comes up is in RSA, which is defined over the multiplicative group of the integers under a modulus. You need elementary number theory (in particular Fermat’s little theorem) to see how it works, and you can use a huge portion of number theory in general (a subject about which I’m mostly ignorant, except to point out that algebraic number theory is largely an outgrowth of algebraic geometry, which I also mention below). The design of block and stream ciphers, which are often decomposed into a series of stages or rounds, generally turns on a combination of linear and non-linear stages—the linear to create diffusion, or an avalanche effect where flipping one bit of the key changes much (ideally half of the bits in expectation) of the ciphertext; and the non-linear to create confusion, where one bit of the ciphertext depends on several bits of the key. The linear stages generally do the most mixing and are designed with efficiency in mind, but the non-linear stages are essential to the security of the cipher because otherwise the entire cipher would be linear, and a simple matrix inversion might suffice for cryptanalysis. Supplying the needed diffusion generally means designing the linear stage using tools of (usually fairly basic) linear algebra (in particular, you need the matrix representation to be fully diagonalizable, and it should really be an MDS matrix, often among other things). Designing the non-linear stage is an art drawing on many areas, but the stage should be reasonably performant, hard to linearize, and not have fixed points; if you’re working with polynomials (or anything they model in the algorithm), tools from algebraic geometry like Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz may be helpful here, and if it’s pretty easy, for example, to find a Gröbner basis for the variety given by your non-linear function as applied to your round design, you’re in deep trouble. Finite fields crop up everywhere, including not just the design of authentication codes but also to define the aforementioned block and stream cipher operations properly, as well as in almost all of the asymmetric cryptography in widespread use (importantly, elliptic curve cryptography and Diffie-Hellman key exchange). Briefly, finite fields ensure you can maintain the strict security properties you want doing any arithmetic you need all with fixed data sizes, which you really want both for performance and side-channel attack resistance (after all, if the amount of data you’re manipulating depends on your choice of key, I can learn things about your key just by measuring the time it takes you to encrypt or decrypt). They also furnish you with things like irreducible polynomials that when used in rounds make it impossible to speed up an attack by factoring the round out into much simpler parts that can be independently inverted. Suffice it to say that you can’t even say the name of fully homomorphic encryption without using the language of modern algebra, much less pursue it. :) Finally, when rubber meets road, you need statistics. When it comes to mounting cryptographic attacks, everything is fair game, but modern statistical tests like the chi-squared test are key to finding weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms (and, on the design side, are out-and-out essential to smoke-testing such algorithms, and any of their constituent parts, for problems). The modern statistical design of experiments is also useful for comparing variations on a given elementary cryptographic primitive in an apples-to-apples fashion. To briefly sketch out some of point 2, on cryptographic engineering: If you cannot state assumptions unambiguously (including security requirements, threats, and so on), reason logically and carefully, and decompose complex engineering problems into their constituents, you’re out of the cryptographic engineering race before it starts. You also need to understand what the cryptographic tools are for and what they offer, as well as grasp the contents of certain basic information theoretic lemmas like the data processing inequality on at least some rough intuitive level, in order to get started with cryptographic engineering. Is lots of formal mathematics training strictly necessary for any of this? Well, no, but it’s very good preparation—to say the least. If you really want to have assurance that your system (or your implementation of a given cryptographic primitive) conforms to a desired specification, you need to put the tools of formal methods to use. This topic is big enough that it really belongs in another post, but to meet the highest standards of assurance, you will need to become very skilled in the use of a computer proof assistant, which will probably entail learning a little programming language theory while developing a great deal of more parochial domain-specific expertise. — Any mistakes are my own.

If you rely on the real random generator directly, then you’re out of luck when it breaks. What’s worse, you might not know when it breaks.” So unless one qualifies a TRNG with “a mechanism that generates i.i.d. values on {0, 1}”, one is more likely in practice to be more secure using a (good) CSPRNG.

A cryptographic hash function computes a small value from a large one in such a way that it’s very, very difficult to find a different large value that computes to the same small value. In practical terms: md5(“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”) == “9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6”. It’s going to be very difficult for you to find a different sentence (or paragraph, or book) that hashes to the same value. The stronger the hash, the greater the difficulty. In practical terms, that means I can say things like “Yo, client, please compute the SHA-256 hash of the text ‘dJ2kBhmNZwsH51’ concate Continue Reading",2021-03-07T00:13:49.691Z,"What are cryptographic hashes and hash functions?

60441ce0ed76476feda3bbba,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-cryptographic-methods-used-nowadays?-,"According to me, there are mainly 4 methods widely used. 1. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Advanced Encryption Standard is a symmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts fixed blocks of data (of 128 bits) at a time. The keys are used to decipher the text which can be 128-, 192-, or 256-bit long. The 256-bit key encrypts the data in 14 rounds, the 192-bit key in 12 rounds, and the 128-bit key in 10 rounds. Each round consists of several steps of substitution, transposition, mixing of plaintext, and more. 2. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) Rivest-Shamir-Adleman is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that is based on the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers. Only someone with the knowledge of these numbers will be able to decode the message successfully. RSA is often used in digital signatures but works slower when large volumes of data need to be encrypted. 3. Triple Data Encryption Standard (TripleDES) Triple Data Encryption Standard is symmetric encryption and an advanced form of the DES method that encrypts blocks of data using a 56-bit key. TripleDES applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block. TripleDES is commonly used to encrypt ATM PINs and UNIX passwords. 4. Twofish Twofish is a license-free encryption method that ciphers data blocks of 128 bits. It’s considered the successor to the Blowfish encryption method that ciphered message blocks of 64 bits. Twofish always encrypts data in 16 rounds regardless of the key size. Though it works slower than AES, the Twofish encryption method continues to be used by many file and folder encryption software solutions.",2021-03-07T00:22:56.498Z,"What are the different cryptographic methods used nowadays?

I spent 10 years designing and developing very high grade encryption devices for the banking community. I started off doing more marketing (not really my thing) and buying-in and managing development but with a change of management concentrated more on direct software development. I took part in the CCITT security study group, but other than that my daily work was very similar to any software development environment. On the other hand I shared an office with a professional mathematician. He had written or, at least, provided input to the low level cipher algorithms that we software engineers used, but his “day job” was doing basic research in cryptology and proving consulting for special projects. He, mostly with a colleague, published a number of papers and was an editor of the “Journal of Cryptology”. Then there are security specialists who do neither research nor development but advise companies on security issues. Are they also classed as “cryptographers”? I don’t know. If so then there are a wide variety of roles and jobs that come under the umbrella of the term “cryptographer”.",2021-03-07T00:36:39.867Z,"What does a typical day of a cryptographer consist of?

But still I would like to mention it in this answer as it makes this answer smooth. Cryptography is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Hence, in short, cryptography is a technique used to hide the original information from others. I needed to mention this because most of people in here will directly relate the word cryptography with encryption. They think that cryptography is same as encryption. But this is not true. Encryption is a part of cryptography - a technique used in cryptography. Cryptography includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers. This was the short introduction to cryptography. Now, I will tell you the prerequisites to learn cryptography. Firstly, you need to sharpen you mind as this is the only way one can learn something new and hard. Then, you need to understand the binary (or hexadecimal) language clearly and get practiced with it. It is because, in cryptography, we hide information. Information is nothing but a sequence of bits for the computer or any other machine. To hide the information, you need to alter the position of bits or introduce some new bits. This way the information is altered. But you don’t need to go in that deep because of advancement in technology. Now, the functions we design are executed by the computer itself. But a clear understanding of binary (or hexadecimal) language is needed. The next thing you want to learn is Mathematics. Yes.. All this time we were thinking that what is the importance of maths in the field of computer science. But it is of great importance here. In cryptography - mainly in encryption techniques, you need to find a function which encrypts the data passed to it and that encrypted data can only be decrypted by the key returned by the function. Also, sometimes we need to find a function which encrypts the data but doesn’t decrypt it. Hence, the function cannot perform the decryption or else the reverse task. In short, a function whose inverse function doesn’t exist. Hence, everything in cryptography is done with the help of functions designed by cryptographers and this is nothing but mathematics. The next thing you have the learn is data structures and algorithms. You need to understand how data is actually stored and how can it be modified so that we can hide something inside it. Suppose, when we open an image in computer, the image viewer displays it on the screen. It is because image viewer knows how the process the bits stored in the image file. If you know this, you can modify the bits to display a different image..right? And if someone knows the way you modified the image, he/she can bring the real image back. Its kind of cool!! But for this you need to study algorithms. Algorithms are a way to understand how data is stored and processed in an efficient manner. Hence, to understand processing of data, you need to study algorithms. The above was a list of prerequisites needed to study cryptography. The answer was very long but this is only the beginning. Cryptography is a deep well and this is only a bucket of water from it. Stay motivated and learn hard..

In practical hybrid solutions though, there is a single symmetric key used for actual communication. It is possible (but unusual) for there to be a separate key for each channel, and/or a separate key per direction - but normally, just one key for the actual communication. Let us take a practical example - TLS 1.3 TLS 1.3 will use a single symmetric key for actual communication - so that’s the first key. that key will however be negotiated using the PFS suite selected - DHE or ECDHE. In either case, each side has a private and public key - so that’s four more. now, the actual exchange will be digitally signed by the passive party (server) - that requires two more keys (the signing key, and the public key from the cert to verify it) the cert will usually be signed - so that’s another key (the CA’s public key). But the CA may not be a direct signatory - there may be a second, or even third intermediate certificate, which each has a public key. so that’s a minimum of seven keys (one symmetric) if the cert is self signed, plus one or more additional keys for the CA layer. A typical CA has one intermediate, so it would be fair to say your average TLS 1.3 session uses nine keys for its setup.

But determining the original prime numbers from the product is considered an infeasible operation due to the time it would take using even today's most powerful supercomputers. This is called the factoring problem. In a nutshell this property is the trapdoor function for RSA encryption. It’s easy to go one way (multiplying the 2 prime numbers) but stupendously difficult to go the other way (figuring out the 2 prime factors given only their product). This is getting all boring. Wait… I’ll explain RSA using an example:  Let’s imagine living in a hypothetical Gotham City. For the sake of simplicity, let’s say you are the Joker, the agent of Chaos! Every fairy-tale needs a good old-fashioned villain :P So let’s say, I am Moriarty ;) Our sole purpose of existence is to cause havoc in Gotham and give Batman a hard time. We are the evil guys. Partners in crime!  Now while Batman is trying to figure out the Joker’s next move, the Joker is out there on the streets tracking each and every move of Batman and reporting them to Moriarty. It’s a battle of wits! The Joker and Moriarty are too awesome when it comes to Python Programming. They are gifted! The Joker needs to report Batman’s moves to Moriarty in a safe and secure way. The problem with sending data over any network to Moriarty is that it can be tapped by Batman. That’s when RSA encryption comes to Moriarty’s mind! The Joker could encrypt his messages using RSA algorithm and send the encrypted text over to Moriarty. Here’s how this is gonna work… There is a public key and a private key. Both of these keys will be generated by Moriarty. Here’s how Moriarty generates the Public key: Choose 22 large prime numbers pp and qq.Find n=p∗qn=p∗q. This is the first part of the public key.We also need a small exponent ee which must be an integer, not be a factor of n and satisfying 1<e<(p−1)∗(q−1)1<e<(p−1)∗(q−1).The generated public key is (n,e)(n,e).Next Moriarty generates his Private key: ϕ(n)=(p−1)∗(q−1)ϕ(n)=(p−1)∗(q−1)d=(k∗ϕ(n)+1)ed=(k∗ϕ(n)+1)eThe generated private key is (d,e)(d,e).Moriarty then broadcasts this public key on all digital billboard screens in Gotham city. He’s done this before ;)  Note: He doesn’t share his private key. He only shares his public key. The Joker looks up at the nearest screen and notes down Moriarty’s public key. Using Socket programming in Python, Moriarty codes up a python script for a Server and keeps it running.  Here’s Moriarty’s Server code… from __future__ import unicode_literals import socket from math import sqrt import random from random import randint as rand import pickle   host = socket.gethostname() port = 5000  s = socket.socket() s.bind((host, port)) s.listen(2)   def gcd(a, b):     if b == 0:         return a     else:         return gcd(b, a % b)   def mod_inverse(a, m):     for x in range(1, m):         if (a * x) % m == 1:             return x     return -1   def isprime(n):     if n < 2:         return False     elif n == 2:         return True     else:         for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):             if n % i == 0:                 return False     return True   #initial two random numbers p,q p = rand(1, 1000) q = rand(1, 1000)   def generate_keypair(p, q,keysize):     # keysize is the bit length of n so it must be in range(nMin,nMax+1).     # << is bitwise operator     # x << y is same as multiplying x by 2**y     # i am doing this so that p and q values have similar bit-length.     # this will generate an n value that's hard to factorize into p and q.       nMin = 1<<(keysize-1)     nMax = (1<<keysize) - 1     primes=[2]     # we choose two prime numbers in range(start, stop) so that the difference of bit lengths is at most 2.     start = 1<<(keysize//2-1)     stop = 1<<(keysize//2+1)      if start >= stop:         return []      for i in range(3, stop + 1, 2):         for p in primes:             if i % p == 0:                 break         else:             primes.append(i)      while(primes and primes[0] < start):         del primes[0]      #choosing p and q from the generated prime numbers.     while primes:         p = random.choice(primes)         primes.remove(p)         q_values = [q for q in primes if nMin <= p * q <= nMax]         if q_values:             q = random.choice(q_values)             break      n = p * q     phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)      #generate public key 1<e<phi(n)     e = random.randrange(1, phi)     g = gcd(e, phi)      #as long as gcd(1,phi(n)) is not 1, keep generating e     while g != 1:         e = random.randrange(1, phi)         g = gcd(e, phi)      #generate private key     d = mod_inverse(e, phi)      #public key (e,n)     #private key (d,n)      return ((e, n), (d, n))  def decrypt(msg_ciphertext, package):     d, n = package     msg_plaintext = [chr(pow(c, d, n)) for c in msg_ciphertext]     # No need to use ord() since c is now a number     # After decryption, we cast it back to character     # to be joined in a string for the final result     return (''.join(msg_plaintext))  public, private = generate_keypair(p, q, 8)   print(host) conn, address = s.accept() print(""Connected to: "" + str(address))   conn.send(str(public[0]).encode()) conn.send(str(public[1]).encode()) print(""Public Key: "",public)  while True:     encoded_data = pickle.loads(conn.recv(1024*4))     for i in range(len(encoded_data)):         encoded_data[i]=int(encoded_data[i])     if not encoded_data:         break     #print(''.join(map(lambda x: str(x), encoded_data)))     decoded_data = decrypt(encoded_data, private)     print(""Client : "" + str(decoded_data)) conn.close()  The Joker will now encrypt his message (Batman’s moves) using Moriarty’s public key that he noted down earlier from the billboard. First he converts all characters in his message to their ASCII value. The encrypted message is given by: c=(message)emod nc=(message)emod n. The Joker now codes up a python script for a Client and connects to Moriarty’s Server. He then sends his encrypted message, cc.  Here’s the Joker’s Client code:  from __future__ import unicode_literals import socket from math import sqrt import random from random import randint as rand import pickle  host = socket.gethostname() port = 5000  s = socket.socket() s.connect((host, port))   def encrypt(msg_plaintext, package):     #unpack key value pair     e, n = package     msg_ciphertext = [pow(ord(c), e, n) for c in msg_plaintext]     return msg_ciphertext  e = int(s.recv(1024).decode()) n = int(s.recv(1024).decode())  public = (e, n)  print(""Public Key: "",public)  message = input("" -> "") encrypted_msg = encrypt(message, public) #encoded_message = ''.join(map(lambda x: str(x), encrypted_msg)) encoded_data = pickle.dumps(encrypted_msg) while True:     s.send(encoded_data)     message = input("" -> "")     encrypted_msg = encrypt(message, public)     #encoded_message = ''.join(map(lambda x: str(x), encrypted_msg))     encoded_data = pickle.dumps(encrypted_msg) s.close()  Now let’s say Batman breaks into the server-client network. He’ll see the encrypted message and won’t be able to decode it. Even though Batman knows Moriarty’s public (because he saw it on his TV when Moriarty broadcasted it), he won’t be able to decode the encrypted message. For decryption, the private key is required which is under the safe custody of Moriarty himself :D The encrypted message now reaches Moriarty’s Server. He uses his private key (d,e)(d,e) which he had generated earlier. The decrypted message is given by: cdmod ncdmod n . The decrypted text will be the ASCII values of the original message. All that’s left is to convert the ASCII values to their corresponding characters!   This code was created in collaboration with Awnon Bhowmik (অনন ভৌমিক).

Businesses and organizations must take a data-centric approach to prevent their confidential data against advanced threats in complex and evolving virtualization, cloud services, and mobility environments. Businesses must implement data security solutions that provide consistent protection of sensitive data, including data protection within the cloud through encryption and cryptographic key management. Two main cryptographic techniques used in cloud security are: Asymmetric cryptography: Same key is used for encryption and decryption also called as secret key cryptography or private key cryptography.

The input to the hash function is of arbitrary length but output is always of fixed length. Values returned by a hash function are called message digest or simply hash values. The following picture illustrated hash function −  Features of Hash Functions The typical features of hash functions are − Fixed Length Output (Hash Value): Hash function coverts data of arbitrary length to a fixed length. This process is often referred to as hashing the data.In general, the hash is much smaller than the input data, hence hash functions are sometimes called compression functions.Since a hash is a smaller representation of a larger data, it is also referred to as a Message digest. Hash function with n bit output is referred to as an n-bit hash function. Popular hash functions generate values between 160 and 512 bits.Efficiency of Operation: Generally for any hash function h with input x, computation of h(x) is a fast operation.Computationally hash functions are much faster than a symmetric encryption.Properties of Hash Functions In order to be an effective cryptographic tool, the hash function is desired to possess following properties − Pre-Image Resistance: This property means that it should be computationally hard to reverse a hash function. In other words, if a hash function h produced a hash value z, then it should be a difficult process to find any input value x that hashes to z.This property protects against an attacker who only has a hash value and is trying to find the input.Second Pre-Image Resistance: This property means given an input and its hash, it should be hard to find a different input with the same hash. In other words, if a hash function h for an input x produces hash value h(x), then it should be difficult to find any other input value y such that h(y) = h(x).This property of hash function protects against an attacker who has an input value and its hash, and wants to substitute different value as legitimate value in place of original input value.Collision Resistance: This property means it should be hard to find two different inputs of any length that result in the same hash. This property is also referred to as collision free hash function. In other words, for a hash function h, it is hard to find any two different inputs x and y such that h(x) = h(y).Since, hash function is compressing function with fixed hash length, it is impossible for a hash function not to have collisions. This property of collision free only confirms that these collisions should be hard to find.This property makes it very difficult for an attacker to find two input values with the same hash.Also, if a hash function is collision-resistant then it is second pre-image resistant.Popular Hash Functions Let us briefly see some popular hash functions − Message Digest (MD) MD5 was most popular and widely used hash function for quite some years. The MD family comprises of hash functions MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6. It was adopted as Internet Standard RFC 1321. It is a 128-bit hash function.MD5 digests have been widely used in the software world to provide assurance about integrity of transferred file. For example, file servers often provide a pre-computed MD5 checksum for the files, so that a user can compare the checksum of the downloaded file to it.In 2004, collisions were found in MD5. An analytical attack was reported to be successful only in an hour by using computer cluster. This collision attack resulted in compromised MD5 and hence it is no longer recommended for use.Secure Hash Function (SHA) Family of SHA comprise of four SHA algorithms; SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. Though from same family, there are structurally different. The original version is SHA-0, a 160-bit hash function, was published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1993. It had few weaknesses and did not become very popular. Later in 1995, SHA-1 was designed to correct alleged weaknesses of SHA-0.SHA-1 is the most widely used of the existing SHA hash functions. It is employed in several widely used applications and protocols including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security.In 2005, a method was found for uncovering collisions for SHA-1 within practical time frame making long-term employability of SHA-1 doubtful.SHA-2 family has four further SHA variants, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 depending up on number of bits in their hash value. No successful attacks have yet been reported on SHA-2 hash function.Though SHA-2 is a strong hash function. Though significantly different, its basic design is still follows design of SHA-1. Hence, NIST called for new competitive hash function designs.In October 2012, the NIST chose the Keccak algorithm as the new SHA-3 standard. Keccak offers many benefits, such as efficient performance and good resistance for attacks.Applications of Hash Functions There are two direct applications of hash function based on its cryptographic properties. Password Storage Hash functions provide protection to password storage. Instead of storing password in clear, mostly all logon processes store the hash values of passwords in the file.The Password file consists of a table of pairs which are in the form (user id, h(P)).The process of logon is depicted in the following illustration − An intruder can only see the hashes of passwords, even if he accessed the password. He can neither logon using hash nor can he derive the password from hash value since hash function possesses the property of pre-image resistance.Data Integrity Check Data integrity check is a most common application of the hash functions. It is used to generate the checksums on data files. This application provides assurance to the user about correctness of the data. The process is depicted in the following illustration −  The integrity check helps the user to detect any changes made to original file. It however, does not provide any assurance about originality. The attacker, instead of modifying file data, can change the entire file and compute all together new hash and send to the receiver. This integrity check application is useful only if the user is sure about the originality of file. NOTE: Always keep in mind that Hashing can never be used to for encryption. Because it is impossible to get original data from hashed value as discussed above. It can only be used to check the integrity of the data. People many a times forget this thing.",2021-03-07T00:46:29.011Z,"What cryptographic algorithms are used to share the data safely with authorised partners and people? ",Quora

Omnipotence contradicts logic as you know it. Omnipotence means having the ability to do everything and anything. Furthermore omnipotence contradicts omniscience. If a being is omnipotent it’s not 100% omniscient for the following reasons. An omnipotent being must be able to create new knowledge. This is because an omnipotent being must have the ‘ability to do anything and everything’ , whereas in contrast to that an omniscient being that ‘knows everything that can be known’ or has ‘universal knowledge and awareness’. By this definition of omnipotence and omniscience, there’s limitations here. An omniscient being would perhaps have the knowledge to create a cyrptographic schema that wouldn’t break. Perhaps that knowledge is indeed known and possible. Being omniscient doesn’t mean your omnipotent. You might have the knowledge to do certain things but also know that certain things are possible. But then on the other hand if it could break that cyrptographic schema then well she’s not omniscient. Because that would mean that it can be broken which means their knowledge isn’t fully correct. Now as for omnipotence it doesn’t matter. Human logic doesn’t apply here. An omnipotent being can create something that can’t be broken and then break it simply because it’s omnipotent.

But still I would like to mention it in this answer as it makes this answer smooth. Cryptography is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Hence, in short, cryptography is a technique used to hide the original information from others. I needed to mention this because most of people in here will directly relate the word cryptography with encryption. They think that cryptography is same as encryption. But this is not true. Encryption is a part of cryptography - a technique used in cryptography. Cryptography includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers. This was the short introduction to cryptography. Now, I will tell you the prerequisites to learn cryptography. Firstly, you need to sharpen you mind as this is the only way one can learn something new and hard. Then, you need to understand the binary (or hexadecimal) language clearly and get practiced with it. It is because, in cryptography, we hide information. Information is nothing but a sequence of bits for the computer or any other machine. To hide the information, you need to alter the position of bits or introduce some new bits. This way the information is altered. But you don’t need to go in that deep because of advancement in technology. Now, the functions we design are executed by the computer itself. But a clear understanding of binary (or hexadecimal) language is needed. The next thing you want to learn is Mathematics. Yes.. All this time we were thinking that what is the importance of maths in the field of computer science. But it is of great importance here. In cryptography - mainly in encryption techniques, you need to find a function which encrypts the data passed to it and that encrypted data can only be decrypted by the key returned by the function. Also, sometimes we need to find a function which encrypts the data but doesn’t decrypt it. Hence, the function cannot perform the decryption or else the reverse task. In short, a function whose inverse function doesn’t exist. Hence, everything in cryptography is done with the help of functions designed by cryptographers and this is nothing but mathematics. The next thing you have the learn is data structures and algorithms. You need to understand how data is actually stored and how can it be modified so that we can hide something inside it. Suppose, when we open an image in computer, the image viewer displays it on the screen. It is because image viewer knows how the process the bits stored in the image file. If you know this, you can modify the bits to display a different image..right? And if someone knows the way you modified the image, he/she can bring the real image back. Its kind of cool!! But for this you need to study algorithms. Algorithms are a way to understand how data is stored and processed in an efficient manner. Hence, to understand processing of data, you need to study algorithms. The above was a list of prerequisites needed to study cryptography. The answer was very long but this is only the beginning. Cryptography is a deep well and this is only a bucket of water from it. Stay motivated and learn hard..

Adam Brown Securing the hybrid cloud means complete protection for all on-site property. This involve protecting the different mobile devices connected both to the cloud 's private and public sides. All the while, you must hope that your service provider maintains a stable, compliant service at its end. There is literally no single-size solution with so many angles to cover. Here's a list of things to remember when considering protection in the hybrid cloud. _________________________________________ 1. IT Security Skills In order to succeed in a hybrid setting, IT security specialists need specialised skills Continue ReadingSecuring the hybrid cloud means complete protection for all on-site property. This involve protecting the different mobile devices connected both to the cloud 's private and public sides. All the while, you must hope that your service provider maintains a stable, compliant service at its end. There is literally no single-size solution with so many angles to cover. Here's a list of things to remember when considering protection in the hybrid cloud. _________________________________________ 1. IT Security Skills In order to succeed in a hybrid setting, IT security specialists need specialised skills. In this climate, openness and visibility are important. Unconventional skills must be embraced by experts. IT experts can value their value in gold, for example, who can track and audit enforcement third-party cloud systems extensively. A considerable privilege is to strike the right balance between conventional and prospective skills. _________________________________________ 2. Monitoring A public cloud platform can work the same as your own infrastructure would expect. Providers monitor the environment and keep accurate records of all operations. In case of a violation of security or even a suspicious behaviour, the vendor may warn the customer who might follow it up. Alerts from the seller are a thing. It's another one to act on what you see. The customer must track the results and alert his own security team. With analytical consideration, businesses may merge reports, warnings and data for a holistic view from other applications. Hybrid cloud protection tightens another few notches as both sides of the fence are tracked. _________________________________________ 3. SLA Flexibility Cloud computing agreements have long been a hot potato. The users are understandably irritated by the ambiguous terminology and misunderstanding about what ""99.95 percent uptime"" actually means. However, thanks to the hybrid cloud, things are looking up. More suppliers allow personalised SLAs. No two implementations are the same and this gives consumers some leeway in the bargaining table. For three reasons, custom SLAs make sense: Data: It is invaluable to use your business data. You want to know who owns it, who controls access to it, and what measures must be taken to make it accessible to you.Compliance: According to 40% of respondents, a survey by Evolve IP reveals that enforcement is a big obstacle to cloud adoption. Compliance is made more complicated by hybrid cloud dynamics.Compliance Management: Data held in the possession of a non-compliance provider does not exempt you from any compliance obligations. Organizations can take advantage of agreements that ensure enforcement by service providers.Custom SLAs provide access to the security infrastructure of a cloud provider. Organizations will inspect that the seller continues to comply with safety policy standards as required by industry or by government. Where that choice is open, IT and security need to cooperate in SLA negotiations. These SLAs need to build stable and compliant hybrid clouds. _________________________________________ 4. Accountability The responsibility of hybrid cloud protection is shared by organizations and vendors. Sellers are usually accountable for: System ٍٍٍٍٍSecurity: Files tracking and security incident notification. This guarantees fairness of the system and lets consumers comply with regulations.Application Security: Control management, customer-managed key encryption of data. Furthermore, confidential information must be avoided.Virtualization Security: Implementation of hypervisor security controls. This helps customers to manage operations of data centres, usage of resources and system efficiency.Network Security: Firewalls and intrusion detection are handled around the clock. Vendors will ensure the protection of the network by securing every node.In the end, the consumer must follow security measures that safeguard confidential data and avoid safety violations. Organization, before they migrate to the hybrid cloud, needs to check the protection of all cloud providers and their own internal policies. _________________________________________ 5. Reliability Most cloud suppliers look at the surface part. They have a state-of-the-art data centre, advanced management tools and outstanding credentials all wrapped together into an accessible kit. Much of this is eye-catching. However, broad list of features and all certifications for compliance are no evidence of durability in the world. To be sure a customer wants a lot more. This can actually be seen as the minimum bear, because it is conscious of regulatory requirements. Decision makers should look for sellers who not only check their certifications, but also demonstrate the ways who customers achieve and sustain their security architecture. You need to dig through the problems and forms that you have been met. Some may claim the latest security threats of hybrid cloud computing. Others may claim that these problems are due to lack of advanced IT management techniques, lack of security policy, and poor execution. However, the secret to accessing the hybrid cloud 's benefits is efficient efficiency.",2021-03-07T00:59:29.536Z,"Is a hybrid cryptographic scheme used to improve data security in the cloud? ",Quora

You can do interdisciplinary style PhDs with a security angle that will have great applicability beyond academia: embedded security with a hardware design angle and side channel, securing AI (a key issue raised by Tesla for example), develop new ways to analyze systems for exploitability (major emerging problem with all the interconnected systems/IoT), program analysis for vulnerability /exploitability mitigation (how do you know when a complex system is interacting whether it is potentially an exploit attempt), secure processors with post von Neumann designs, post quantum security (not breakable with quantum computing), using emerging technology to enhance how security is done from physical unary functions (PUF) to technologies that make it hard to reverse engineer a system, etc. These are just some examples from the top of my head that someone who starts out today could do. A PhD will give you an education (assuming you work with a world-leading advisor) that will benefit you for a lifetime. If you join a company in cyber security you will be dealing with every day security challenges and will be competing with others without an intellectual edge so to speak. Nothing wrong with it if you end up with the right organization with key experts and you can still continue to learn, but chances are that your perspective will become much more limited.",2021-03-07T01:03:42.406Z,"What bachelor’s degree should one hold in order to become a cryptographer?

Public Key Cryptography, or Asymmetric Cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: Public Key and Private Key. It is one of the most important (if not the most important) part of cryptocurrency protocols, and it is used in several places: crypto wallet creation, to ensure that crypto coins can only be spent by owners, signing of transactions (digital signature), which are the core components of cryptocurrency protocols. In short, if you send cryptocurrencies to others you sign that transaction using your private key (or signature key, which is generated using private key)  Continue ReadingPublic Key Cryptography, or Asymmetric Cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: Public Key and Private Key. It is one of the most important (if not the most important) part of cryptocurrency protocols, and it is used in several places: crypto wallet creation, to ensure that crypto coins can only be spent by owners, signing of transactions (digital signature), which are the core components of cryptocurrency protocols. In short, if you send cryptocurrencies to others you sign that transaction using your private key (or signature key, which is generated using private key) and transaction is verified using your public key. So, if hackers obtain your private key, they would be able to send your cryptocurrencies to themselves. There are a couple of algorithms to generate public and private keys. For example, Bitcoin protocol uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). In this article I am going to explain Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) and compare with ECDSA. RSA is one of the first and widely used public key cryptosystem. It is named after its founders, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman and it has become almost synonymous with public key cryptography. RSA Algorithm RSA makes extensive use of arithmetic operations using modulo-n (mod n) arithmetic. x mod n simply means the remainder of x when divided by n.For example, 17 mod 5 = 2.In general, RSA consists of three major parts (sometimes it makes sense to add public key sharing): Generate the public key and the private keyEncrypt data using generated public keyDecrypt data using generated private keyGenerate the public key and the private key To generate the public and private RSA keys, Alice or/and Bob (two fictional characters who have become the industry standard for discussions about cryptography) performs the following steps: Choose two large prime numbers, p and q. The larger the values, the more difficult it is to break RSA, but the longer it takes to perform the encoding and decoding.Compute n = pq and z = (p — 1)(q — 1).Choose a number e, less than n, that has no common factors, other than 1, with z or their greatest common divisor (gcd) equals 1, gcd(e, z) = 1. In this case, e and z are said to be relatively prime. e will be used in encryption.Find a number d, such that ed — 1 is exactly divisible by z. In another way ed mod z = 1. d will be used in decryption.The public key that Bob or Alice makes available to the world is the pair of numbers (n, e) and the private, which must be secret, is the pair of numbers (n, d).Encrypt data using generated public key Suppose Alice wants to send Bob a message, which is represented by bit pattern integer number m (plaintext message), where m < n. The encrypted vale c (ciphertext) of plaintext message m is c = m^e mod nCiphertext c will be sent to Bob. Note that Alice encrypts message using Bob’s public key. Decrypt data using generated private key To decrypt received ciphertext c Bob computes m = c^d mod n which requires use of his private key (n, d). The security of RSA relies on the fact that there are no known algorithms for quickly factoring (prime factorization) a number. In this case the public value n into p and q. RSA vs ECDSA In ECDA a private key is a randomly generated integer number. In Bitcoin protocol it is 256 bit (32 bytes) integer number. A public key is derived froma private key using elliptic curve cryptography, but not vice versa and compressed public key size is 33 bytes. Also, ECDSA can use the same algorithm using different elliptic curves to generate public key. Bitcoin protocol uses Secp256k1 and public keys are either compressed or uncompressed in RSA keys (public, private and signature) are big and key generation is slow.On the other hand, RSA is easy to implement, but ECDSA is difficult to properly implement standard. In December 2010, PlayStation 3 was hacked, because Sony did not properly implement the algorithm. This is why it is recommended to use already tested libraries like OpenSSL to generate ECDSA key pairs.About a year ago I implemented an open source library called eccpem and put on GitHub, which generates ECDSA key pairs and stores them on the .pem files using OpenSSL library. Conclusion Most of cryptocurrency protocols use ECDSA (I think it makes sense) instead of RSA. There are at least two reasons: ECDSA uses much less memory than RSA, which is important in crypto protocols.ECDSA is faster than RSA.Q: Which one is secure algorithm ?A: They both are secure for now. After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now (total volume over 120 million dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days.

Cryptology is the study of codes and codebreaking.

If you want to be a cryptographer you're going to study cryptology. Cryptography is just writing codes. Definitely important, but it's an application of cryptology rather than an exhaustive super-field in and of itself. Cryptography is definitely a big area and very involved technically, but without the greater area of cryptology to give you answers on why your code is unbreakable (e.g.: RSA is hard to break because prime factorization is prohibitively difficult) you're not seeing all of the necessary angles.  Sometimes in CS programs they just write ""cryptography"" and mean ""cryptology."" This was sort of the case in my program, but my professor (who was a NSA cryptologist prior to going back to teaching) lamented this was the case. Basically I think the delineation between ""cryptography"" and ""applied cryptography"" may be similar to the delineation between cryptology and cryptography. If that's the case...it depends.  Honestly nobody does cryptoanalytic attacks on cryptosystems unless: 1.) That cryptosystem is really fucking bad and you're a bad person for using it. I got my start in cryptography by loudly complaining during my internship at NetApp that considering using a stream cipher like RC4 was dangerous in a certain context and writing a cryptanalysis program to show how bad it was. Having situations like this are fairly rare though, as most people who use crypto are smart enough to avoid situations where undergrad CS kids can discover vulnerabilities in your architecture. 2.) You are a mathematician that works at an intelligence agency or within the DoD. I'm not one of those guys, but I do know a lot of them. And even then, when they're breaking codes, they're usually just writing programs to analyze things for them rather than going ""Imitation Game"" on something. Now should you know why doing some kinds of cryptography are worse than others? Absolutely. And answers to that lie within mathematics, and are usually not ""applied"" as they're the result of theoretical math like numerical analysis and theory of computation.  When it comes to college classes, I honestly vote that you go higher up and theoretical and work your way down. Whether we're talking about CS and programming or this, theory doesn't change that often. Applications, on the other hand, change a lot.  Your knowledge of computational mathematics and its application to cryptography is going to mean a lot more, a lot longer than knowing how to use something like Jack the Ripper to hack Windows SAM passwords.

To be clear, an accumulator is a system where it is quick to answer:“is this specific value in this specific set?”but slow or impossible to answer:“what are some of the values in this specific set?” So to do the test and prove set membership, you need to already have the encrypted description of the set, and the individual whose membership you are testing. The classic example is to have every individual have their own large prime number, and represent a set by multiplying the primes of all the members, plus a few more random distinct primes. To check if a specific person is in the set, just see if their prime can divide the value that represents the set. If it can, then it went in to making the set, and they are in it, if it can’t, they aren’t. But if you wanted a full list of everyone in the set, you’d have to factorise the product of large primes, which is slow to impossible to do. Another option would be to store a list of hashes of all the members of the set, and give each individual a personal name. If a person is in the set, then their name can be hashed to get a value in the list, and if they aren’t, it can’t. But simply having all the hashes can’t give you a list of the names of the members. There are plenty of other ways you can do this, but they all need to have essentially the same structure to work. Note that you need to have enough individuals total that someone can’t just iterate over all of them and check by brute force, or the whole thing would be pointless.",2021-03-07T01:14:48.957Z,"How do you use cryptographic accumulators to prove set membership without exposing the set or the member?

Most security problems cryptography can not solve.

Simple thing so far and simple decision to make. Even a bad or vulnerable cryptography is better than none at all. With one exception, that people tend to trust crypto. Like in the 2nd World War of 40k more than 30k young u-boat men died on the German side because of communication over the broken Enigma cipher (besides other factors that obfuscated this fact to the German high-command). But you can’t use encryption to system vulnerabilities for example. So crypto is very limited to the access of data files or streams. Once you have successful encrypted a message with a safe key and cipher, there is no efficient way to break that code without the key. Encryption, in that case, is flawless and safe and you can not transform it in a different sort of problems. If you not start thinking out of the box. I mean, you may have a super safe encryption method, you may have a flawless algorithm that implements this, you may have a super safe key that can not be guessed, still you live in a little house in the suburbs and if somebody breaks into your home, holds a pistol to your head and offers you a deal for not pulling the trigger if you give him the key, your perfect encryption is worth nothing. If you consider your life more valuable than your data, of course. Or the loss of the data would compromise people or values that you hold higher than your life. Security is a whole concept. And encryption is just a small aspect of it. So, if you encrypt data that was before that easy accessible by an attacker, the cryptography doesn’t transform the problem in any way. It just makes the attacker move and change his angle of attack and he most likely will go for the weakest link. I personally think, that to read once in your life books about warfare is a good thing to do, that will help you to understand the nature of this fight. Like many would say that The Book of Five Rings from Musashi would be a good way to start, but don’t stop there like all those brainless executives that make that to a cult. Also read The Art of War but don’t stop there either, like all our mindless executives that think of themselves of being a step further. That’s just the basement, no less than that, it’s the base of the foundation of the fundamentals of the house. Read Carl von Clausewitz “Vom Kriege”. And then go on with that and think about what you are reading and make up your own mind. I once said, that I am a code warrior and I see myself as one. Because if you are working in computer security and you are trying to fight the good fight, you have to become a warrior in all the sense of meaning. This not only means you have to understand how you fight and know of all of the tricks and trades of war, but you have to foremost know why you are fighting. And for what. What you want to achieve with that and what it is, that you are trying to defend. This may lead to some quirks in your personality, that I for my part accept as a consequence of that way of life for mine. But it is not for everyone. It means, to understand what exactly you are fighting for, you have to experience that. So you have to learn to live before you can learn to fight. You have to, if not actually executing , doing it, have to understand the depth of being a human. You have to learn and come in contacts with arts, have at least value that if not learning some form of art yourself. If you don’t understand art, you don’t understand what you are defending. I for my part, as a dedicated hacker learned to play several instruments, painting and writing. And I think I still have no idea about the real depth of this, because I only can scratch the surface of it as a person, which primary goal is to understand the technology with which I do fight this war. But I deeply understand why I fight and for what I am fighting. And I often told people to stop doing something or to withdraw from certain circles or forums, because they deeply violate what I am fighting for. I just had a friend at the phone, telling me about his problems in one of those forums I only for a short time visited and where I left as quickly, not without leaving a mark and a note of protest. He said, “Nah, I stay. That’s not so evil as you say. You may have overreacted.” It was different what he said this morning on the phone. But it doesn’t fill me with satisfaction, that I was right. I knew that I was right, but I was at that time not strong enough to argue and make my important points about this heard and understood. The warrior always is searching for the reason for a mistake at his own person. Because you are the only variable that you can change. And you have to be strong enough to admit when you have been wrong, because you can prevent other people from suffering by that. A real code warrior is a mix of warrior and monk, as I see it. There is a lot of pride in it and strength, and it is not without self-interest, but in the end you are serving a public cause. And yes, you are right. The problem of cryptography doesn’t really solve the issue, it is just a tactical move and if you have done that, you have to face the whole concept, the idea, the philosophy why in the first place you are trying to protect the data that you are protecting. To find a way to make it accessible would be a better way, to fight with water not with the sword. Like we on the Open Source community did solve the problem of copyright and license issues that in consequences were not only creating democracy eroding laws and effects, it made our own work much harder if not impossible. And with that wasn’t serving the greater goal of progress for society. So we stopped clinging on that overcome concept and let go of the urge to control it. With that we gained so much momentum, that we now can control and lead the software development. It is like a game of chess, where you sacrifice your queen in a daring move, just to win the game. And this is the art of war, the art of war of codes. It doesn’t stop with cryptography, it is just beginning there. And you have to learn to go new ways, find new ways and see over the edge of your personal horizon and you have to do everything to get over that horizon. And that means hard work and new things and life itself. Compassion and dedication and philosophy and wisdom, and aggression and violence where it is needed for defense but with love and empathy, because communites don’t build on battlefields. Communities and culture builds on a fields that are accessible for everyone and everyone gets a share who does his part. That hard work can bring you where you want without a limit that is set by authorities, until you directly come in conflict with someone else, dreaming the same dream, working for the same cause. We are not a family. We are not a nation. We are not a culture. We are more than that, but we are nothing if we don’t know the three above and respect them and understand them and understand who we are. And this is where cryptography will lead you.

Unnikrishnan Menon RSA is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm that enables public key encryption for secure data transmission.

The security of this algorithm is based on the practical difficulty of factorisation of product of 2 very large prime numbers. Multiplying 2 given prime numbers to get their product is easy.

In this algorithm, 2 sets of keys are generated (a public key and a private key). The security of this algorithm is based on the practical difficulty of factorisation of product of 2 very large prime numbers. Multiplying 2 given prime numbers to get their product is easy. But determining the original prime numbers from the product is considered an infeasible operation due to the time it would take using even today's most powerful supercomputers. This is called the factoring problem. In a nutshell this property is the trapdoor function for RSA encryption. It’s easy to go one way (multiplying the 2 prime numbers) but stupendously difficult to go the other way (figuring out the 2 prime factors given only their product). This is getting all boring. Wait… I’ll explain RSA using an example:  Let’s imagine living in a hypothetical Gotham City. For the sake of simplicity, let’s say you are the Joker, the agent of Chaos! Every fairy-tale needs a good old-fashioned villain :P So let’s say, I am Moriarty ;) Our sole purpose of existence is to cause havoc in Gotham and give Batman a hard time. We are the evil guys. Partners in crime!  Now while Batman is trying to figure out the Joker’s next move, the Joker is out there on the streets tracking each and every move of Batman and reporting them to Moriarty. It’s a battle of wits! The Joker and Moriarty are too awesome when it comes to Python Programming. They are gifted! The Joker needs to report Batman’s moves to Moriarty in a safe and secure way. The problem with sending data over any network to Moriarty is that it can be tapped by Batman. That’s when RSA encryption comes to Moriarty’s mind! The Joker could encrypt his messages using RSA algorithm and send the encrypted text over to Moriarty. Here’s how this is gonna work… There is a public key and a private key. Both of these keys will be generated by Moriarty. Here’s how Moriarty generates the Public key: Choose 22 large prime numbers pp and qq.Find n=p∗qn=p∗q. This is the first part of the public key.We also need a small exponent ee which must be an integer, not be a factor of n and satisfying 1<e<(p−1)∗(q−1)1<e<(p−1)∗(q−1).The generated public key is (n,e)(n,e).Next Moriarty generates his Private key: ϕ(n)=(p−1)∗(q−1)ϕ(n)=(p−1)∗(q−1)d=(k∗ϕ(n)+1)ed=(k∗ϕ(n)+1)eThe generated private key is (d,e)(d,e).Moriarty then broadcasts this public key on all digital billboard screens in Gotham city. He’s done this before ;)  Note: He doesn’t share his private key. He only shares his public key. The Joker looks up at the nearest screen and notes down Moriarty’s public key. Using Socket programming in Python, Moriarty codes up a python script for a Server and keeps it running.  Here’s Moriarty’s Server code… from __future__ import unicode_literals import socket from math import sqrt import random from random import randint as rand import pickle   host = socket.gethostname() port = 5000  s = socket.socket() s.bind((host, port)) s.listen(2)   def gcd(a, b):     if b == 0:         return a     else:         return gcd(b, a % b)   def mod_inverse(a, m):     for x in range(1, m):         if (a * x) % m == 1:             return x     return -1   def isprime(n):     if n < 2:         return False     elif n == 2:         return True     else:         for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):             if n % i == 0:                 return False     return True   #initial two random numbers p,q p = rand(1, 1000) q = rand(1, 1000)   def generate_keypair(p, q,keysize):     # keysize is the bit length of n so it must be in range(nMin,nMax+1).     # << is bitwise operator     # x << y is same as multiplying x by 2**y     # i am doing this so that p and q values have similar bit-length.     # this will generate an n value that's hard to factorize into p and q.       nMin = 1<<(keysize-1)     nMax = (1<<keysize) - 1     primes=[2]     # we choose two prime numbers in range(start, stop) so that the difference of bit lengths is at most 2.     start = 1<<(keysize//2-1)     stop = 1<<(keysize//2+1)      if start >= stop:         return []      for i in range(3, stop + 1, 2):         for p in primes:             if i % p == 0:                 break         else:             primes.append(i)      while(primes and primes[0] < start):         del primes[0]      #choosing p and q from the generated prime numbers.     while primes:         p = random.choice(primes)         primes.remove(p)         q_values = [q for q in primes if nMin <= p * q <= nMax]         if q_values:             q = random.choice(q_values)             break      n = p * q     phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)      #generate public key 1<e<phi(n)     e = random.randrange(1, phi)     g = gcd(e, phi)      #as long as gcd(1,phi(n)) is not 1, keep generating e     while g != 1:         e = random.randrange(1, phi)         g = gcd(e, phi)      #generate private key     d = mod_inverse(e, phi)      #public key (e,n)     #private key (d,n)      return ((e, n), (d, n))  def decrypt(msg_ciphertext, package):     d, n = package     msg_plaintext = [chr(pow(c, d, n)) for c in msg_ciphertext]     # No need to use ord() since c is now a number     # After decryption, we cast it back to character     # to be joined in a string for the final result     return (''.join(msg_plaintext))  public, private = generate_keypair(p, q, 8)   print(host) conn, address = s.accept() print(""Connected to: "" + str(address))   conn.send(str(public[0]).encode()) conn.send(str(public[1]).encode()) print(""Public Key: "",public)  while True:     encoded_data = pickle.loads(conn.recv(1024*4))     for i in range(len(encoded_data)):         encoded_data[i]=int(encoded_data[i])     if not encoded_data:         break     #print(''.join(map(lambda x: str(x), encoded_data)))     decoded_data = decrypt(encoded_data, private)     print(""Client : "" + str(decoded_data)) conn.close()  The Joker will now encrypt his message (Batman’s moves) using Moriarty’s public key that he noted down earlier from the billboard. First he converts all characters in his message to their ASCII value. The encrypted message is given by: c=(message)emod nc=(message)emod n. The Joker now codes up a python script for a Client and connects to Moriarty’s Server. He then sends his encrypted message, cc.  Here’s the Joker’s Client code:  from __future__ import unicode_literals import socket from math import sqrt import random from random import randint as rand import pickle  host = socket.gethostname() port = 5000  s = socket.socket() s.connect((host, port))   def encrypt(msg_plaintext, package):     #unpack key value pair     e, n = package     msg_ciphertext = [pow(ord(c), e, n) for c in msg_plaintext]     return msg_ciphertext  e = int(s.recv(1024).decode()) n = int(s.recv(1024).decode())  public = (e, n)  print(""Public Key: "",public)  message = input("" -> "") encrypted_msg = encrypt(message, public) #encoded_message = ''.join(map(lambda x: str(x), encrypted_msg)) encoded_data = pickle.dumps(encrypted_msg) while True:     s.send(encoded_data)     message = input("" -> "")     encrypted_msg = encrypt(message, public)     #encoded_message = ''.join(map(lambda x: str(x), encrypted_msg))     encoded_data = pickle.dumps(encrypted_msg) s.close()  Now let’s say Batman breaks into the server-client network. He’ll see the encrypted message and won’t be able to decode it. Even though Batman knows Moriarty’s public (because he saw it on his TV when Moriarty broadcasted it), he won’t be able to decode the encrypted message. For decryption, the private key is required which is under the safe custody of Moriarty himself :D The encrypted message now reaches Moriarty’s Server. He uses his private key (d,e)(d,e) which he had generated earlier. The decrypted message is given by: cdmod ncdmod n . The decrypted text will be the ASCII values of the original message. All that’s left is to convert the ASCII values to their corresponding characters!   This code was created in collaboration with Awnon Bhowmik (অনন ভৌমিক).

There are two popular approaches that focus on this task: Secure multi-party computation. This subfield focuses on creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private [1].Homomorphic encryption (HE). HE is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext [2].The idea of homomorphic encryption was firstly introduced in the 1970s. However, no practical implementation existed until Craig Gentry proposed one in his PhD thesis in 2009. Modern cryptosystems are capable of performing arbitrary computation on encrypted data - ciphertexts, facilitating the implementation of various data analysis tools. As an active area of research, there are a multitude of HE schemes that have recently been proposed and implemented as open-source libraries. The most popular ones are Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (SEAL) developed by Microsoft, Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers (HEAAN) developed by Seoul National University and Homomorphic Encryption Library (HElib) developed by IBM. However, there are a number of unsolved problems that limits applicability of HE methods. Some of these problems are more practical while the others are more theoretical. The practical problems are Slow commutation over ciphertext. This makes speeding up the computation an important task.Limited number of levels (sequentially executed operations). Hence, increasing the number of operations that are performed over cyphertext is a major problem. Every operation performed over cyphertext adds a small amount of noise, this noise eventually builds up and becomes intolerable so that the isomorphism breaks (i.e. the result obtained over ciphertext does not anymore match the result of the corresponding operations over plaintext).Limited number of basic operations. Currently, most of HE libraries and HE schemes, support only operations of multiplication and addition. This in turn limits the number of nonlinear functions that could be computed over cipthertext. In this stage only polynomials with a limited number of terms are implementable (the number of terms are limited due to (2)). One of the consequences is the inability to represent efficiently the sign function.Theoretical problems are mostly come down to The questions of what operations should be permitted to compute on ciphertext. Allowing to compute a wrong set of operations would allow to reconstruct plaintext (data) or at least to infer something about the data. A trivial example is, having a comparison operation of a ciphertext with a plaintext would make plaintext reconstruction a trivial task.Search for novel cryptographic schemas that would resolve problems 1 to 3 described above.

To that extent, you would have to basically train others to treat you in the respectful way. Yes, it's not about you doing all kinds of favors for others - it's about the right favors to the right people. You can start out by presenting yourself in the proper manner: only business clothing, a daily planner (hard copy) to take to meetings for notes and to have your schedule available at a glance, and a professional attitude.The thing about that planner is that the moment you open it, it means you are open to ideas and inputs and the meeting, and closing it symbolically means that you are done with the meeting and case is closed. It's a powerful psychological tool without being too obvious. Professional attitude is to keep everything only business-oriented - not personal, not a hint of personal things: no pictures on desk, no sentimental things, no travel pictures, nothing at all.At one of my jobs no one even knew I was married until once I asked for a day off because my child got sick and my husband was traveling at the time. You are at work to work and you are compensated based on your time talking about business - not how to make the best cookies. Avoid gossipers and do not get involved: by associating self with undesirable people, you can be labeled as one by others, and trust in your professionalism will deteriorate. If you are being pulled into gossip, just say, ""I can't be a part of this conversation"" and walk away. Read a lot of legal-type papers to enhance your vocabulary and add to your phrase collection: someone can say things better, so instead of reinventing the wheel, you can just borrow that.Treat all of your written communications as if they will be forwarded to anyone: inside and outside the company. If your email can grace front page of a major newspaper and you won't be ashamed of it, then you can hit ""Send"". Otherwise, go back and re-write it. Do not react emotionally to comments from others. Others can try their best to provoke you. You will be held liable for your reaction though. Keep in mind that you don't have to respond to every invitation to the conflict. Know the scope of your responsibilities: someone's email in your inbox means it's on their to-do list, and not on yours. Ask specifically what help is needed from you - otherwise you can either under-deliver or over-deliver. Treat your time as valuable. You can't attend every single meeting. You can't participate in every single phone call. Ask if your presence is required and what is needed from you exactly. Most of the time it will come out that the meeting is casual and the person thought that you would like to spend hours of your time in the listen-in mode.Limit your time and tell this to others.

The keys are used to decipher the text which can be 128-, 192-, or 256-bit long. The 256-bit key encrypts the data in 14 rounds, the 192-bit key in 12 rounds, and the 128-bit key in 10 rounds.

Only someone with the knowledge of these numbers will be able to decode the message successfully. RSA is often used in digital signatures but works slower when large volumes of data need to be encrypted. 3. Triple Data Encryption Standard (TripleDES) Triple Data Encryption Standard is symmetric encryption and an advanced form of the DES method that encrypts blocks of data using a 56-bit key. TripleDES applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block. TripleDES is commonly used to encrypt ATM PINs and UNIX passwords. 4. Twofish Twofish is a license-free encryption method that ciphers data blocks of 128 bits. It’s considered the successor to the Blowfish encryption method that ciphered message blocks of 64 bits. Twofish always encrypts data in 16 rounds regardless of the key size.

But that is not a satisfying answer. Another correct but equally unsatisfying answer is that a hash function takes an input that is unlimited in size and outputs a finite bitstring therefore there are infinitely many inputs that correspond to the same output. Now what if we ignore that? How do we know that there even exists a function with preimage resistance? We can look at a hash function a little differently and think of it as generating a sequence. A hash function definitely does this because it is a function from all natural numbers to another set. This is to say when you plug 0 into the hash, it gives you something then you plug 1 into the hash and it gives you something else. Now we can think of a hash function as simply reordering all the 256bit strings into an unsorted order. So in this new way of thinking of a hash function, what would a preimage attack look like? Well a preimage attack would be finding an input that corresponds with a specific output so this is analogous to finding a specific item on this massive unsorted list. The fastest algorithm that can find an element in a list that is n items long takes O(n)O(n) operations. Because the length of the list is 2n2n for n bits, the time it takes to search through that list is O(2n)O(2n) putting it firmly in the np classification. Okay, so how do we know that a specific algorithm has preimage resistance? The answer is an unsatisfying “we don’t”. In fact, we have no good way to verify preimage resistance for any of the common hash functions that we use today. There are certain properties of hash functions relating to their construction that cryptographers look at that point to “probably secure” or “probably not secure” but most of these are based on parts of old hash functions that have broken or stood the test of time. For example, Keccak was chosen as sha3 over several other algorithms in the final round not because we knew it was faster, more secure, etc; instead, it more closely resembled sha2 which has lasted a very long time under a lot of scrutiny without breaking. (side note: Keccak was also chosen because it is easy to implement in hardware allowing for speedups but this was a secondary concern) Certainly there are some hash functions that are mathematically proven to be secure. Why not use those? Sure, there are. To name a few, we have VSH, ECOH, FSB, and SWIFFT. All of these are slow, none of them are random oracles, and to top it off, none of them have all the properties of a cryptographic hash function. But this isn’t that bad, so what if none of the commonly used hash functions are provably secure? They are all probably secure and they probably will be for a very long time, that’s why we trust them with so much. In fact, whenever we say something is “provably secure” we mean we show that it is at least as hard as some other problem that we know is hard. The fact of the matter is that all of these hard problems rest on one universal problem, the boolean satisfiability problem. To quote wikipedia: There is no known algorithm that efficiently solves each SAT problem, and it is generally believed that no such algorithm exists; yet this belief has not been proven mathematically In fact, because the entirety of NP-Complete lies on the shoulders of SAT, finding an algorithm to efficiently solve SAT is equivalent to solving P vs NP. That is to say, it could be that all these “hard problems” really aren’t all that hard.",2021-03-07T01:49:00.821Z,"What is the general justification for the hardness of finding preimages for cryptographic hash functions?

However, cloud computing has presented security challenges as cloud operators store and process customer data outside the scope of existing customer security measures. Businesses and organizations must take a data-centric approach to prevent their confidential data against advanced threats in complex and evolving virtualization, cloud services, and mobility environments. Businesses must implement data security solutions that provide consistent protection of sensitive data, including data protection within the cloud through encryption and cryptographic key management. Two main cryptographic techniques used in cloud security are: Asymmetric cryptography: Same key is used for encryption and decryption also called as secret key cryptography or private key cryptography. It is much faster than asymmetric key cryptography and utilizes less resources than asymmetric key cryptography.Symmetric cryptography: Separate keys are used for encryption and decryption, one for encryption and the other for also called as Public key cryptography and it is slower because of different keys used for encryption and decryption It uses more resources than symmetric key cryptography.",2021-03-07T01:57:23.773Z,"How do I get knowledge over cryptographic techniques used in cloud security?

If you give it the same seed, you’ll get the same output. It’s “random” in the sense that knowing only the “random number” part of the output and the algorithm, it’s difficult to predict the next random number. A pseudo-random number generator is “cryptographically secure”, if it has a couple of extra properties, most notably that even if you were able to discover the seed (which lets you predict future random numbers), it wouldn’t be enough to let you figure out previously generated random numbers. That’s a tighter constraint on the problem, and makes a CSPRNG a somewhat more complicated than PRNGs that aren’t cryptographically secure. The actual process is pretty well documented with the various algorithms, and I suggest you look to Wikipedia as a starting point if you want more thorough details, but the basic idea is just what I described above. You use a function that’s (provably) difficult to invert. Let’s break down the term “cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator”. A pseudo-random number generator is a function.

The term “random” simply asserts that there is no way to predict the next value. That is, outside of having a probability density function (PDF). In practice, you can’t produce truly random numbers using a deterministic algorithm, but you can produce a series of numbers for which there is no “simple” way to predict the next number. Obviously, “simple” is not a well-defined term, and you can always just re-run the algorithm to perfectly predict the next values. This is why such series are called “psuedo-random”. In practice there are many many psuedo-random number generators. Such generators are divided into algorithm families with similar properties. Within each family you can often enumerate the generators with a number called a “seed”. And for “good” algorithms, knowing the series of numbers produced with one seed will not help you predict the series generated from another seed. With that, we can finally answer the OP’s question: There is no such thing as a “random seed”, since a seed is just a single number. But if you choose a “good” algorithm, then all you need to do is pick a seed that is different from previous runs and you will generate a “completely different” pseudo-random series, in the sense that you can’t “easily” use the previous series to predict the next values of the current one. At least not any better than knowing its PDF. Ideally, you could simply enumerate the seeds (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4…). Unfortunately, in practice, many available algorithms are not “good” in that they have a set of “bad seeds” (e.g. seed=0), for which the pseudo-random series they produce are not random, or that similar seeds produce correlated series. In such cases you should be aware algorithm the limitations and follow the documented work-arounds to mitigate these limitations.

Hardy in a short but now classic book called “A Mathematician’s Apology”. Hardy was for most of life a chaired professor at Trinity College, University of Cambridge. Besides his scholarly work and his books, Hardy is most famous for his collaboration with the Indian wunderkind Ramanujan. The story of their meeting has been told in many a book and movie, but I especially like Robert Kanigel’s book “The Man who Knew Infinity”. I spent a few years of my life in Ramanujan’s home town, and Kanigel’s portrayal in the book is so accurate, it literally took me back four decades in time so I could remember the smell of the temples and the bustle in the streets. Hardy’s ode to pure math is unlike anything else you’ve read on Quora. He didn’t justify pure math because it’s useful — which is obvious to anyone who sees its impact on physics or even computer science — but rather as a spiritual exercise that uplifted man. Just as we cherish poetry — not because it makes us rich or makes practical things — Hardy argues we should appreciate the pure mathematician as a creator of patterns of the highest order. When you read a great poem, like Robert Frost’s “Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening”, whose last lines read: “The woods are lovely, dark and deep But I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep And miles to go before I sleep” it evokes in us images and feelings that only great poetry can induce. These four lines to me say more about what it means to be human than most books could. Similarly, Hardy argued great math ennobles our spirit and allows us to revel in a spiritual way about patterns that seem almost mystical in their beauty. No one embodied this spirit more than Ramanujan, who was almost completely self taught. I have in my house a facsimile bound edition of his famous Lost Notebooks. Glancing through them, I sense a little bit of the awe that Hardy and Littlewood, Hardy’s longtime collaborator at Cambridge, must have felt when they first read through Ramanujan’s original letter, chock filled with impossible looking results. Hardy instantly knew that Ramanujan was a once in a millennium discovery. As he later put it, the alternative being that Ramanujan was a fake capable of deceiving two of the best mathematical minds in Britain, was even more unlikely, hence Ramanujan was clearly genuine. One of the more entertaining stories of Hardy’s dislike of applied math came about when he almost casually solved at High Table dinner at Trinity — an ornate affair — one of the deepest mysteries of natural selection. The resulting theorem is now called the Hardy Weinberg theorem, but Hardy refused to take any credit for it until the day he died. The great puzzle of evolution is why — when successive generations inherit the genetic endowment from mother and father — the genome does not converge to some fixed distribution. If you imagine each generation as multiplication by some random mixing distribution, it seems that the random walk must converge as the diversity in the population reduces. Why does evolution preserve diversity? Hardy heard this problem over dinner and with a few doodles in his napkin, worked out the reason. Anyone else would have been proud to have his name associated with one of the cornerstone theoretical results in the theory of evolution. Not Hardy. He refused to have anything to do with it, and never acknowledged the work as his. The idea that he had accidentally produced something of value to society revolted him. Such was his love of pure math. As I look back on my three decade career in AI and machine learning, the happiest memories are the times I spent over long winter nights deeply immersed in some abstract math book, struggling to understand some concept. When, all of a sudden, understanding dawns, and I grasp and climb one more step on the infinite ladder that comprises pure math, it’s a sensation that is almost deeply religious. I’m not particularly religious myself, but I can sense through pure math what those of deeper faith than me possibly experience in a church, mosque, or temple. Ultimately, we are all on earth only for a brief flash of time, nanoseconds really when compared to the vastness of time. Our only glimpse of true immortality comes when we feel a tiny sliver of what is eternal, truths that will be unchanged for all time. Presidents come and go, countries are created and destroyed, solar systems come into existence and fade away as the star’s energy reserves are depleted, heck, even galaxies eventually fade into the void, perhaps into some black hole, perhaps our own universe — one of many possible mulitiverses — will not be around forever. It’s comforting to know in such a situation that prime numbers will exist for all eternity, and the theoretical result that every natural number can be decomposed uniquely as a product of primes will remain true till the end of time.",2021-03-07T02:32:09.154Z,"What is the point of pure mathematics?

If you are interested in biology, there is Biohaskell, and a whole bunch of different uses of Haskell for bioinformatics. If you care about computational linguistics, there is the Grammatical Framework, the Geni surface realizer (http://kowey.github.io/GenI/), tools for functonal morphology (http://www.cse.chalmers.se/alumni/markus/), even a book on Natural Language Processing for the Working Programmer in Haskell. EDSLs and tools exist in Haskell for working with cryptographic protocols, such as John Ramsdell's Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cpsa). Other cryptographic tools exist, such Galois' Cryptol, which is used to verify cryptographic protocols and design netlists that you can use to turn them to silicon. Speaking of silicon, Bluespec ships a modified Haskell compiler that they use to generate netlists for chips. Drilling down into this space, we have several EDSLs for working with SAT and SMT solvers that can be quite useful for generating code for other disciplines. Back to Galois, another Galois project, Passage, provides ""Parallel code generation for hierarchical Bayesian modeling"" and serves as a Haskell front end to STAN, and can be used for generating complicated Bayesian models. Other EDSLs for probabilistic programming and Bayesian modeling also exist, such as Hal Daumé III's Hierarchical Bayes Compiler. My automatic differentiation package gets used in computer vision and motion planning for robotics, risk assessment, and also in computing the derivatives for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling for these kinds of Bayesian models. Anthony Cowley gave a very eloquent case for the use of Haskell in robotics, backed up by lots of elbow grease and examples in his talk ""Abstractions for the Functional Roboticist"". Hitting Galois _again_ we find their Copilot EDSL for generating code for hard realtime environments.  Drifting back to Bayesian tools, Tom Neilsen's work on bugpan (that led to his more recent work on BayesHive) has been used for describing, conducting, and measuring experiments in neuroscience (braincurry). There is a lot going on in the Haskell community. These are just the major highlights of projects that leap to mind when I think about folks working on ""science"" in Haskell in the public sphere.

This means that if your neighbor wasn’t getting stock quotes, VSNL had to dig up roads and lay a physical line to your door. It might take months to get that service started. And VSNL wouldn’t go beyond areas of Bombay. Like, if you lived in Colaba, you might get the quotes, but no service Dadar/Worli and beyond. That’s why all the traders had offices in South Bombay. However, there was a big market for day traders. There are lot of people in Bombay who were interested in the stock market. They would call in to their trader located in South Bombay to get quotes and place trades. One of the problems that the traders had that they had to field lot of calls from people interested in day trading. My employer was a financial magazine located in Central Bombay, and we had an office in South Bombay that had some reporters and data entry operators. We had got the real time stocks from BSE, and we would collect them and publish them in the monthly magazine. Also, we had a software product that was an electronic version of the magazine. Subscribers got detailed information about the fundamentals of the companies in the software. We would publish updates to data in floppy disks to select subscribers. One day I got interested in understanding how we get our data, and started talking to the BA. He explained me all about how we get data from BSE, and he mentioned “It would be so awesome if we can get the real time quotes to everyone”. I said “Why don’t we just broadcast it over the internet” “The internet?” “Yeah, you know how we dial into VSNL and open web pages. We could make an app that get stock quotes when the computer is dialed into VSNL” “I don’t believe it” “Let me show it to you” So, I made a quick POC. It was a simple client-server program. The server sat in our SOuth Bombay office hooked up to the hard line that we got from BSE. The client sat in our Kurla office. It was a simple socket connection between the 2 and the first version just printed out stock quotes as it received. The BA’s jaw hit the floor. Then I got to work, and made a multi user version that looked much better with more features. We showed it to our MD and Asst MD. Asst MD couldn’t believe it. She asked me “This is real” “Yes, this is real” “you aren’t just playing some animation or anything right” “No No.. See you can change which stocks you want to see”. Technically, it wasn’t rocket science, but the business impact was huge. I know it doesn’t sound that awesome now. The idea that we could sell stock quotes to anyone who lived in a metro area in India was huge. The company more or less transformed itself from being a financial magazine to developing software products. The design was a piece of crap too. The server tapped out when it had like 20–30 clients. We had to keep buying servers. After I left the job, they hired someone who rewrote the whole thing to work over HTTP. It doesn’t matter.

Of course this wouldn’t necessarily make a lot of sense for the business, but the fact that the possibility is there made many people rather uncomfortable. Ripple decided to try to stop people from having these concerns by “locking” their coins away from themselves. They made a public announcement stating: “Today we are permanently removing that uncertainty by committing to place 55 billion XRP into a cryptographically-secured escrow account by the end of 2017. By securing the lion’s share of our XRP, investors can now mathematically verify the maximum supply of XRP that can enter the market.” They in detail explained how this is going to work in this article. The common assumption of the reason they originally decided to hold on to so many of their own assets is so that they would be able to control the fluctuation of the currency. This seemed to work out for now, but whenever there was a case of heavy centralization of a cryptocurrency, it usually didn’t end up with shining colors.

The Poles also developed a ‘Bomba’ which was a mechanical device for testing Enigma keys. A technical description of the Polish bomba arrived in England on August 16th 1939, just three weeks before Turing came to Bletchley. Turing immediately understood that the Polish bomba helped to identify keys by asking whether the enciphered message keys of the cryptogram were consistent with the unknown basic settings that were wanted. The bomba rejected the thousands of inconsistencies and left only the few (relatively) non contradictory situations which could then be tested to see whether their settings yielded German when applied to the intercepts. Turing took a giant leap forward. A basic technique of cryptanalysis has been that of the probable word. The cryptanalyst guesses that a particular word or phrase exists in the plaintext of a cryptogram and uses this as a ‘wedge’ to recover the full text and perhaps even the key. The British called these ‘cribs’. The Poles had used this method to a limited extent before they had their bomba, and were using basic pen and paper methods, but Turing endowed it with considerable power. He took a probable word or phrase (crib) and matched it to a portion of an intercept before testing whether any rotor position allowed such an encipherment. Turing moved from speeding the recovery of keys by finding non contradictory links between the known and assumed keys, to speeding the recovery of keys by finding non contradictory links between assumed plaintext and assumed keys. This was his major contribution to the breaking of Enigma. Turing’s Bombe worked by a different method to the Polish machines. It added a test register, a set of twenty six relays, to the multiplicity of Enigma replicas. At each of the successive rotor positions the bombe was running through, this test register looked at the output voltage at each of the twenty six points equivalent to the output lights on Enigma’s illuminated output panel. Two conditions, voltage appearing at all twenty six points, or all but one, represented a non contradiction between the assumed plaintext and that particular position of the rotors. It represented a possible key and this would be tested to see if it produced German plaintext. If it didn’t it was back to square one, the bombe would be restarted. Of course many others made significant contributions. Welchmann with his diagonal board being a prime example. We’ll unfairly gloss over his contribution in this reply by writing that his understanding that the Enigma settings were reciprocal (for any given set up) meant that his rather complicated looking diagonal board greatly reduced the number of false stops for the bombes and thus the number of possible keys to be tested. It too was an important contribution. Anything that reduced the number of possible keys to be tested reduced the time for a solution. Welchmann also re-invented the Poles’ Zygalski sheets (which were unknown to him). These perforated sheets, which further narrowed down the possible rotor and ring settings were called Jeffreys sheets, after John Jeffreys who prepared them.

Thus, your password is encrypted at rest (via cryptographic hash) and encrypted in motion (via TLS tunnel between your machines), but NOT encrypted in use. There be dragons there. In other words, if Facebook wanted to (and they don't -- because they don't want to make that list of companies with horrible security like Adobe, Yahoo, or big parts of the US govt), or if they had a bug, they could still accidentally save or leak your password (i.e., saving it to disk in a log file, as Ridhish Guhan suggested), or just have it stolen from memory before they hash it with a security bug like Heartbleed that leaks server memory (including passwords and TLS keys). Also, the encrypted tunnel itself (SSL/TLS) could be leaky in minor or very bad ways, as it has been several times in the last few years, or your government forges Facebook's server certificate in order to proxy your communications without you being aware. (hello, Iran.) Or your browser could have a trojan (browser extension) that's recording every keystroke (these are rather common), or your operating system could be attacked, or a million other things can go wrong. But wait, there's more! Timing Attacks involve guessing your password remotely by timing how long it takes the server to check each character of your password. (and even that page doesn't cover all the risks.) That sounds imprecise, tricky, and hackish, but it's much easier than it sounds -- and they don't even require server side access or breaking into the TLS tunnel. (You just have to do them one at a time.. sometimes not even that.. and guess the username)! Timing attacks are simply devastating because most usernames are guessable, and even most security-oriented programmers mistakenly believe that they're really hard to pull off (or don't even realize they exist) and then they do things like if hashed(password) == storedpassword, which in most languages is extremely vulnerable to timing attacks. Even worse, far too many hashing algorithms get the hashing algorithm right and then unhelpfully provide comparison functions that are not hardened against timing attacks. In each case, all you need is a username to get started. Using a different password for each site, or, at minimum, for the sites that have data on you, is STILL best practice and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

CRC helps to find data corruption in every few bytes so that they can be immediately corrected (using error correction calculation) or the bytes can be re-read or re-transmitted immediately. So, there is no use of doing one CRC on MBs/GBs of data because the remainder operation is very very easily repeatable. Hash Hash operations are much more complicated and they have very high distributions. Even a single letter hashed will produce a unique hash. And every additional letter hashed will transform the hash radically. And even after millions of letters hashed consecutively, the resulting hash will be transformed radically and still be unique for that sequence of letters/data. Hashing is comparatively costly. So, it cannot be used often for every few characters to immediately detect errors. But, its strength lies in its uniqueness. It can be used to pretty much guarantee that the entire sequence of several MBs/GBs is unique and unaltered - because even if a single byte changes, the hash will turn out different. Also, if you have selected a particular hashing function, it is so reliable that you can discard the original data and only verify the hash for a match. For example, nowadays passwords are not stored in servers - only their hashes are stored. But, this uniqueness also means that sometimes (for small snippets of data) it can be possible to reverse engineer the data from the hash. There will usually be no de-hashing function. But an index can be built by hashing all possible combinations, and then the hash can be searched in that index for a match. Note People sometimes confuse hashing with encryption. Encryption’s purpose is to obfuscate data - but always to make it easy to recover the data if the password/key is known. Hashing’s purpose is to uniquely obfuscate data and make a tiny reliable hash - so that uniqueness or match can be checked but data would not be retrievable.

Public key on the other hand, can be shared with others. Anyone who knows your public key can send you bitcoins. Talking about bitcoins, you’d usually work with addresses instead of a public key (IP addresses and email can also be used on some clients). Address can be generated from a known public key and funds are transferred to addresses, not to public key itself. Going back to the question, There can be two reasons for this to happen. (More likely) You have imported a public key into your wallet. Public key can only be used to view transactions or receive bitcoins to that specific public key hash. You can’t spend funds from a wallet unless you have it’s private key. Solution: import private key belonging to the wallet that you want to spend from.(Less likely) You’re trying to spend newly generated coins. Solution: you’ll have to wait for 100 confirmations before spending newly generated coins. It usually takes about 16–20 hours depending on the network.If this answer helped you, please consider upvoting it.
