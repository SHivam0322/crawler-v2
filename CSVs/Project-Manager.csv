Decision - Quit the job and started an edtech company. Why? Now or Never - Always wanted to have my own business.

Details below* What do I do today? Employed again, with obviously a higher salary.Visiting professor for Entrepreneurship - Indian Institute of Management IndoreLooking for the next startup idea all the time, have so much more clarity around what I would want to do.What was my experience like? Best time (torture) of my life. It wasn’t easy but it was the best thing I did.I think I learnt enough that I know what I don’t want to do in my next startup. That’s super valuable to my mindMoney was tight, but I survived. Largely, coz of an awesome support system.Your career is not your job. Your career is you, and you are the sum of your experiences. Start Up experience takes you to the next level. There are enough people who value that. Provided you know your shit.Teaching is a super enriching thing. Something I could manage to do coz of my startup experience.*Startup details Totsmart Education - Making Education personalized for kids.

Decided to shut down the digital business and focus only of the profitable Books publishing business.Business is running successfully without my involvement. I am free to pursue other opportunitiesAccepted Totsmart as an awesome Small Business, even though it was a failed $Bn idea. See some learnings belowPearls of wisdom Be clear, Small business or a Unicorn - Why did I quit? It became clear to me that I would end up making a very very successful Small business (Rs 5–10Cr revenue) but likely will not reach ~Rs 100 Cr mark in 10 years’ time. Did I want that? No. Will you want that? May be.Small-Medium business is one which is self reliant (No equity investment) and the founder owns the company & makes a handsome salary. Has a circle of loyal employees to run the show. Eg - CA firm, A doctor who has started his Nursing home, an importer who goes to China every month and then wholesales his goods etc.Unicorn - Startups that have the potential to become $1Bn businesses, likely rely on venture capital, grow exponentially and create new categories/jobs. Founder often starts but later on needs a management team to run the business. Eg - Flipkart, Inmobi etc.3 variables - Desire - Competence - MarketDesire - What you want to do or like doingCompetence - What I can do? In my case - I couldn’t code a mobile app by myself. I could create mockups, plan features, learn editing softwares and create creative assets…but I needed someone to bring it all together and make it work. So, if I want to create a kick-ass mobile App, I am starting on the back foot. I would rather secure a high quality App developer before saying my company is competent in the area.Market - What you are making, is there someone ready to pay for it?For a successful business, you need all three. You can not hope to create a successful business if you don’t like your new life and your sector. You live that life for 100 hrs a week and hating it just won’t cut it. Without competence you’ll just be wasting time or creating something which will be crap! Last part is often tricky. Founders believe their view of the problem statement/market is true. Product Market fit is what decides whether there is anything in the business or no.Passion & PerseveranceFor a startup founder, facing rejection is a daily routine. Whether it is prospective employees, investors or clients, Yes’ are much rarer vs the No’s.In the face of that adversity, if the Founder gives into the pressure then there is no one else to drive the business forward. Come what may, there is only one direction for the Founder to move - Forward! That is where perseverance comes in. And perseverance alone doesn’t do justice. There has to be some passion about the opportunity/idea driving that perseverance.90% Admin - Media presents a very glorified view of an Entrepreneurs life. Let me assure there is lot more that they either don’t know or don’t share. If you have worked with an MNC, it is highly likely that all your admin requirements would have been taken care of - Office, stationary, coffee, food, taxes, even commute, communication, VC, hiring, firing, salary, regulatory requirements etc. All the MNC expects you to do is excel in your work and do it as best as you can.As a startup founder - Since there is no support and you are often operating with a cash crunch, these admin things that you used to take for granted now consume a huge proportion of you work day. If there is anything broken, you calculate the no of hours your employees are not working. You prioritize fixing that issue and reprioritize your own work. Next, there is something else that comes about. Cycle just goes on an on. My most productive work hours used to be 8–10 am & 7–10 pm, before & after admin issues started.Team - Tech Co-Founder - The most difficult part in Entrepreneurship is building a team. And if you are looking for a tech Co-Founder, the challenge becomes even harderNo Unicorn startup was built by ordinary people, and no extraordinary people work for strangers and without money.Only way you can hire a rockstar employee is if there is mutual trust or you are able to sell your vision. Trust comes if you know each other and hence its best to dip into your network. Selling your vision is super important but not as easy. Every one has their own life, dependencies and financial requirements, coz of which they may share the vision but may not be able to commit.Read my experience with finding a Tech Co-FounderWork life harmony - At P&G we used to have a concept of Work Life Balance, company used to encourage us to take care of our personal life. 40 hr work weeks were a norm and maintaining a healthy personal life was considered to be super important for professional success. I used to hate working over the weekends and they were reserved for Sports and going out. Then I decided to start up-I realized if I am not completing my tasks, there is no one coming after me, there is no appraisal waiting to be screwed. Its just my life, my career and the salaries that I need to pay. So what should I do? Sleep that extra hr or play that game of squash or god damn work? Answer was obvious. I never felt any pain. Though, my family sure did.Later on, while reading Jeff Bezos autobiography, I realized the term is called Work Life Harmony.Support system - If there is one thing that can make or break an Entrepreneurial venture, its the Founders’ support system. Founder can fight all the rejection around him, but can’t handle the same at home as well. Its not only super critical for the family members to support the Founder, but also important to reduce his financial obligations as much as possible. In absence of that it just becomes that much more difficult.I was super lucky to have my father who allowed me to leverage all his existing infrastructure, which meant I could straight away try to fly the plane vs building the run way. At home, my wife never let any financial crunch bother me. I had to only worry about funding my business, not worry about putting food at the table. Plus, obviously you need everyone to understand the 14 hr/day schedule and live with it.You learn about people, startup experience tells you a lot about people. You meet with lot many people. Not saying whether they are good or bad, you just learn to know where to put them and deal accordingly.Your Acquaintances - No of people who congratulated me when I decided to start up was astonishing. It never made sense to me. Deciding to write the JEE/GMAT doesn’t mean the same as getting selected for IIT/Stanford. But your acquaintances who have no visibility into your life, besides occasional social media post view, think you have arrived. I have seen so many startup founders getting carried away with those compliments.Coffee break Entrepreneurs - Then there are those smart ones. Who have never started up, but they are experts. I call them coffee break entrepreneurs who have solid suggestions for every business problem. Good to take relevant intros (to people you may want to reach out to) but not to listen further. There are tonnes of them at QuoraStartup Experts - As a Founder, you are bound to attend lot of startup events & visit/subscribe to Entrepreneurship related content. Every now & then you will come across these experts. People who project themselves as experts/investors. In reality a huge majority of them don’t have any clue about what running a startup entails. When someone goes out of job, the easiest thing is to become a mentor/advisor. Use your judgement when dealing with these experts or else you will be spending too much time on immaterial things.Mentors - Amongst all the clutter, you need people who can guide you. You’d be super lucky if have some successful Startup founders in your network (You should define “Success” yourself). They would have most likely seen the entire journey and would know many relevant folks. Plus, they’d be able to guide you on things that matter. Always, maintain a good relationship with them and value their perspective. Huge majority of them are always keen on giving back to young entrepreneurs.Every experience is a good experience coz it makes you more experienced - More so if the experience is of running a startup. My startup journey taught me a lot, made me see things from a different pov, made me put my work ahead of everything else, made me a better person and obviously was super fun while it lasted. I was glad when I decided to start looking for a job, there were people who valued what I had done. People were willing to look at me as someone who had the guts to put his career at stake coz he believed in something. As someone who was willing take such a big risk even if the odds of success were low. And above all as someone who knows how a business is run and is not just worried about his 8hr shift. I feel, my startup stint has made me a better man.Entrepreneurship 101Do Homework, don’t assume - Please do your market research fully to understand the Startup Matrix. DO NOT assume things.Sector nuances - Don’t assume you will be able to do exact same things in Travel as the Bansal’s did in Flipkart. Each sector is different. Know your sectorTeam - Please know what is the critical skillset you need to get your company off the ground. Get that skillset before you start.Financial planning (cash flow) - Ensure you’ll be able to survive the cash crunch. Plan for 18 months and then multiply by 3 or 5. Save that much.Evaluate your competition - “I don’t have competition” means you don’t know anything.Market sizing - Don’t assume, conservatively speaking, you will take 1% of the total $200Bn market. If it was that easy, everyone would do it. Make the market estimation REAL.Peer Pressure - Accept it. You will not have free time for a game of Squash, holidays will be much fewer, international holidays won’t be possible…while your peers will do all these you will have to focus elsewhere. Accept it before you take the leap of faith.",2021-03-05T08:22:51.551Z,"Have you ever left a high-paying job to pursue entrepreneurship? ",Quora

At first, I thought interior design would be easy for me since I have so much passion in drawing and design, turned out it didn’t easy as I expected. I’ll tell you about what makes it hard; both for being the interior student and being the interior designer. Interior design is fun. We play with colors, shapes, fabric, textiles, etc everyday. It wouldn’t be as stressful as we learn math or physics (I personally hate counting and formulas). But what makes it hard, and a bit stressful, is because of its much of tasks and assignments. There could be assignment everyday in a row; made a layout (I hate the manual drawing, digital drawing is fine). And the paper size is made me crazy, it’s in an A1 paper (guess what it’s sometimes in almost A0 paper!) for each layout (layout furniture, floor plan, ceiling plan, section, special furniture, perspective, etc etc!) and they’re manually drawing and also some of them need to be rendered by pencil color/watercolor. And we should do it all alone by ourselves.  The trial wasn’t finished there.. The final is we should make a maquette of the design we made. And it costs quite expensive for the material. The smaller the scale, the easier we can build. It’s easy to build a wall in a maquette, what’s hard is to make the furniture complete with its texture. Actually we can easily buy the furniture, but it will be much cheaper if we made it by ourselves (but it’ll drain our time and energy). And another final task after maquette is make a material scheme. This is my favorite among all of the tasks!   After graduating from Interior major, the struggle begins. We are officially an interior designer! Because I haven’t graduated yet, I don’t know how it feels to be a real interior designers but I expect the work will be easier because we work as a team. Each person has their own job. But the hard thing about being a designer is maybe how to deal with the clients.  We need to learn very deep about the place we want to build and the client who needs our help. And the problem is the taste of every person is relative. Maybe for A, our design is good, but B thinks it is weird. That’s why we need to have a good communication and be patient with our clients. Well my answer is very long, finally I found this kind of question for me to answer and express and also share my experiences! :) But I didn’t mean to scare you if you are interested in interior design, it’s a very fun major! Actually, it depends on the person. But basically, yes it is hard (even the smartest student in my class said it is hard and stressful but he made it!) And there is nothing easy. But if you happy and fun while working with it, you’ll enjoy doing every single of your work even you have lack of sleep and skip your meal a lot. Because I do, and also all of my fellow friends in interior design at college enjoy it too. So good luck to you! Edit: NOTES: Because so many said that I might be scare you to learn interior design and some thought that interior design is not as hard as I explained, this is just based on my personal experience studying in my college and the clients I’ve worked with.. and hard/difficult or not interior design is, it is relative & depends on you :) As an interior design student that has been struggling for 3 years, I’d like to say yes it is.

For the most part, they work alone, or with a small team of fellow lawyers if they’re part of a firm. For introverts like INTJs, this is the best possible arrangement: working alone or in small groups, only appearing in public when it comes time to dispense their expertise. 2. Consultant.

Lawyer. For the most part, they work alone, or with a small team of fellow lawyers if they’re part of a firm. For introverts like INTJs, this is the best possible arrangement: working alone or in small groups, only appearing in public when it comes time to dispense their expertise. 2. Consultant. Same deal as the lawyer. The INTJ consultant gets to hide themselves away in an office or classroom for years, learning all they need to know about their chosen topic, and then suddenly burst forth, frothing over with expertise and insider knowledge, dispensing it to those who are willing to pay them well for their services. I would add the following careers to that list: 3. Teacher. One thing INTJs like (or at least I like) is dispensing their expertise. They’re not extroverts, so classroom settings can disagree with them, but speaking for myself, I found I was able to become an extrovert for a few hours a day when I worked as a teacher. In exchange, I was able to educate and instruct the young in the vagaries of subjects I dearly adored: English, and occasionally history, politics, culture, and mythology. Really, any profession that allows an INTJ to pursue their geeky interests and dispense their stored-up knowledge is a good profession. 4. Scientist. INTJs are highly rational and analytical people. There’s no career better suited to them than that of a scientist—a person of esoteric interests, working singly or with a small group in a cloistered laboratory, plumbing the mysteries of the universe with strategic application of the scientific method and their own considerable brainpower, gaining fame and acclaim for their groundbreaking discoveries and theories. INTJ heaven, in other words. 5. Engineer. Same principle as the scientist, really. INTJs like nothing better than sequestering themselves in a secluded place and putting their considerable brainpower to work on a sticky problem, and that’s exactly what an engineer’s job description is: solving problems with brainpower. 6. Architect. Hell, on 16personalities.com, INTJs are referred to as “architects.” This works on largely the same principle as careers in science or engineering. The INTJ architect can hole up in his or her studio, put his or her amazing brain to work on designing a building from scratch, and employ their obsessive attention to detail and relentless perfectionism to their fullest. The result may not be the prettiest building, but you better believe it’ll be sensibly structured and utilitarian. 7. Writer. What’s more introverted than writing? I’m an INTJ writer myself, and it’s a career match made in heaven. I get to sit here, in private, and dream up my little worlds inside my head, and then I publish them and you (the public) read them and adore them. That’s hog heaven for an INTJ. The writer career path stimulates all four initials of the INTJ’s type indicator: “I” (introverted), “N” (intuitive), “T” (thinking), and “J” (judging). The only problems INTJ writers may have are these: they may spend too much time obsessively planning a book and never getting around to writing it; they may write characters that are intensely rational, but are boring as hell because they are not emotional (INTJs don’t understand emotions, generally); and, should their work be rejected, INTJs may fly into a narcissistic rage. “What do you MEAN my work isn’t publishable? I STROVE for YEARS to create the PERFECT NOVEL, and now you REJECT it, you pathetic ape?!” 8. Judge. INTJs are Thinking Judgers, meaning that they make decisions based on reason, not emotion, and like to make plans rather than wing it. You can bet that an INTJ judge will already be familiar with all the facts of a criminal case before they ever hear the defendant’s attorney open his or her mouth, and based on the jury’s verdict, they will make a ruling that is cold, calculating, and logical. You can expect nothing but the purest justice (as the INTJ sees it) from an INTJ judge. 9. Private investigator. As we’ve seen, INTJs prefer to work alone, and they love a good intellectual challenge. P.I. work is tailor-made for that sort of lifestyle. An INTJ private investigator would go to any lengths to make sure that their client gets the full facts of the case and is satisfied with the results of the investigation. Their obsessive attention to detail, infinite patience, and unwillingness to move until conditions are perfect serves them well in investigation work. 10. Hitman. Works kind of the same way as a private investigator, really. INTJs are patient, analytical loners who have nothing but contempt for organized structures and rules. Sounds just like a hitman, doesn’t it? An INTJ assassin would be choosy, turning down jobs on marks they felt didn’t deserve death (again, highly developed sense of justice…see what I wrote under “Judge” above). And yet, despite having contempt for society’s laws and structures, you can expect an INTJ hitman to have plenty of his own: a set of rules he lives by, a stringent code, a complete and definite set of conditions a potential mark must satisfy before he or she qualifies for assassination. And as always, you can expect obsessive attention to detail and a relentless perfectionism from an INTJ assassin. Expect this person to have a gun, a backup gun, a backup gun for the backup gun, a knife, and a backup knife. And probably some other tricks up their sleeve, too. And about five getaway vehicles, and a dozen passports. Plans on top of plans on top of plans.",2021-03-05T08:25:53.770Z,"What are the most suitable career options for an INTJ personality type?

No experience is required for entry-level jobs; however, 2 to 5 years of experience may be required for more advanced roles. Voluntary certification from software developers is available. Key skills include artistic ability; creativity; communication, coordination, critical thinking and time-management skills; and the ability to visualize artistic concepts and use computer imaging and editing software. Step 1: Learn to Draw Carry a sketchbook. Drawing practice outside the classroom is an opportunity to work with diverse subjects and learn observation skills. Having a sketchbook available also provides the means to practice drawing as often and as much as possible.Step 2: Earn a Bachelor's Degree Earning a bachelor's degree in animation can prepare students for a career in media arts, illustration, Web design, film and television. Students take fundamental courses in drawing, graphics, storyboarding, character motion and art design. Students build on these skills with practice in conceptualization, texturing and digital cinematography. Advanced training includes the use of animation computer software programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, After Effects and Maya. Step 3: Put Together a Demo Reel While in school, students usually create a portfolio, DVD or website to showcase their best work. Some educational programs feature a senior project for students to demonstrate their creativity, artistry and proficiency in various software programs. A portfolio or demo reel can also incorporate independent work done outside of school. When looking for employment opportunities, recent graduates will submit their demo reel for open positions. Success Tip: Focus on a main interest. An animation designer can work in many different industries, so it's best to gear demo reels and portfolios to the career of choice. For example, a demo reel for cartoon animation could contain entertaining characters and creative stories.Step 4: Consider Industry Certification Earning a certification can be a good way to stand out, as only a bachelor's degree is required for senior animator positions, according to job postings. Certifications in this career field are typically offered by software publishers, such as Adobe. Professionals can validate their proficiency in using animation technology by becoming an Adobe Certified Expert. Applicable software programs that animation designers can become certified in include Adobe Flash, Illustrator and After Effects. Animation designers should have a bachelor's degree in animation, must learn to draw and put together a demo reel in order to find employment.

Interacts with project partner and principal.9. Interacts with primary technical client representative. 10. Determines adjustments in project schedule, approach and budget Analysis of Differences in Roles Clearly there are significant additional functions an engagement manager performs over and above those of an associate consultant. Often an individual phases into the role by serving as a team leader on engagements. The difficulty and success of an associate moving into an engagement manager role depend on several factors, including the experience of the individual, capabilities, and interests in technical and management tasks. When I moved from an individual associate to a project manager role, it was a phased move; and was impacted by other events. For example, I served as a team leader on two projects, with responsibility for leading the project team’s efforts in a particular project segment. On my first PM role, I inherited the positions when the previous project manager resigned. I seemed to have a natural interest and ability as a project manager. I was already developing a fairly strong passion for consulting, and the engagement manager role was an important step to advance in the firm and the profession. Another significant change in my consulting management experience was in moving from managing a project with 2-5 people to one with 12 or more staff. There were several differences, including span of control issues. In a project team of 12 people, one could not oversee the entire team by himself or herself. Instead he or she had to learn to delegate properly as well as to organize a project around several sub-teams with team leaders. For me this was a bigger change than going from an associate consultant to a project manager role. Since I had a passion for consulting and also skills in organization and management tasks, the transition to scaling up the project size went quite well. But it doesn’t go smoothly for everyone. Not every consultant has the interest or abilities in the management roles consultants need to assume to advance in the field.",2021-03-05T08:27:28.430Z,"What is it like going from being an associate to a manager?

6041ebaaed76476feda194e8,https://www.quora.com/What-should-be-the-Skills-of-a-Project-Manager-for-a-new-Project?-,"1.Leadership Project leadership was a hot topic this year. Being able to lead your team as well as manage them is a trend that shows no sign of abating (and that’s a good thing). It’s really important to be able to inspire others, set the vision and lead effectively, so if that’s not your strong point resolve to work on it now. 2. Negotiation It would be lovely if everyone did what was best for the greater good at all times, but projects don’t work like that in real life, do they? Project managers with good negotiation skills will be an asset to their teams as they seek to resolve conflicts by finding the win-win scenarios for everyone. 3. Scheduling It should go without saying that project scheduling is a core project management skill. However, speaking to people who manage project managers during end-of-year review time I have heard that some of them aren’t up to scratch in this area. Get to grips with project scheduling because a) it’s your job and b) it will help you deliver things more successfully for others (which is also your job). 4. Cost Control Budget management is bizarrely one of my favourite topics. I am not a natural maths whizz but I do like a well put together spreadsheet. If I understand the numbers and create my own tracking mechanism I can tell you to the penny how much my project is spending. Cost management is a critical topic for project managers. Those without this skill will be at a disadvantage because budgets are tight. You need to show that you can deliver your project within the cost constraints and by managing the project finances intelligently. 5. Risk Management The more mature project management gets as a profession, the more we find ourselves doing projects that are unique. The more ‘routine’ the project, the more it is likely to get outsourced or given to a functional manager who shows an aptitude for getting things done. Project managers will work on the more complex, transformative, unique endeavours that require decent risk management. Being able to control risk (as far as you can) is a sign that you are on top of your project. Project sponsors hate surprises and good risk management is one way that you can manage that. 6. Contract Management Part of managing your project involves managing suppliers. The vast majority of projects will have an element of supply, whether that is something as simple as the outside caterers who bring in cakes for your launch event or a full-on off-shoring system development firm. Contract management is about being able to actively manage those procurements. Previously many project managers have been able to rely on their Finance departments to get this sort of work done (and Legal teams for managing the terms of the deal). Today, with everyone under pressure to do more with less, it’s falling to project managers to pick up the slack when it comes to procurement. 7. Critical Thinking Critical thinking is core to being able to make good decisions. You have to weigh up the pros and cons of solutions to problems before choosing the right way forward. This is what distinguishes a project manager who is good at managing issues to someone who blows issues out of the water every time. You can build your critical thinking skills through practice and by equipping yourself with tools and approaches to help you structure arguments logically and see things from all angles before making the final decision. 8. Communication If I had to pick one skill on this list to focus on during 2015 it would be communication. We don’t do enough of it. Our stakeholders demand more of it. We fail time and time again to meet expectations largely because we failed to communicate effectively and often. Think creatively about the communication channels you have got available to you including: IntranetNewslettersEmailsCollaboration and social media toolsTeam meetings/face-to-faceWeb and online conferencing.Then think about how you can apply each of these to actively serve your project next year. 9. Project Recovery I hope you don’t have to do project recovery next year but if you are looking for a boost to your career then showing you know how to turn around a poorly performing team and project will certainly set you aside from your peers. 10. Coaching Most of the people on your project team won’t work for you (if, indeed, any of them do). That makes it really important that you are good at managing in a matrixed environment but also that you are good at coaching. Why? Because they may not have much project experience and you’ll have to coach them to top performance. If you are worried about not being a good coach you might be surprised to learn that coaching skills are something that might be closer in reach than you expect. If you sit with a child during homework and help them come to the right answers then you are doing a form of coaching. Some training in this area will help you apply those skills in the workplace to help your team perform their best. 11. Task Management This is another bread and butter task for project managers. You should be able to create a task list, delegate work to others and keep on top of progress. I found this was the easiest part of project management when I started because I was naturally a list-maker. If it doesn’t come easy to you you’ll have to develop strategies to ensure you are always on top of your To Do list. When you have cracked managing your own work you can help others manage theirs. This is the best way in my experience to make sure that projects come in on time and others take responsibility for their deliverables. 12. Quality Management Quality management ensures that you deliver a product that is fit for purpose. What project sponsor doesn’t want that? Unfortunately project managers often don’t spend enough time on the quality angle of their projects – it’s one of those processes and set of tasks that are overlooked as an administrative overhead. If you are a quality expert, then good for you. But if you aren’t, seriously consider upping this on the priority list for 2015. The better the quality of your deliverables, the better value you are offering stakeholders and the more satisfied they will be. 13. Meetings Management How many of your meetings this year have overrun or finished without any clear action being agreed? How much time have you sat in meetings wondering why you were there and what time you can leave without it looking too bad? Or worse, how much time have you spent on conference calls only half listening while doing your emails or playing Candy Crush? Being able to sense when a meeting is going off the rails and people aren’t paying attention is a key skill for project managers. It’s helped by sticking to the agenda but it’s also about being able to read the body language of people in the room to check that you are getting through the material quickly and comprehensively. Don’t let 2015 become another year of wasted time in meeting rooms. 14. Business Case Writing With the ongoing focus on delivering business value, being able to write a business case (or at least contribute one) will be a good skill to have. Get hold of some templates so that when you are asked to finalise a business case or review one you know what should be included. Find some business cases from past projects and evaluate what you would do differently. And make sure that your next project actually has a business case – that’s a good start! 15. A Sense of Humour The end of 2014 has been a frantic rush to get everything done before the IT change freeze, people’s holidays, the end of the financial year and what seems like a hundred other deadlines. Getting through it has largely relied on a good sense of humour and the goodwill of colleagues prepared to pick up the slack or wait another 24 hours.",2021-03-05T08:28:26.209Z,"What should be the Skills of a Project Manager for a new Project?

After leaving the Navy as a musician I went to work for an Electric Utility company as an Assistant Engineering Clerk. My contribution to the financial success of the company was folding blueprints. I would receive rolls of blueprints and each blueprint had to be folded into an 8 x 11 inch square so they would fit into file folders. I tried to look beyond my immediately dreadful horizon and befriended managers and designers and engineers and besieged them with questions to try to understand what engineering and designing power plants was all about. A massive new construction program was on the horizon so the company picked an engineering manager to become the company’s first Project Manager. This implied some kind of reorganization and a new way of doing things which sort of left the Project Manager scratching his head a bit. So one day he took me to lunch and told me that he wanted me to work for him. He would give me a promotion to some kind of yet-to-be-defined administrative position. He said that my first and primary assignment was to research every thing there was to know about project management and project managers and give him a report. Understand, this was a time when a computer filled a room and there was no such thing as an internet or computer access — unless you were a punch card aficionado. So my response was an eloquent, “Huh?” “Look Jerry,” he said, “they made me something called a Project Manager and I don’t know what that means and yet I am supposed to develop plans for building multi-million dollar power plants. Figure it out for me, and you will become a vital part of my organization.” He then did something really shocking. He gave me access to a company car, told me to show up to work every day and then leave and find stuff out. He wanted my results in one month. So I went to technical bookstores and bought books, went to the library, called major oil and gas companies asking about their project management groups (and they didn’t know what I was talking about). Finally I went to the NASA Manned Spacecraft center here in Houston. This was during the Apollo program and I figured maybe they had some insight. After four or five days of making a nuisance of myself I met an older gentleman who would talk to me. (He remained a friend until he died about ten years later.) Yep, he was in Project Management. He took me to the ‘war room’ where there were giant boards with schedules plotted with strings and press-on tapes and lots of numbers representing something called budget dollars, actual dollars and earned dollars. It seems that NASA adopted something the military was doing to track costs and schedules and progress. I spent hours and hours with this gentleman. He liked me and gushed with pride in teaching me. Now this was rudimentary project management blessed with a hint of something called Project Controls would become. But I took all of this new knowledge including everything I had read and prepared a report for my new Project Manager. I included different organization options (matrix management organization options, direct organization) and new weird stuff like Document Control and Earned Value and Milestone Credits and on and on. The net result is that a new organization was formed and I was promoted again to Project Administration Supervisor. I talked the Project Manager into hiring my NASA friend as an expert consultant. And my career in project management began. Because I was associated with the development of project management and project controls I pretty much gained an insight into the pitfalls and figured out what was realistic and what was pretty stupid. I soon became a Project Controls Supervisor and then finally Project Controls Manager within various companies, became a bit of an expert on Performance Measurement and Risk Analysis and we sent out to teach courses for a few years. Because of a truly strange assignment from my boss, a new career was launched for me.",2021-03-05T08:32:48.813Z,"What is the strangest request you ever received from a boss of yours? ",Quora

The challenge is that as any field grows, the talented practitioners become increasingly specialized. I have friends that work at long-short hedge funds, in real estate, in oil & gas, at generalist funds and at funds that specialize in a particular sector. The analysis required differs by sector and strategy, and while you could spend a lifetime attempting to cover everything, your career will likely be best served by picking a strategy, industry or career path that interests you most. Yours is a difficult question to answer, but if you work through the content below, my guess is you will naturally start to gravitate towards what is interesting to you. Adopt efficient learning practices. I committed considerable time to learning about learning, and I wish I had done it sooner. My thoughts on this subject: On Learning: Knowledge I Wish I Had in College. Focus on variables consistent across industries. For example, most privately-held companies require you focus on the following in a financial model: Income Statement: Growth rate applied to revenue.Measures of profitability (generally measured as a percentage of sales).On the income statement itself, the primary drivers are the growth rate applied to sales, and measures of profitability. You can go into as much detail as you want (ie projecting revenue by product line or Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) by line item), or you can project total revenue with a single growth rate, and Gross Margin (measure of profitability after COGS) as a percent of revenue. At the bottom of the income statement, you have net income - using the balance sheet and cash flow statement we can start working towards cash flow. Balance Sheet: Working capital accounts.Property Plant & Equipment (capital expenditures).Debt liabilities for borrowed money.On the balance sheet you will find that working capital accounts are often linked to the income statement. You may use historical data to come up a number of days for working capital accounts. Accounts receivable, for example is projected using Day Sales Outstanding (DSO). The assumptions you make about how these accounts are handled can have a big impact on cash. To continue with the example provided, if you assume DSO increases, Accounts Receivable will also increase and consume cash. PP&E balance equals the beginning balance less depreciation, plus capital expenditures. Depreciation is a non cash expense, so the focus should be on capital expenditures (especially if the business is asset heavy). Generally there is some kind of link to revenue based on the assumption that greater sales in an asset heavy business will require more equipment. Capital expenditures reduce cash. Debt obligations, particularly in an Leveraged Buyout. Here the link to the income statement is less obvious, but availability of liquidity (cash flow) should influence the debt burden assumed. Cash Flow Statement: In most financial models the cash flow statement will take data from the income statement and balance sheet to translate the activity of the business from an accrual basis of accounting to a cash basis of accounting. Summing net cash flow for the period with the previous periods cash balance will give you the cash balance for the current period (which links back to the balance sheet). Generally no drivers found on the cash flow statement. For a publicly-held business you should include stock-based compensation and share count (this applies to privately-held businesses that use stock-based comp. aggressively as well). Become proficient at building the following model types: Three-Statement Model (also known as a fully integrated financial statement model): As it relates to financial modeling, a thorough understanding of how the financial statements are integrated is possibly the most important thing you can learn.Discounted Cash Flow Model: Building a DCF model introduces some of the most critical aspects of finance. Even if you do not intend to follow a career path that requires this skill set, the lessons learned will prove valuable in any aspect of your life where time and money are important.Leveraged Buyout Model: The LBO model is often viewed as extraordinarily complex, but it shouldn’t be. This process will introduce you to purchase accounting, making balance sheet adjustments, and detailed debt schedules. It will also really help develop an understanding of capital structure (in my opinion, more so than any other model).Practice with real data. Try downloading SEC filings and building your own model. The process will expose what you need to revisit. Give the model purpose. The exercise will be all the more valuable if you have an objective. For example, find an article claiming a company’s shares are mispriced, and build a model to form your own conclusion. Read the books listed in these answers: What Is the Best Textbook on Investing? What are some recommended tips or readings in gaining a deeper understanding of annual reports? And finally… work with new concepts until they are simple to you: Example: IRR Formula Made Simple If you are still looking for more answers, or more financial modeling resources, please see this list of topics - Private Equity / Investment Banking: Getting the Job Stating that you want to be an expert in financial modeling is akin to stating you want to be an expert in finance.

Even if you don’t get a job in the U.S., the experience can be life changing. The bad news is that most Indians approach doing a M.S. the wrong way. Here is how one of my friends did it (the right way): Starting from the first year, he started looking at different options. He looked at both his interests as well as potential of the field of study (many just look at their interests, which is fine). He reached out to alumni and spoke to them (on email). He also started interacting with colleges abroad.He narrowed done his field of study. He started interacting with professors. By the time he was at the end of his third year, he knew where he wanted to apply and which professors he would work with. He knew who would give funding. He knew what kind of work people do after their MS. He knew whether to do a Ph.D. or not.I would recommend you do that in a hurry. If you need to work for a few years in India, do that. Keep in mind that the M.S. is a research oriented degree (mostly). You can’t expect to do something like CCNA. Also remember that it is much less expensive to experiment in India than in the U.S. If you want you can take some classes in India to improve your technical skills or figure out if you like that topic.

Now if you are asking, “When is a software engineer skills set to the point they are considered a senior software engineer?” Again, hard to say, because one’s peers and one’s managers that are specific to your one department withing your one company may judge with completely different metrics from others…but I’ll give it a shot. As far as having the respect from one’s peers to obtain that title, here is my breakdown, from a software developer/security professional POV. The categories, responsibilities, and years of experience I have suggested are my opinion from anecdotal experience in the industry: Entry Dev. - Just starting out; has the theory, but little to no real world experience. Requires almost constant to moderate supervision on most programming tasks. Typically a liability at fist, as the actual productivity of the inexperienced individual is much less than the time invested into them, since senior developers who are teaching them are not coding themselves. Anyone <1 year experience.Junior Dev. - Beginning to understand how the pieces all come together. Can do some coding, but still needs to be monitored to ensure they are following universal coding and specific team standards. Feels like you’re constantly “drinking from the fire hydrant”, but you also have frequent ‘light bulb’ moments where you see how to manipulate the theory into actual concrete solutions that fit specific problems. Still requires supervision from time to time, but net productivity is a positive overall. Usually 1–2 years in the industry.Mid Software Engineer - At this point, I would say a person can be a software engineer vice just a developer. They are being thrown normal coding tasks, but also investigate bugs and offer solutions. They don’t just code a solution to a problem, but evaluate which solution to employ, being mindful of version history, how changes may affect other aspects of the project, as well as future requirement or project plans. Still stumped at times, either with unusually hard bugs or just ignorant of the full project scope/technology constraints, but is becoming an expert in the field requiring little to no supervision when tasked. Anywhere from 3–5 years typically.Senior Software Engineer - Will still be doing a lot of mid level grunt work, but may also take on one or multiple additional functions; tutoring juniors, monitoring coding and check in standards, verify proposed code fixes by mid and lower members when needed, and assist lead engineer as needed are just a few. They should have a full general understanding of the project, will typically be a SME on at least one aspect of the technical project and/or development cycle. and may be required to research alternative technical solutions. 6+ years experience.Lead Engineer - SSE who is responsible for the whole project development team getting the project successfully completed. Primary responsibility is to complete the project. Second is to manage the team by assigning tasks, removing roadblocks, and development of team skills as whole. May have been the system architect, but if not, is usually involved in the final project review process before approval and scheduling, so project scope is understood by all and expectations of the team are realistic.

In charge of the development team, but may lose assets to management for other higher priority requirements. One can be assigned as Lead as any point in the gamut of experience theoretically, but usually requires somewhere from 8–10 years to master the varied technical, managerial, and people skills.Manager - There are generally two areas of manager that apply to software development, Project Manager and Development Team ManagerProject manager is not required to have a technical background, but some developers have moved into this aspect, multiple times in and out depending on the department needs or career choices. Focus is on overseeing the project from a business perspective. They will define the problem from the customer and then communicate scope of the solution to the customer, management, and the development team. They will establish what resources are needed and ensure those resources adhere to all expected business, technical, legal, and financial requirements of the project. Project managers will prioritize project issues, but don’t typically dictate which developer works on what, since the team lead is responsible for balancing team productivity with team skill development.Development managers manage the personnel in the development department. They may or may not manage the project manager, depending on the company structure. Their focus is to coordinate project requirement within the department and manage the personnel resources to meet these requirements. They can and may take a person off a project, but will work with the project manager/team lead to explain the reasoning and requirement for such a move. Responsible to ensure all technical requirements on a daily basis are being met, and to develop skills within the department as a whole.

Our well-versed knowledge about in-depth processes and solution-oriented approaches has to be accredited for the affordability math. We have created more than 10000 real time case studies with regard to different business models in our company and group of entrepreneurs. However, sharing below the glimpse of determinants that I thought through before rationalizing Digiuniversity: How to build an industry-oriented course which includes its best curriculum.? How to build team for delivering the envisaged course ? How to make it affordable and in reach of maximum people ? How it is going to add value to the learner’s skill set ? When I got the clarity on the above-mentioned questions, I started looking for the possible resolves: To start with I started my research work on the available courses, to 1st challenge i took and started working how to build industry oriented course which again not any bookish knowledge and course missing with marketing .I called it marketing in digital world ,So i world on problem most of courses in market are trained by person which is again giving definition of digital and no knowledge of marketing . How we created this course? Well necessity is the mother of all invention they say! We made this course to train our employees in regorb Coming from a complete digital work model, we had to train our employees with the digital marketing workings. So, each time an employee joined we had to induct them with the detailed insights on digital marketing. This induction not only gave them a fair knowledge of digital marketing but the practical case studies gave them the required in depth know how of digital marketing tools used in real work. We then thought upon making this induction process in the form of a course. The best part was that we didn’t have to deploy any external expertise to build a course. Our business model and working style in itself was a readymade million-dollar study material. To make value additions to the course curriculum I later on added insights and expertise of other entrepreneurs as well. I pooled few entrepreneurs to do relevant upgradations to make it even more industry oriented. Like we added some fundamentals of marketing and other such important aspects as part of this course. This made our course even more apt for all learners who wish to pursue their own business, career in digital marketing , or to start with freelancing projects.  “Don't limit your challenges, challenge your limits” Now coming to question why its affordable and priced at Rs 2790 1. As already cited above, the best part of this course is that we didn’t had to start building this course from scratch. We already had made this course for our employees, which we later fine-tuned to make it suitable for other intended learning groups. In fact we make the insightful additions regularly to make it at its upgraded best. If we have to start from scratch it would have attracted a hell lot of money like in developing content, hiring resources, hiring research team etc. 2) We launched this course online on Cloud infrastructure whose costing is very less as compared to offline courses. Offline course attracts a lot of cost like renting a space, one like coaching centre which might have costed rent of few lakhs per month, deploying front desk manager, teachers, office boys, maintenance, internet cost. All these sum up to a great recurring cost. If we would have chosen the offline model course, we might have ended up pricing the same course for approx Rs 40k to 70k per learner. We kept our course and internship (live projects )100 percent online and learn at your own schedule. Both course and internship are 100 percent online . Here’s the psychology behind why we like expensive things There's something else that gives you pleasure — the price. It's tough news for our wallets, but studies show that we tend to value expensive items over their affordable counterparts. It's known as the ""marketing placebo effect . 3) We wanted to touch base masses, therefore to get across with a widespread reach. With this intention we have kept the course costing to the basic. As a result we have crossed 8000 plus learner as on date. We wish to carry the same traction in future too. 4)We pooled resources and trainers from our group companies at probono basis more so it saved our training cost and some people charge only nominal fees for same. This help in saving cost and getting best industry leaders who has real domain knowledge . 5) Last but never the least, we don’t have any sales team for selling this course of ours. We are directly approachable by the interested learners without any involvement of sales professional. We can be reached at whatsapp and email.

As someone wrote to this question, if one have passion & will one can succeed. But I personally don't think so that this will work for an CSE guy to be in Construction because there are lot civil grads currently who does not have jobs particularly in India. An IT or CSE graduate can learn planning tools like Microsoft Planner, Primavera etc with basic knowledge of planning and scheduling can work as a scheduler. In long term one can settle only as supporting staff to Subject Matter Experts in Planning and Scheduling. There will not be no further growth. The other option is to get in to Survey and GIS. One has to learn tools related to GIS such as Vector Maps, Arc View etc . The career growth will be similar as said above. The best option would be to join with software companies who develop softwares for construction such as Auto Desk, Oracle etc as a programmer or develop a Mobile Application that will be helpful to Civil Engineers. Finally Civil Engineering/Construction is not a like a Software Industry that anyone can become software engineer by taking or hacking exams like Red Hat or doing certifications and learning software like .NET, Java, C++ etc. Diploma in Architecture will not work anyway.

No experience is required for entry-level jobs; however, 2 to 5 years of experience may be required for more advanced roles. Voluntary certification from software developers is available. Key skills include artistic ability; creativity; communication, coordination, critical thinking and time-management skills; and the ability to visualize artistic concepts and use computer imaging and editing software. Step 1: Learn to Draw Carry a sketchbook. Drawing practice outside the classroom is an opportunity to work with diverse subjects and learn observation skills. Having a sketchbook available also provides the means to practice drawing as often and as much as possible.Step 2: Earn a Bachelor's Degree Earning a bachelor's degree in animation can prepare students for a career in media arts, illustration, Web design, film and television. Students take fundamental courses in drawing, graphics, storyboarding, character motion and art design. Students build on these skills with practice in conceptualization, texturing and digital cinematography. Advanced training includes the use of animation computer software programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, After Effects and Maya. Step 3: Put Together a Demo Reel While in school, students usually create a portfolio, DVD or website to showcase their best work. Some educational programs feature a senior project for students to demonstrate their creativity, artistry and proficiency in various software programs. A portfolio or demo reel can also incorporate independent work done outside of school. When looking for employment opportunities, recent graduates will submit their demo reel for open positions. Success Tip: Focus on a main interest. An animation designer can work in many different industries, so it's best to gear demo reels and portfolios to the career of choice. For example, a demo reel for cartoon animation could contain entertaining characters and creative stories.Step 4: Consider Industry Certification Earning a certification can be a good way to stand out, as only a bachelor's degree is required for senior animator positions, according to job postings. Certifications in this career field are typically offered by software publishers, such as Adobe. Professionals can validate their proficiency in using animation technology by becoming an Adobe Certified Expert. Applicable software programs that animation designers can become certified in include Adobe Flash, Illustrator and After Effects. Animation designers should have a bachelor's degree in animation, must learn to draw and put together a demo reel in order to find employment.

Since the Continue ReadingUdacity Android Nanodegree is too early to be reviewed; since the approximate course duration is 6 to 12 months; and the course was launched around 5 months back (Google I/O 2015). So we might not have many Android Developers graduated at this moment. However, what we can do right now is review the course content and not the degree. Be it Android, or any other Nanodegree, for that matter. As written on their landing page by Peter Lubbers (Developer Education, Google): ""We are building this curriculum with Udacity because we believe it reflects what developers everywhere should know."" Since the course material is prepared and developed by those already working with Android since it's inception; we can very well assume that the content is much relevant to what's needed by the industry. We're taught by expert instructors, so there's no margin for error there.Udacity has structured the course in such a way that it is a project-based approach, and we learn by doing things. They demonstrate the problems faced in real world and ask us to build real projects.I've gone through the curriculum offered in Android Developer Nanodegree, which consists of multiple courses right from building Android Applications from the scratch to publishing them on the Play Store; whilst using various services provided by Google and extending the applications to Wearable, TV & Automotive Devices. Having developed an Android application myself, I can safely state that the applications/projects they ask us to build involve working with different APIs provided by Google and other parties, helpful practices for taking care of Performance of our apps, automating certain tasks, and also motivate us to publish those apps on the Google Play Store for monetization. We cannot ignore the career advice that we get after completing the course. IMHO, the confidence that we get after developing the applications on our own should get us started for the industry. So to conclude, I consider the Android Nanodegree worth the money, and in fact, I've been planning to enroll sometime soon, depending on my schedule :)",2021-03-05T08:45:43.802Z,"What are the reviews of Udacity Android Nanodegree?

Get specific. Set aside an hour or two this weekend to do the following: Write down your top 3 goals (can be personal, professional development, or both)Under each, write down 3 things you would need to do on a consistent basis to get you closer to each goal.Then, create a schedule for the week ahead so that you can devote blocks of time to making progress in the areas you've identified.Next Sunday evening, when you've followed your schedule for a whole week, do an assessment of the progress you made. Did some activities take more time than you anticipated? Did you need to plan better so as not to waste time on things that are less relevant to your goals (outside of work, school and other responsibilities)? What could you have done better? Then make adjustments for the following week.Feed your brain. Use the weekend to learn something new, expose your brain to different ideas and perspectives, maybe even others' point of view. You never know when you might find an idea or two you can implement into your daily life. Use this time to learn, be curious, wonder, question, pause, think. A.

After you devote most of your weekend on activities that should bring you closer to achieving goals that are important to you, you should give yourself a reward to mark the occasion. What you choose to reward yourself with will depend on your personal interests, your passions, as well as your personality. Do you enjoy spending time with friends? Get everyone together for an evening out to watch a movie together, attend a concert, catch up over coffee or dinner at your favorite restaurant.Would you prefer to spend some quiet time alone? Schedule a night in, order takeout, watch a film or a documentary that interests you, or do something else that makes you feel really good, like playing guitar, painting, writing, or any project that really gets your mind engaged.Whatever you choose, it should feel like a celebration of small wins.

On seeing their way of teaching and how they explained things, I got convinced and joined their online course of Hadoop.In starting, I was taught on basic concepts like the relationship between Big Data and Hadoop very clearly, Hadoop’s importance, application, its architecture, MapReduce’s lifecycle (oh btw, all these were taught with live sessions by real Hadoop professionals over a personalized dashboard, the one you get after logging in).Then later I was moved to advanced level training, where I was taught concepts like Unix Shell & Apache Pig, HIVE, SQOOP & Hbase, YARN, Impala & Apache Spark With Scala, Apache OOZIE and Spark with the practical implementation of each, we would do live projects with trainers.Our entire training was based on real business problems and we were taught from a range of study materials like videos, PPT, eBooks, MCQs, and so much more.The best part I liked about their training was their 24X7 support system, and I was free to ask doubts anytime.And another thing I liked the most was the flexibility in paying the fee, we had the choice to pay in installments. And they have discounts too, I got 30% off that time when I signed early.I found the trainers very calm & approachable, their way of teaching was quite good.I took their training because I wanted to crack Big data certifications for the job, and they actually cover concepts that are asked in these examinations. They even have access to exam dumps, question banks, which is quite helpful if you are aiming for the certifications.Even they helped me with job assistance, like where should I apply, who is hiring, how to approach the company with the best resume, how to appear for the real interviews - like it was cherry on the top.However, If you too are aiming for Big Data Hadoop certifications, I would suggest their program to you.

That said, the part-time program you end up picking really should depend on what you’re looking to learn and what you’d like to do with your brand new knowledge. It’s important to know your goals and what you need to get out of a class in order to achieve them. To start, here are two really big questions you should ask yourself: What will my schedule really allow?If you’ve got a full-time job, there are physical limitations to your free time, so evaluate how much of it you’re willing to dedicate to learning. If you’re only able spend 2-4 hours a week on a class that requires 8-10 hours of your time. It might not be a worthwhile investment unless you can sacrifice something else in your schedule (hopefully not sleep!). Honestly, from my personal experience, it’s just difficult to move forward with material if you have to keep Googling Terminal commands before getting started with anything. How much you’re able to learn is going to be directly proportional to how much you practice. If you never have time to practice, it’s going to be super tough to learn the next topic and the one after that. Why do I want to learn how to code?The possibilities are really endless, but why you’re learning should guide your decision. Is your goal to build or prototype responsive websites? Maybe a front-end class is all you need. Do you want to work as a full-stack developer, make web apps, scrape websites, or learn how to navigate databases? Then you should consider taking a more holistic web development course. First decide why you want to code; then choose how you’ll learn. Become a Full-Stack DeveloperHonestly, this one’s tough. Our immersive programs in iOS andWeb Development are only offered full-time. You can learn a bit more about how we teach in this answer, but here’s the gist: we want our students to have a transformational experience, to get super excited about what they’re learning, find a place in the programming community, and ultimately kick off new careers because they love what they’re doing. We just don’t think we could provide this kind of experience teaching Ruby a few hours a week. Students would come out with a broad understanding of web development—but it wouldn’t be as transformational as it is to learn something totally new and be able to actually use it in the real world.   Instead, places like General Assembly offer evening introductory classes on back-end development for people looking to get a broad understanding of web development. If you want to get a little deeper, Thinkful’s program is totally online, and offers a mentor to help guide you through the process.  It’s not that it’s impossible to learn to program while you’re working, it’s just that learning enough to be a proficient full-stack developer takes a lot of time. You will probably find yourself doing a lot work outside of your curriculum to get the mastery of the material you need to actually be employable. Build Fully Responsive WebsitesAs I mentioned, we offer a nights and weekends class on Front-end Development. It’s a flipped classroom—meaning you watch lectures online before class and complete assignments in class with our instructor. It’s taught by Jon Grover, who’s a terrific teacher (he’s also taught over 5,000+ students on Skillshare to an average of 5-star reviews). Students cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They don’t just learn Bootstrap; they learn how to make Bootstrap. By the end, they’re able to build a fully responsive website from scratch. If you’re not in NYC, there are still plenty of options out there, both online and in person. Getting from knowing nothing about code to knowing how to build a website from scratch is absolutely possible part-time. More than that, it can be transformative for people who know what they want to do with it. For example, we currently have a student who is learning product design full-time, and needs front-end skills to help her get even better at designing, creating, and testing user experiences. Disclaimer: getting to the point where you can actually build stuff from scratch still takes a lot of effort. Even in a part-time front-end development course, you can expect to dedicate a lot of time to learning. Our course is really flexible, but to stay on pace, you should be spending around 8-10 hours every week between lectures and course material. It’s important to remember when you’re learning to code that what you get out of a class totally depends on what you put into it. See If Coding Is For YouIf you don’t know if you even like coding yet and just want to dip your toe into everything from Python to Ruby to Node.js, you are in luck! There are a ton of affordable resources for you. You can take all kinds of intro classes at places like GA. You can also learn so much online at Treehouse and Codeacademy—which get more robust all of the time. If you need an actual teacher, there’s Skillshare (I recommend Jon’s class!). It’s easier to learn to code online than it’s ever been. Maybe you’ll find you love it so much that you can’t wait to take a deeper dive or discover a whole new reason for why you want to learn to program. Your motivations for buckling down and learning to code should really drive how you choose to do it. The reality is that many part-time classes are best equipped to give you a broad introduction to programming, rather than help you make a big career change. If this is what you want, don’t worry. Classes can be a great way to get a foundation, fill gaps in your knowledge, and learn from other people. Good luck!",2021-03-05T09:02:17.256Z,"Are there any part-time programming boot camps? ",Quora

Our well-versed knowledge about in-depth processes and solution-oriented approaches has to be accredited for the affordability math. We have created more than 10000 real time case studies with regard to different business models in our company and group of entrepreneurs. However, sharing below the glimpse of determinants that I thought through before rationalizing Digiuniversity: How to build an industry-oriented course which includes its best curriculum.? How to build team for delivering the envisaged course ? How to make it affordable and in reach of maximum people ? How it is going to add value to the learner’s skill set ? When I got the clarity on the above-mentioned questions, I started looking for the possible resolves: To start with I started my research work on the available courses, to 1st challenge i took and started working how to build industry oriented course which again not any bookish knowledge and course missing with marketing .I called it marketing in digital world ,So i world on problem most of courses in market are trained by person which is again giving definition of digital and no knowledge of marketing . How we created this course? Well necessity is the mother of all invention they say! We made this course to train our employees in regorb Coming from a complete digital work model, we had to train our employees with the digital marketing workings. So, each time an employee joined we had to induct them with the detailed insights on digital marketing. This induction not only gave them a fair knowledge of digital marketing but the practical case studies gave them the required in depth know how of digital marketing tools used in real work. We then thought upon making this induction process in the form of a course. The best part was that we didn’t have to deploy any external expertise to build a course. Our business model and working style in itself was a readymade million-dollar study material. To make value additions to the course curriculum I later on added insights and expertise of other entrepreneurs as well. I pooled few entrepreneurs to do relevant upgradations to make it even more industry oriented. Like we added some fundamentals of marketing and other such important aspects as part of this course. This made our course even more apt for all learners who wish to pursue their own business, career in digital marketing , or to start with freelancing projects. “Don't limit your challenges, challenge your limits” Now coming to question why its affordable and priced at Rs 2790 1. As already cited above, the best part of this course is that we didn’t had to start building this course from scratch. We already had made this course for our employees, which we later fine-tuned to make it suitable for other intended learning groups. In fact we make the insightful additions regularly to make it at its upgraded best. If we have to start from scratch it would have attracted a hell lot of money like in developing content, hiring resources, hiring research team etc. 2) We launched this course online on Cloud infrastructure whose costing is very less as compared to offline courses. Offline course attracts a lot of cost like renting a space, one like coaching centre which might have costed rent of few lakhs per month, deploying front desk manager, teachers, office boys, maintenance, internet cost. All these sum up to a great recurring cost. If we would have chosen the offline model course, we might have ended up pricing the same course for approx Rs 40k to 70k per learner. We kept our course and internship (live projects )100 percent online and learn at your own schedule. Both course and internship are 100 percent online . Here’s the psychology behind why we like expensive things There's something else that gives you pleasure — the price. It's tough news for our wallets, but studies show that we tend to value expensive items over their affordable counterparts. It's known as the ""marketing placebo effect . 3) We wanted to touch base masses, therefore to get across with a widespread reach. With this intention we have kept the course costing to the basic. As a result we have crossed 8000 plus learner as on date. We wish to carry the same traction in future too. 4)We pooled resources and trainers from our group companies at probono basis more so it saved our training cost and some people charge only nominal fees for same. This help in saving cost and getting best industry leaders who has real domain knowledge . 5) Last but never the least, we don’t have any sales team for selling this course of ours. We are directly approachable by the interested learners without any involvement of sales professional. We can be reached at whatsapp and email.

This can’t be overemphasized. Meet and exceed the expectations for your position. Make sure you know exactly what those expectations are. No matter what career path you’re interested in, technical or managerial or some combination, ensure that you’re excellent at your current job. If you’re not, find a way to get there.Demonstrate passion/enthusiasm for software development and for your projects. Work hard, meet deadlines, get things done, and maintain high quality. Complaining about management, schedules, testing, documentation, customers, etc. is counterproductive, and saps your energy and the energy of those around you.Be a team player. Work well with people in your team, as well as others outside your team. If there is a test/Q&A group, work cooperatively and productively with them. Don’t take offense when someone finds a problem in your code. Fix it, learn from it, and catch that class of error with your own tests so that it will never happen again. When there is disagreement, friction, or tension within the team or between teams, find a way to help resolve it. Humor, as long as it isn’t destructive or inappropriate, is a great help here. When you need to be a naysayer, propose a feasible alternative approach.Ensure that your verbal and written communication skills are excellent. You’ll need to be great at writing crystal clear technical specifications, communicating effectively with non-technical people, presenting to groups of all sizes, using email effectively, communicating effectively with others who don’t share the same spoken first language, etc. For many software engineers, this requires a lot of effort and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone.Tell the truth and be diplomatic. Your integrity is incredibly valuable. If you lose it by lying or cheating, it’s very difficult to win back the trust of others. If you need to provide negative feedback to someone, don’t do it in front of other people.Care about others. I know this sounds odd, but you might be surprised at how many engineers are so narrowly focused that they don’t want to be bothered with people.Find out exactly what the requirements and expectations are for the next level, whether it’s technical, managerial, team lead, etc. You can typically get this information from an employee handbook, human resources, or your manager. Then, start meeting those expectations. And then start exceeding those expectations. The easiest promotions for a manager to push through the system are those for employees who are already operating at the next level. And, some of the promotion requirements can be waived if you’re already operating at the new level.For example, I once got a promotion that officially required five years at the previous level, but the promotion came after only six months. How? By consistently meeting and exceeding the expectations of the new level. Even though it was 4.5 years too early by official standards, it was clear that I was already operating at the next level.Be an expert, a mentor, a resource. Be the person that others come to for solid advice and information. Avoid being judgmental or condescending. Share what you know. Let others benefit from your knowledge and experience.Express your interests. Managers and team leads are not mind-readers. If you’re interested in a particular career path, or even just some specific project or responsibility, say so.After changing from a team lead position at one company to an individual contributor position at another company, I casually mentioned to my manager that I was interested in leading a team at some point. When an opportunity came up, my manager remembered my expressed interest and recognized that I had already been demonstrating the required skills.Learn the business. Gain an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of other teams, departments, and divisions. Understand how each contributes to the success of the business. Strive to have a good grasp of the big picture, and then strive to grasp an even bigger picture.ABL - Always Be Learning. Keep proactively adding to your skill set. This might happen naturally on the job, or might require taking a course or learning on your own. Don’t remain stagnant. Balance improvement of hard technical skills and soft skills.Be the type of person that others look up to and aspire to be. The best way to earn respect is to be respectful of others (at all levels), to help them succeed, to lead by example, to remain humble (no matter what level you’re working in), and to make the effort to truly understand problems and solutions. Respect is not something you can demand or require or buy. You need to earn it.Some of this may seem like common sense. Some may seem incredibly daunting. Some of it can happen naturally, with experience. Some might require significant effort. Which ones require extra effort will vary from one person to another.

If you have the patience to make it through the answer, then I promise you’ll leave with some more value and probably the right knowledge to kickstart your digital marketing career. The easiest way to get started with digital marketing is by understanding the purpose of digital marketing. People often see it as a fancy job because of how people have exaggerated the idea of digital marketing by showing cars and loads of money, etc.  Well, I wouldn’t deny that there is a good opportunity for people to make good money through digital marketing, but the idea of making money and becoming rich overnight is what I find misleading Not going to spam you with false hopes, so here is everything practical, real, and transparent that I know about digital marketing. Let me share some basic details about digital marketing and then I’ll tell you how exactly can you get started with digital marketing. What Exactly is Digital Marketing? In simple words, digital marketing is the craft of reaching out to online audiences through several strategies and procedures involved (I’ll discuss in detail about these strategies also). At present, over 50% of the world’s population has access to the internet which makes it the world's largest marketplace. People are influenced by things they see, hear, observe, and feel. There is no way one could reach out to so many people physically. I mean if you have lots of money, then you might try and get your billboards in several cities or try getting your advertisement published in the newspaper. While you are spending loads of money traveling, designing billboard ads, paying for it, then paying for the newspaper ads, I can go ahead and develop 10 pieces of content, publish it on my website, social media channels and share them aggressively to find hundreds, thousands or even millions of people from across the globe engaged with my message. When people have their eyes on phone screens all the time, who is going to pay attention to billboards and because we were always surrounded by massive hoardings and billboards for a very long time, we have become consciously aware of the fact that they are nothing more than advertisements and that consciousness doesn’t encourage us to think of making a purchase for that particular product or service. At the same time, people might read a blog post that contains the very details, reviews, etc and find it supremely convenient to go ahead and make a purchase based on what they just read. There are people who are scaling 6–7 figure businesses entirely through online practices. Social media and other platforms have got people hooked to the internet, and so in order to reach the maximum possible people, you need to apply some smart tactics to grab an audience of specific interests on the internet and put forward your pitch through a blog post, a video, an Instagram post, a Snapchat story, or a Quora Answer!  You don’t have to wait for your content to go viral on social media, you can make your website rank higher on search engines like google. Google receives over 66,000 a second. If you consciously think of it, in our day to day lives, whenever we have a query the first thing on our mind is to google it and find more about it. Once we google it, we blindly click the first, second, or probably the third link which gives us info about what we needed to see. Just imagine how many more people would have done the same? Probably tens of thousands of other people and so, you receive attention from all over the world and then through content when you’re feeding your consumer with real value, and then you make your product pitch, not all but a good percentage of your audience will find it a wise choice to explore and find what your product or service is about and if it could be of any help to them or not. Web Audience Reach Matters: So, through all of what I have written so far, it is clear that the core structure of digital marketing is solely dependent on reach and the primary subject of digital marketing is content. Today, a website is no less than an asset. You can just have a website and still be scaling 5–6 figure income through several marketing channels. List of things you can do (to make money) if you have a good audience reach: Put adsPublish sponsored contentStart affiliate marketingMonetize your audience through subscription packagesPay-to-view contentSell directly (e-commerce)Now we’re gaining momentum about the topic “Easiest ways to get started with digital marketing”. Now that we have understood the purpose and structure of how digital marketing works, here is what you can do to get started with digital marketing. Step 1: First, you need to decide that you’re going to market yourself or others. Step 2: Once that is decided, you need to know which audience to target. (Focus on the audience with the same interest as your product theme or genre) Step 3: Look for the platform where you can find a good number of people to reach and understand what kind of content they prefer. Step 4: See if there is a need to run ads based on competition and whether or not your organic reach is strong enough. Step 5: Analyze the response to your content and check if anything is lacking. Step 6: Don’t bother your audience by explicitly asking them to buy, rather pitch your product smartly and see what percentage of people engaging with your content can be potential customers. Step 7: Collect emails through contact forms, and reach out to the potential consumers on a direct level and you have an extraordinary opportunity to reach their inbox with your best possible pitch and see what is the conversion rate. This is just one side of how digital marketing works, and once you explore you’ll find 100s of other ways to digitally market your products. Before getting started, Let’s learn about some of the strategies and practices involved in Digital Marketing: SEO (Search Engine Optimization): This is one of the most preferred methods of developing huge organic reach by developing content and optimizing it to rank higher on search engines like Google and Bing.SMM (Social Media Marketing): Social media platforms are crowded with billions of daily active users and because of the flexibility of communicating with each other it is sort of addictive. It is one of the best ways to find relevant audiences.Email Marketing: Just like I mentioned, collecting emails through subscription forms or contact forms and then reaching out to them directly with your product pitch can drastically improve the chances of getting them to buy your product or service.Affiliate Marketing: Businesses need sales, and if you happen to have a social media channel or a website with a good audience base, you can promote their products, and every time any sale happens through your reference, you earn a commission.Video Marketing: Videos are extraordinary sources of information and video content is one of the best formats of engaging content which is the reason you should start video marketing for the best results.SEM (Search Engine Marketing/Advertising): There must be some valid reason behind the fact that global digital ad spend has crossed $10 billion. Facts suggest that for every $1 spent the Return on Investment or the ROI is $2.Digital marketing has grown into one of the fastest industries and is on it’s way to becoming the largest industry however, in countries like India it is not addressed as a mainstream industry even though it offers humungous opportunities. So, to be a part of the digital marketing industry, to start a career as a digital marketer or to have your own digital marketing agency, here is what you’ll need to do first.

It's a big mad world and our nation is FULL of extremely talented people, better than you-dying to replace you. Yes, it's mean. Face it. If you didn't make it to an IIT:Consider that you made it to a decent NIT.It doesn't promise anything. There, I said it.Not a secure future, not a happening career or a rich life.You will have to work here too.Not so much, but considerably a lot. It's possible that your teachers maybe abysmal, infrastructure disheartening and grading system completely unfair.Live with it. As long as you're not coding, it's quite difficult to get a good job. I know 9 pointers who have got placed at 5lpa jobs -completely unrelated to their branch. We are taught by teachers who think isothermal processes have zero exchange of heat! (That's the definition according to them). Now that I'm in the third year of engineering, I see more than half of my batch (not my branch- the entire batch of almost 900 students) preparing for CAT ! Very few are interested in pursuing higher studies in their branches or going for research. I would majorly assign this factor to the pathetic status of academics in my NIT. (And trust me, I am not alone- there a lot of other NITians who can vouch this.) We may be producing a lot of engineers for the namesake, but we are in dire need of good engineers. Engineers who actually stick onto their branches, go for higher studies or devote themselves to research. ( I mean no disrespect or offence to people who chose other career options after engineering.) Two years of engineering over, and I have already discussed the above factors with a lot of fellow students,seniors and students from fellow colleges (other NITs). Our main doubts/conclusions : It's so difficult to get into a top notch set of colleges like IITs, a few NITs, BITS and other notable colleges.After that too, nothing is certain.Hell lot of competition everywhere.If you go for CAT, repeat the same - ensuring good grades (read above 90% in boards and 8.5+ CGPA after graduation)Nothing changes. You work your ass off again for an IIM. It's quite possible that the love you had for Science might be eroded by engineering. (I am not considering the top IITs, a few NITs and BITS Pilani here- I am not sure but I expect them to have excellent professors.) Engineering is one of the most followed education in India but alas! How many engineers do we really produce? Life is unfairThat's the way it is. Sometimes, you get lucky, sometimes, someone else does. Learn to never question things like: Why don't I have what she/he has :Be happy that you've internet access and a laptop which enables you to read this. Realize that you are quite blessed with what you have. Questions like these are futile. I have brooded incessantly during the beginning of the college about a thousand things and then wisdom dawned upon me. I've now decided to utilize the best of everything that I have without complaining.Being jealous of a friend who has a rich dad won't make me any richer. Most of the entrepreneurs who made it big, started from scratch. If they were complaining like you and me, they would have never been successful.Why am I not smart enough? It's a common thing to spot people smarter than us (higher IQ). Getting upset over the fact that we've to work harder than them to score equal to them in a Maths test is useless and depressing. It won't lead us anywhere. Working harder and smarter is the only solution. We (I and a few of my friends) got a little upset with our performances in JEE in the second year of engineering after knowing that a guy from Bhopal (my hometown) had an AIR <100 ! But that lasted only for an hour or so. What's gone will never come back.We have such high tech problems that we often fail to notice our blessings. Ignore the trivial issues and move on. Life's too small for cribbing. The ultimate loverI have seen dozens of my friends being upset over not finding the right guy/ girl. Expecting that a boyfriend will have all the possible traits that a good guy has, will lead to nothing but disappointments.  Guys in my college often complain about not having pretty girls around.Seriously, how handsome are you ? ( No offense but the expectations of finding a super hot chick in an NIT require you to be equally good-looking). Thinking that someday, we will find that one person who will fulfill ALL the expectations one has from a lover is sorrowful. Either cut down your expectations or stay single. Forever. One of my friends wants the following traits in his would-be girlfriend: Smart ( and by that he means a college of his college's stature)WittyExtrovertPrettyPlays a sport !UnderstandingCaringShould pay half the bill on datesShouldn't trouble him a lot- talking a lot over the phone, being a gold digger etc.Preferably likes SoccerShould be atleast 5'3"" ( He's 6'1"")Long hairThis is it !My friend probably plans to stay single for the other half of the college life. With all due respect to his choice of a girlfriend, it'd be a strenuous task to actually find such a girl ( if she exists). Very rare combination. Not every guy can be as romantic as Gerard Butler from P.S. I love you and not every girl can be as sporty as Jess from Bend it like Beckham. Wake up. See the other beautiful things about a person. Appreciate them. Live happily. P.S. : I am not preaching. Been there, done that. :P",2021-03-05T09:05:44.967Z,"What are the most difficult and useful things people have to learn in their 20s? ",Quora
6041f47bed76476feda19fee,https://www.quora.com/What-are-unrealistic-expectations-outsiders-have-of-your-field-of-work?-,"I worked in Project Controls pretty much my whole career (retired now) for power plant and oil and gas pipeline engineering, design and construction projects. One of the interesting unrealistic expectations expected from our group was precision. Many times project and executive management expected us to tell them exactly what was going to happen with the project cost and schedule one or two years into the future. We are pretty smart, but not that smart. We are able to provide a pretty sophisticated range of probabilities based an myriad of factors, but never precise information. You keep changing the answer. Yep. Those ranges of probability may change from one month to the next because the factors supporting the predictions change. We have to take into account what has actually happened and why it happened between reporting periods. We are the Black Box people. We force project team members (and other experts) to endure in Risk Analysis to figure out probabilities of potential cost and schedule outcomes. We ask for and research project information and then walk into a meetings telling the Project Manager that their project has problems. It is as if, ‘We willingly provide you what you want and then you turn around and tell us we are screwing up!’ And how do we assess the project — by throwing out off productivity terms, intone acronyms all over the place, flash charts on the screen while saying weird things like, “You can clearly see the divergence of BCWS and BCWP, and that degree of divergence clearly indicates that…” ‘Who do you guys think you are? NASA?’ In other words, stuff is thrown at Project Controls, somehow gets massaged and manipulated, and boom! We tell the project where their problems are expressed in gobbledygook. We have to work hard to translate that gobbledygook into plain English. You don’t know what you are doing! Sometimes there is some truth to this. We plaster the walls of the construction office with huge sheets of paper displaying a finely crafted resource loaded construction schedule with a pretty red critical critical path with confusing links from one activity to another. Then we call in the Construction Supervisors to lecture them on where they are deviating from the schedule and what they have to do next. They walk up to this masterpiece, put on their reading glasses so they can read all the fine print, and then turn around and tell us, “You guys don’t have a clue!” We are the hot shots telling construction experts that have built power plants for the past forty years what they are supposed to be doing! We are laughed out of the building. The more experience Project Controls folks scale the whole thing way down. The wise Project Controls person pins a Gantt Chart (a bar chart) on the wall and asks, “Does this make sense to you guys?” It is simple and straight forward and you will get comments like, “You can’t put in the Aux Boiler here because you are then blocking access for the crane that will be needed for…” You definitely make note to revise the schedule. Finally you mark up that bar chart to make everyone happy. From then on, you put up a new bar chart weekly and those Construction folks come in an color in what has been accomplished and point out where you screwed up something in the future. To be sure, when a project schedule is being developed you have a Construction Manager come in for a Constuctibilty Review. The problem is if they have to study a CPM schedule, their interest wanes. It is too complex, there are too many lines and links, and get bogged down in ‘floats’ and ‘predecessors and successors’. Give them a bar chart and they will redo the whole thing for you. Give them a CPM and they will mutter “Whatever” and walk away. You guys think you are policemen! It is hard for a hard core Project Controls employee to understand a couple of things: (a) common sense takes precedent over rules; and (b) know when to get out of the way and let people do their jobs. Project Controls has the facts and figures and the analysis to identify valuable stuff. The question is, what to do with it. It is easy to make proclamations and point fingers and lecture. But it is also ineffective. The smart way is to be part of the team, using your talents to help the Project Manager. You have to be on the Project Manager’s side, not his accuser. Your job is to make him a success!",2021-03-05T09:06:03.192Z,"What are unrealistic expectations outsiders have of your field of work? ",Quora

I completed my PG Diploma from IIITB via Upgrad. It started on Sep 2019 and finished in Sep 2020. This is the certificate that was provided [https://www.credential.net/92a006e3-bafa-42eb-8a06-3456c8c8c045 ] :  And here is the snapshot from the transcript, along with the roll number from IIITB   The reason I posted the above certificate and transcript details is because, there were few fellow students (and their parents), who were not sure how real this deal is. So yes, the certificate and transcripts are all from the IIITB and they don’t have the UpGrad logo on them.  Was it required? Up-skilling is something everyone in the IT has to do regularly. Like CI/CD today CE/CT is much important. It stands for Continuous Education, Continuous Training. After working for 15 years in C++, I observed how the greenfield projects in C++ were a rarity and the existing projects were either legacy enhancements or migration (to Java) ones. Moving to People Management was an option however the engineer and developer inside me wanted to stay hands-on for just a few more years. I needed to pick a technology which was fairly new yet promising. Among the two options of DevOps and Data Science, I found Data Science much interesting. Not only was it similar to what I already have been doing (a lot of data wrangling), it had Python and Machine Learning which are among the best and most interesting technologies around today. And they pay well!  A friend told me about the Masters from Georgia Tech. It is a highly ranked institute and a masters degree from it will fit like a gem in any resume. The problem was, it was a really long program. Plus although the GRE score was not required, English proficiency test was needed which would have further delayed the application. Overall, I saw it would have taken about 4 years (3–6 years is the range) for me to finish. It is recommended to those in their 20s. I was touching end of 30s.I had a talk with Great Lakes who market themselves as the best one in the market. In 2019 they didn’t have a program for budding Data Scientists, one which included hands on coding on Python. Also the program was PGP and not a Masters.All of the Masters listed in Coursera are on the expensive side (easily exceeding 10L, reaching up to 30L) with their duration touching 3 years.I checked UpGrad. It offered two courses of my interest - Master's in Data Science from Liverpool John Moores University, UK and Master's in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence from the same institute. The package is that the lectures and the initial training will be provided by the IIITB, which basically will be the PG Diploma. It will get the student 110 credits. These credits will be transferred to the LJMU. For the rest of the 70 credits (it is a 180 credits program), a student will do a research project in LJMU under the guidance of LJMU. English proficiency test was not required. Thus, the student gets a PGD and a Masters Degree. The cost was 4.85L. The loan was available which would be interest free. This was a major deal clincher. The complete length of the course was mere 18 months. It was the shortest course to get an International Masters Degree. Another deal clincher! There was a small test as a part of application which I gave nonchalantly. And kind of cracked it, as it involved High school Math. In few minutes I received a call from UpGrad and they offered me a 70K scholarship (discount?). That was encouraging.  The Course Designed by IIITB, the course quality is top notch. The lectures (recorded) are given by the IIITB faculty as well as the Industry experts which include the Head of Data in Zee5 and CEO of Gramener and Googlers. However, the soul of the course are the regular submissions of assignments and case studies that one has to do. These projects are challenging and teach the intricacies of the data science projects very well. Usually each submission has a guidance session by Sumit Shukla. Any sincere student will do well in the assignments and case studies if he follows the approach what Sumit suggests.  The Support System By UpGrad TAs help out in the Discussion Boards along with the fellow students. Also, for non academic queries and problems a student mentor is provided. Their job is to face the fire and still deliver. And that they do well. I had once made a submission in a zip file sans a major document. I realized it after 10 days. The student mentor handled it, trusted me, and ensured the 30% penalty was not applied. The support system doesn’t end with the course. The career counseling and the alumni supports continues even after the course is finished. In my course, MLOps and Data Engineering were not a part of the initial curriculum. Special lectures were arranged for them for us. The video recordings of special sessions are always provided later and as they are in YouTube (private videos), they never expire. In latest curriculum MLOps and Data Engineering have been added. In case access to the professor is required, the student mentor arrange for it. Few people have mentioned this is not the case, however I always had a two way communication on institute email with the IIITB faculty. Towards end of the course, there is a special module which covers the major questions that are asked in the DS interviews. UpGrad also arranges for on-demand pre-interview session with Data Science leaders. Overall, student mentor is a very resourceful fellow and your best friend during the PGD course. His need might reduce during the MS part.  Effort Required Effort is needed. Because if the effort was not needed, the course will have no value. These certificates are not up for sale. One has to earn it. I have spent many weekends doing case studies and assignments. I have been gifted with dark circles. There were days my eyes were itchy the whole day as I didn’t get to sleep well. I have seen a lot of sad, angry and depressed messages in the WhatsApp group. But that heat is required to turn Iron to Steel. My schedule was to put the family to sleep and then study for 1–2 hours every night. And then spend 8–10 hours every weekend. Totally it came out to be 15–20 hours in addition to the time spend on office work, helping wife (covid-19 had arrived) and baby sitting (it was even more challenging than the PGD). And yes, I am a programmer all my life and have exposure to Python since 2011. So this course is not for someone who is thinking of merely buying an International degree.  Exams and Marks. 10% is given on how active you are on the discussion board. Usually you get really good here. The End of Module exams have 25% weightage. Now, exams are tough so always start with the 4 python coding questions which are present in each exam. Major marks can be scored in Quizzes. Take as much time to finish the quiz and never be in a hurry. They have 20% weightage. The rest of the 45% is for assignments/projects. In each assignment, there are certain questions asked. And if the student has build a notebook which is able to answer those precise questions, getting 100% is not impossible. And there is always an option to send the marks for a review explaining your situation. And marks do increase more often than not, after revaluation.  Career Prospects Although my Masters is still ongoing, my PGD is seen with respect in my organization. In fact there were no technical questions asked by my client during the interview for my Data Science Project. The Masters degree will add even more value.  Masters: As it is ongoing, I will write in detail about it later. Till now, I have become pretty good in doing literature review. During the Masters, the LJMU has provided the access to IEEE and various other publications. UpGrad has joined hands with NimbleBox AI to give access to GPUs for model building. We have weekly sessions with the LJMU Professor and he lets us book a 1–1 session if required. UpGrad has also provided a Thesis supervisor and the one assigned to me is really good. I might end up publishing a paper which will have an impact in both Health Science and Statistics.  You can visit Master's in Data Science (fees is about 4.85L) in case you are interested in Masters or Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science (fees is about 2.3L) in case you are okay with just the PGD. I noticed UpGrad has started an Online+Offline PGD as well, which involves campus visits. For that, visit PG Diploma | Online + Offline. The Post Graduate Certificate in Data Science (fees about a Lakh) course of much smaller duration and gives a PG Certificate from IIITB.

Show how the role’s relevant skills were demonstrated in your experience. The employer will immediately ignore your resume if you sent the same old generic file that you sent in applying for customer service, business development, and IT roles.In writing your work experience / internships / volunteering stuff, do highlight your accomplishments in the particular role. Developed a marketing plan that led to your ad agency’s first industry award? Write it down! Increased your company’s monthly sales revenue by 150%? Write it down! Spearheaded a successful charity concert for a NGO? Go ahead, put it on your resume! Employers will surely be impressed by the work you’ve done and their resulting achievements.Customizing a resume per role?

Check out the company’s social media handles to have an overview of their brand voice, how they present themselves to their customers, etc. Read up on recent news about them so that you have some information in hand should they ask you if you’ve heard anything about them lately.

If you have taken baby steps and are trying to stabilize your career, you too can opt for this credential. So, what exactly are the CAPM certification requirements? Who specifies these CAPM certification requirements? CAPM Certification Requirements: Are you eligible? Project Management Institute (PMI) PMI Institute Project Management Institute is the world renowned body for project management best practices. PMI has its headquarters in the USA but has chapters all over the world. While it advocates project management framework and best practices, it also helps practicing professionals execute projects more successfully. The certifications from PMI are sought after over the globe. Moreover, some of them are a mandatory requirement for a project management career. To maintain quality, PMI maintains a certain minimum criterion, CAPM certification requirements for its certification. Let us explore the CAPM certification requirements. What should you have at a minimum as CAPM requirements? Before you decide to dive into the CAPM certification, you need to understand and verify the eligibility requirements. Or, do you have what it takes – CAPM certification requirements? You need to have the following educational qualification & experience or project management education. But please note that you don’t have to meet all three CAPM Certification Requirements below. Meeting the 1st and 2nd or the 1st and 3rd ensures that you qualify the CAPM Certification Requirements.  CAPM Certification Requirements #1: Secondary diploma When you complete your high school typically 9-12 grade in North America, you get this Secondary Diploma. In British Columbia, Canada, it is called British Columbia Certificate of Graduation. An equivalent British qualification would be ‘International General Certificate of Secondary Education’ (IGCSE). Therefore, if you have any of these or equivalents in your country, you meet one of the CAPM Certification Requirements. CAPM Certification Requirements #2: Project Experience You should have worked for at least 1500 hours on a project team to meet the other CAPM Certification Requirements. Are you worried that you are a fresh pass out with a high school diploma? PMI has given another option in CAPM Certification Requirements that you need to meet if you do not meet this one. CAPM Certification Requirements #3: Project Management Education To meet the CAPM Certification Requirements, you should have 23 contact hours of project management education. There are many providers who give this CAPM education courses for you. We will see in a bit what this Project Management Education is. Watch the CAPM Certification Requirements Video Project Management Education: CAPM Training Course We have seen the CAPM Certification Requirements you need. Does this mean that you don’t need the project management education if you have experience? No, but along with the 23-hour certificate most CAPM Training Course providers provide the wherewithal to crack the CAPM exam. Hence, it is worthwhile to go for a CAPM Exam Prep Training in spite of your experience. Why go for a CAPM Training Course?

In case you cannot spare time for a classroom training or find it tough to commute (we understand your travel woes!) or have unpredictable schedules, then we have some options that are tailor made for you. If you are comfortable learning by sitting in a class with an instructor, you can choose a classroom or a Boot camp as it is referred to. But, just a caution, schedules are pre-defined, if you miss, difficult to find a slot in the next session which again can happen a month later. So, go for it if you have predictable schedules, can easily travel to the class and of course have a good one close by.If you want flexibility, study at your pace and not be hassled by traffic jams, go for a CAPM training course online. CAPM Exam and how to equip for it There are a few more CAPM Certification Requirements that are not prescribed by PMI but those that put you in control. Here are a few things about the CAPM Exam and how to go about it: Create a Study plan which is your project management plan to execute your CAPM ExamChoose a good CAPM Study Guide that has CAPM exam sample questions, exercises to test your understanding of the concept.

Here's a breakdown of these 3 ideas. ONE. Always have a goal to aspire to. Start by asking yourself these questions:  Where do you want to be in 6 months, 1 year, 5 years from now?  Who do you want to become?  What is a dream scenario for you: a life in a specific city, having a career in an industry that motivates you, being surrounded by smart and interesting people who contribute to your personal growth, b Continue ReadingYour spare time can feel much more productive if you use it to (1) build a strategy for achieving your goals, (2) feed your brain, and (c) treat yourself well for all the hard work that you do. Here's a breakdown of these 3 ideas. ONE. Always have a goal to aspire to. Start by asking yourself these questions:  Where do you want to be in 6 months, 1 year, 5 years from now?  Who do you want to become?  What is a dream scenario for you: a life in a specific city, having a career in an industry that motivates you, being surrounded by smart and interesting people who contribute to your personal growth, becoming an expert in a field that requires a lot of your dedication and time?  Next, get specific. Set aside an hour or two in your spare time to do the following: Write down your top 3 goals (can be your personal, professional development, or both)Under each goal, write down 3 things you would need to do on a consistent basis to get you closer to each goal.Then, create a schedule for the week ahead so that you can devote blocks of time to making progress in the areas you've identified.At the end of the week, make an assessment of the progress you made. Did some activities take more time than you anticipated? Did you need to plan better so as not to waste time on things that are less relevant to your goals (outside of work/school)? What could you have done better? Then make adjustments to your schedule for the following week.TWO. Feed your brain. Use your spare time to learn something new, expose your brain to different ideas and perspectives, maybe even others' point of view. You never know when you might find an idea or two you can implement into your daily life. Use this time to learn, be curious, wonder, question, pause, think. A. Listen to podcasts Achieve Your Goals with Hal Elrod (creator of The Miracle Morning, provides ideas to cultivate a morning routine and be productive early in the day)Intelligence Squared (forum for debate and intelligent discussion on  a variety of topics ranging from world politics to art to economics)Optimize with Brian Johnson (condensed big ideas from the best books on optimal living and also micro classes on how to apply these ideas)Happier With Gretchen Rubin (a fun show led by bestselling author of ""The Happiness Project"" with small ideas you can apply to your life to exercise your happiness muscle)Ask Altucher (Q&A sessions with entrepreneur/investor/writer, where he responds to questions from listeners on a variety of topics)Planet Money ( stories about smart people, economics, politics)Radiolab (show about curiosity, interesting ideas, science, philosophy)The Inquiry (a debate on a controversial topic in the news and 4 experts challenging each other with 2 views, for and against the topic)Question of the Day (a show for people short on time and long on curiosity, with a lot of good humor in trying to answer the question at hand)B. Read books (fiction and non-fiction) Why? It's the equivalent of living multiple lives; reading can stimulate your imagination, utilize your critical thinking skills, and ultimately, it will give you food for thought. Dive deep into the lives of others and get lost in private lives of fictional characters, find out what makes them tick, ask yourself what would you do in their place.Learn from the experiences of others in their quest to live a happier life, become healthy, start a business, excel at a skill, overcome an obstacle, live a life with more meaning and a sense of purpose. THREE. Be good to yourself. So now that you've worked hard during the week focusing on activities that should bring you closer to achieving your most important goals, you should give yourself a reward over the weekend to mark the occasion. What you choose to reward yourself with will depend on your personal interests, affinities, your passions, as well as your personality. Do you enjoy spending time with friends? Get everyone together for an evening out to watch a movie together, attend a concert, catch up over coffee or dinner at your favorite restaurant, or invite them over to your place for a few hours of laughter, good conversation, and fun.Would you prefer to spend some time alone or with your family or partner? Schedule a night in, order takeout, watch a film or a documentary; spend an hour or two in an activity that makes you feel really good, like playing guitar, chess, painting, writing, or any project that really gets your mind engaged.Whatever you choose, it should feel like a celebration of small wins. For every hour of your spare time that you dedicate to your personal development, reward yourself so you feel like you've accomplished something worthwhile: investing in your own future. Your spare time can feel much more productive if you use it to (1) build a strategy for achieving your goals, (2) feed your brain, and (c) treat yourself well for all the hard work that you do. Here's a breakdown of these 3 ideas. ONE. Always have a goal to aspire to. Start by asking yourself these questions:  Where do you want to be in 6 months, 1 year, 5 years from now?

So I'm gonna one-up your question and tell you how you can get a job at Google and Facebook in 1 month (1 month's prep, that is.) By the way, brevity isn't my strong suit, so this post might take you a while to get through, but I promise it's worth it, and I'll do my best to answer questions you post in the comments about specifics, because I'm almost definitely going to forget to mention some important things (I prepped for the interviews some 5 months ago so this is based on my memory only.) I'm going to detail how I prepared for technical interviews in ~1 month, after which I got a job at Facebook. The process of getting an interview all the way up to getting an offer will probably take 1-2 months extra after that. For my own experience during the actual interview process, see Jimmy Saade's answer to What is the software engineering interview process like at Facebook London? Note that this is for the general Software Engineering position (in my case, new grad), and nothing specific like Android/iOS developer, or Infrastructure Engineer, or so on. The cool and not-so-convenient thing about tech interviews is that you really never know what you're going to get, so you have to be prepared for a huge range of possible topics, some of which are more likely to occur than others. I'll touch on these below and then outline some very important question-types that may arise and that you should be prepared to deal with. So let's say your interview is in one month. Here's how I would plan said month (assuming a full-time schedule). Note that this is what I would do (and did, actually), so it might not be the optimum approach for you, but I suggest working similarly and switching it up a bit based on how you feel you'd grasp concepts better (e.g. solve and code in parallel, as opposed to what I did which is solve everything then code everything...)  Days -∞ to 0 - Prerequisites I assume that you have taken an algorithms course and know your way around major data structures including but not limited to: binary trees, binary search trees, hash tables, heaps, stacks, queues, graphs, lists, tries... as well as all algorithms related to them (insert, delete, search, find, find max, find min...) and the time complexity for each of these, at least at a high level. For graphs you need to know searches (BFS and its properties, DFS and its properties including cycle detection and the like) and shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and A*) at a bare minimum. If you don't know all these, along with Dynamic Programming, you're going to need longer than a month. Pick up Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and start studying them first. (Update: I posted an answer here: Jimmy Saade's answer to What should I know from CLRS 3rd edition book if my aim is to get into Google? in regards to which parts of CLRS are relevant for technical interviews.) This is the easy part, as it's all academic and it's just expected that you know all of it. The part that follows below (Day 1 onwards) is the actually valuable part that I can offer you. I also assume that you know a programming language like C++ (or Java) and the built-in functions which actually make it useful (i.e. STL or its Java equivalents). (Update 2: I posted info relevant to this here: Jimmy Saade's answer to What are the most important concepts in C and C++ that should be learnt and understood before a programming interview?). If you don't know STL, spend time learning vectors, maps, sets, unordered maps, unordered sets, queues, stacks, and the entire ""algorithm"" library (seriously, all of it). These are essentially implementations of what you just learned in CLRS, so that if you need to use a heap you won't actually start to code one during an interview (just use a map or priority queue). You also need to know how to implement a linked list, BST, and a trie in 5 minutes flat, which is a lot easier than it sounds (just build a Node class and an insert function and for interview purposes, you're good.) I do not assume that you know anything about the following topics: parallel programming, computer networks (HTTP/TCP/IP/Ethernet), operating systems/scheduling, threads/processes/parallelism/concurrency, assembly, hardware and hardware-descriptive languages, or whatever else. While these are all valuable concepts to know as a computer scientist (as are machine learning and AI and others), the chances that they come up are close to none unless you state them as skills on your resume, so your time is better spent elsewhere (i.e. working on the topics below). You do need to have some awareness of distributed computing, though, so scroll down to the System Design section for that and make sure you read the MapReduce paper at the very least. Day 1 - The Book Buy this book: Elements of Programming Interviews. Phew. That was hard.In all seriousness, this is the best book on the subject in my opinion, and I'm actually really surprised so little people know about it or use it. (I have no affiliation with this book.) The collection of questions is excellent and to-the-point, it is large (300+ problems, which is the most I've seen in one book), they focus on the right concepts (e.g. several problems are on binary search, which is extremely likely to come up in an interview - more so than any other algorithm), and their answers (and the code provided) are almost all correct and excellent. I say ""almost"" because there are 1 or 2 problems which have much simpler solutions than the book details, but it's not an issue, especially when you compare it with other programming interview books, which have several answers which are downright incorrect. Plus the online support community is pretty good, with Java code available for all problems (the book has them in C++ only) and an online forum for discussions over at Home - Elements of Programming Interviews. They also forgo all the 'teaching' stuff that other books have where they try to teach you big-O notation and data structures, and focus almost completely on the problems part, which is much, much, much, much more important. The big-O notation and data structures you should learn from CLRS, which is the best resource for them, period. No other book, especially not programming interview books, come close to its quality in teaching that stuff. I also know (through various sources) that several of these problems are actually asked as-is (or in a disguised form) during interviews, which shows how on-point it is. (I imagine a reason for that may actually be its low popularity compared to other interview books, as companies ban questions that are 'out there' from being asked in interviews, which is why you probably won't see questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.) If this happens to you, however, I suggest you tell your interviewer, as it's very easy for them to tell if you know the problem before or not, and if you just recite the answer it defeats the purpose of the interview. Luckily for me, I wasn't asked any of the problems I'd done from the book. Days 2-14 - Algorithms Stage Go through the book chapter by chapter, one chapter per day[1], starting at Chapter 5, ending at Chapter 19. Do every single problem. All of them. (To be completely honest, I might've skipped a few, but this was more by accident than anything else, and I definitely did like 98%+ of them.) Don't code, solve the problems only (i.e. find the algorithm). Give yourself a deadline per problem, depending on how hard the problem is (for example, 10 minutes for non-ninja[2] problems, 20 minutes for gray-ninja problems, 30-40 minutes for black-ninja problems) - if you haven't found the solution by then, look at the answer and understand it. If you don't you won't improve. It's important to think of the problems on your own, because it's the way of thinking that matters, as you can't go and recite the book on interview day. If you found a solution, make sure it's correct, and that you have thought of all corner cases. Note 1: The new version of the book (which I linked to) has all the ninja problems in a separate chapter (Ch. 22). This, in my opinion, is a terrible idea. The book I had had the problems which are currently in Ch. 22 spread across the book, each in its relevant chapter. I suggest you go through the relevant ninja problems of each chapter while doing said chapter. For example, on Day 2, do Chapter 5, and the Chapter 5-related problems in Chapter 22. On Day 3, do Chapter 6, and the Chapter 6-related problems in Chapter 22, and so on. I believe the problems in Ch. 22 are ordered accordingly (the ninja problems of Ch. 5 come first, then those of Ch. 6, and so on), so this shouldn't be too hard, but I'm not 100% sure as I have the older copy of the book.Note 2: I sometimes spent hours on a single problem, just because I thought the problem was really interesting and I insisted on cracking it myself. I find these random endeavors useful in the long run, as it develops your critical thinking a lot more than the easier problems, but it also takes time, so you likely can't do this for every problem, if you even want to do it at all. Days 14-24 - Coding Stage Repeat the book, this time with coding. You already know the answers, so you should be able to remember the algorithm for each problem pretty quickly (if you don't, look it up. It happens, and it can happen sometimes even if you'd previously figured the problem out by yourself.) This is the coding stage, so don't waste time re-deriving algorithms. I do not suggest you code all problems, especially if you're experienced with ACM-ICPC, TopCoder, or Codeforces and the like (and really, if you're familiar enough with STL, you probably have a decent skill set). Only write the code for problems you feel have complex algorithms, a new data structure you haven't used before (e.g. unordered map for hashing maybe), problems with tricky corner cases (binary search is at the top of this list as its variants are asked often and can be much trickier than you think) or a programming concept you're not comfortable with (these include, but are not limited to, operator overloading, custom comparators, custom hash functions, custom == functions, and much more...) If a problem proves tricky for you, or you implemented it in a way which you feel isn't optimal, look at the solutions the book provides, which are excellent and clean, and will teach you all of the above-mentioned concepts. I suggest you mimic their style of writing code a bit. Some important-if-obvious notes are: use descriptive variable names (none of that 1-letter-variable-name crap) and indent properly, and don't forget to close parentheses and brackets. I also suggest you code all problems from the Greedy Algorithms chapter and almost all ninja-marked problems. The Dynamic Programming chapter is also important if you're not familiar with DP, and can be tough to grasp, so make sure you give it its time. Day 25 - Onto more questions So now that you've exhausted the best question reserve and are comfortable enough to step into an interview, you... need to prep even more. Go to Google Interview Questions (Career Cup). This is a dangerous place. Some very good problems exist, but there's also a class of problems that my ACM trainer likes to call ""Chuck Norris problems"": Problems written where the OP has no idea what's going on and suggests the interviewer required linear time for problems that clearly cannot be done in linear time (like this, which is clearly not linear time: http://www.careercup.com/question?id=14951746), or similar. Now that you've finished Elements of Programming Interviews, you should be easily be able to differentiate between good problems and terrible problems. On Day 25, go through ""all"" (the last 20 pages or so) the Google Questions (even if you're preparing for Facebook) and make a list of the ones you deem 'good', and by 'good' I mean problems you feel might have actually been asked in a Google interview. You know the question style from the book, so you should be able to tell which are legit and which are questionable. I assume you should have a list of something like 80-120 questions in the end, some simple, some not so much. Also note that very few problems actually have correct answers posted on the site, so mainly you'll have to rely on your know-how to figure them out and make sure they're correct, but given your previous prep you won't find it too difficult to know when you should be sure of your answer and when you shouldn't. This is actually valuable prep for the actual interview, which is a similar experience. Days 26-30 - Solving Career Cup Questions Solve all the problems you jotted down on Day 25. Find the algorithm. If you feel it's too difficult, seek help. If you feel it's impossible or the best solution is exponential time, it really might be that the OP was mistaken. Shake it off, move on to another problem. If you still feel like it, code some of the more challenging problems. Several of the Career Cup questions are similar to ones in the book, so you shouldn't have too much trouble with most problems. Day 30.5 - Skip Lists (Google-only) I've heard that Google has recently gotten into the habit of asking about Skip Lists (not sure why). Watch this video:  and understand it and know the analysis of the expected run times. After that, implement and test your very own Skip List. I did this just to practice and because Skip Lists are interesting anyway. To be honest, Google can be pretty unpredictable with their questions sometimes, in my experience. They might ask general questions about object-oriented programming or computer networking, Linux commands like grep, theoretical things like the proof of the sorting lower bound, coding questions that rely on some math concept you may have forgotten to be solved, or in-depth programming language questions (e.g. functors/operator overloading in C++). I guess it depends on your resume and what you claim to be proficient in, so my advice is not to put anything on there that you’re not at least somewhat proficient in. It helps to have a degree in Computer Science or Electrical and Computer Engineering, really, just based on the huge variety in the possible questions. I suggest a read-through of Get that job at Google (Steve Yegge) and Five Essential Phone Screen Questions (Steve Yegge). You should probably know most of the topics covered here (I wouldn’t put my money on things like threads/processes/parallelism coming up unless you explicitly state it on your resume, though.) Most of the coding questions in the second link are too easy to come up in an interview, I think, so don’t get too excited by them, and I’d skip the “Special Fast Track Version” section. It’s humorous but I thought it’s way too cynical and off-point. Your choice of text editor, knowledge of OS, or knowledge of one vs. multiple languages will not, in and of themselves, make you fail an interview. On a small note, though I believe Google may ask a lot of non-algorithmic questions as above, the bulk of the interview will still be data structures/algorithms/coding, so all the other things mentioned in Yegge’s blog you should know, but they’re not the main focus. Day 31 - The Non-Technical Stuff Okay, so I'm cheating a bit by adding Day 31, but you should also take a day or so to prepare for the non-technical part of the interviews, especially if you're interviewing at Facebook, where there's a non-technical interview. First, prepare questions you want to ask your interviewers about Facebook and about their job and what they do all day. See my Facebook London post for more examples on this. Second, think over your experiences in college/work/whatever - projects you've worked on, teams you've worked with or managed, conflicts you've addressed, hard bugs you've had to deal with, etc. Google-search ""behavioral questions"" and you'll find thousands of possible questions. Prepare a non-generic answer for ""Why Facebook"" (hint: the fast pace and culture, the great talent in the company, the mission to connect the world...) and ""Why Google"" (hint: the diversity of the endeavors, the awesomeness of search and Android, the mission to do awesome things, the company culture...). I wasn't asked these questions in either company (to my disappointment since I was really passionate about both and couldn't wait to show it), but I squeezed in my interest while asking my questions to the interviewer, so use that opportunity if you really want to impart something that you didn't get the chance to. Tips for the Interviews Numbers 3,4,7,8,9 are the most important points. You might be nervous before an interview, but it'll pass. I was nervous before every single interview. Once the interviewer stepped in and we started talking, I generally had a blast because I really loved talking with them and solving these kinds of problems. Try your best not to be too nervous: do mock interviews and the like. I also recommend scheduling interviews in an increasing-priority order, so that you get used to it and find out your shortcomings by the time you reach your most-wanted company.Practice coding without a compiler/on a whiteboard/paper. I did neither, but I have the C++ syntax memorized and I'm used to coding on a paper in ACM competitions, so you might not need to do this if you're already comfortable enough with your favorite language (you only need to know one language well, by the way, as long as it's reasonably well-known, like C++/Java/Python. They let you use whatever language you like during the interview.)Corner cases can kill you. You really have to practice on finding and dealing with corner cases, and/or recognizing what I call ""corner-case-prone problems"". Some problems are dead simple algorithmically but can be very tricky to code, and I got 2 of these problems, once in my Google phone interviews, and once in my Facebook phone interviews.After finding the algorithm, stop, pause, and think about how to code it, before you actually do. This is especially true for the harder problems, and I would've failed one of my interviews had I not done this, and as a result, would never have gotten a job at FB. I also might've passed an interview at Google which I failed, if I'd taken my advice in this step at the time.Think out loud about algorithms/ideas as you come up with them. It's fine to pause and think quietly for a bit, but don't stand there for 3 minutes without a word. Always at least give the simple solution, which very well might not have a great run-time, but it won't hurt. I did it in all my interviews no matter how simple the answer was, but I said them directly and noted that there's probably a better solution, then proceeded to think of that. (e.g: Okay, to search a sorted array, we can scan it linearly, but this is an O(n) solution and there's likely something faster). Also, don't be cocky about it (question yourself out loud until you're sure of your method and have a rough proof that your method works). Don't argue with your interviewer. 99.99% of the time, they're right, and you're wrong. One possible exception to this is if they’re challenging your code: they’re either really pointing out a bug to you, or trying to make it seem that way to see how confident you are in your code and if you’ll agree blindly or protest that your code is actually correct (if this happens, don’t panic, just think well about your answer before you give it.)Don't talk through your code line by line as you write it. Interviewers know how to read your code and what if-statements and for-loops are. Only speak about the general structure of the code (which you should've mentioned before anyway, as per Tip #4) while coding. Do, however, mention what you're doing in intricate lines of code (for example, if you want to test if 'x' is a power of 2 via ""if(x & (x-1))==0"", you might want to mention that.)Questions are so often underspecified, and this is a huge weakness of Elements of Programming Interviews: all problems are specified completely, so you have next to no training on this. Always think of questions you might ask or conditions that might make your algorithm fail if not true. Some examples are: Are all numbers positive? Are they distinct? What is the type of the input (integer/double...)? Can you revisit a grid cell? The book has questions where these properties are specified explicitly in the question: think about what would happen if these conditions weren't there: the solution often breaks down.Don't give up if you don't think of the answer directly. In my last Facebook interview, I got the most challenging problem yet, and it took me about 5 minutes to get to the answer, and I ended up hired. That was actually possibly *the* interview that got me hired, and it was also the one I most enjoyed.Two really important concepts to know well are binary search (and its variants) and searching the state-space using Breadth-First-Search to find some shortest sequence of 'moves' (like this problem: ACM-ICPC Live Archive - Kermit the Frog). Both come up very often.Luck matters. The interview process isn't perfect, and you might not pass it even if you're really good, as it depends on your interviewers and what questions you get (and what type of questions you're strong in, etc.) You can mitigate this factor a lot by prepping a huge amount, but it's always there, and it's important to know. I suggest you read Get that job at Google (Steve Yegge's blog) if you want some more detail about this factor.Ignore Ch. 20 and 21 in the book. They're not great. (Maybe read through Ch. 21 a bit to get an idea but that's it.) Scroll down to the System Design section if you also have to prepare for a system design interview.Undersell yourself on your CV (or at least, don't oversell yourself), especially if applying through a referral. If you write 'expert in C++', they're going to call up their senior-most C++ engineer to get you to crash and burn. I've never met anyone who got anything related to multithreading and parallelism in an interview for SWE, except one person who listed it as a skill. And lo and behold, he was asked about it, and it didn’t go so well.Oftentimes, you'll get a problem which is a variant of a problem you've seen before in the book or on Career Cup, or is the same problem but in a ""disguised form"" (i.e. it's worded differently but it has the same or a mostly similar solution.) Be careful about these subtle differences; you might figure out (or think that you've figured out) the solution for the problem because you found it very similar to one you've seen before, but a small difference in the problem statement actually means its solution is really really different. As an example, check out question 17.5 - Search for a sequence in a 2D array - in Elements of Programming Interviews. It includes the statement ""It is acceptable to visit an entry in A more than once."" With it, the solution is DP. If that statement is not included (i.e. it's not acceptable to visit an entry more than once), the solution is branch-and-bound, and there's no DP involved at all. If you wrongly answer DP instead of branch-and-bound or vice versa, the interviewer will know you've seen the other problem before and think you've just memorized the solution, so that's probably enough by itself to give you a ""no-hire"" recommendation from that interviewer. (I'd also venture a guess that that statement wouldn't be stated by the interviewer at all first, exactly for this reason, and you'd have to ask whether or not you can visit an entry more than once, as per tip #7. The goal is to see whether or not you'll figure out that there's a huge difference in solutions depending on the interviewer's answer to this question.)Again, I probably forgot a whole lot of stuff, so if there's anything specific you want to know, leave a comment. I'll also do my best to keep this post updated with whatever other important things I remember later. System Design Even though I didn't have one myself, I did prepare for the System Design interviews. I prepared by visiting this site: Hired In Tech, which is decent (not great) and by reading several papers on this site, straight from Google: Distributed Systems and Parallel Computing, mainly the first MapReduce paper (near the very end of the page) and the Chubby paper. MapReduce is very important and I really suggest you read it and understand how it works. After those steps, look up databases, specifically SQL and NoSQL, get acquainted with the CAP theorem, scalability topics, and maybe read up on Hadoop and some problems you can solve with it (Hadoop In Practice is a decent book for these purposes). Try some questions like the ""Design a URL shortener"" question on Hired In Tech, or something larger scale like ""Design a web search engine"" or ""Design Google Maps"", all questions which may be asked (also check Ch. 21 of the book for possible questions and a small idea of how to answer them - though the book's answers aren't great.) But in general, for the system design interview, practicing on questions is less meaningful than fundamentally understanding the above concepts and knowing how to discuss them, as the entire interview is something like a quick conversation between you and the interviewer, where he/she will change the question specifications on the fly to see how you deal with different scenarios. Final Advice So, if you really want that job, it’s going to take some time and dedication, but hopefully it’s the enjoyable kind. I personally really enjoyed preparing these kinds of questions and found that, job aside, I really learned a lot and got a good deal of knowledge out of the preparation, and you probably will too. My final piece of advice is to just go into the interview and not be stressed out (this is obviously easier said than done). The engineers want you to be good and they want to hire you – hiring is a pretty expensive process. Some may be easygoing, and some may be less forgiving, but in all cases, the interview is very similar to a conversation between two engineers, and that’s exactly what these companies strive for the interview to be, so just treat it that way, and if you’ve prepared well, it’ll show. [1] - One chapter per day is actually a bit slow since you're not coding, so for shorter chapters such as Chapters 5, 7, 8, 9, I suggest you do 2 per day, which is feasible.[2] - In Elements of Programming Interviews, non-ninja problems are standard problems, gray-ninja problems are somewhat difficult, and black-ninja problems are difficult.

And secondly to have a experience in some A grade firm and that's why he joined Infosys but the catch is he haven't apply for any IT related role because for that he need to be serious about his job as well. So as a smart person he applied for Infosys BPO where you need to focus on data entry kind of stuff. I remembered my roommate saying that he doesn't even bother to be involved or mixing with the teammate, you assign the task to him and he will just focus to complete the job and back to home. Which I think is fair enough since his ultimate goal is to get a one year experience certificate, if anyone is have curiosity of what his job role then he work for an Insurance process where he need to allocate a proper insurance cover to the customer. And guess what the insurance company is a renowned company from US. So even his fortune is working in his way.

Full-time employment in a team is order of magnitude more effective in advancing your career further. You will learn on the job from more experienced peers, you will get yourself familiar with established development processes that makes everyone more productive, and you will get accustomed to the necessary discipline that enables larger, long term projects. Excellent full-stack programmers often start with being experts in a narrower field. To start straight with self-employment means to bypass this important step, to reinvent a bunch of wheels and to progress slowly. If you're a professional programmer with years of full-time experience and just looking around, I can name a few things: 1. If you're already a valued professional in a team, especially if you're an expert in a narrow ""esoteric"" field, it's possible to reach agreement with your manager that you leave the company and join them back as a self-employed contractor. This requires being high level, being experienced, being valued, having great network, and being great at negotiations. Based on my observations of my friends and acquaintances, this is the only (and very rare) opportunity to make more money as self-employed comparing to being a full-time employee. 2. Make your own start-up. At early stage you'll be happily self-employed. 3. Write commodity software like ""tool"" apps for desktop or mobile. Mobile apps may be easier to produce end-to-end. But easier to produce also means easier to clone. Get ready that success will be short if your idea is simple. There are other risks, too. For example, apps based on reverse-engineered API of some service may quickly go out of business once API is published. 4. There are plenty of short-term or medium-term contract jobs out there (see job sites like dice, monster, glassdoor, linkedin), which are usually filled via agencies. Most jobs with posted salary usually are of this kind. You work full time at an agency, AKA ""bodyshop"", and they sell your billable hours to companies. Your salary is usually 2-5 times less than what they bill. Although it may look like an opportunity for self-employment, it's not... Most client companies won't deal with individuals (except for p.1., see above), and if they do, they will offer lower rate. 5. There are plenty of freelance programming websites, where you can sign up for short term projects. It ranges from ""help me with CS homework"" to ""make a clone of well-known website"". This is suitable if you enjoy boring simple work, able to produce low quality quickly, and satisfied with rates in $5-20/hour range. As far as I know, $30/hour is peak. It often works well with outsourcing, when a programmer resides in a country where $20/hour is good money. From a client's point of view, several of my friends confirmed that it's often cheaper to hire a full-time experienced engineer for $80-120/hour than pay an $30/hour for low quality and poorly organized work, which takes much longer and with lower success rate. A few general observations about self-employment in IT (note: perhaps, this is slightly biased because I am in the U.S.): *) Comparing to full time, it's WAY harder to make good money, do interesting projects, develop yourself professionally, create good network, etc. Successful self-employed programmers are rare and they usually know what they want to do, so they don't seek out random opportunities. *) Short-term contracts and outsourced work is only effective with small and simple projects. They are usually ineffective to help with career growth, and it's not the kind of experience which will make your resume shine. Interesting, challenging and big projects are almost never outsourced. *) If you know what you want to do, it's usually beneficial to first work full time a few years, developing similar products as a part of a team. Startup founders often work a few years in various other startups prior to starting their own, so they quickly get full-stack developer knowledge with smaller risk. Team work skill is also useful if you want to grow your business further. *) Self-employment is not for everyone. There is a common misconception that self-employment allows more money, better choice of projects and tasks, more flexible schedule, less stress. All of it is opposite from true. In most cases it's less money, riskier job, more stressful, smaller choice, less flexible schedule and more stress. It's rational for situations like you don't need money and you're interested in an idea with very vague and remote business value. Or if you're specifically seeking for adventure, stress and risk. Or if you have a very specific idea in mind and you aren't open to do anything else. If the problem is lack of full time jobs in your city and you don't want to move, I'd recommend remote jobs - they are full time but with meetings over VC/phone and occasional business trips. If you just want to use significantly more time for family, get a full time job for a year, then take a year off, or arrange part-time flexible schedule. Many companies offer that today. If you’re a beginner programmer asking this question, my recommendation in the context of career advice would be against self-employment. Full-time employment in a team is order of magnitude more effective in advancing your career further. You will learn on the job from more experienced peers, you will get yourself familiar with established development processes that makes everyone more productive, and you will get accustomed to the necessary discipline that enables larger, long term projects.

If you are working for many extra hours, then you should be worried if you are lacking the productivity or manager is giving you so much extra work. You have to correct whatever it is and work only in office hours.Why should I worry about understanding other systems which are related to the project, I will only focus on mine - This is one thing which every other new engineer thinks but this differentiates between an average engineer and a good engineer. Understanding other systems might bring you three big benefits: a) You aren't in that company just to work forever but learn as much as you can. So, learn it. b) You can avoid any incorrect assumption which you would make otherwise. c) You can see any flaw in the whole solution proposed, which can lead you to become a star. d) No one else knows about this project more than you know.

I will not cross question him - He might be coming directly from a business meeting and would be in same mindset for some time.

So, sharing the knowledge will make you more famous instead.I think that I am correct but I shouldn't argue with the senior engineer. He is senior, he must be correct - Yes, there are very high chances that the senior engineer is correct. But you have to learn and grow, hesitation will stop your learning growth. Conflicts are the best opportunities to grow yourself, since you can learn something new.This tool is already built, I needn't worry about how it works - At least, this is definitely going to be one of the interview questions if you plan to switch and in addition, understanding the already built components will add to your knowledge as they are already proven successful.This decision is made already, I needn't understand the reasonings behind that - Don't miss any such opportunity. More than coding, problem solving and design are more important and valuable to learn. You will get only a few design projects or good problems to solve yourself, but you can still learn these things even in other projects too.My job is only to develop software, not worry about security, backend, testing, user experience - When you learnt everything while doing engineering, why not start now ? This differentiates between an average engineer and a good one. Go for the top. Apart from all other answer given here, I would like to add few more points from my work experience at Amazon (company) : (To give you little background, at Amazon as SDE, we have to work on almost everything I.e., from design till security and testing. So, this experience is based on that.)  Let me complete this project then I will definitely start going to gym  - This is a myth and never going to happen. Your manager is not paid lakhs of rupees to keep you sitting ideal. You will always feel that you just have to finish this then you will get little more free time and start doing other things.IContinue Reading",2021-03-05T09:16:25.944Z,"What are mistakes which software engineers make in their early years?

We take a ton of pride in our community and look for passionate people above all else. In a nutshell, the admissions process looks like this: 1. Online Application - Fill out our application Don’t be afraid to be yourself. Doing something like this won’t hurt either.2. Interview - We’ll set up time for a quick Skype chat, so we can talk a bit more about your application and learn about who you are as a person. No need to prep for this one. We want to hear your story and why you want to join our community.3. Code Assignment - After the interview, we’ll ask you to make something. Once you’ve submitted your code, we’ll schedule a time for you to walk through it with one of our instructors. At this point I’ve interviewed thousands of candidates, and have had to make a lot of really hard decisions about which people to select for our classes. Unfortunately,there are plenty of highly qualified applicants that don’t get admitted to FlatironSchool. Honestly, there’s so much demand for programming skills that acceptance rates are low across the board at programming schools (ours is ~6% as of 10/2014). Here are a few of the big things you can do to help yourself stand out: Be Passionate Our students put a lot of faith in us to make a huge difference in their lives, and that's not a responsibility we take lightly. Our goal is nothing short of changing our students' lives - what they do professionally and who they are as people. The best way we know how to do that is by showing them how to fall in love with what they're doing.  We want to know you are passionate about learning to code and don't just see it as a means to an end—as a way to get a cool job or start a tech startup. While those are perfectly good reasons for learning this, we’re looking for people who see code as a craft to which they want to devote their careers. This is actually one of the hardest things for us to assess in the admissions process. As I mentioned, we usually we look for people who’ve at least started learning to code on their own and know that they enjoy it. We also look for people who’ve demonstrated the ability to be passionate about something—anything, even. Do you love to cook? Do you blog prolifically or volunteer often? Are you a chess master or top rated Fiddle player? Cool- let us know. We've had students just like you :) Be Determined Your pet projects and successes in other careers are really important to us, no matter how unrelated to code they are. They show that you’ve got grit (passion and perseverance for long-term goals) — a predictor of success that transcends both talent and the ability to learn faster than others. Today, it’s easier than ever to learn how to program, but it can still be an incredibly frustrating, arduous process, whether you’re in a program or teaching yourself. It’s hard, and we want our students to be successful, not just early in their careers, but 20 years down the line. It takes a lot of determination to do that. Demonstrate Smarts Our courses are intense, so we want applicants that show the intellectual stamina they’ll need to pick up material and get through it.  There’s a misconception that programmers are employed to be quantitatively minded factory workers who churn out code, but we see it as more art than assembly line work. Like playing an instrument or writing music, we consider programming a mode of expression that requires people to think about problems in highly structured ways. And we keep an eye out for creative people who have already proved they can think like this. If you’re a great communicator, a musician, or an artist, you might have this kind of aptitude, and it is way more important to us than where you went to school or how good you are at coding when you apply. Be Interesting Tell us what makes you you. Share whatever interesting perspective you can bring to the table—how or where you grew up, what your values you are, why you’ve made certain decisions in your life, etc.  We never admit a student into Flatiron School. We admit a class. We see programming as a creative endeavor and work really hard to bring people together that can boost the creativity of the entire group. So the big goal of the admissions process is to craft a class that represents a purposefully diverse student body. While this certainly means diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender, we go out of our way to seek diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We like to bring together amazing people who normally would not have found each other. These have included venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, professional athletes, chemists, musicians, pro-poker players, and literal rocket scientists. If you're incredible at one thing, we think that's because you're smart and worked hard at it, and it's likely, that being in a room full of highly motivated, smart people, from different backgrounds, you'll be incredible at this. This also means that someone that doesn’t get admitted into one class can get admitted later on. I've had to turn away some incredibly nice, smart, passionate people, because even though they fit all our criteria, they were McKinsey consultants and we already had 3 in the class- we'd rather give that next spot to a musician, or an artist.  That's what allows our students to be better together than they ever could separately. Build Something Show us you love programming. You don’t have to be an expert, but it really helps to have gone through some online coursework, or even some of the Flatiron School Prework. Even better, build an simple website or app and show it to us. Flatiron School is really big commitment. It’s 70+ hours of work per week for three months. We are sure that anyone can learn to program, but learning in this intense of an environment can be really difficult. It’s totally cool if they aren’t experts, yet. Part of why we give them code challenges is to make sure they have enough experience to know they are going to love learning to program. Actually taking initiative, learning on your own a bit, and making a simple app is the best way to show us you know what you’re getting into. Plus, if you hate it, it’s sure going to save you a lot of time :). Come Say Hi Finally, we’re hanging out on campus in New York City every day. Our contact info is on our website, and we hold public Meetups  almost every week. If you’re in the NYC, there’s no reason not to stop by one and introduce yourself. You’ll get a better sense of where you’d be learning and with whom you’d be working. Most importantly, you can decide whether or not you like us in person :). -- To summarize: we have to make a lot of tough choices in our admissions process. It’s competitive, and while we could grow super fast by opening up more spots, we try to focus on providing the absolute best experience to our students. If you want to standout, show us you’re smart, kind, totally excited about learning, and think really hard about how to best express this in your application.  Hopefully we’ll see you soon!",2021-03-05T09:16:54.557Z,"How can I best prepare for Flatiron School’s admissions process? ",Quora

Seed A: Sure, I will wait here with you.Life is very easy here;why should I grow;Why should I go outside;why should I work hard,;Why should I care about my responsibilities? After few hours Seed A asked the same question, but Seed B denied again in style. This cycle went on… Now here is a question for you all, Question 1: Have you ever stopped working, because no-one was there to appreciate you? Question 2: Have you ever woken up, and slept again because you believe its not the correct time? Question 3: Have you ever thought over the word commitment seriously, what does it mean for you, does it mean that you are working for an office job or as an student, so doing homework on time or doing office work with half your heart because it is not a part of your commitment? If you are planning something and not achieving it, are you sure you are committed to your plan, or Out of 10 how much marks will you give yourself for your commitment level? Do you have any plan to increase your commitment score? Question 4: Have you worked hard yesterday? Question 5: Are you going to work hard today? Do you know that Seed A wants to grow and go outside and face the world but he was not getting courage to go outside alone, or he may be too much used to the pleasure of staying inside his own small world. But Seed A was not aware that growing or making progress is an individual process , and on the path of progress you need to walk alone, because its a path of your life, no-one can drag you ;they only can guide you. But running or walking or sitting ideal will be your decision.  But what keeps seed A driving, the insane desire to go out, and why because he wants to explore the outer world. And one day Seed A rose above all the questions and became the master of his own thoughts and decided to grow without thinking anything else other than growth and progress. After few years he became one of the most significant trees in the area.  Here a question for you: “If a thought/idea is a seed , do you have the insane attitude to make it a tree?” What this story teaches us is about productivity, 1- You need to identify what drives you and why it drives you? Are you seed B who just wants to take rest, or you are seed A who had an immense desire to grow. 2- Once you get the answer to point 1, you need to figure out a daily basis plan for the same, please remember every personal plan should have four stages: Stage 1: Learning Once you are aware and clear that you want to grow, and want to have insane productivity, try to master every skill in that area, if you are trader, try to master communication, interpersonal skills , try to master calculations etc. In short for insane productivity first step is to have insane desire to learn. I once went so insane that I wrote the same algorithm more than 70 times so that i could learn. Are you that much insane to learn new things? If yes then start dreaming!!! If you got a belief that for your field you are the best student or say noone can learn better than you!! You can start dreaming !!  Stage 2: Earning Once you have learnt enough, you can start earning, but always remember, for any business transaction “ Your time is the most valuable commodity”, so invest your time wisely. Stage 3: Legacy We all want to have a legacy of our own ;may be we are writing on quora because it can serve us as a legacy. Always be careful about every aspect of your personality. This stage involves lot of leadership skills.  “Every word of yours, every work, every decision is your legacy, chose it wisely” Now here is a point, for insane productivity you need to have a good sense of legacy that you are going to create. Your legacy defines your productivity. Stage 4: Golden Days Golden day is when you have maximum credibility, golden is when you have become the master of your subject and your one word is enough to solve the problem. When you become the master, you are already on the stage of apex productivity, but to reach golden days, you need to be the best student, best earner, and a legend by creating everlasting positive legacy.  Let me tell you one thing, most of us failed in stage 1, i.e most of cannot be insane in learning, so how we can think of consistency in productivity. In short learning attitude is and was and would be the secret of insane productivity. At the end I want to say something out of the context that you should always keep in mind while doing any work I believe that it will help you in attaining insane productivity:  Never care about outcomes while you are doing a good work, because you can only control your work, not the outcome.

There are a few different strategies: Outwork everyone by putting in more hours:I do recommend this in the context of trainings and skill development (to really understand and practice the lessons you’re getting, which is of excellent quality and being paid for by the Firm…in a tradeoff with current project needs vs. useful for rest of your life, choose the one with longer term value).I don’t recommend this for the particular problem you’re solving today (see next bullet for better approach)Build a toolkit that improves your productivity:This is an underused model which will give you tremendous rewards (and upside potential over the course of your career)Get to know practice experts, assistants, support personnel (research), communications folks - they all can help you get answers better and faster by pulling on a broader team. They appreciate when a consulting team respects the many unique skills that they can bring to the table, builds their contribution into the schedule as a non-emergency, and recognizes them for their contributions publicly with the team and partners (or even puts them in front of clients)Put together workflow and tooling that reduces time spent on low value add work (ie outsourcing powerpoint production, automating time calendaring, spending too much managing synchronizing story, data/ version control, learning intermediate and advanced functions in your top tools like excel, etc). Spend small amounts of money on these things…don’t forget what your client is spending on your time hourlyBe a menschBe helpful when people are strugglingParticipate in knowledge development and sharingBe supportive/ empathetic when you see people above you doing the best they can but maybe not what you want/ need at the moment (this part I didn’t realize til after I left…we’re all learning in this life and sometimes that process is messy…no reason to make it worse.

Listener: Myself. Speaker: So, to whom should the question be directed? Or should we talk about time? What do you waste? Do you waste time, or do you also waste resources? You also waste life and you waste everything that comes to you. Somebody who is wasteful, would he waste only time or would he waste a lot of other things as well? So, is time the real issue or is it ‘me’ that I should to talk about? What should I talk about? When you ask that how to utilize time, you have made a very arrogant assumption. Your assumption is- ‘Everything is alright with me, it is just this small aspect of time utilization that I falter in. Everything else is good’. It is like this that there is something wrong with my entire physical system, my blood, my very blood has a lot of impurities and because of this there are a lot of symptoms that are showing up in my body: my heart is under-pressure, my kidneys are not functioning well, my lever is enlarged, I keep feeling sleepy, I keep forgetting, my brain doesn’t function properly, the blood is impure, there are few pimples on my face. I go to the doctor and say, ‘Sir, my problem is that I have a few pimples on my face’. Now, am I wise when I say that the pimple is my problem? Is my problem only that I have pimples? What is my problem? My entire being is my problem. My very blood is my problem. Right? But what am I focusing on? Pimples ! Now the doctor can give you a cream that will remove the pimples. Will that solve your problem? This pimple gone, another pimple will come up. Right or Wrong? Have you not seen that happen? It clears from here and comes somewhere else or sometimes at the same spot. We don’t even know that what the real issue is. It is not about time at all. Don’t ask that how to manage time. Don’t ask that how to utilize time. Ask yourself, ‘How do I manage myself’? Because it is the self that is wasting the time. It is the self that is wasting everything that is around it. There are thousand opportunities that come to you, life itself is a grand opportunity, but the self is squandering all the opportunities. Not only time, everything else as well. So, we will go to the more basic question, to the more useful question and that is how to manage the mind, because it is the mind that wastes time. We will forget time. Nobody can manage time. Time just flows, time cannot be managed. What can be managed? The Self. My own mind that needs to be managed. We will look at that. You need to then ask yourself, ‘What does my mind find attractive?’ What does your mind do most of the time? There are twenty-four hours in the day for everybody. Ask yourself that where do these twenty-four hours go. Where does my mind spend these twenty-four hours in? When you will look at this, you will come across your values. You will come to know what is it that is preferred in life. Because whatever you prefer in life is where you spend your time. If you have told yourself that the biggest pleasure in life is sleeping, then don’t be surprised if you find that you sleep eleven hours a day. ‘Why do I sleep eleven hours a day? Because I have thoroughly convinced myself that sleeping is the highest happiness’. Similarly, if you have convinced yourself that roaming around here and there, is the biggest pleasure that is possible, then don’t be surprised if you spend four hours gossiping, because you have told that to your own mind. We are looking at the mind now. Right? We have kept time behind, we are looking at the mind. We said that we will find out how do we spend our time. And when we find that out, we immediately come upon our values. ‘What have I told myself to be valuable?’ Whatever you have told yourself to be valuable, you will find that your time is going there. Let me ask this to you- to how many of you this happens that you want to find time for doing something but unable to find time for it? With how many of you does this happen? (Some listeners raise their hands). Please be assured that somewhere you are convinced that the thing for which you cannot find time, that thing is not important. It is embedded deep in your psyche that it is not important. So, howsoever much you try, you will still find no time. Had it been really been important, had you been careful enough to really examine and see its importance, time would have made itself available, because there are twenty-four hours in a day for everybody. How is it possible that somebody finds time and somebody does not find time? You are the one who is allotting time and you allot the time according to your values. It is a question of values. What do you find valuable? ‘I find it deeply valuable that one must sit with the family and watch television’. So, don’t be surprised if three hours a day you are doing that. ‘My definition of valuable friendship is when I talk 3 hours a day to somebody on mobile phone’. So, don’t be surprised if you talk three hours a day on mobile phone. You are spending time exactly according to your values, not even a second is spent otherwise. Be convinced, time does not slip away. Time strictly follows your values. So, if you say that I don’t know, time just flies away, then you are deceiving yourself. No, time never flies away. Every second of it is controlled by your mind. If you do not find time for studying, the conclusion is obvious that you do not find studying valuable. In your value system, you do not accord priority to studying, that is why you cannot give time to studying. In your value system, had studying been important, time would have presented itself. Is this becoming clear? It is not about time at all, it is about ‘my mind’, the values enshrined in it. Is this becoming clear?when you will find what is really valuable in your life, then you will find time for it. Do you know what is really valuable? Have you ever given a thought to it? What is really valuable in life? What is really important? Listener 1: Money. Listener 2: Happiness. Listener 3: Time. Listener 4: How do I find out what is really valuable? Acharya Prashant: : Nice, four or five responses have come. I asked that do we know what is really valuable. There are four or five responses. Somebody said money, somebody said happiness, somebody said time. One of you said something else and then there was this girl who says that how do I know what is really valuable. There are others who are already convinced about what is really valuable. If money is really valuable, what would you spend most of your time doing? Dreaming about money, and that is what you do. Dream, have money, without asking that who is it that is having money and how is that money benefiting him. It must be from some source that you have gathered this notion that money is the most important thing. Somebody said, ‘Happiness’. Yes, good ! What is happiness? Is happiness that which you experience on listening a joke? Is happiness that which you experience upon achieving a target? What is happiness? Why must happiness be different for different people? Why does happiness vary for the same man at different times? Today, something is happiness for you, ten years back your doll was the greatest happiness for you. What is the value of such happiness that keeps on changing? What is happiness? One has to find out. I am inviting you to this. When I was your age, this was one question that was so important for me – what is valuable in life? I was very clear that I will not commit myself to any path till this question is answered. How can I just start doing something without knowing that it is really valuable? I have these few years of my life with me and I have one life. How can I spend this life doing something of which I am not convinced? And at the end of it, what will happen? If I see that I have wasted my time in pursuit that has no value at all, is that not horrible? You are 70 years of age, you are dying, and you realize that I have spent my life doing something that had no value. Tell me. Won’t that be horrible? And I am telling you 99.99% of this world faces that horror daily. Your so-called grown ups, the so-called successful people, the so-called super achievers, they all are realizing this every second that they have wasted their life doing something which is not valuable at all. Why are people quick to jump to conclusions? Why do you quickly commit yourself? Why can’t you investigate? And she has put it very nicely, ‘How do I find out what is really valuable?’ Listener 3: Sir, we have already been told what is valuable. Acharya Prashant : Good ! Very good ! So you have something to start with. You have already something to start with and it coming from outside. You have already been told what is valuable. What is valuable? A huge car is valuable. A huge mansion is valuable. A bank statement that has ten zeros behind it is very valuable. And all these things have been told to you by your so-called well wishers! They have already filled you up with what is valuable and you are chasing that without examining whether it is really valuable. Naved is so right. How can I inquire what is valuable, when I have already been told what is valuable? The inquiry has been closed. We have been told that there is no need to inquire. Getting married is valuable! Having two kids is valuable! Having a house is valuable! Being respected is valuable! And you will say, ‘Yes Sir, everybody says that. Are these not valuable? Why should I say no’. I am saying that go and find out. Why can’t you find out that whether these things are really valuable? When you will discover what is not valuable, then that which is really valuable will start showing up. It will silently start shining. But first you will have to reject all that which is rubbish but you are mistakenly thinking to be of value. Are you getting it? So many of you believe that fakeness is valuable. So many of you believe that living a structured life is so valuable. Are we not intelligent? Don’t we have our own eyes. Don’t we have our own mind to examine. Can’t we go close and see whether these things are really of any importance? Will we have just beliefs for some fake values? If you just want to believe, then why are you studying science? Does science tell you to believe or does it tell you to go close and ask questions, examine and experiment? Tell me. Does science tell you to be a superstitious? Just believe anything. They have told me that going to the temple every Tuesday is very valuable, very important. So, go. Do you know why you are going there? And if you don’t know, why must you go there? Do you even know what the temple is? Then what are you doing in the temple? You have been told that you must always look good, you must be praise-worthy, people should say nice things about you, you should be respected. Do you understand that what is praise? Do you understand that what is respect? Then why you should feel bad when somebody does not respect you? Without understanding something, why have you given it so much importance? Get married. Settle down, have a family. Do you understand that what is marriage? And if you don’t understand, why you are getting restless to get married? Why do you feel devastated if you see somebody not getting married? Do you know that what is really important in life? And if you don’t know, then open your eyes and see. It is not a huge secret. It is an obvious fact if only you bother to inquire. You are intelligent, you have the capability. Just open your eyes and see. I assure you that all of you are capable of looking at the facts, are capable of being in the truth, if only you are not afraid, if only you have not closed your eyes believing that I already know everything. ~~~~~~~~~ Sharing with you,",2021-03-05T09:22:41.362Z,"How can I make better use of my time?

I always noodled around, sometimes semi-professionally, and wrote various tools for game projects both commercial and hobby. Lots of Perl, lots of C, lots of Lua, and even a pretty serious toolchain made mostly out of DOS batch files (hey, it worked). Recently I decided I wanted to up the ante, so I sought and accepted a contract gig that required me to develop an eBook toolchain and an accompanying iPad app. The toolchain is web-based and is written mainly in PHP. The iPad app is Objective-C, obviously. I had to learn a lot on the fly, but I got it done and the client was very happy. And I get to put ""programmer"" on my resume (although I am keenly aware that I am not in the league of the many amazing programmers I've met during my video game career). In doing this I was applying a quote from Stephen Colbert. He said that in his early career his approach was to deliberately get himself into trouble so that he'd have to get himself out again. That made a lot of sense to me, so I did it with a programming gig that - frankly - I wasn't 100% qualified for. I also stumbled across this article: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html ...and was somewhat emboldened. I took the time to write ""FizzBuzz"" and found it trivially easy (I used gcc on MacOSX to compile and test it). I've always been a self-starter on this stuff. I enjoy programming immensely and get cravings to do it, so ""study"" has never been a problem. I think I would probably benefit from some structured learning (like a class of some kind), but it never seems to fit with my schedule. So I favor learning my doing... with the internet, github, etc., access to sample code has never been easier. The number of frameworks and free tools available is truly incredible. And I make a policy of not being daunted by the unfamiliar... nine times out of ten you just need to get over the initial hump and things are simpler than they initially seem.  With programming especially you need to be willing to understand the paradigm of the domain you're working in. Most languages, tool, dev environments encode many assumptions about how to work, and in general I find it more productive to try to learn what those assumptions are (asking an expert helps a lot) rather than trying to force every tool to work the way I think it should. I have done this. I always dabbled in programming but never had much in the way of formal training (I started a CS degree, but left to go work as a designer in the video game industry). I always noodled around, sometimes semi-professionally, and wrote various tools for game projects both commercial and hobby. Lots of Perl, lots of C, lots of Lua, and even a pretty serious toolchain made mostly out of DOS batch files (hey, it worked). Recently I decided I wanted to up the ante, so I sought and accepted a contract gig that required me to develop an eBook toolchain and an accompanying iPad app. Th Continue Reading",2021-03-05T09:23:23.317Z,"How have people made a career change to programming?

I have divided my explanation into 3 sub sections to make you to easily understand the IoT concept. Hardware Layer -Should have a basic understanding on Low-powered device (embedded micro-controllers) and sensor data acquisition.

I have divided my explanation into 3 sub sections to make you to easily understand the IoT concept. Hardware Layer -Should have a basic understanding on Low-powered device (embedded micro-controllers) and sensor data acquisition. There are range of low powered micro-controller platforms which you can easily prototype basic IoT applications e.g: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beagleboard and more. Also you should know how to interface external hardware device such as sensors, actuators with micro-controller platform (These things can be easily set it up on a breadboard or perfboard). These interfacing hardware may comes as a standalone micro-chip unit (e.g: have to refer the device datasheet to understand how to use), sensor breakout boards (wiring interfaces are properly labelled to connect with micro-controller) or sensor shields (easy plug and play to micro-controller to start work). Also you should learn how to program a micro-controller. PIC (C), C++, Arduino C, Python are some of the general purpose programming languages which can be used to program micro-controller platforms. Also knowing real-time operating system concepts such as threading, processes scheduling, interrupts, I/O, memory management, semaphore and timer would help to function the hardware platform in a more robust and efficient way. Connectivity Layer - (Networking)There are two networking types which we can adapt to establish connectivity between IoT applications. 1. Ad-Hoc mode2. Infrastructure mode Ad-Hoc mode of networking is needed when the application required to make short range data communication. Most of the time this nature of connectivity will be a full-duplex data exchange between microcontroller platform and interfacing devices (sensors, actuators, mobile phones and other microcontrollers) bi-directionally. Infrared, RFID, Blutooth, WiFi (Adhoc mode), XBee some of the commonly used connectivity technologies in IoT applications. Adaptability of these technology range may vary based on application requirements and usability. Infrastructure mode of networking is needed when the IoT application demand to exchange data in a long range and distributed data environment. Preferably the communication will flow through a commonly accessible network gateway to exchange data between two remote endpoints (via GPRS or Ethrenet). Both GPRS and Ethernet mode support HTTP/TCP protocols to communicate over Internet. In this case the interfacing hardware act as as client and the data receiving end will act as server. Its possible to configure server instance inside the hardware base its self if hardware platform support this feature. Additionally there are some other commonly used network protocol such as MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and ZeroMQ which are highly recommended to use in IoT space. These protocols itself can be used between device to device (M2M - Machine to Machine) and operate without a backing of a software stack. With this capability can build high-end intelligent network between devices to serve most critical and complex industry requirements. E.g : Defense, Healthcare, Automobile, Agriculture, Logistics etc. There are some open source community driven project such as Eclipse Paho, RabbitMQ which supports to improve and expand the capabilities of this IoT network protocols. Software Application Layer - (Software Stack)Have an intermediary level of proficiency in any general purpose programming language is sufficient to build fully functioning IoT software endpoint (standalone, web and mobile). Basically application developer should know how to setup 3rd party libraries, dependencies, IoT server connectivity instance within the software code base. Also should know how to write code to communicate with external API's, web sockets and IoT application instances. E.g: Open source community project such as Eclipse Paho has provided a whole set of libraries, code samples, server application to meet the specification to write software application to communicate with IoT endpoints. By knowing network, serial, socket level programming in any general purpose language such as JAVA, .Net, Python, PHP, JavaScript and having good overall understanding in IoT architecture can help you to pursue a challenging career within a IoT domain.

The harder part is sustaining them over a very long time. Think for example about workout. Working out for only 5 minutes will bring significant gain, but if it done over a lifetime. Here is my list. Wake up on time and respect your alarm clock. Snooze is not the way to go. Within five minutes of your alarm going on, you should be up and ready to do your next task.Spend a lot of time thinking. Warren Buffet spent almost 80 % of his time thinking. The power of thinking is amazing. In five minutes, you should be able to decide for yourself, if you have thought about the problem at hands enough. If not, then take more hours thinking about it. Then answer yourself again in five minutes if your understanding is enough.Believe in yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, no one else will. Steve Jobs believed that he could change the world, and he did. Each day, spend five minutes reading some quotes that make an impact on your belief.Learn something everyday even if it is a small thing. Just read a lot of material and look for a learning. Elon Musk learned rocket science. We can certainly learn something smaller. Five minutes are sometimes sufficient to decide to learn something new.Workout everyday because it has to be done everyday to be fit for ever. Look for example at Usain Bolt. He works out everyday. One can prepare themselves to go to a gym, or a workout place within five minutes.Love your work. Work on things you love. Then you can do this for a very long time and it won’t look like hard work. Look for example at Sundar Pichai. He loved his work, that is why he is CEO of Google. Take 5 minutes of the day just reflecting upon what you did best during that day.Try to finish whatever can be done today. Leaving things for tomorrow would not make you successful. It is said about Satya Nadella, that he was a perfectionist when it would come to finishing a task. Every time you have an item that bothers you, in five minutes make the best plan for that item.Believe in mentors, and their suggestions. Some suggestions will work for you. At the end of the day, people have wisdom, and they want to give it to you. You should use it. Warren Buffet also took advice from Benjamin Graham. Talking to your mentors for five minutes everyday and updating them about your intentions, and plans can make a significant difference to anyone’s life.Do not take shortcuts where there are none. There is no shortcut for great work, building a great character, and keeping oneself fit. These characteristics demand patience, work, and many years. Look at any typical CEO. They are in their fifties, sometimes sixties. The one thing you can do in five minutes is to decide what the optimum way of doing anything and everything is, and then convince yourself that you would take that route.Learn computer programming no matter what your age or experience is. It will pay off within an year. Behind every successful man, there is a woman, and a computer program. Now this cannot be learned in 5 minutes, but it takes less than five minutes to go to various online websites, and look at the computer programs written by other people to simply get inspiration.Spend wisely on things that should last long. For example ~ spend good amount of money on a bed, because you would spend 1/3rd of your life on it. In five minutes, you can probably think about this, and then stick to this rule for a long time. Every time you have to make a decision, think about it with all your concentration for just five minutes, and you should get a better answer from within.Save wisely, and invest wisely. Experiment a little, but learn quickly what mistakes not to make and then stick to them. In five minutes, you can only find out what are the resources you should be reading to help you improve this knowledge. It would take you years to build on that knowledge.Eat only healthy food. Once you put on weight, everything will seem inefficient, and it would be very hard to lose it later. Spend five minutes of the day just making a good meal for yourself. If you are in cafe, take a tour in first five minutes to just select what would be the healthiest thing to eat that day.Talk to people giving them respect. You never know who would become your boss one day, and the way you communicate with others decides how far you would reach in your life. If you are every angry, do not reply to someone over the email. Take your five minutes to compose yourself, relax, stop, take a break, drink some water, and reply with a calm mind.Love your friends and family. You never know when it could be the last time you are meeting them. Take five minutes of a day to think about your near and dear ones, and pick one friend you can talk to.Find an edge over your competition, and repeat it. The edge has to be simple, repeatable, and carry forward worthy. Last but not the least, the edge has to be interesting. Then stick to it and don’t give it up. Take five minutes of your day thinking and reflecting on your work and reward yourself when you have made a significant improvement.Don’t forget Murphy’s law. It works in engineering and science world more more pronounced than other places. Five minutes won’t teach you these things, but every time you learn something, take your five minutes to note that thing down in a diary carefully so as to reflect on it later.Think from very basics when it comes to solving a new problem. Elon Musk believes in thinking from very basics and building his way upward. This method takes years to develop, but five minutes to be repeated over and over in life for a very long time.Rely on data, but do not trust every piece of it. Don’t forget that everyone believed in data and said Hillary would be president of the United States, but we have a different outcome. Five minutes are not sufficient to derive a conclusion, but they are sometimes sufficient to make a good decision.Put quality over output. When you server others, focus on quality. When you are the customer demand it! In five minutes you should be able to decide if any step you take would improve the quality, output or both.Physics, economics and beliefs: These are the three things that make anything impossible. Two of them are real. In five minutes, you should be able to convince yourself, that your belief is not false.Movement of molecules is expensive, but that of electrons is cheap. Never forget this. Optimize movement of molecules, and you would always get a winning edge.Focus on impact more than work. Before you work hard, ensure that it is smart work. Reflect for five minutes of the day on this, and note down anything where you make a significant impact on something.To bring any change at any place, look for these four: Ability, Agility, Adaptability and Affordability. Five minutes are sometimes sufficient to think about these aspects.Train and teach people around you. Knowledge compounds like anything. As such training and teaching is a philanthropic action. Make a decision to become a trainer in your organization. That decision making would take only five minutes.Read, Read, Read. When it comes to building knowledge, sky is the limit.

Orion Development Group(OD) Orion Development Group (OD) is a well-known business process consulting firm. They are known for providing business process management courses in NYC. Unlike PMTI, OD group may not be the best choice for getting your PMP certification as they lack an all-inclusive package for PMP training. However, they are an appropriate choice if you want to increase your knowledge in process management, you can still apply to their project and process management seminars and workshops. Technical Institute of America (TIA) TIA’s principal focus is in training various Microsoft Office programs. They are also known for their CompTIA, Adobe, and Cisco courses. Just like Orion Development Group, their main focus is not PMP training, and they are not the ideal choice if your goal is to pass the PMP exam on the first trial. TIA only offers two PMP training programs: classroom and live classes. Thus, TIA might not be suitable for you if you have a tight schedule and need a program such as PMTI’s self-study course. Their fees are also relatively high and start from $2,500, which is higher than the average NYC rates. Webucator Even though they specialize in technical courses such as MS Project, database courses, business courses, among others, they have a great PMP training course as well. Webucator is not the ideal option for busy professionals as they do not offer a PMP Self-Study Course. Therefore, it might be hard to find a PMP training course that will suit your schedule. ProjectPro Management Services Just like PMTI, Project Pro Management Services also offers PMP and CAPM training. Despite having live Online training, their website is old-fashioned and hard to use. Also, instead of providing live self-study online courses, they offer CD-Based PMP training. Total Systems Education, Ltd Total Systems Education provides various training courses such as project management, healthcare project management, business analysis, and other related training and consulting. TSE is not the best option if your goal is passing your PMP exam since their project management courses do not cover all the PMP exam content topics. However, if you are interested, you can attend their seminars and workshops to acquire more knowledge in project management. The Project Solvers of America, Inc The Project Solvers of America are on-site consultants and provide project management consultancy and project management courses as well. They also outsource project managers to various companies. If you are seeking something more than PMP training, The Project Solvers of America might be the best choice for you. They offer online and in-class PMP training courses. NetCom Learning NetCom Learning offers IT & business certification training to corporations, government agencies and individuals. Netcom learning has multiple positive reviews online; however, their programs are limited, and they only provide classroom PMP courses in New York and live PMP courses. Another shortcoming is their relatively high fees, which might be unaffordable for most students. PMP Certification Examination Preparation Preparing for your PMP examination is the next major step in your quest of getting PMP certified. Having a well outlined PMP study plan is a requisite if you want to pass the exam in the 1st attempt. With over 50,000 professionals in more than 208 countries and a 99% first attempt pass rate in 14 years, we have prepared a tailor-made PMP training success guide designed to help you prepare for your PMP examination Taking your PMP examination Once you are approved to take the PMP exam and have fully paid the necessary examination fees, you are required to arrange for your PMP examination in NYC.

The quality provided by PMP trainers can vary widely, and some institutions may not adequately prepare you for the PMP examination. It is crucial not to sacrifice quality for a lower price while investing in your career. After considering all key decision factors, we believe the Project Management Training Institute (PMTI) is the most suitable option.

The IAS training experience at LBSNAA is a profoundly enriching one. The programme modules such as Bharat Darshan and District Training provide on-field learning opportunities to the IAS probationers which the academic sessions conducted at the LBSNAA prepare the recruits for challenges ahead. There are exams and marks during the training as well, and the probationers have to abide by the Probation Rules. However, a regular stipend during the probationary period and a distinct focus on co-curricular and extracurricular activities enable the IAS officers-to-be to learn how to balance work with overall personality development.

The more interesting question is whether technical interviews are effective. That’s a more difficult question to answer, for two reasons: There’s no standard measure of effectiveness.Technical interviews themselves aren’t standardized.In principle, technical interviews assess the capabilities required for job performance. Software engineering involves writing code, so candidates write code during the interview. Likewise for using algorithms, system design, etc. Of course, the job probably doesn’t require you to write code on a whiteboard under strict time constraints, thinking out loud as you try to balance parentheses. Moreover, the problems used in technical interviews are often toy problems, optimized for standardized grading rather than for being representative of everyday work. Also, real work isn’t a closed-book exam: in real life, you have access to sites like Stack Overflow and Quora. Are technical interviews effective? They can be, but they often aren’t. It depend a lot of the company, and even on the particular interviewer. Getting through a technical interview process often involves as much luck as skill. But technical interviews certainly aren’t a formality—which is why it’s imperative that companies get better at it.

I’m going to tell you the path to become a professional in the field of cyber security ( This is my Honest Opinion). Problem : Just a Beginner. Goal : Cyber Security Professional. We Indians lack most of what other developed nations might have - Time with a computer since childhood. Our generation is relatively new with computers and for a 10th class or a 12th class student Networks, Databases, OS are few things unheard of (Not all, but most states). With this situation prevailing in the country I guess, the best solution to deal this is to interact with the Computer in a very productive and daily fashion. I’m answering this keeping in mind the person has very minimal knowledge. Step 1 : Get used to installing Games , Softwares ( Cracking ) , uninstalling Malwares etc which would require you to understand how a program is loaded into the PC and how to eliminate it when unnecessary. Step 2: Browse through few FB pages, Blogs, Web sites about Tricks and Tips for Windows, Android, SMS tricks, Bash scripts etc. Mind it these tricks are basic building blocks to Hacking. ( Not Cyber Security yet but we shall get there ) Step 3: Easier step when you’re familiar with few tricks now show them off to your friends and also, try to help your friends and relatives as much as possible with their problems in Mobile Phones or Computers or whatsoever ! This will help you understand Trouble-Shooting problems and trust me it’s a real help. Step 4: Now you’re into the Basic Knowledge of Hacking from Minimal to Basic is a good leap. I would suggest now you start getting into Cyber Security stuff, it starts here with first getting to know few terms in the field such as Malwares, Attacks, Phishing etc. Always be updated with HackingNews website, they’re AWESOME ! Step 5: You can use YouTube and few good sites out there like NullByte (just google them) There are many tutorials out there for you to try and learn step by step. I would say start from learning how to install an OS to a small metasploit attack. This step is gonna take lots of research and your interest will build up as much as you learn. Do you know why? Because the Fun has just begun ! Step 6: Now you should be familiar with OS (installing) , Few tricks up the sleeve, Few tutorials here and there in mind. Actual Security will start now.Tip 1: Always google for the term you encounter the first time, like EXT4 while installing Linux just google it, understand the hell out of it. Tip 2: Start learning a Course whether it is Linux, or HTML or C or whatever just start ! Tip 3: Always practice what you have learnt. Theory <<<< Practice. Step 7: Dude, you’re half way down to achieving what you wanted, just keep your focus on important stuff and the import stuff lies in Linux, Networks, Hardware, OS, Programming, Scripting. If you learn them you’re a professional already but the Security part lies the LoopHoles and issues associated with the courses you learn. Welcome to the world of Cyber Security.Cybrary - Online Cyber Security Training, Free, Forever is the place you need to start from. Step 8: Always think like a Hacker ! You should be like “ Where’s the loophole, how can I get in, what mistake did the programmer do?” etc.Now download a C|EH study guide or a video tutorial course from places you can easily google. Tip 4: Always Always and Always maintain a Running notes when you’re watching a video or reading a book. Step 9: Take up a certification exam , try your level best to achieve it with good score. Sec+ is a good certification to start with. Meanwhile if it’s possible on the other hand it is in best interest you take a Computer Science degree, all the things you learn online on your own start to unveil as you progress in your degree. Step 10: Congrats you are a certified security professional already by now.Attend Security conferences and conventions in India in the year and keep yourself updated and meet new professionals all over the world. The Key is if you know how to make, you’ll better know how to break! Dedication and loads of enthusiasm is very much required as a pre-requisite for what I’ve written above.

I enrolled for the course BrandBuilding in February 2019. Below is my journey: 1)TRIGGER : When people enter B-schools they all have different approaches for two years, mine was Student Exchange (EuroTrip ;) ) and marketing career. I had secured an internship at HUL. As soon I was in third trimester, panick started to kick in about performing well in the internship. That's when seeing our marketing society's mail earlier I landed up on Kraftshala's web page. A call with one of the SPOCs and alums of Kraftshala, a senior of mine ,triggered me to enroll in the course. 2)PROJECT: My project was from 3M, in a category of decor. It was so good that for catering us they had given us the consumer universe as campus students. Needless to say, the projects was very well defined. I had set my timelines accordingly,taking mid terms quizzes in time . February,March 2019 was spent on this hands on project comprising of consumer work, PPTs, mentor calls(my favourite), and the creative brainstorming. 3) INTERNSHIP: Having a hands on experience on the project, the internship proved enjoyable. I remember I was feeling low and had scheduled a call with Soumita -ex HUL, who used to review my submissions and she beautifully guided me in project and curbing my anxiety. I even connected to other Kraftshala mentors and Alums during this time to sail through. 4)CredsScore: I had put in a lot of efforts and the hard work was paid off with a score of 87/100. The score came in July since I had missed to write aptitude test. The feat made me happy! the project, interview (with a senior person from Sony- a truly memorable experience), aptitude test combined the score. 5) PLACEMENT HELP: Having not converted the PPI, I was sad and felt hopeless for FMCG. No major companies visited all campuses, and IIM Lucknow was waiting for its share. I was too keen for FMCG and persistently pinged Kraftshala for help. I had Consulting shortlists. The firm set up calls with consultants too and aided me in case prep. 6)FMCG dream : Meanwhile my score was forwarded to many recruiters, and Nestle gave me a PPI. After three rounds I successfully converted the offer and now I am thrilled to join Nestle India. I can't thank enough Kraftshala for this opportunity. 7)BARRIERS: The question asked is the dilemma I too faced. Money was an issue since we come on loans but they kept a provision to pay 50% advance and 50% post internship, with a good stipend this was easy. TIME: MBA is about management, and Kraftshala kept the timelines very flexible. Once, I had a quiz the next day and submission too, I talked to SPOC and it was adjusted. 8) COURSE BENEFITS: If you complete the course well on time you can reap benefits early in Case Competitions, internship and placement. The course even helps you in acing marketing electives. Lastly, just like other certifications IndustryCreds is about INTERNAL MOTIVATION. It's one of its kind for sales and marketing aspirants. I too know friends who enrolled after me and left. Nothing can be done then. I also know friends who enrolled after me and secured benefits. Not all experiences are the same, but if you put in 100% efforts you shall get 100% positive results. P.S. I gained a mini network outside B school - I proudly associate with my Kraftshala network - all industry, company you could think of.

Chartered Accountants in India are said to have a very wide scope due to the varied services that they can provide. I have covered these areas in a different question. However, in reality it is not really easy for a fresher, to venture into a field different from the orthodox Auditing and Taxation. As I and my friends have been through this very phase recently, I will explain the reasons behind the same and how prospective Chartered Accountants can avoid this situation.  What are the common areas where freshers are offered jobs? Accounting Management (in all Corporates)Financial Analysis (in Large Corporates)Financial Reporting (in Large Corporates)Tax Compliances (in all Corporates)Internal Auditing (in all Corporates)Management Consultancy (in all Corporates)Statutory Auditing or other types of Auditing (in Big four firms)Tax Advisory (in Big four firms)Indirect Taxation (in Large or Mid size firms)Credit Analysis (in banking sector, not very different job)International Taxation (in Large or Mid size firms; a little rarely offered) Source: PayScale - Salary Comparison, Salary Survey, Search Wage  Why it is difficult to enter into an unorthodox field? Students become Chartered Accountants after dealing with a lot of difficulties. It feels as if we have crossed the difficult times of our life and now it is time to reap the fruits. However, you may have heard many times senior Chartered Accountants saying that clearing CA Final examination is not the end, but the real beginning! And it’s true for everybody, whether you go for practice, job or otherwise. Initially it feels as if people who are doing job are at advantage, since they don’t have to face the problems that a person choosing to practice faces. However, the problems for people opting for jobs are inherent and people realize it later after one or two years. Understand the following situation. There maybe exceptions, but this is the general scenario. Every fresher Chartered Accountant opting for job has the following expectations on their mind: High Salary - “I should get a salary package preferably around 10 lakhs per annum, since 7 lakhs per annum is average and I can get it anywhere.”More Knowledge - “I should also be able to learn more and more, so that I can accumulate huge experience before I step into level of my career. I didn’t get much exposure in articleship. There is so much to learn yet.”Unorthodox field - “I should be in a field which is unorthodox. Every other person is giving Auditing and Taxation services, so I cannot survive in competition if I choose the same field.”Comfort of Big Corporates - “I should preferably be in a big corporate house. Once I have Reliance, ITC or such company or any Big four firm in my resume, my career would take a super leap. Besides, the corporates offers so much comfort at job. It would be fun.”Flexible Schedule - “I have worked so hard for last four-five years. Now I wish to enjoy my life. Therefore, I must have a job where I have time beyond my work life so that I can enjoy, party and travel.”Atleast avoid ending up jobless - “I will accept any offer, in any field with any salary, but not end up jobless. Just get hired, else people will question my knowledge and skills. I will switch job later when I get a better offerNow on the other hand, every Company hiring fresher Chartered Accountants have following expectations on their mind: Lowest possible Salary - “We are hiring freshers because we need to reduce the Salary expenses. The experienced Chartered Accountants are better than freshers, but we cannot pay high salaries to every employee. We need some employees at low cost to the company.”Make them Robots - “Freshers are New born babies. It is easy to teach them our policies and fit them into our clerical jobs. The experienced Chartered Accountants make a lot of noise and would not accept any clerical job.”Don’t take risk, they are best for Accounting & Taxation only - “Chartered Accountants are best for Accounting & Taxation. For managing Finances, we can hire MBA or CFA. They have past exposure in Accounting, Auditing and Taxation. Therefore, it would be easy to make them work in these fields rather than training them for a completely different field.”Make most out of them before they switch - “We know that you are definitely going to switch job after two or three years. So we will make the most out of this period. Instead of training you for higher positions, it is better we will make the most out of your skills at the low package that we have offered.”Show them Carrots - “We will tell them about our good employee policies, compensation policy for working extra hours or about our promotion policy. We will lure them with benefits and make them work more and more.”So you might have realized that there is a mismatch between the expectations of the employers and employees. Maximum jobs are offered in the field of Accounting, Auditing & Taxation only. There are few jobs which offer beyond the orthodox profiles.  So what should I do to avoid this situation? Give up expectations of high salary - If you work in core fields, you may earn higher. I know in India, your Salary is equal to your Social reputation and it has big implications in social and personal life. However, if you wish to earn better in long term, you will have to give up the expectations of earning high salary in the initial years. The reason is very simple. If you want to work in unorthodox areas where you neither have exposure, nor you are considered expert, the company hiring you is taking a big risk since you may or may not fulfil their expectations. Hence, such offers will always be lower than the regular offers.Look for Large or Medium size firms, not Corporates - Corporates won’t take the risk of hiring Chartered Accountants in areas which are non-core to the profession. They would hire other professionals like MBA, CFA, CMA, CS, etc. since they are in a position to hire them. They are not interested in training and grooming you according to your desires. However, large firms or medium size firms who themselves are working in different areas e.g. a CA firm with Investment Banking division or CA firm providing Financial services, will surely hire a Chartered Accountant for those positions. Such jobs pay low salary, but definitely set your career in right path by giving you exposure in the area where you wish to work. Don’t get lured by high packages offered by Corporates.Look for Startups - If you wish to be an Entrepreneur or maybe practice in future, Startups are a good place for you. Ofcourse, corporates are also good for your career, but corporates will not offer you work in new areas. Startups need people who are multi-talented, who are flexible and can cater different needs. You can closely observe how startups grow by being close to the promoters. Such experience will help in future. Startups don’t have a separate division for everything. There is one division which does everything from them - Accounting, Finance, Taxation, Auditing, Compliance etc. As they grow, they separate each division. Your benefit is that you will every kind of work.It is okay to be jobless for a few months - Again this will hurt your social reputation, but believe me, if you are into one field let’s say Auditing or Taxation, switching to another field becomes difficult. After having two years of experience in Auditing, if you wish to switch to Investment banking, it would be like starting from zero. So it is completely okay, to wait for jobs in your area of interest rather than accepting a job in some other field. You may accept a job in another field to cater your financial needs, but your search for job should not end until you get a job in the right field and then you immediately shift to it.Develop your Knowledge from beginning - Even if a person manages to secure an interview for unorthodox profile, when interviewer tests the knowledge of such candidate, they find it below their requirements. In such interviews, you are competing not just with Chartered Accountants but people from all other professions. If you neither have knowledge nor the exposure of this area, how will you get hired for that position? So if you wish to venture into a different field, you need to prepare for the same right since your first year of Articleship. You must voraciously read, understand that industry, gain practical exposure and be fully prepared with atleast basic knowledge by the time you complete your course. Your knowledge should be at par with other professionals you will be competing with.Work as a Trainee for few years if you had not planned earlier - Many students realize their core interests after becoming a Chartered Accountant or after working for a few years for a different profile. So in such cases, you will have to start from zero. You can work as a trainee with some expert to learn various kinds of work. This practical experience will not earn you much money, but it will definitely be a worthy experience and set the course of your career. You can request certain firms to accept you as a trainee where the firms is doing exactly the same work which you wish to do.Work with specific Companies providing those services - You can work with specific companies who are directly working in those fields. This won’t be a job though. You can request to accept you as a trainee to learn certain type of work for a short period. This internship helps you to gain the knowledge and experience in that field which definitely enhances your prospects in those areas. Thereon, you can seek jobs in that area. For e.g. a person who wishes to work in Investment banking sector, can apply for internship in Investment banking companies. What areas you can opt for, if you follow above points? Investment BankingInternational TaxationCorporate FinancingEquity ResearchTreasury ManagementForensic Accounting & AuditingShare Valuation WorkSystems DevelopmentProject FinancingCorporate RestructuringCost AccountingSpecific Legal CompliancesRisk ManagementTransfer Pricing Conclusion: If you want a job according to your desired area, you will have to give up some of your expectations including Salary. Besides, you will have to prepare yourself for that area in advance during your articleship days itself. There aren’t many opportunities besides core Accounting jobs. Chartered Accountants in India are said to have a very wide scope due to the varied services that they can provide. I have covered these areas in a different question. However, in reality it is not really easy for a fresher, to venture into a field different from the orthodox Auditing and Taxation.

Demand for data analysts with the right skill set and knowledge will keep increasing with billions of data getting generated every day. There is an umpteenth number of opportunities that span across multiple industries for you to explore since making a career in analytics is promising for people of all backgrounds. Let's find out why one should pursue a Career in Data Analytics? High salary at entry-level and excellent perks - Data analysts are paid very well in the industry even at entry-level since there are limited data analysts in the market. Data analysis is one of the most sought after jobs in the market and there is no denying that. The salary of a data analyst also depends upon the skills, certifications, education level the industry that they work in, and a candidate’s experience. Diverse roles - Data analyst professionals are always exposed to versatile roles and responsibilities based on years of skills or experience. You need to do is identify your strength and what exactly you want to do and what you are good at since there are numerous roles that you can choose from. High demand – Until it is put to the right use there is no use of data companies are continuously recruiting professionals who have the right knowledge of using advanced tools and good command over the programming language to translate raw and unstructured data into meaningful insights and to design software that can process a large volume of datasets. The shortfall of Data Analyst Professionals - Professionals who possess the right skill set and knowledge to perform the task are very limited however the demand for a data analyst is very strong. This opens up an extreme number of opportunities to kick start your career in this field. What skills do I need to become a Data Analyst? Communication Skills it is of utmost importance for a data analyst to convey their findings in a manner that is easy to understand for a vast audience since insights that are gathered from data analysis are consumed by several departments within the company to aid decision-making. Communication skills and Strong presentation are keys to success. Programming Language You must have a solid understanding of at least one programming language to become an expert in data analysis. But to be more versatile having command over more than one language increases your chances of getting a good salary. Python, R, Excel, and SQL are some of the languages used by data analysts. The logic remains the same even though the trend keeps changing hence to stay up to date It would be best if you focused on algorithms and fundamentals. Database Knowledge Since you being a data analyst you may have to work at the backend wherein you design a data warehouse to store a huge chunk of data from multiple sources in one place. To pull information from different tables to perform the further analysis you must possess a strong database and database query language knowledge to query the database.

Project managers must exhibit a broad range of talents to bring teams together and help organizations reach goals. This often comes down to great collaboration and people skills.

Project managers must exhibit a broad range of talents to bring teams together and help organizations reach goals. This often comes down to great collaboration and people skills. Below you can see some of the most crucial Project Manager traits: Empathy – as project management serves two masters, the customer and the internal team, an empathetic mindset is all the more critical. If you can effectively put yourself in someone else's shoes you will avoid unnecessary conflict, and increase effectiveness of your team. Leadership – ability to foster freedom, creativity and autonomy in a workforce rather than top-down hierarchical micromanagement is essential. It requires project manager to recognize the distinct skills and strengths of the group and push those we work with to take agency and ownership. Subject matter expertise – the best PMs are the ones who thoroughly know their subject matter and their team inside out. Of course, not everyone is an absolute expert as soon as they start a project, but the best take the time to learn during the initiation and planning phases. Strategy – all of the skills necessary to successfully manage a project are the same as those needed to manage an organization. Most people assume the key to being a great PM is excellent attention to detail, and while that's important, the ability of a project manager to see the bigger picture of what problem the project is solving is what separates the good from the great. A great PM knows what value, not just what deliverable, they're providing. Risk management – the skills required to be a strong project manager have changed significantly over the past several years. As the rate of technological change has continued to increase, the amount of uncertainty that a project manager must contend with has increased as well. Risk can no longer be controlled by creating ever more detailed project plans. Today, successful project managers must learn to adapt to change rather than attempt to eliminate it. Communication – great project managers are great communicators with high emotional intelligence. They are efficient in their communications—they say a lot in few words, and are clear and concise. Prompt and honest communication immediately gives a project manager credibility, and increases the likelihood of a successful project. Expectations management – great project managers take time to manage stakeholder expectations, to minimize negative surprises. Great project managers are constantly juggling the 'Iron Triangle' of project management — scope, timeline, and budget. They help their stakeholders understand the tradeoffs between Good, Fast, and Cheap. Decision making judgement – effective project managers have strong judgement, and think of decision making as a process to be tracked and managed, the same as schedule, scope, and budget. Great project managers drive clear decisions about priorities and plans at the beginning of their projects to make sure their teams are pointed in the right direction. This means they head off most problems before they damage their projects, and more effectively manage decisive action when problems inevitably arise. Tech savvy – as technology is now a major player in any industry, a successful project manager stays abreast of relevant technology in his or her industry. Strong project managers must be interested in continuously learning, staying up to date with the latest software and other technologies that will keep their teams on the cutting edge. Integrity – the leadership or project management depends on integrity represents set of values, dedication to honesty, and consistency in behaviors with teammates. Integrity is that a good project manager takes responsibility for setting the high bar for ethical behaviors for oneself, as well as reward those who exemplify these practices. Leadership motivated by self-interest does not serve the wellbeing of a team. Here, at Toptal, we thoroughly screen for all of the above qualities to ensure that our project managers are truly world class, only top 3% make it through the process.

To find a better job opportunity and upskill in a field which has a future potential, this very need drew me to Data Science. I also would like to mention here that i have a Computer Engineering background and have 6 years of coding/development experience in Java. Let me begin with the very basic details of the program : 1. IIIT-B and UpGrad Platform IIIT-B and UpGrad are a superb collaboration of education and platform for providing Data Science Diploma. The professors of IIIT-B and industry experts explain the difficult concepts with so much ease that it makes learning easy. Live sessions and Industry expert session are also organized throughout the program. The live sessions are helpful as we can clear all our doubts directly with the professors. The process works as follows: We mail all our doubts before the session so that these can be addressed by the professors in the session.Post session also some questions are taken up by professors. The UpGrad mobile app is a plus for people on the go especially helpful when you have long commute times. Basecamps are organized in major cities, which gives a good opportunity to meet the fellow peers and attend the learning sessions. 2. Program Structure The program is very well structured. It is designed keeping in mind the varied backgrounds the program peers come from. There are preparatory sessions for students to understand the concepts required to begin the course. This is useful for students from non-technical background to understand the basics of Programming, Database and Maths. Also, useful to revise the concepts for working professionals. The Program is divided in a systematic pattern with all modules following a structure. Broadly, topics from CRISP DM, Modeling, Visualization, Hypothesis Testing, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Big Data are part of the program. A detailed structure can be downloaded from the UpGrad platform. Also, tools like R, TABLEAU and MySQL are used during the program. Then there are exams during the program, which also help confirm our understanding of the modules and need hard work. To further confirm our learnings, assignments and group case studies really help to relate and apply practical aspect of our understanding. The capstone project in BFSI/E-Commerce/Healthcare domain in the program is industry relevant and monitored and evaluated by industry professional. This will also help make us industry ready in the data science field. 3. Student Mentors Every student is assigned a student mentor, who helps keep tab on keeping you up the schedule and reminding of the deadlines. This helps to keep track and keep learning at the same pace as your peers. I really appreciate the effort put behind the course with constant support from mentors who really keep you motivated and very helpful to solve all your queries. Another way to look at this is that, it helps with good completion rates of the program modules. 4. Program Peers The course has a healthy mix of diversity with peers from so varied backgrounds and experience. This brings great domain knowledge learning from peers. It has also helped build a professional network of peers with all having the same learning path and data science aspirations. The Group Case Studies are part of the course and are very helpful from two aspects, it gives a very thorough understanding of the practical implementation of the concepts and i really like that being part of a group all of the team member approach the problem differently because of varied backgrounds and domain knowledge. Since, everyone has a different way of solving the problem this healthy mix of ideas leads to brilliant solutions and more learning for the team. Discussion platform is very helpful to get doubts cleared from program peers and technical mentors and also get to know the peers as well. 5. Career Support Career support is 8-9 months post completion of the 11 month course. It is currently, happening for previous batches so, we do get to know of internship options and experienced positions fro peers who are already in the same field. For my batch, we have had a resume building activity and a basic introduction to the data science field call with industry mentors. Since, we are yet to reach the program completion so, will update on this later as and when it happens. 6. Program Fees: The program fee may seem on the higher side to some of the aspirants but i feel with the course content and the fact that we also get a PG diploma in Data Science from IIIT-B, makes it worth the cost. Additionally, its a great boost to your resume when you want to transition to this field with a strong knowledge base. My final thoughts are that one needs to be determined and put the effort to learn to excel in this field. The program is demanding and should be taken up if one can manage time well to meet the course deadlines. But, a dedicated regimen for studying the program and keep learning is the key to be successful and pass the program. This program will help build a strong foundation for successful transition to data science. Additionally, participating in hackathons and Kaggle competitions to solve real world problems will definitely give you an edge and land a job if one is willing to work hard. Hope this was helpful.",2021-03-05T09:31:14.066Z,"How would PG diploma in Data Analytics offered by IIIT-B help me leverage my career? ",Quora

How i Continue ReadingWell I consider myself as the best person to answer your question - Because I am a live example . Be patient as it is going to be a long answer.. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in 2001 then I worked in core mechanical / manufacturing industry for 5 years I was doing very well, I was working as an Assembly In charge for a reputed Water Heater manufacturing company .I also completed my Part time Post Graduate Diploma in Operation Management during that period. In 2006 I switched my career as an IT Business Analyst. Though it was not a planned move, neither I was obsessed with IT field. How it happened ? ERP Boom- 2004–06 During that period SAP, Oracle, JD Edwards, MS Dynamics ERP’s were in boom and lot of mechanical & other engineers were joining IT companies as Functional Consultants. But this required a formal internal/ external training and a bond of 2–3 years with bank guarantee. So I was not much interested to work as ERP functional Consultant. Even I was interviewed by few IT companies for ERP functional consultant. But I did not take it seriously and don’t regret the decision even today. In August 2006 One fine day I got a call from a HR representative of an IT company and she informed me that they have shortlisted my resume, available on a Job portal, for the position of a Business Analyst position and they would like to have interview soon. It was a surprise for me as I never thought of something like this and even I was not knowing what is the role of Business Analyst and I was not knowing abcd of software development. Only I knew of basic things and C as a language, some ERP systems and I was computer literate enough to use Windows , MS Office and Internet. I was clueless about what kind of questions they will be asking me? I tried gathering information about the BA role but could not understand much of it. Becoming - BA I went for interview , still I was in dilemma . Once I was there the lady from HR took me directly to the CEO’s cabin. It was a small but reputed company established in 1976, The founder/ CEO was a well known technocrat for his contribution to Indian IT industry in its early stages. To my surprise He is also a Mechanical Engineer and has worked in Manufacturing Industry before getting into IT. He has worked in IBM during 1972–75 even before I was born. So this enlightened me and I was feeling comfortable conversing with him. During the interview the CTO also joined, they asked me basic questions about my 5 years of experience and about my technical know how of the Industry. More focus was onto Production Planning, scheduling. I answered all those questions with ease and they did not asked much about software development. I honestly told them that I know basics. At the end of the interview they asked my current salary and my expectation. They asked me to wait for some time outside. After 10 mins the lady from HR came to me and informed me that you have been selected and they offered me 50% hike , the offer letter was handed over to me within 20 mins. Again the CEO called me and described why they are recruiting me - It was a immediate requirement. They already got the project for implementation of Advanced Planning and Scheduling Software for a transformer Manufacturer. The Software Solution was from a US company and the client had directly approached the US company. Then the US company has chosen this Indian company as their Implementation partner. My role was to visit the client, which was situated in North India, study their processes and document the processes. Suggest process enhancements. Configure those process steps in the software, co ordinate with development team for any customization. Test the solution and report issues. Conduct UAT with the client and handover. I was excited and worried at the same time. I was sure that I can do this as it is all related to manufacturing field plus I was getting a good Salary. 5 days week working, I was getting a chance for the first time to travel by Air - multiple times but I was not sure about the future….what after that?? There was risk in switching the career , and the risk is still there even after 11 years… But I finally decided to take the risk, and accepted the offer. That’s how I became a BA officially. The project went well, multiple times I traveled to client location by air, stayed in cozy hotel rooms, enjoyed parties with client. The project was successfully handed over, I made very good relations with directors of the client company, even they offered me job with them as Planning Manager but I was not very keen to relocate to the North India with family. So I politely denied the offer. After that project was over, there was nothing for me to work on…what to do?? I started searching for job but with 1 year experience on paper as BA and without much knowledge about the actual role of BA in software development it was difficult to find a job. It was lot of struggle, Many times I cursed myself for switching the career, even I called up my earlier Manager and told him that I wanted to come back to Manufacturing again, He called me to meet him- He simply said…“Come to me when your salary stops crediting to your bank account, people try hard to get jobs like these, why you want to come back?” that was some kind of relief. I kept on searching, and finally I got a job in Mumbai as a Knowledge Engineer as they called it, similar to BA, I required to relocate from Pune to Mumbai. The profile again was bit different . It was a R & D project in Risk Management for Ship operation. My role was to conduct Video recorded interviews of Subject matter experts - Chief Engineers, Captains, Superintendents of Commercial Ships and document the related content in structured format. I was happy despite relocation , as the job was something new and different . I got international exposure, got a chance to travel to London etc…It was all fun…and then came 2008- 09 recession… Many of my colleagues/ team mates lost their job…the anticipated risk at the start continue to play its role. Though my job was saved. But during that period I realized that this risk is always going to in the IT field and there is nothing you can do to shield yourself from this. It is the part of our life. But I changed my lifestyle, I cut down most of the liabilities like Home Loan, Car Loan etc..and I trying to be debt free , tension free. 3 years I worked there but after that recession period, the situation did not improved much, and again I started for searching for Job. This time I was having 4 years BA experience and I was a proficient BA by then. Got a good opportunity with midsize company and working with them since last 7 years as Senior BA. Now that was my story about how I became BA in IT with the manufacturing background. Till today I don’t have any coding/ IT technical knowledge. But I was part of many successful Projects. Even I have worked as a Project Manager + BA on certain projects. But still the risk continues even in 2017, never felt safe in this profession, and opportunities for BA are shrinking… Now the reason I took efforts to write all this.. Its not only a question on Quora but many people whom I met always ask me this question. So I wanted to give you the background. So there is nothing specific you can do to become a BA, but yes- You can go for MBA, and then you can go for professional course of BA and then look out for opportunities. But this is a longer route. Else you can look for opportunities available for Fresh BA’s, try to self learn the BA skills and you can start your career as a BA. But opportunities are very few. But before doing all these things- Ask few questions to yourself- Why you want to be a BA? Why you want to leave the mechanical field? I assume you are doing well in your current job. Is that only Money attracts you to get into BA role? If it is so its a wrong impression in current Indian IT scenario. I hope you have got a clear picture of the situation now. Still if you need any guidance/ clarification do message me.

Is not all discipline just conduct in search of a pre-desired result? First of all you desire a result, and then you figure out what kind of action and conduct is required to reach that result, right? That is why the discipline inside a submarine, is different from the discipline inside a tank. Right? The discipline that a wrestler requires is different from the discipline that a swimmer requires. And both have to follow acute regimens of discipline. Is that not so? What comes first? First comes the vision, the goal and then you say this kind of struggle is needed. You need to chisel your body, you need to cultivate your mind in this particular way. And then you follow that discipline. All the expanse of discipline is built upon the foundation of the goal. The goal comes first. Now who is setting the goal? Is the goal firstly not coming from a mind that is afraid? A mind that is beset with desires, a mind that is confused. A mind that sees a lot of choices and is easily attracted to one choice after the other. And hence, leads to confusion and strife. From such a mind, firstly the goal is coming. And then once the goal has been set, you say, now I need to have such discipline in order to meet that goal. Discipline and struggle are no virtues by themselves. No discipline has any virtue, if that discipline is serving a self-created goal. Most marauding armies were sometimes the most disciplined armies. The most greedy of men are also sometimes the most disciplined of man, because greed requires that kind of discipline. You might have dedicated yourself to any discipline. You may have modeled your body and mind, according to the rigors of the discipline, but mind you, it is you who are doing it, with all that you stand for. This discipline will never take you beyond yourself. Then there is another discipline, which is the right kind of discipline. The word ‘discipline’ is very closely related to ‘discipleship’. And ‘discipleship’ means, to follow, to be a student. Who does one follow? To whom does one let himself be a disciple? To that which is bigger than oneself, right? If you follow someone smaller than yourself, then you are essentially following but yourself. Hence real discipline is about submitting yourself to that, which is far far bigger than you, That which really qualifies to be your guru, your teacher, That which you call by no names, and also by an infinite variety of names. Real discipleship is surrender, and in that you do not follow any particular pattern of living. Then you do not say, I am disciplined. Then you just say, I live. And that living itself is discipleship. If you are disciplined, then you are imposing a discipline upon yourself. And that is cruelty. Every child knows, that to be put under discipline, is something not likeable. Did you like discipline when you were subjected to it as a kid? It is that kid that you have to return to. The kid who does not like external discipline. When you do not remain subjugated under external discipline, then something from the heart rises. And that is a great discipline. ~Acharya Prashant ( The above article is from Acharya Prashant Ji.)   Let yourself free from your daily life routine and feel the real celebration of life.

Dear friend, To be honest, that which we call as discipline is only a conduct aiming at a certain result. Is not all discipline just conduct in search of a pre-desired result? First of all you desire a result, and then you figure out what kind of action and conduct is required to reach that result, right? That is why the discipline inside a submarine, is different from the discipline inside a tank. Right? The discipline that a wrestler requires is different from the discipline that a swimmer requires. And both have to follow acute regimens of discipline. Is that not so? What comes first? First comes Continue Reading",2021-03-05T09:33:10.775Z,"How do I learn to become more self-disciplined? ",Quora

For example: Project management: coordinating all aspects of a large technical project, keeping schedules, communicating with stakeholders and subject matter experts, running meetings…and so on.End user research and design: basically, anything that focuses on identifying what an end user actually needs and (more importantly) DOES. While tech support people still bring up old 'cup holder’ jokes, the simple fact of the matter is those old CD drives were poorly designed. They functioned perfectly, but they really did look like cup holders that were available everywhere (at that time) and they were distributed to end users with little to no experience with computers (it as a new- ish thing,back then). Your existing experience could be put to good use in any environment that is designing for the general public OR your current industry.Information Security: Part of the regular Pen Test is physical security testing, which (literally) tries to determine whether or not 1) someone can talk their way past a Secretary or security guard, 2) sensitive information can collected off of desks (by cleaning staff), 3) a customer service employee can be conned into giving away important information by someone calling into the regular phone line…and so on.Technical support: When i did help desk work i used to joke with coworkers about spending the majority of my time calming down panicked secretaries and carefully talking non-technical people through providing enough information to both identify the problem and reduce their stress level (kinda like a crisis line volunteer). This wasn't a joke. We really did those things. Regularly.So, in short, the answer is yes. Pursuing. An IT degree is a good idea.

In addition, they test prototypes to make sure that they function according to design. Duties of Aerospace Engineers Aerospace engineers typically do the following: Direct and coordinate the design, manufacture, and testing of aircraft and aerospace productsAssess proposals for projects to determine if they are technically and financially feasibleDetermine if proposed projects will result in safe aircraft and partsEvaluate designs to see that the products meet engineering principles, customer requirements, and environmental challengesDevelop acceptance criteria for design methods, quality standards, sustainment after delivery, and completion datesEnsure that projects meet quality standardsInspect malfunctioning or damaged products to identify sources of problems and possible solutionsAerospace engineers may develop new technologies for use in aviation, defense systems, and spacecraft. They often specialize in areas such as aerodynamic fluid flow; structural design; guidance, navigation, and control; instrumentation and communication; robotics; and propulsion and combustion. Aerospace engineers can specialize in designing different types of aerospace products, such as commercial and military airplanes and helicopters; remotely piloted aircraft and rotorcraft; spacecraft, including launch vehicles and satellites; and military missiles and rockets. Aerospace engineers often become experts in one or more related fields: aerodynamics, thermodynamics, celestial mechanics, flight mechanics, propulsion, acoustics, and guidance and control systems. Aerospace engineers typically specialize in one of two types of engineering: aeronautical or astronautical. Aeronautical engineers work with aircraft. They are involved primarily in designing aircraft and propulsion systems and in studying the aerodynamic performance of aircraft and construction materials. They work with the theory, technology, and practice of flight within the earth’s atmosphere. Astronautical engineers work with the science and technology of spacecraft and how they perform inside and outside the earth’s atmosphere. Aeronautical and astronautical engineers face different environmental and operational issues in designing aircraft and spacecraft. However, the two fields overlap a great deal because they both depend on the basic principles of physics. Work Environment for Aerospace Engineers[About this section] Aerospace engineers held about 72,500 jobs in 2014. The industries that employed the most aerospace engineers were as follows:  They are employed in industries where workers design or build aircraft, missiles, systems for national defense, or spacecraft. Aerospace engineers work primarily for firms that engage in manufacturing, analysis and design, research and development, and for the federal government. Aerospace engineers now spend more of their time in an office environment than they have in the past, because modern aircraft design requires the use of sophisticated computer equipment and software design tools, modeling, and simulations for tests, evaluation, and training. Aerospace engineers work with other professionals involved in designing and building aircraft, spacecraft, and their components. Therefore, they must be able to communicate well, divide work into manageable tasks, and work with others toward a common goal. Aerospace Engineers Work Schedules Aerospace engineers typically work full time. Engineers who direct projects must often work extra hours to monitor progress, to ensure that the design meets requirements, to determine how to measure aircraft performance, to see that production meets design standards, and to ensure that deadlines are met. How to Become an Aerospace Engineer[About this section] [To Top] Get the education you need: Find schools for Aerospace Engineers near you! Aerospace engineers must have a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering or another field of engineering or science related to aerospace systems. Aerospace engineers who work on projects that are related to national defense may need a security clearance. U.S. citizenship may be required for certain types and levels of clearances. Aerospace Engineer Education Entry-level aerospace engineers usually need a bachelor’s degree. High school students interested in studying aerospace engineering should take courses in chemistry, physics, and math, including algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. Bachelor’s degree programs include classroom, laboratory, and field studies in subjects such as general engineering principles, propulsion, stability and control, structures, mechanics, and aerodynamics, which is the study of how air interacts with moving objects. Some colleges and universities offer cooperative programs in partnership with regional businesses, which give students practical experience while they complete their education. Cooperative programs and internships enable students to gain valuable experience and to finance part of their education. At some universities, a student can enroll in a 5-year program that leads to both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree upon completion. A graduate degree will allow an engineer to work as an instructor at a university or to do research and development. Programs in aerospace engineering are accredited by ABET. Important Qualities for Aerospace Engineers Analytical skills. Aerospace engineers must be able to identify design elements that may not meet requirements and then must formulate alternatives to improve the performance of those elements. Business skills. Much of the work done by aerospace engineers involves meeting federal government standards. Meeting these standards often requires knowledge of standard business practices, as well as knowledge of commercial law. Critical-thinking skills. Aerospace engineers must be able to translate a set of issues into requirements and to figure out why a particular design does not work. They must be able to ask the right question, then find an acceptable answer. Math skills. Aerospace engineers use the principles of calculus, trigonometry, and other advanced topics in math for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work. Problem-solving skills. Aerospace engineers use their education and experience to upgrade designs and troubleshoot problems when meeting new demands for aircraft, such as increased fuel efficiency or improved safety. Writing skills. Aerospace engineers must be able both to write papers that explain their designs clearly and to create documentation for future reference. Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations Licensure is not required for entry-level positions as an aerospace engineer. A Professional Engineering (PE) license, which allows for higher levels of leadership and independence, can be acquired later in one’s career. Licensed engineers are called professional engineers (PEs). A PE can oversee the work of other engineers, sign off on projects, and provide services directly to the public. State licensure generally requires: A degree from an ABET-accredited engineering programA passing score on the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examRelevant work experience, typically at least 4 yearsA passing score on the Professional Engineering (PE) examThe initial FE exam can be taken after one earns a bachelor’s degree. Engineers who pass this exam are commonly called engineers in training (EITs) or engineer interns (EIs). After meeting work experience requirements, EITs and EIs can take the second exam, called the Principles and Practice of Engineering. Advancement for Aerospace Engineers Eventually, aerospace engineers may advance to become technical specialists or to supervise a team of engineers and technicians. Some may even become engineering managers or move into executive positions, such as program managers. Aerospace Engineer Salaries[About this section] [More salary/earnings info] The median annual wage for aerospace engineers was $105,380 in May 2014. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $66,110, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $155,240. In May 2014, the median annual wages for aerospace engineers in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:  Aerospace engineers typically work full time. Engineers who direct projects must often work extra hours to monitor progress, to ensure that the design meets requirements, to determine how to measure aircraft performance, to see that production meets design standards, and to ensure that deadlines are met. Job Outlook for Aerospace Engineers[About this section] Employment of aerospace engineers is projected to decline 2 percent from 2014 to 2024. Aircraft are being redesigned to cut down on noise pollution and to raise fuel efficiency, which will help sustain demand for research and development. However, growth will be tempered because many of these engineers are employed in manufacturing industries that are projected to grow slowly or even decline. Most of the work of aerospace engineers involves national defense–related projects or the design of civilian aircraft. Research-and-development projects, such as those related to improving the safety, efficiency, and environmental soundness of aircraft, should sustain demand for workers in this occupation. Aerospace engineers who work on engines or propulsion will continue to be needed as the emphasis in design and production shifts to rebuilding existing aircraft so that they are less noisy and more fuel efficient. In addition, as governments refocus their space efforts, new companies are emerging to provide access to space beyond the access afforded by standard space agencies. The efforts of these companies will include low-orbit and beyond-earth-orbit capabilities for human and robotic space travel. Unmanned aerial vehicles will create some opportunities for aerospace engineers as authorities find domestic uses for them, such as finding missing persons lost in large tracts of forest or helping to put out forest fires. Aerospace Engineers Job Prospects Aerospace engineers who know how to use collaborative engineering tools and processes and who are familiar with modeling, simulation, and robotics should have good opportunities. Employment opportunities also should be favorable for those trained in computational fluid dynamics software, which has enabled companies to test designs in a digital environment, thereby lowering testing costs. Finally, the aging of workers in this occupation should help to create openings in it over the next decade.

Try to figure out if it’s something you could work on personally to make group work more successful. Are you choosing people who aren’t serious about doing the work? Or are you doing something that is driving them away? Or not doing something? First talk to the professor about your failed groups. Say you want to learn from this experience. He/she may have some general advice about how to work with a group. Maybe the prof even has some specific insight about why the other individuals left you. But the prof should be diplomatic and avoid naming names. There’s no reason to make it seem personal or create hurt feelings. Get the prof’s opinions about this, but here are some other ideas: Talk to some of the other groups who are more successful, and ask them how they work together. How do they divide the work? How do they integrate the results together? How do they schedule meetings? How do they communicate during meetings? How do they handle people who are shy or introverted?Find books or articles about teamwork. Here’s one: Running Successful Software Projects with Teamwork.com. Another thing to look up: steve jobs meetings - Google Search. There are lots of articles written about Steve Jobs’ techniques for running effective meetings. Go read some of these articles.Should you talk to the individuals who ditched you? Probably not. If they simply flaked (or they preferred to cheat on the assignment, as another answer speculated), they may be reluctant to admit it. If they hated you, most people naturally avoid giving you a candid answer because it’s considered rude. Either way, you’re not likely to get the information you need.Anyway, to answer your direct question—YES, YOU WILL MISS OUT if you work alone and don’t get experience working in groups successfully. You can assume every software job you will have will involve a lot of collaboration with other developers, and also other people who are part of the project even if they aren’t developers. Graphic designersUX expertsDatabase adminsIT engineersProduct managersProject managersTechnical writersLegal professionalsSecurity auditorsService vendorsThat list could go on for a long time. If you want a career as a professional software developer, you will need to know how to work with people. Software projects require a lot of complex communication.

Not very complex, just the simple ones.Once you have an insight to the above, go to the official Apache Hadoop site. It gives you very crisp and clear understanding for a starter. You can also refer from the official sites of Hortonworks, Cloudera and MapR. (I know initially it feels like beating the bushes, but just ignore the feeling and keep trying)When you start learning, do remember not to skip the hadoop architecture. It’s a must. Refer this : What is the Hadoop cluster and how does it work?Once you have a fair idea of the architecture, go further and learn MR, Hive and Pig. Why I choose these three - because I feel they are the pioneers :) . You will get a lot of hands-on to do on these technologies.Once you are deep diving in the Hadoop ocean there are a lot of things to learn then - HBase, Oozie, Cassandra, Spark, Mongo DB, etc.For hands-on - load a CDH (from Cloudera) or HDP (from Hortonworks) into a VM.

While you know you have an important project to work on if you are going to get it done before the deadline but you can’t help your mind wandering. Suddenly you’re on Facebook reading the latest updates, completely off task. The Afternoon slump has struck again. Research has shown that we often struggle with the afternoon slump. A variety of reasons causes it, but regardless it prevents us from focusing and being productive. With only 24 hours in a day, we need to make the most of them if we are to be successful and feel fulfilled. Here are a few ways you can turn your afternoon slump into all-day success. Understand your body’s natural tendencies Research has shown that in the afternoon, we often feel tired because of our body’s natural circadian rhythm. Between 1 and 3 pm, our bodies naturally have the urge to fall asleep. Whether you’re an early bird or night owl, it’s essential to realize that we each have different times when we are at peak performance. Knowing when we are most productive means we can use that to our advantage and use that time to get our most important tasks done. Determine the times of day you are most productiveSchedule your most important tasks for the times you are most productiveSave tasks that are non-essential for when you are less productive, like your afternoon slump.Take Care of Your Body. We all know self-care is important, and physical health is the first step in taking care of ourselves. One symptom of the Afternoon slump is feeling drained and tired. By taking care of ourselves, we can better maintain our bodies and feel more energized. Better health can help us focus and get more work done. Avoid a heavy lunch and sugary foods and drinks that will make you tired or cause you to crash.Stay hydrated - Being dehydrated will cause you to feel more tired.Make sure you are getting enough sleep, so you have more energy to make it through your day.Take a Break It may sound counter-intuitive; how are you going to be more productive by not working? Studies have shown that our minds work best in short bursts of work rather than continuous extended effort. Experts have found that working 52 minutes, followed by a 17-minute break, is a very effective way to stay on task and be more productive. By taking breaks, we give our minds to rest to come back more focused and energized. Set timers throughout your workday for the times you will take a break.Get moving - go for a walk or stand up and stretch will get your blood flowing and help fight off fatigue and sluggishnessMeditation is a great way to reset and refocus your mind to help you get back on track.Use the lack of focus to your advantage. Let’s face it, there are a ton of things that we have that can distract us from being focused on the tasks we need to complete. During the afternoon slump, it’s even easier to find ourselves taking part in distractions like social media and email. With our mind already wanting to wander, this is a great time to let it do just that and use it to fuel your creativity. Brainstorm ideas for your business that could help you growCollaborate with your team and be social to turn everyone’s afternoon slump into a productive meetingIt’s a great time to send emails or engage on social media because others will be looking to distract themselves during their afternoon slumps.We don’t have the let the afternoon slump keep us from being our most productive. Finding ways to reduce its impact and turn this downtime into an essential part of our day will help you be more successful in your career and business.",2021-03-05T09:40:25.477Z,"How do I stay productive and creative in the afternoon?

Needless to say, they cannot question the aforementioned reasons. Grow some balls. You are done at your present job. They sensed, that you are unhappy, and apparently haven’t taken steps to make you happy - by paying more. It’s quite clear they are not going to. You weren’t “poached” from some high-paying expert job because of your industry achievements, have you? Then you are not important to deserve a raise/promotion. So if you are preparing the stage to ask for that, it won’t work. They don’t care. Just leave - on good terms, to be able to return there in a couple of years asking for a higher pay, if you really want to return. Even if you say nothing, you can’t hide your body language. You can’t display stupid enthusiasm eight hours a day. And you’ll inevitably slip. Whether you wag your tail or not, the’ll never throw you a bone. You’ve reached your cap at that company, and your work doesn’t matter. Why “good behavior” started to matter all of a sudden? Companies don’t fire white-collar employees for lying about doctor appointments (requesting the proof, etc.). You can sue them for that. They’d just put you on the layoff list - whenever it happens: as the recession hits (later this year), during some internal difficulties, etc. If you are in the top pay percentile (however pathetic that pay is) compared to your peers, you are already on that list regardless of your work importance. If most of your colleagues got their jobs due to the connections, and you didn’t know your boss or his/her boss personally, you are 100% on the list. If you are the last employee hired in your group (e.g. a year ago), you’ll be laid off first. If the manager doesn’t like you - which can be the matter of looking at him/her the wrong way, or not smiling during meetings, the chances are, you are on that list too. No one would admit, how subjective those decisions are. But… they cannot officially fire just you. Not until the layoffs officially started - meaning they need to let go several people, so no one can claim he/she was circled out and treated unfairly. See? Typically you’ll be laid off (with sincere “sorrys”) w/o doing anything wrong. That’s how it happened to me during my IT career. You are not in control of your “job security”. So you have nothing to lose. Never advertise that you are interviewing or abuse “doctor appointments”, but don’t let your current shitty work (being watched in a “fish tank” kind of office, endless stupid meetings, etc.) inhibit your job search. The search for a good job always starts when you sign some “not 100% perfect” offer. It takes months to find a good job. There is no way around it. A word of caution about recruiters - primarily the third-party ones. They can waste a lot of your time, especially at work. Taking every recruiter call and responding to every recruiter email, not to mention going to averagely shitty interviews simply because someone wanted to see you, can result in too many smoke/coffee breaks to take those calls and too many “doctor’s appointments”. While the volume alone will never ever lead to a good job. Especially if you are doing it in a hurry looking over your shoulder. Be very selective and prefer proactive networking: joining professional communities, answering questions here and on StackOverflow, joining others’ open-source projects, building your work portfolio of complete projects (“industry achievements” I mentioned above), and doing many other things along with submitting your resume to direct job postings. Instead of posting a resume online and letting yourself being “discovered” by recruiters. The “hot” job market and the volume of their calls doesn’t matter. They just dump toxic hard to fill (Gee, I wonder why…) positions on you - almost always worse, than your current shitty job. However if you are interviewing for rare good jobs a couple times a month, no one would notice.",2021-03-05T09:40:53.513Z,"How do software engineers interview for jobs at other companies while working full-time?

For a person with Industry experience, it is difficult. Here are my Pros and Cons: Pros - Good Starting Pay and signon BonusesGreat Expense Reinbursement Policy if you are a Manager or Above. If you want a $100 steak dinner with wine, no problem.Good benefits in generalFor a person hired right out of school, great training and indoctrination and assimilation into the Deloitte way.Deloitte seems to have a lot of young energetic people and you rarely see an out of shape person even the older people.You rack up your frequent flyer and loyalty miles,If you are into it, many firm events on Fridays and weekends. Good social networking opportunities for new consultants out of school.Defined career path. You can become a partner in 12 years if you can make it.Very diverse workforce. You have people from all over the world and different cultures. Strong Indian presence although as you get to the Partner Ranks, it is mostly white males and white females. Females have as much of an opportunity to make partner as a male. Several programs for women empowerment etc.Cons- For an experienced hire, it is extremely difficult. Deloitte brings up people in the Deloitte way and the company is not really open to outside ideas.Deloitte is arrogant. They think they know everything and that the clients are just stupid. You have consulting and you have industry, they do not consider firms such as ibm for example doing client projects as consultants. They consider it staff augmentation. I had a strong background in project management and that skill set was not valued. It was though of as a staff aug skill and not a consulting skill. Also, people are divided as either being in consulting or in Industry. People in consulting such as Deloitte are the smart ones while people in industry which is client are stupid,Thinking out of the box or being independent is a bad thing. Everything is about collaboration and following the Deloitte way. Being innovative can get you fired.Partners are God’s. When you work at Deloitte, you will work under a partner and your partner has his or her cost center and so partners are running their particular projects as if they were their own company. They have profit and loss etc. Partners get most compensation via bonuses. The role of a partner is sales. Partners typically handle both the sales effort and the client relationship. You get a good partner and you can grow. You get a bad partner and it is hell.Managers and Senior Managers have a terrible job. Typically the project lead of a project is a manager or senior managers director basically he or she is a slave to the partner. A lot of the work I did as a manager and senior manager was building PowerPoint decks and sales support. I really did not get to be challenged and do true consulting. Deloitte is big about PowerPoint decks. Everything needs to be put into a deck.Terrible woke hours and travel. Travel gets old fast and typically your work week begins getting on a plane at 6am and getting to your client site before noon. You will need to grab your lunch on the way to the office. You will typically work until 9pm on Mondays, Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s are the big days as they are full days onsite, you will typically get in around 830pm and work until 8pm. Typically you are expected to go to dinner with the team or partner. Alcohol is generously consumed and you will not be done with dinner until 1030pm or so. Typically, restaurants are about to close and many times especially if there is a Partner visiting, you will end going to a bar at the hotel after dinner and not get to bed until 12am or 1am. Then it’s getting up at 6am, going to the hotel gym which actually nearly all the consultants work out and typically in the Mornings. Typically on a Thursdays, you will work from 830 until mid afternoon and then head to the airport. You will get home around midnight. Even though your work schedule is supposed to be 3 nights in a hotel with 4 days on the client site, your Fridays are not free. Every Friday you are expected to go to the home office which is located in pretty much every large city in the states and be part of firm activities. It can be anything to fun team building events to senior level partners coming out to talk to the team. Typically you will work from 9a to 5p on Fridays. weekends are about working on proposals and doing additional work. At least once a month, there will be a social activity where you will need to attend. It might be a charity event, party, luncheon etc. You really are working a minimum of 70 hours a week plus the travel and many times closer to 90. At the client sites, sometimes the partner will come and take you to a team event. I went to see the Blue Man Group and went to see a couple of baseball games.You have to be part of these so called optional firm events. If you don’t go to dinner and go to the bar and spend your weekends on the firm activities, you are looked at as somebody not dedicated to the firm. I have a problem with Deloitte being a pseudo-cult. You are supposed to be homogenous and act alike and behave the same and use the same language and nomenclatura. Drink the kool aid and don’t complain.People suck as Deloitte if you are not in the clique. Partners have their favorites. If you are not a favorite, you will not succeed. It is highly competitive with plenty of backstabbing. People will let their colleagues hang out to dry without helping them out. Nobody is truly your friend. Mentoring is not about helping you but about them getting ahead, everything is competitive including what school you went too. If you are not a Liberal, you won’t succeed, very fake people. You have some bright people but I was not impressed with most of them. They just happen to know the Deloitte way and execute it well.If you are not partner by 38, their is no chance to make it, the reason being is that you have to pay money to be a partner. You will basically get that money loaned to you from Deloitte in the form of a loan that gets paid back over 20 years I believe. Partners have mandatory retirement at 60. If you do not go on the partner track, you will go on the Director track. The only difference is that as a director you do not have equity in the company and as a result, your overall compensation is much lower. Directors still spend ,pst of their time Selling, Deloitte has this lower age of retirement for one reason and one reason only, it is to make more money. Deloitte wants its partners to leave at 60 and become a C suite Level person at a mid to large sized company that needs consulting services. So basically, the former partner becomes an executive with such and such firm and then hires Deloitte to come in and do consulting. The ultimate pay it forward situation,No work life balance. Even though you get a month of vacation a year, you can’t use it because it will cause your billable percentage to go below the target. Understand that if you do not meet the billable requirements, you will get let go. You might make great money and have a ton of frequent flyer miles but you will not get to enjoy it,Up or out. You are graded in such a way that if you don’t advance to the next level within a certain period of time, you will be let go, promotions are not based upon the job you do as much as your relationship with your team and partner. Also, a person who Does not want to be a partner and be selling has limited upside with the firm. Great technical and individual contributors struggle, also, there is a pecking order at Deloitte with a Strategy and Operations being the top. If you are in a technology for example, it is considered less desirable than Strategy & Operations. The Strategy folks typically come from the top B-Schools.Advice Deloitte is great for new college graduates. Not so much for experienced hires.Deloitte looks great on your resume so even if you are just there two years, it will help you for the rest of your career. You will have competing companies always contacting you about joining their firm.Join Deloitte right after school and stay a few years and see if you are on track to make partner. If not, leave the firm because you can make the same amount of money elsewhere with less hours and travel potentially. Wait to start a family etc until you leave Deloitte is typically the best.Relationship building is key, you will be more forgiven for making a technical mistake than you will if you break one of Deloitte unwritten social rules. If you are going to be an employee of Deloitte, you have to realize you are basically giving your life to them. You will not have an outside social life. Give it 110 percent to be successful at Deloitte. At some companies you can just 8 and skate but you will not survive at Deloitte that way. It is a brutal world and excuses will not be tolerated.Get as much money as you can up front and get hired into the highest level you can. Never fall for the line that we will start you off st this lower salary and level and you will get promoted within a year. Don’t fall for it,Do not trust anybody. HR is not your friend, Your advisor who is really the one who fills out your reviews can not be trusted, any sort of mentoring that is offered to you , take it but realize they are not doing it because they are interested in you succeeding. They are doing it because they have something in it for them.2019 Levels and Wages for Deloitte Consulting with typical number of years before promotion Associate - 70k (2 years) Consultant - 85k ((2 years) Senior Consultant - 110k (2 years) Manager - 160k (3 years) Senior Manager - 200k (4 years) Director - 280k - you will go to Director if you are over 40 or if you are not on partner track, Partner - 280k plus equity (6 levels of partner with most first level partners making around 400–500k total compensation). Once you get to a third level Partner, you can be in the million dollar a year range, partners only advance to the next partner level which means more equity of you sell. Partners can be let go if they are not producing which means the firm buys them out, ( typically partner tracks are for those that are under 40) Undergrad no experience will start as an associate. Typical undergrad will get promoted to consultant and at that point go to Business school. S0 typically around year 2 or 3. MBA grads start as a senior consultant. So typical partner will take 13–14 years. Some partners make it in 12. If you are an mba grad, you are typically older and have some work experience. However, you can make partner in 9–10 years with a few making it in 8. Most undergrads start at age 21 and mbas Start at age 25. Typical partner gets there around age 35. You will become a manager around age 28 and a senior manager around age 31. Again, if you can’t get to partner by age 38 -40, you will be going down the director route, understand that a director although shown on the .org chart as equal to a partner is definitely not. They are looked as either smart industry experts or old people who came from other companies. Rule of thumb for experienced hires is every two years of work is equal to one year of work at Deloitte, in addition, Deloitte levels are typical one level lower than industry. If you are a Director at a company, that typically is the same as a manager at Deloitte, Hope this helps",2021-03-05T09:43:12.395Z,"What is it like working for Deloitte? ",Quora

I knew some of the Israelis that sailed on Dakar, they were really great blokes and I remember quite clearly watching her that day in January 1968 when she finally left HMS Dolphin, (Home of British Submarines at that time), and sailed for Gibraltar. In 1965, Totem was purchased by Israel, along with two of her T-class sister boats, Truncheon and Turpin. The former Totem was commissioned into the Israeli Navy at Portsmouth, England on 10 November 1967 as INS Dakar (דקר , English: Swordfish), under the command of Major Ya'acov Ra'anan. She then headed to Scotland to conduct sea and dive trials. Late in 1967, Dakar returned to Portsmouth; she left for Israel on 9 January 1968. Dakar's first port call after leaving the UK was Gibraltar, on the morning of 15 January. She departed at midnight on 16 January with the intention of crossing the Mediterranean Sea on snorkel. The original schedule was for the submarine to enter her new home base at Haifa on 2 February. During her voyage, she was making excellent speed, averaging over 8 kn (15 km/h; 9.2 mph), and Major Ra'anan radioed Haifa to request entering port ahead of schedule. He was ordered to enter on 29 January. Later, Ra'anan requested to enter a day earlier, on 28 January. This request was denied, as the welcoming ceremony could not be rescheduled. At 06:10 on 24 January 1968 Dakar transmitted her position, 34.16°N 26.26°E, just east of Crete. Over the next 18 hours she sent three control transmissions which did not include her position. Her final broadcast was at 00:02 25 January, after which no further transmissions were received. On 26 January the British Admiralty reported the submarine was missing and gave the last known position as 100 miles (160 km) west of Cyprus. An international search and rescue operation began, including units from Israel, the United States, Greece, Turkey, Britain, and Lebanon. Although the Israeli Navy in Haifa began broadcasting calls to commercial vessels to be on the look out for Dakar, Israeli officials would not admit the submarine was missing. On 27 January, a radio station in Nicosia, Cyprus, received a distress call on the frequency of Dakar's emergency buoy, apparently from south-east of Cyprus, but no further traces of the submarine were found. On 31 January, all non-Israeli forces abandoned their search at sunset. Israeli forces continued the search for another four days, ceasing at sundown on 4 February 1968. Israel denied that Dakar sank as the result of hostile action. It stated that Dakar was involved in crash diving exercises on its return voyage and was probably lost as a result of a mechanical failure. On 25 April 1968, Vice Admiral Avraham Botzer, commander of the Israeli Navy, stated that Dakar sank on 24 January 1968, two days before being reported missing, due to ""technical or human malfunctioning"" and not ""foul play"". On 9 February 1969, more than a year after Dakar went missing, a fisherman found her stern emergency buoy marker washed up on the coast of Khan Yunis, a town southwest of Gaza. British T-class submarines had two such buoy markers, bow and stern, secured behind wooden doors in cages under the deck and attached to the submarine with metal cables 200 meters (660 ft) long. The experts who examined the 65 cm (26 in) of cable still attached to the buoy made several inaccurate determinations. These conclusions - that the buoy had remained attached to the submarine for most of the preceding year until the cable broke completely, that Dakar rested in depth between 150 and 326 meters (492 and 1,070 ft), and that it was 50–70 nmi (93–130 km) off her planned route - misled searchers for decades. It was not until April 1999, after some 25 failed expeditions, that a search effort was concentrated along the original route. On 17 January 1970, the Egyptian newspaper Al Akhbar reported that Dakar had been sunk by an Egyptian warship with depth charges. The Egyptian story was told in a 2 July 2005 interview by Asharq Al-Awsat with General Mohamed Azab (a major at that time): On 23 January 1968, the Egyptian frigate, Assyout, left Alexandria base in a training mission for the naval academy. After completing the training assignment and during the return journey to the base, students noticed the periscope of an alien submarine in Egyptian waters, about two miles (3 km) off Alexandria. The Egyptian commander was informed and the decision was taken to attack the unknown submarine. However, the submarine made a hasty dive and the Egyptian ship lost track of it. General Azab reported the story to his commanders and mentioned that there is a probability that the submarine had crashed into the seabed. However, the story was not believed by the higher Egyptian commanders and there was not sufficient evidence to start a search process. General Azab mentioned that the submarine may have crashed into the seabed due to the shallow depth of water in that region, about 36 meters, while it needed at least 40 meters to dive. It appears that the submarine commander took the risk. The Israeli government stated there was no evidence to substantiate the Egyptian unofficial charges. During the 1980s the Israelis, using a salvage vessel with Egyptian liaison officers, conducted three searches for Dakar in waters north of Sinai and another search off the Greek island of Rhodes. In August 1986, the U.S. Navy committed a P-3 Orion and a S-3 Viking to search Egyptian waters near al-Arish. In October 1998, Israel began running advertisements in newspapers in Turkey, Egypt, France, Greece, and Russia, offering rewards of up to $300,000 for any information on the fate of Dakar. On 24 May 1999 a joint U.S.–Israeli search team using information received from U.S. intelligence sources and led by Thomas Kent Dettweiler, a subcontractor from American Nauticos Corporation, detected a large body on the seabed between Crete and Cyprus, at a depth of some 3,000 meters (9,843 ft). On 28 May the first video pictures were taken by the remote operated vehicle Remora II, making it clear that Dakar had been found. She rests on her keel, bow to the northwest. Her conning tower was snapped off and fallen over the side. The stern of the submarine, with the propellers and dive planes, broke off aft of the engine room and rests beside the main hull. During October 2000 a survey of the Dakar wreckage and the wreckage site was undertaken by Nauticos corporation and the Israeli Navy. Some artifacts were recovered, including the submarine's bridge, the boat's gyrocompass, and many small items. The exact cause of the loss remains unknown, but it appears that no emergency measures had been taken before Dakar dived rapidly through her maximum depth, suffered a catastrophic hull rupture, and continued her plunge to the bottom. The emergency buoy was released by the violence of the hull collapse, and drifted for a year before washing ashore. Finding Dakar After the submarine DAKAR went down somewhere in the Mediterranean, Israel spent 31 years searching for the sixty-nine officers and crew. Newly purchased from the Royal Navy, along with two of her T-class sisters, she was commissioned into the Israeli Navy on 10 November 1967 as Dakar (""Swordfish"" in Hebrew) and en route to Haifa after completing sea trails in England. On January 25 1968, two minutes after midnight, the Dakar transmitted her last communication Compelled by one of Israel's strongest military traditions to bring home all killed and missing during battle for a proper Jewish burial, over 25 expeditions were launched and to search different areas of the Mediterranean. Imagine the national frustration of not being unable to find a massive 287-foot submarine that was lost for over 31 years, and not knowing the fate of the men of the DAKAR? This was the problem faced by the Israeli Navy in 1996 when it invited David Jourdan and his company Nauticos to conduct the search which led to discovery in May 1999. ""NEVER FORGOTTEN: The Search and Discovery of Israel's Lost Submarine DAKAR"" tells the exhilarating story of the will, endurance, and technical know-how of extraordinary people who made a lifelong impact on an entire nation and sixty-nine grieving families.NEVER FORGOTTEN is a first-person account that grew directly from Jourdan's successful career in deep-sea searches. The narrative follows the technological quest to locate the missing ship, 10,000 feet deep, and then try to discover the cause of the disaster. Included is the story of the DAKAR itself, beginning with its origins as the WWII British HMS TOTEM, through its sale to Israel, and the last, fateful voyage from which it never returned. Through it all we follow the families of the lost crew, from their pride in the DAKAR, to their horror of its loss, and their closure with the discovery of their loved ones' grave site. A dramatic final chapter imagines what the crew of the doomed submarine might have been doing in the final seconds before a massive implosion snuffed out their lives.While the exact cause of the loss is still unknown, it is likely that a catastrophic hull rupture occurred during a dive since it appears that no emergency measures had been taken before Dakar dove rapidly through her maximum depth. On 11 October 2000, Dakar's bridge and forward edge of her sail were raised, and are now a memorial display in the Naval Museum in Haifa. Recovery of the remains of the crew members and giving them Jewish burial in Israel was finally abandoned, due to the enormous cost of such an operation and in deference to the long-standing maritime tradition of letting the sea bottom be the final resting place of drowned sailors. The crew members' families had to content themselves with holding a ceremony in a ship over the submarine's http://remnants.In the thirty-year period between the loss of the submarine and the final discovery of its remnants, various suppositions and Cold War conspiracy theories circulated. Many Israeli cities and towns have a Dakar Street, and several schools and other public institutions are also named for the lost submarine. ""Full Circle,"" a television documentary of the project was first aired on the National Geographic Channel in November of 2003, adding to public recognition of this event.

Before I narrate my first hand experience with Jigsaw, I would like to give a brief back ground on myself. This will help you in understanding my review better. Brief Background I am a banker with 14 years of experience in Banking and Financial services predominantly in Consumer Banking and Wealth management. I have a bachelors in commerce and a MBA in Marketing& Market Research. I did not have any educational background or work experience in IT when I signed up for PGPDM at Jigsaw. When I decided to up-skill about 2 years ago , with an objective of creating an unique value proposition and make myself more relevant to an organization- Data science drew 100% of my attention. Why Jigsaw? Having decided on data science I shortlisted a few options- my most important criteria being that I needed additional support from the course provider since this was a new terrain to navigate. I needed more hand holding than rest of the class. Jigsaw fulfilled all of my criteria - which includes good credentials & in- person classes too. Once I signed up, Jigsaw team was quite efficient and helped me settle in well. The introduction videos were quite exhaustive and covered all the basics that was required to start the program. The face to face classes in Bangalore were reserved for covering tough concepts that would be effective only in face to face classes. ( eg languages like R and Python which are most used in data science) My Experience As the course progressed, the intensity increased and this is when I understood the enormous leap that I have signed up for. There were weekly assignments, weekly sync sessions from the experienced faculty, University of Chicago and, of course the assessments, which always kept me anxious!! I was always made to feel comfortable by both the faculty - at Jigsaw and at UC, when I highlighted that I had no prior experience. The method of teaching was simple and easy to understand. Most important aspect was -there were no difficult prerequisites. Midway through the course I fell in line and was able match the pace set by the course. Capstone Project All the theory that you learn in any course needs to be applied and validated in reality to test your true understanding of the concepts. This is all more vital in data science and machine learning. Jigsaw organized for capstone projects ( real time projects) with reputed institutions to help their students gets a hands on experience. The course has been designed to provide more credits for the capstone project and becomes part of your Final assessment. This is the culmination of all the hard work that the student put in since the beginning of the course. This gives a glimpse of how a real project could be and prepares you well for the next stage. Surprise Elements While the faculty was always available for additional support or for a repeat of the classes, what really surprised me was this- Toward the end of course, the placement support from Jigsaw swings into action mode and showcases a lot of internship opportunities and job offers. For data science, I have not come across any institute that offers placement support too!! This was a pleasant surprise indeed!! Once we apply and get shortlisted, the faculty supports in preparing for the interview / test. This support is a great initiative and gives a lot of confidence while giving the tests or interviews. My experience with these tests would have been very difficult otherwise. My Verdict If anyone wants an introduction into the world of data science and machine learning, with/ without experience, this curriculum is quite exhaustive but manages to deliver it in the most SIMPLE and CRISP way that even person with zero experience in IT can understand and come out in flying colors! After all, there is no denying that SUM of all EFFORTS is directly proportional to SUM of all SUCCESS!!",2021-03-05T09:44:41.817Z,"How is the PGPDM certification program from the University of Chicago and Jigsaw Academy?

6041fdebed76476feda1b0fc,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-best-tips-and-tricks-every-developer-should-know?-,"1. Plan your projects  The first mistake and surprisingly very common even with senior developers is that most of us don’t plan. It’s boring, we don’t know how to plan and we feel that it’s not our job. That’s why we quite often skip this very important step. Good planning can help you to: save you a lot of timereduce stress when the deadline is approachingcomfortably finish on time everydayAnd it doesn’t have to be complicated. Simply putting down a list of templates and elements which need to be converted from PSD to HTML or breaking up any complex elements into a smaller parts and writing them down is enough. Making a simple project based to-do list will allow you to: stay organisedkeep your head clear and focused on the task at handhighlight any roadblocks early in the project phaseeasily keep your client, boss or project manager in the loopMore on the last benefit in the point #2. Helpful tools for planning Workflowy – dump a list of templates into a Workflowy bullet listWritemaps – create a website site mapTrello – create a project board and cards for each of your templates and elementsPen and paper – all of the above in an old fashioned but still effective wayPlanning is important, but not always everything goes as carefully planned. 2. Be Proactive  There is nothing worse then telling your client or boss, that things are taking longer than expected and that the project won’t be delivered on time. Proactively highlighting any roadblocks or delays is a very powerful way to keep everyone happy. It’s ok if things are taking longer then initially planned, but it’s not ok to keeping this for yourself. You’re stacked with a bug or can’t figure something out? You are not alone, everyone even the most experienced developers have the same issues on almost every project. When this happens, call it out! Everyone will appreciate that you are trying your best and keeping them in the loop with the progress. Do you want to delight your client and boss? Send them a short summary of what you did today and what you will be working on tomorrow, highlighting any concerns. It should only take 5 minutes, and if you use tools from #1, even less time. They will love you for that because it gives them a time to think about a plan B, which might be simply asking the client for more money or extending the deadline. Other reasons why to be proactive: it makes you look more professionalit boosts your credibilityit helps to build a trustSetting a daily or weekly reminder will help you to never forget to give a project progress update. Helpful tools for reminders Google Calendar – create a simple reoccurring eventEvernote – create a note with a checklist of your tasks and set a reminderiOS Reminders – doesn’t need a description, does it.Curious about the next point? Great. 3. Be curious  I believe that one of the most important attributes on this list is being curious. New tools, plugins, techniques and languages are being released almost every day. It is very important that you stay open to all the new things and will make an effort to explore and understand them. The bad and at the same time the beauty of front-end development is that it’s moving forward very fast. This means that you can quickly become an expert but also your skills can become very quickly outdated. Tip: You don’t need to know everything, just having a rough overview about a topic or technique is fine. You can then dive deeper into it when the right project comes along. Helpful sources for front-end development news CSS WeeklyHTML5 WeeklyJavaScript WeeklyResponsive Design WeeklySidebar.ioWeb Design WeeklyLet others filter out the noise and concentrate on the top news only. 4. Invest in your skills  Front-end development and everything related to it is just a skill and any skill, believe it or not is learnable. You will need to invest in yourself in order to grow. I don’t mean spending money on expensive courses, seminars or books, I am more thinking about investing your time. There is no short-cut to success and researches show that it takes around 10000 hours to master a skill, that’s around 4 years practicing 40 hours a week. Be prepared to put up with late nights exploring other websites, experimenting with a new plugins and frameworks, reading web development blogs, listening to podcasts and chewing through thousands of tweets. TIP: Schedule a time for self-development into your week. I know this might be harder if your employer doesn’t support you, but be prepared to invest some of your free time into your own career. Helpful blogs and podcasts for front-end developers CSS TricksCodropsShopTalk PodcastBoagworld PodcastApply Filters PodcastBONUS TIP: Setting the podcast playback to 1.5x or 2x speed will help you to get through more stuff quicker. Did you say yes, sir? 5. Don’t say YES to everything  Clients and bosses are demanding, we all know that. But saying yes to everything can eventually turn against you and you will end up working for less, being under the pump and stressed out. Carefully evaluate what are the project requirements and align that with your skills. Also be sure to ask which browsers you need to support. There is nothing wrong in highlighting which parts of the project will need a senior assistance or will need to be left out of the project scope. Highlighting these earlier in the project timeline will make the whole process from start to finish much smoother for everyone. Tip: Don’t be afraid to call out functionality or feature which is out of your skill set. Being honest is the key, but also make sure you don’t say no to everything. Did you say no, sir? 6. Don’t say NO to everything  Contradictory to the previous point, but also important attribute of a highly effective front-end developer is learning something new on every project. Each project is a great way to implement a feature which you are not familiar with or you do something new for the first time. By saying no to everything and only doing the things you are familiar with, you are essentially closing the doors for personal and career development. You will soon drown in the sea of average developers. On the other hand, exploring the unknown will give you a great feeling of achievement, satisfaction and will keep you hungry to learn new things again and again. Tip: Pick a feature, plugin or a technique you wanted to use for some time and implement it in your next project. And if you need, use a mentor to steer you into the right direction. 7. Find a mentor  You are keen to learn, but not sure where to start? What should you learn next? How to implement this or that? That’s what mentors are great for. Find someone with more experience than you, someone who is keen to help you to grow. Your mentor should be someone who you respect, someone who you would like to be like. Someone who can teach you how to code and what to avoid doing. This could be your boss, your colleague or someone online who you will follow. Bigger companies might have a formal mentorship program in place, but if you are in a small studio or on your own, look on the internet. Following developers like a Chris Coyier, Paul Irish or getting a mentor through Thinkful or similar programs might be a good idea. TIP: If you are not going forward, you are going backwards, especially in web development. A good mentor will help you: to get advice on your project approachto get a sense of directionto help you foresee any potential roadblocksTip: Remember a mentor is not a guy who will do everything instead of you and is not there to motivate you. You still need to be curious and self-motivated in order to grow. Still with me? Great..thanks, but don’t forget to move. 8. Stay active  Working in the digital industry means that we spend a lot of time staring at the computer screen. Sitting 40-60 hours in the office will sooner or later take it’s toll. That’s why it’s vitally important that you look after your body the same way as you take care of keeping your markup nicely organised and commenting everything you do. Healthy body and healthy mind means a better code. So when you schedule your week, don’t forget to include some non digital activities – walk, run, gym or whatever else will make you forget about all the pixels around you. 3",2021-03-05T09:46:19.554Z,"What are some best tips and tricks every developer should know?

But believe me, to become an established freelance writer, the primary thing that you need, is to hone your writing skills. Practice writing as much as you can. 2. Read a lot Your writing skills will improve when you have a kack for reading a lot. It will not only increase your vocabulary but also will help you expand your horizon. 3. Learn new skills As much as quality content is preferred by clients, there are stuffs that you must keep in mind while writing for a them. When you become a freelance writer for a website, your client relies on you to write content that is good in quality and helps in ranking his website. Learn search engine optimization(SEO) basic html and wordpress. If you do not want to learn the languages, atleast learn SEO. After you’ve aquired your skills and have decided that now you CAN write for clients, here’s a list of things you need to do. Make a websiteA writer MUST have a website. If you do not, make one. You do not need to have advanced website making skills or learn a whole set of programming languages. All you need is just go to a free website maker like wix or wordpress and make one. 2. Write blogs Blog writing helps you hone your writing skills. And for your website visitors, this is the place where they’d be entertained and spend the most of their visiting time. This will also become an area where your prospective clients will examine your skills and consider you for their project. But before starting to write blogs, you need to choose a writing niche. 3. Choose a niche A writing niche is a just like genres. There are many writing niches. You may be familiar with few, like, fashion, lifestyle, IT, sports, business, health, entertainment etc. Do not be tempted to say that you can write on virtually any topic because believe me, nobody can. Juggle your options and choose the right one. After you’ve set up your website and have written few blogs, Start with writing internshipsClients will always want an experienced writer. They neither have time nor money to consider an unexperienced one. On the other hand, internships, though low paying, will consider you and give you projects to do. The end result would be an addition to your portfolio. There are many websites like internshala (many others are there, search them) where eminent companies register to offer internships. 2. Pitch on job boards Clients hang out on job boards to hire freelance writers. Here’s where you’ll meet prospective clients and get work. Before doing that, do not forget to add the links of your published works(from the internships)to your portfolio and provide a link to your portfolio and blog on your CV. 3. Register in freelance service providing website They are also a means to gain a clientele. Sites like fiverr, freelancer, truelancer etc provides opportunities for freelancers(not just writers) a platform to showcase their skills and get clients. On the other hand, there are websites like wittypen, iwriter, which are just for freelance writers. They will examine your skills before welcoming you onboard. 4. Make a professional twitter and linedin profile A professional twitter profile is very important. Twitter along with linkedin is a great place to expand your network. Do not just create a profile, add a profile picture and sit back. Follow people and in turn they will follow you back along with people who follow them. Tweet regularly (your can tweet about your work, your current project, about writing or promote your latest blog posts). I hope this answer was able to solve your query. You can personally contact me of you want to know anything else. :)",2021-03-05T09:47:22.340Z,"How do I start freelancing as a content writer? ",Quora

I completely understand your dilemma and I was in a similar position as you two years back. I have spoken to many academics and a couple of industry experts to understand the system better and here's my take on this: Your choice to pursue one or the other depends a lot on your long term goals.  Normally, if you're aiming for studying in the US, a PhD would entail a year or two of coursework and lab rotations, and then your qualifying exam and doctorate thesis begin. All in all, for Biotechnology and related fields, it take roughly 6 years (In fact it's 5-6 years for all fields right now). If you add an MS before that, it's another 2 years. That makes 8 years of post graduate study. By the time you come out you'll be roughly 30(ish). You can see one solution right here- if you want things to run faster, a direct PhD would be your answer. Here's more: you can walk out of your PhD two years into the affair, with a terminal master's degree. That can, however, have emotional, financial, and academic repercussions. Never walk into a PhD with the intention of walking out with a terminal master's. Make that decision only when you feel academia is not right for you, and you'd like to get out, or if you're in a situation where you have not much choice but to quit. In the UK, PhDs are normally for 4 years. If it's a formal program, then you'll have a year of rotations, and three years of thesis work. You have to complete some credits through coursework or professional courses within this time frame at your pace. No one really cares about your coursework performance, as long as you're doing well in your doctoral project. In the UK,  even though it's shorter, PhDs are focused and very goal oriented,  not very much training.  In Australia, it's always the same or less than in the UK (3-4 years, normally no rotations). In all three countries, you have the choice of pursuing a PhD right after your Bachelor's. For competitive programs in the UK and Australia,  however,  a Master's is recommended.  In Europe, particularly Germany and the surrounding areas, you need a Master's to do a PhD,  and the PhD is almost always 3 years or even less. In exceptional cases they might allow a Bachelor's student to pursue one, but it's not a recommended procedure for two reasons: (1) for such a tight scheduled Phd, you should have prepped and have had enough practice or experience with research, so that you waste minimum time learning and more time producing, (2) such PhDs are not heavily mentored. You have supervisors but they will not hold your hand and help you walk. They'll just warn you when you're about to trip. It's always better to have sufficient experience through a Master's in order to deal with this better. Getting a PhD in the US after your B.Tech is much easier than one in the other places I have mentioned. There are more scholarships in the US for international students, so competition is much less. However, most times you'll have to do a TA / RA alongside your thesis work for your stipend. External Fellowships from the NSF or NIH, AHA etc are few and and far between for international students, and accordingly very competitive. Of course this is just for your information. Having secured a competitive one simply makes your CV look better and your (financial/academic) load a little lighter. Now here's the thing - if you want an academic career, and you're pretty sure of what you want it in, a direct PhD might be your answer. If you're not experienced enough through internships or training in your Bachelor's,  a PhD in the US might be better for you. The coursework and intense training will prepare you for that academic challenge. If you're confident that you can prep yourself and just need the thesis project to be good - go for the shorter ones in the other countries (you'll need a very strong profile to make it though).  If you're not very sure about being able to deliver in your PhD, or you'd like some time and courses to specialize in a particular discipline, then an MS (has a longer thesis work period) or MSc (has a longer coursework period) is a recommended option. As you specialize and get higher degrees, your job options, however, start getting limited. This is because a PhD makes you an expert in your area, to the point where you've lost touch with the other things. So working in those other options now start going away because HR sees you as ""unqualified"" for it (they'll tell you you're ""overqualified"" for that position). This is not to say that things are set in stone. If you're clever and quick you can always be the exception and not the rule. Within the Biotechnology industry, however, a PhD is a recommended qualification for the good jobs. If you're good at what you do, excellent in fact, the industry will just run to hire you and lead their R and D divisions. Most of the products of Biotechnology are in pharmacy or fuels, or expensive chemicals - a PhD gives you the confidence to make less mistake and cost the company badly (or even lives in the case of medicines or vaccines). So such companies prefer PhD students for their R and D divisions. Of course, you need to be specialised in the right thing for this ;) Without knowing your personality or situation properly, I can't really say which is the best option for you. I have laid out all the vital information you need to make this decision and I wish you all the best for whatever you decide. Just remember - what decision you make is not as important as what you do after you've made it. I am not sure what kind of work you've done, that I may recommend colleges, but you should look at the public rankings, pick the college, check out the faculty and courses and then decide. Email grad students to get a better picture of what's going on. Cheers and all the best for your exams! :) Continue Reading",2021-03-05T09:47:40.790Z,"Should I apply for an MS or a PhD in molecular biology in the US? ",Quora

Schools are one-size-fits-all, but they say they want ""to meet every student's needs."" It gives practically no career guidance. Practical hands-on experience is saved until senior year, and treated as an amazing thing. Rich schools have iPads, optional high school trips to Europe, and swim teams with a pool. Poor schools implicitly require the teachers buy pencils and notebooks for their students, because the parent and school can't afford to spare $150 for 150 students.  Schools were designed in the industrial era: one-size-fits-all. All kids have virtually the same class schedule for middle school (or a +1, 0, and -1 shift in difficulty for honors, regular, and remedial). Grades are set up by age, with different ability levels smashes together. They do not work to make an individualized plan based on what the kid already knows/doesn't know. Schools expect every eleven year old to meet fifth grade standards by May/June of their fifth grade year. Doesn't matter if the parent is a teacher of their child and the child has an adult reading level; doesn't matter if the parent didn't read to their kid and didn't talk to them much either as a child, and didn't support homework time. One of those kids is meeting/exceeding seventh grade standards; one lf those kids we'll be working toward a 5th grade reading level well into high school. They're expected to perform the same at the end of the year, which is ludicrous.    Upper-class kids and elite private schools       emphasize the importance of creating an action plan, emailing experts, finding mentors, and enacting a plan.  The Boy Scout Eagle Scout Award and Girl Scout gold award teach a student how to be a change-maker for society; to find a societal problem or need and to fix it.  The public schools do not teach this empowerment. When kids have a good idea, we as an institution promote that adults have the ideas and the say-so.  We don't even trust them to go to the bathroom, so how could we ever give them the authority to plan a community center, or start their own food drive, or investigate the oral history of the community.   We put them in boxed classes called Science, and Math, and Writing, and History. We don't show them how the real world is more inter-connected: a mixture of technology/sciences, people skills, marketing skills, business accumen, financial math, and real-world writing. My second job had us counting the silverware by sets of twenty, and I wanted to show my kids how the math helped me expedite life on my job. But there was no time or place for it in the curriculum. Even cool projects from real math-dependent careers don't meet the standards of what should be taught in class, and this project is what math people do as their job for real life.  We never show them the end product - what's in it for them on the other side. I had a 7th grader who told me I'm the first teacher he knows who codes, and it's because I spent ten minutes of one bell giving my kids some life advice for their individual careers.  I've heard China selects its Olympian trained athletes at a very early age. Yet we are afraid to take twelve year olds and merely suggest to them that ""you have an aptitude for the life sciences - you should pursue a career in vet medicine or nursing"" or ""you are a talented athlete - have you thought about being a personal trainer or coach"" or ""your art is amazing - did you know that graphic design exists as a career"" or ""you're fearless - you would do great as a Youtube host, or in acting, or in delivering speeches to customers at the business you work for.""  So these kids don't know that, and they pursue one of the three careers they heard from their parents, or a career they heard about on TV (lawyer, doctor, CSI), and they go to expensive colleges that don't give them career advice.  They aren't taught how to be their own company, how to provide their life skills to the world. But that's because we need them to stay in their seat, to stay unempowered, and to stay in the illusion that one size fits all.  ""You ALL need this calculus class and you ALL need chemistry and you ALL need exactly one P.E. and one Art class a day. Psychology and Economics and teaching how people are motivated in general can wait until electives your senior year."" ""Government class will teach you from second-hand sources the definitions of governmental agencies; it won't have you simulate the legislative experience because you'll never be an elected official (or at least here at this school we don't want you to be.) The elected officials come from the elite private school, or the rich-district public school kids, and that's the way our society wants it, because nobody's improved the problem.""",2021-03-05T09:48:25.741Z,"What are some flaws in the educational system of public schools?

Project managers work in every industry, and on every kind of project imaginable. Life science & ResearchDrug manufacturing and Big PharmaCommercial Software productsAircraftLarge scale infrastructure (water, sewer, roads)Buildings including houses, commercial property and skyscrapersThe list is endless. What makes a good project manager varies from industry to industry. A good PM in software would be lost in commercial property development or infrastructure engineering. There’s a big difference between good leadership and management skills, and industry-specific project management and experience. Most of the time, PM skills aren’t swappable between industries. As someone who is an expert in custom software development, I would find commercial (software) product development a totally different challenge. In software, you also have to recognize the relationship between architecture, product management, design and other key specialist. Being a good PM means understanding how to motivate individuals and teams of people, many who may be as smart or smarter than you. Being a good PM requires VASTLY more high level skills than any role that I can think of. And the really good ones are as much an expert at human behavior, communications, and financial management as they are at complex scheduling and other project management disciplines. A bad PM on the wrong project at the wrong time can be an exit card for management at any level. Unfortunately, finding managers who know how to work with or develop good PM’s is a rare find in the software industry. In software, line managers and even mid-level Directors are easily threatened by a heavyweight PM, primarily because it’s a very complex set of management and leadership skills, and it’s not hard to understand why those resources might feel upstaged or even threatened by those competencies. After all, delivery management is a cornerstone of management. We usually find that line managers are promoted due to their technical abilities, first, political connections, and then leadership potential, but it’s never because they are amazing project managers or formally-educated with management degrees. Like I have told people all too often, there’s a reason that almost every 4-year college and university has bachelor and masters degree programs in business management. If you’re a business or engineering major looking for an exciting career, you could do a lot worse than to specialize in project management. In my experience, it helps immeasurably if you have held a hands on role in the industry and types of projects that you are managing.

I say this because it is becoming increasingly apparent that she has chosen to play herself in most every role she’s in; or, the “girl-next-door / just your average girl with brains”. She seems to mainly hold out for, and play, roles that she can “personally identify with” and which she “personally idolized”, such as Belle and Hermione, inserting herself into said roles. She’s also consistently picked “safer” and smaller roles (Noah, Perks of Being a Wallflower, Bling Ring, etc.), ones that don’t allow her to go (and grow) outside of her personality, and to broaden and deepen her range as an actress. Instead, she has chosen to mainly focus on her education and career as a UN Ambassador and social activist. While this is not a bad thing, that time spent on social activism took away time she could’ve used to improve her acting skills and range - and, unfortunately, it shows in Beauty and the Beast. According to Watson herself, she only had “three months” of combined training, including singing, when many criticisms of her performance cited that “she was not a very strong singer / actress” in the film. I feel as though if you’re going to play a role like Belle - one with already astronomically-high expectations from both critics and audiences alike - you absolutely need to buckle down on singing and voice training. Unfortunately, I don’t feel as though Emma did that, which resulted in her (disappointingly) being overshadowed by more trained, experienced singers in the film. Had Emma chosen to focus on her acting and singing wholly, I feel that, perhaps, she could’ve become a much stronger, steady presence in her role as Belle. While she is not a talented singer, I feel she could’ve considerably improved, had she devoted more time to her training. As Thomas Edison once said, “Genius is one percent inspiration, and ninety-nine percent perspiration.” She also turned down the lead actress role in La-La Land, presumably to play Belle in Beauty and the Beast instead, which I feel may have been a major, missed opportunity for her. “It’s one of these frustrating things where sort of names get attached to projects very early on as a way to kind of build anticipation or excitement for something that’s coming before anything is really actually agreed or set in stone,” said Watson. Acknowledging that she had been committed to Beauty and the Beast for years, Watson says she felt her performance wouldn’t be best served by splitting time between Bill Condon’s fairy-tale adaptation and Chazelle’s tale about an aspiring actress in love with a jazz pianist. “I knew I had horse training, I knew I had dancing, I knew I had three months of singing ahead of me, and I knew I had to be in London to really do that,” said Watson. “And this wasn’t a movie I could just kind of parachute into. I knew I had to do the work, and I had to be where I had to be. So scheduling conflict-wise, it just didn’t work out.” (Source) If you know (or even read a little about) Emma Watson and her personality, it is very obvious why this is. It is because Emma is basically much like Belle and Hermione herself; hence, why she was cast in, and accepted, those roles.  “For me, Beauty was the perfect, most joyful thing to do,"" Emma, now 26, gushed. ""There was something connected about Hermione and Belle, and it was good to be reminded that I am an actress; this is what I do. The film is pure escapism [to me].” (Source) “I think that I just feel really lucky. For me, Belle was my childhood heroine; [the animated original] came out two days after I was born,"" she said. ""And then, in my early teens, it was about idolising Hermione. So to be given the chance to play my two childhood idols is probably a very unique and rare experience for an actress.” “I think I came out of [Beauty and the Beast] with more confidence, with more skills. And more belief in myself,"" she said. ""Because when I came off Potter and decided to go to [Brown] University, that wasn't a career decision the people I worked with were pleased about. But I kind of… I try to stay true to whatever whisper I'm getting from myself and I hope that will see me through. That's all I can do really. Otherwise, if I don't listen to myself, I'd feel a bit lost in it all.” (Source) So, when Emma plays roles like Belle and Hermione, she’s basically playing herself, “escaping” into these roles. To me, it almost seems as though she’s placing characters like Belle and Hermione on a pedestal, seeing them for all of what she admired in them, without seeing (or being somewhat blind to) their flaws. At the same time, by placing these characters on a pedestal, Emma is showing (conciously or not) a decided lack of self-confidence, especially in how she views herself, and the characters she plays. If they are what she aspires to be, then, by default, that means she already considers herself “below” them, that they are somehow “above” her. That she is somehow “unworthy” of playing them, which, I feel, negatively affects her performances. She shouldn’t aspire to be them; she should just be able to be them. In other words, you shouldn’t put characters on a pedestal, nor make them out to be some sort of “ideal” that is unattainable. If they are “unattainable” from the start, then how are you supposed to play the role? I feel that doing so is, ultimately, setting yourself up for failure, before you’ve even begun. (However, I think, perhaps, that Emma herself may not realize that she’s doing this.) One of the main criticisms of Emma’s performance of Hermione in the Harry Potter films, as a character, for example, is that she seemed “too perfect”. Too many of Hermione’s flaws, which made her endearing, relatable, and human in the books, were taken away. This caused a lot more issues with the story arc and structure as a whole, including taking away crucial character development from another protagonist, Ron Weasley…a character that Hermione was supposed to have a believable romance with.  However…as per many fans, Hermione was too “flawless” - too “perfect” - and had too little relationship development with Ron Weasley in the films to make that romance believable. For a relationship that is built up throughout the entire book series, I feel that this feedback on Emma’s performance highlights one of the main reasons why not just “being yourself” for a character is so important. (Because, let’s face it. The character isn’t “yourself”. It’s a role that you take on, but not actually “you”.) Yet, what many people do not realize is that it’s a characters flaws that make them truly appealing, and interesting, as a person. It makes them relatable, intriguing, believable, and real; a performance isn’t just about “going through the motions”, it’s about breathing life into a being, and becoming that being. To to that, by default, you have to become something - and someone - other than just “yourself”. The audience doesn’t know “you”. You, personally, are a stranger to them. They are only familiar with what they see on-screen, as part of the story, for a limited amount of time. Thus, it’s best to stick purely to the character within the confines of the story itself, and to omit any outside influences or ideas that don’t directly relate to the plot or character. This also includes things that are unnecessary or extraneous to the structure of the overall arc. Again, we saw this happen with Beauty and the Beast, where I felt like Emma’s involvement may have caused Belle’s character to just be… “Belle as Emma Watson”, instead of “Emma Watson as Belle”.  However, if Emma Watson is ever going to grow and develop as an actress, or nurture her acting career, then she needs to step outside of her “comfort zone” by not treating roles as “personal escapism” or “wish fulfillment”. Yes, Belle and Hermione were her childhood heroines…but they are not “Emma Watson”, nor should they be seen, treated, or seen as such. To use a quote from the Harry Potter films: ""Harry... It’s not how you are alike. It’s how you are not…"" For these roles, Emma needed to dissociate the character from the person…and, for her, I feel that simply never happened. Concerning her voiced feelings, I feel as though the saying “you should never meet / try to be your idol” is very applicable in this case. An actor or actress can’t just completely idealize a character, and then expect to play that character without a strong bias that clouds and compromises their view of the character, and prevents them from seeing (and portraying) that character’s flaws. It strips away a character’s humanity, what makes them real for so many people, and makes them “just” the actor/actress “doing another role as an idealized version of himself/herself”.  I feel that this is one of the major, most common mistakes and pitfalls when it comes to method acting, as well as creative writing - and especially for novices, or those who still have yet to become experienced “in the field”. Many of those getting involved in these fields simply don’t realize that it's not enough to ""just play yourself"" when it comes to certain roles…and especially iconic ones, like Belle and Hermione. That being said, if Ms. Watson ever reads this, I really like and admire you as a person and activist, but as you said yourself, you have “a long way to go” - including when it comes to your acting career. I hope that you can accept this criticism as a chance to continue to learn and grow as an actress, and to transform yourself more in future roles. Emma also touched upon the criticism that comes with the territory of being engaged in issues beyond Hollywood. ""It really toughened me up,"" the actress explained. ""There is a level of criticism that comes with being an actress and a public figure, which I expect, but once you take a stance on something like feminism, that's a completely different ball game."" After Beauty and the Beast premieres March 17, 2017, Watson revealed she'll get right back to activism, but don't expect a book to follow shortly thereafter. ""I need to see and do a bit more first...I'm no expert, and when people push me into a corner of 'here's Emma Watson to lecture you on feminism,' it's uncomfortable because I am aware I have a long way to go. I am not sure I deserve all the respect I get yet, but I'm working on it,"" she said. I hate to say it, but I think that Emma Watson, as of the release of Disney’s live-action version of Beauty and the Beast, makes this list.  I say this because it is becoming increasingly apparent that she has chosen to play herself in most every role she’s in; or, the “girl-next-door / just your average girl with brains”.

We needs roads for transportation, we need electrification and we will need water. These  basic provisions that determine the sustenance of any industry from the secondary sector  need to arranged for by the construction industry. The tertiary sector has already shown us a little crescent of potential scope in various arenas like Airports, Ports, Malls, IT Parks, Healthcare sector, Educational Institutions, Mass housing, etc., There are still a lot of sectors that remain fairly unexplored by the construction sector in India like tourism-related, defense related, water supply and sewage management, sustainable energy projects (solar, wind) etc., I cannot stress more on how the construction industry is I daresay, INDISPENSABLE for the overall growth of the country. It therefore becomes imperative that there will be enormous scope for work in India for atleast 5-8 years from now. Off the top of my head, let me mention a few ""big-ass"" projects that have been envisioned or are already in the pipeline:   The Chennai-Vishakapatnam industrial corridor: The remnant part od  Andhra Pradesh, has lost a well developed city - Hyderabad. They are building a new capital in Vijayawada and aim to make Vishakapatnam their commercial hub. Large scale transportation, buildings, power and water projects are expected to come up in the state. Two towns - Nellore and Kakinada are expected to get large ports and proposal for a lot of food processing industries are on the table.The Tamil Nadu Petro Chemical Investment region - A string of refineries to be established between the Cuddalore and Nagapittinam Port. Add to this the much needed river interlinking project which will solve the water problem  that this state, which is the 2nd most industrially productive state faces.The much ambitious Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor and the Kolkata-Delhi-Amritsar industrial Corridor - 65% of the country's population is expected to be benefited from these two beast-like projects. Smart cities, IT parks, healthcare institutions, educational institutions, everything!!Apart from the above we also have the Chennai-Bangalore industrial corridor and the Bangalore-Mumbai corridor. Each of the above industrial corridors will have dedicated freight corridors, development of roads and airports is an immediate requirement. Also put in perspective the following - Large scale road projects connecting the north east with Bengal and effectively, the rest of India, various smart city proposals. Metro rail projects is more than 15 cities. The list will go on and on and on. It's pretty mathematical if you look at it, we are a glass that's only about one third full. It's going to be a challenge to take up and finish all the above mentioned ambitious projects but then again, challenge is equal to opportunity. tldr: Enormous is the right word.

Are you are a morning, afternoon, evening or night person? Are you able to 'switch on' and by productive immediately? Or are you a slow starter? Which means, does it take you a long time to get down to work? Also, are you more visual, auditory, or kinesthetic in how you learn and remember things? Some 'for instances'. I am often very slow to prepare myself to work;  when I was studying for my exams in psychology, I would get my books out, then fall asleep for an hour or two. Then I'd go to the toilet for a long moment, then make myself something to eat. All that before I was able to settle down to study. - I still passed all my exams. My wife, could just walk in, make a cup of tea, and start studying. I have a poor memory for remembering facts; I would need to read, re-read, copy, edit, summerise, re-summerise and then find memory tricks to remember stuff. (I have just passed an exam for becoming an 'equine assisted therapist' where I have had to remember, for instance, which groups of muscles work together to action a certain movement. At 59 years old, dyslexic, with no knowledge of anatomy, I still used the same technique.) My wife would pick a book, and with a set of colour highlighters, would highlight; the chapter titles, headings, sub heading and any passages that she thought could be useful. And that was it, she had it down. I used to do quite a lot of theatre, I would learn and repeat my dialogue, walking. This is linked to the kinesthetic functioning of my memory. I am basically a night person, the idea to wake up in the morning and start to study, doesn't work for me.  However, last year, I wrote and published 5 books, while working full time, etc. I would come home from work, eat, relax, watch something, and wait. I would wait to see if the energy to work would come, (which it usually did), and I would then write for an hour or two. Obviously, I was highly productive. Sport and physical hygiene are also really important to keep your mind at it's best operating level. So, to sum up: I am not convinced about this '10 hours a day', studying idea. It is much more important to be efficient for a shorter time, than drag for more. To succeed the long haul, it is imperative to have a balanced lifestyle. It would also be more than useful to be clear on your own personal 'learning profile', so as to put all the chances in your success. Please keep us informed of your progress.

60420057ed76476feda1b59b,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-duties-and-responsibilities-of-an-HR-manager-in-a-software-company?-,"Small software businesses rely on human resources for the specialized talent needed to support their business strategies. As evidenced by a 2010 Deloitte Development survey of chief information officers in high-tech firms, talent issues affect innovation capability, efficiency and overall productivity. Start-ups and small software companies compete for the same talent as their global competitors. They face a declining trend in information technology as a career choice while struggling with retention. This dilemma extends HR’s role beyond hiring; more than their counterparts in other sectors of the economy, information technology HR managers must address the cultural, career pathing and benefits aspects of talent management. Recruitment A recruitment strategy must be based on anticipated needs, such as product development plans or market expansion strategy, and labor market trends. Successful recruiting also requires that HR managers have a command of social media, an ability to recognize how a candidate’s technical experience complements the company's technical needs, and networking skill for referrals. To increase awareness, they will position their company as an “employer of choice.” In a study written for the National Center for Women in Information Technology, Dr. Catherine Ashcraft cites factors for retention from “Climbing the Technical Ladder” that mirror characteristics that employers of choice enjoy: positive work environment, advancement and development opportunities, equitable compensation and work-life balancing initiatives such as flexible scheduling. Culture and Work Environment According to software industry analysts Aldo Ventures, Inc., marathon work sessions to meet deadlines on often abandoned projects, a lack of employee appreciation and zero tolerance for mistakes are stress-producing aspects of software development that create an unattractive work environment. HR has the challenge of instilling what the Stanford Computer Industry Project calls “an esprit de corps” to thwart employee dissatisfaction. HR can hold supervisors and managers accountable for retention and train them on mentoring, team building, employee recognition, being receptive to employee suggestions and tapping into their influence on corporate culture. Career Development Dr. Ashcraft notes that more than 61 percent of mid-level technical employees consider opportunities for promotion necessary to prevent them from seeking employment elsewhere. She also points out that, while mid-level workers consider teamwork and collaboration to be success indicators, such soft skills have little bearing in promotion decisions. To prevent a “brain drain,” HR must establish a promotion-from-within process in which selection criteria is applied consistently and without bias. Training supervisors how to discuss career options and career goals, give performance feedback and develop their employees will improve communication as well as underscore the company's emphasis on career development. Formal employee training programs that challenge technical professionals and expand the company’s pipeline of promotable talent will, according to HR experts Hartley & Associates, “keep key players longer.” Job Flexibility All generations of software employees rate work flexibility and eliminating the need for 24/7 availability as ideal, according to the Deloitte talent gap survey. HR management can use these findings to introduce initiatives that create a family-friendly work culture. Those initiatives might include telecommuting, examining current manpower allocation based on employees' full- or part-time status, requiring flexible scheduling for management, “on-off ramp” programs to enable employees to take time off and return to work, and reviewing the performance evaluation process so that telecommuting and flex-time do not disadvantage participating employees.",2021-03-05T09:56:39.830Z,"What are the duties and responsibilities of an HR manager in a software company?

In general though, the weekdays will be completely dedicated to work. On good days, you might get off with just around 12 hours per day of work, but the usual scenario is closer to an average of 15 hours a day during the weekdays. In addition, there is always a high degree of uncertainty in your life when it comes to making personal plans during weekdays. I remember there being multiple cases when I had to cancel plans because of some urgent work. I now try to avoid any time commitment to anybody till the last moment. However, when it comes to weekends, the situation is usually much better. There is an active push from the firms to ensure that there is as less work on the weekends as possible. Barring some of the projects which are always on fire, most projects generally have lighter weekends. To ensure you don’t burn out, it is recommended to pick up a hobby that you can pursue during weekends. For instance, I try to ensure I am regular in my weekend dance classes, as that helps me relax. You can also try to avoid burning out by taking a few days off every few months to relax or travel. Management consulting is not an easy career, especially if you compare it to a normal 9–5 job. But the perks, especially as you climb up the corporate ladder, are huge - both in terms of monetary benefits and learning. As a result, it is extremely important to be aware of both sides of the coin properly before entering the world of management consulting.

Here’s one that’s free, can be used in a completely self-directed fashion, and works very well for those who give it an honest try. You want satisfaction, and success. You want changes with positive outcomes. Even when it is not obvious, change is always happening. Good decisions can turn that change toward the life you want. Changes that are based solely on information, fade, if the psychological component of decisions is not taken into account. That creates more disappointments. Daniel Kahneman answered a question on this topic with, ""most reactions are a mixture of emotion, and cognition."" He won a Nobel prize for demonstrating this point. What’s needed is a change to the patterns of decisions that carry reminders of earlier traumas. Many of those opinions/decisions stem from long-ago events that may even be forgotten. The conclusions drawn at the time, like, ‘no one likes me’, ‘I can’t do anything right,’ ‘my parents are the problem in my life’, are still operating in all of us. The trick is to stop being as prisoner of those conclusions, and then change them. It’s a long list that varies from person to person, yet those views run the life of the adult. The less you want to face it, the more powerful it is because avoidance of the subject becomes the core of your life. A fundamental shift is necessary in order to become the person you can be, and to release the abilities you already have. How can you do this? Let’s agree on some obvious realities. Before anyone can be a Canadian, Australian, African, American, Guinean, Fijian, Catholic, Hindu, Muslim, Episcopalian, man, woman, child, heshe must be a human. In order to survive as a human, heshe needs water, food, and oxygen. No human produced the water, the oxygen, or the environment that enabled food to be grown. So, before we can disagree about details, we have to share a whole planet, no a whole cosmos, of commonalities, and basic relationships. Let’s examine a few of those. No one lives outside the truth that each being is unique, and requires the conditions that make life possible. No one escapes the reality that causes produce effects. The effects may sometimes not be apparent for years, or they may only be internal. Yet, they do not stay away. No one is above the impermanence of things, and circumstances. Ignoring, or forgetting any of these essential realities will probably lead to an increase of problems. If you agree so far, then it might be appealing to have a convenient, short, way to impress these basic realities on the mind. Good intentions are important, yet have limited power. Neuroplasticity, combined with good intentions, and a solid method, can create fundamental changes. Even a few percent of actions carried out with greater effectiveness can create far reaching improvements. If you are still reading, you may decide to use the method that has already been developed to help anyone achieve the infusion of essential realism into ones mind-life. Infusing the brain involves using the formula that had been abstracted by the scholar from Kucha, named Kumarajiva. He combined the essence of many teachings into a description of the essential relationships of life into five Chinese words. They are pronounced miaofa lienhua jing. But, what does it mean? miaofa An event arises from the potential for it to happen. It also means that we are each a unique set of events that arise from the social, and ecological potential. Have you ever known anyone that didn’t need anything from the rest of the world? lianhua This comes from the name for the lotus blossom. Causes produce effects. This one is very obvious, and hopeful, even though most people mistakenly think of it in terms of punishment. jing This comes from the word 'warp', for the long fibers in fabric. Lives change, yet Life goes on. Without the continuation of life, he individual events would have no meaning. These principles hold anywhere, anytime, any circumstance. It's a great accomplishment on the level of Newton's law of gravitational attraction. It was however theoretical brilliance, not daily life guidance. Then, in the thirteenth century, a monk named Nichiren recognized the value, and saw that ordinary people could use this formulation to rid themselves of confusion, in a step-by-step process. He added the verb Nam, from the greeting namaste. The formula is spoken in the Japanese pronunciation. It is Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. The action does what all actions do. They create new neural connections. The more often the action is taken, the stronger the connections become, and the greater the freedom from the chains of the past become..

Pakistan turning into a water-scarce country, say experts 828 children died in drought-hit Thar in three years, NA panel told Growing Chinese Expat community A growing Chinese expat community and a large infusion of Chinese culture into Pakistan. I’m not sure about the exact amount, but Pakistan could become home to a large and growing Chinese expat community who will primarily be concentrated in Lahore, Punjab and Islamabad-Rawalpindi but also spread across in smaller communities and compounds dotting the country. Some of them will be settled close to CPEC related projects while others might start their own private businesses and mix with the local population. We might have government and legal systems in place facilitating their travel across the country and security provisions. There might also be an uptick in marriages between Chinese people and Pakistani people and it might not even be restricted to Uyghur Muslim Chinese and Pakistani Chinese. I have observed that Chinese people are pretty secular minded and don’t normally make a big deal of converting for marriage. This is a personal observation, feel free to correct me. How Pakistan is becoming China's land of opportunity “China Town” Likely to be Established In Karachi Growing infusion of Chinese culture into Pakistan Chinese cultural infusion into the country deserves it’s own separate point. Pakistan as a nation state has a curious case of identity related issues due to our somewhat hybrid state as a Muslim majority country located between the greater Indian civilization sphere and the Greater Iranian-Turkic-Afghan cultural spheres. In this state of half-existence, we technical don’t fully qualify for inclusion in either cultural sphere. Pakhtuns and Baloch identify more with Iranian-Afghan culture than India from my observations. Punjabis tend to be split between the ones embracing their South Asian identity or fully cutting themselves off from local stuff to embrace Islamic identity. Sindh on the other hand is a pretty self-contained culture in it’s own right. Because of this void in our identity, our multi-cultural and multi-ethnic nature and somewhat fluid existence, Pakistan has always proven fertile ground for the importation of foreign culture and ideology whether it’s the Arabization under General Zia, Afghan cultural influx in the 80s and 90s, the Indian media influx and Bollywood culture under Musharraf and the PPP 2008–2013 government or the current Chinese cultural influx under the democratic government of 2013–2018. This also fits in with the Pakistan’s ancient heritage as a crossing point between greater civilisation spheres, as it sits adjacent to Turkic, Iranian, Afghan, Sikh, Hindu and Chinese civilisations and culture. We will see a sharp uptick in Chinese food consumption, Chinese language use, Chinese clothing and goods, Chinese business presence, Chinese architecture and Chinese cultural practices like Chinese dragon symbols, fire crackers, new years celebration related stuff, their garden styles and maybe even some Feng Shui in more wealthier, liberal suburbs. Chinese cultural symbols will definitely become more visible if not commonplace in Pakistan by 2030. A lot of this stuff has happened already or is currently happening. The Ali Baba CEO is setting up his presence in the country. Property prices are rising in certain areas as Chinese buy real estate here. Chinese goods and services are becoming mainstream across the nation. Chinese people intermingling, roaming the streets of Pakistan in major cities will be a common sight rather than a rarity in 2030, as evidenced by the Dawn News video about Chinese businesswomen selling cellphones in Karachi: Dawn.com Pakistan also has a large and growing number of people learning and using the Chinese language. Chinese Confucian language centres are swamped with so many language students they have to do classes multiple times a day to accommodate them all. Confucian centres have had mixed results across the globe depending on the politics of the region, but due to the close nature of Pakistan and China’s relationship they have been met with a large amount of success in the country. Even certain projects of CPEC are designed to enhance the projection of Chinese soft power via culture in Pakistan. This is an extract about the fiber optic line being placed from Pakistan to China: “A national fibreoptic backbone will be built for the country not only for internet traffic, but also terrestrial distribution of broadcast TV, which will cooperate with Chinese media in the “dissemination of Chinese culture”.” We might soon see Chinese news channels, TV shows and films translated and played on local media here. The massive popularity of Turkish dramas in Pakistan offers a precedent. It remains to be seen whether Chinese media finds a foothold in this conservative Muslim country. Confucius Institutes expanding rapidly to meet demand for Chinese language skills - ICEF Monitor - Market intelligence for international student recruitment Mandarin lessons to become compulsory in Pakistan Pakistan embraces language lessons and Chinese culture Mother China: A 'Chinese revolution' sweeps across Pakistan Dawn.com Pak-China ties getting stronger through cultural corridor: Sun Weidong But all in all, several aspects of Chinese culture, Chinese people, their language, media, architecture, diet and practises will become pretty visible, if not commonplace, by 2030. A Different Economy We will transition from a agricultural-semi industrial economy to a more logistics-semi industrial-commercial economy with a reduced role for agriculture. Part of this will be due to water shortages and land loss reducing agricultural output. Part of this will be due to Chinese investments changing the economic landscape and bringing certain new sectors into greater prominence. The CPEC investments total somewhere around 20% of our current economic size. If you sink 50 billion into a 1 trillion USD economy, it might not change that economy much and just be absorbed without changing the economic footprint of different sectors. But in a smaller economy like Pakistan which is only around 270 billion USD, 50 billion USD will change how much different sectors contribute to the economy, which sectors employ how many people and so on. An authoritarian democracy A contradiction perhaps, but one that can only work in Pakistan. We are seeing even today the uneasy nexus between the Armed Forces, the Establishment, the Elected career politicians, the Judiciary and the Islamists settling into a stable equilibrium. Neither having the required power to overtake all the others. And some, not having the capacity to do so. Pakistan is an increasingly large and complex country. Both in terms of size and internal factionalism. A coup cannot control and contain the entirety of the nation as it could in the past. And neither does the inclination for a coup exist anymore (for now). Similarly, the PML-N has seen the limits of its power in the face of an energetic and fanatical PTI and an assertive Judiciary. Without going into details, suffice it to say that all the different factions like the courts, the Army, the PML-N, the PTI, the Islamists and so on have seen the limits of their power during the tussle to redefine Pakistan from the 1998–2017 period and they have all settled into an uneasy but currently steady equilibrium that we see today. A limited democracy. A flawed republic. But the increasing trend towards authoritarianism has been the one key element common to all these factions. Mass surveillance, deportations, border controls, militarised law and order, suspension of normal procedures for quick and easy enforcement and so on have continue regardless of which way the power of the pendulum swings. After taking a beating from all sides during the turbulence of the 2008–2013 period when the country was transitioning between military rule and civilian rule, the state is starting to settle and reassert itself. There is a growing and gnawing fear that Pakistan is in for some immense challenges ahead in the near future. And that fear is translating into increasingly harsh and punitive government measures for controlling citizens and mass surveillance. And these measures pass because of the flawed nature of our democracy, lack of civil society, general consensus among most government power centres that they are needed and a populace scarred by terrorism for decades willing to accept them. Missing persons, jailing for criticism of powerful institutions and people in public, harsh and questionable sentencing under anti-terror laws, mass surveillance of private lives, torture, abduction and death penalties will become more frequent. Military courts will be a permanent part of the judicial system and sentencing/trials for terrorism or related charges will be “off the books” for the most part. Terror will be wielded as an instrument of the state to impose harsh law and order. Pakistan's Military-Democracy Complex Military courts resume in Pakistan Pakistan, currently, is a competitive authoritarian regime and not a democratic one A two front military deployment As the war in Afghanistan intensifies, placing significant pressure on the Afghan government, we might see a tense border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. There will be heavy fortifications, artillery exchanges and extremely restricted travel across the western border similar to the border with India. Under defence policy in the Trump administration, which is increasingly defined by the Generals appointed by President Trump, we are seeing a larger troop commitment by the US to Afghan government defence against an increasingly stronger Taliban insurgency. The US will not be willing to give up all of it’s military presence and nation building investments in Afghanistan are spending so much blood and treasure on the country in nearly 2 decades of war. However, if the US government does change policy on Afghanistan after a change in Presidents and does begin a pullout, it’s quite possible India might send troops and arms to prop up the Afghan government. India is currently undergoing a transformation in foreign policy and taking a more muscular foreign policy approach on the back of its growing economic and military capability. India, similar to the US, might not allow investments in Afghanistan and a friendly regime go to waste if the US were to pullout and the Afghan government were to face a collapse. A small but significant deployment of Indian forces in Afghanistan to assist the current government might be a possibility by 2030 if the Western ISAF mission were to abandon Afghan government in the face of an increasingly aggressive Taliban offensive. We might even see other smaller nations like Bangladesh and Nepal sent small support contingents as well under an Indian umbrella. Of course, this possibility might not come to pass if the Afghan troops manage to hold out against the Taliban with ISAF air support/special ops backup. Or if a political settlement is reached with Russia-Iran-China-Pakistan acting as mediators between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Whether or not ISAF remains in Afghanistan or leaves and is replaced by India or we see the Afghan government alone, the situation at the Western border is likely to remain tense enough to necessitate military deployment on 2 fronts. Even if the government collapses and the Taliban take over the entire country, a 2 front deployment might still be in place. The last 16 years have changed Afghanistan for a long time to come. There will always be an influx of terror from the West, necessitating a fortified and controlled border and the military troops needed to screen it. This would mean more defence expenditure as well. Which would either add to our debt, be absorbed by the economic growth enabled by CPEC or be made up with foreign aid (the SCO’s counter-terror budget for example). More technology, more advanced infrastructure Due to the capitalist and relatively open nature of Pakistan’s economy and the current trend of Chinese investments in Pakistani infrastructure, we are likely to keep up with a lot of tech trends in the world. Military tech aside, Pakistan in 2030 could see more advanced cellular comms, wireless payments, subways, urban metros, renewable energies and even some electric vehicles. Technological progress doesn’t automatically mean a better life though. Pakistan experienced a massive boom in internet, cellular tech and urban mass transit but at the same time experienced massive law and order problems, terrorism and flooding. But the point here is, that by 2030, this trend is likely to continue. China’s WeChat app and its ushering in of wireless digital payments, scheduling and other options could cross over into Pakistan as well. The current CPEC project laying down a fibre optic cable from Pakistan to China and China’s Ali Baba entering Pakistan’s e-commerce market could enhance this integration of digital economies and services in Pakistan and China. WeChat faced issues with it’s adoption in countries like Vietnam because it contained a map that showed the Nine Dash Line as China’s border in the South China sea which angered countries like Vietnam and Philippines who oppose those claims. Pakistan, however, does not have any sentiments over that dispute so WeChat could become on of the mainstays in the country’s digital market, especially if it is integrated with the country’s e-commerce and digital, wireless financial transactions infrastructure. This makes sense historically as well as ever since Musharraf opened up the economy during his tenure, we’ve pretty much automatically adopted tech from abroad in our localised setting. Whether it’s Netflix, Uber or what not. And this is likely to continue. And the CPEC investments in infrastructure (urban rail lines, metros), fiber optics and e-commerce will also usher in more up to date tech in everyday Pakistani life.

The road to peace between India and Pakistan increasingly passes through Beijing as the systemic barriers to peace between India and Pakistan are making it increasingly difficult for a bilateral process to work. SAARC’s death suits both country’s just fine. It allows India to focus on BIMSTEC and BBIN. And Pakistan focuses on the SCO. Pakistan has long advocated joining a regional forum where India isn’t the only economic heavyweight (and thus, the sole power) as was the case with SAARC and the SCO with it’s Russian and Chinese members meets this criteria perfectly. This will be compounded by the fact that the only major economic, diplomatic and counter terror alliance that Pakistan and India will share in common will be the SCO. And the SCO is dominated by the policy agenda set forward by China. Pakistan will be increasingly embedded in the SCO and possible majority of its economic, diplomatic, military and counter terror activities will be under the auspices of the SCO regional framework. Economic integration and regional cooperation will be increasingly defined with China, Central Asia, Iran and Afghanistan (the latter with a pinch of salt). How the entry of India and Pakistan transforms the SCO’s agenda SAARC Is Dead; Long Live SAARC Greater Debt Problems and more Debt relief and servicing with the AIIB and Chinese state banks rather than the IMF/World Bank Pakistan’s debt problem is unlikely to go away anytime soon. Declining exports might soon be compounded probably by the GCC countries kicking out Pakistani labourers and workers from their countries due to Pakistan’s refusal to be involved in their disputes with Iran. Pakistan’s debt issues will plague it well into the next decade. Because of cooling ties with the US that has the most significant voting rights in institutions like the IMF and World Bank, its possible that future debt servicing will not be possible from the IMF. Instead, Chinese banks like the AIIB might take up Pakistan’s debt management programs. China bails out Pakistan with over $1 billion in loans Eurobond debt paid off with Chinese loan - The Express Tribune More state fragility, urban pressure, crime With a population straining at 200 million, a huge youth bulge and growing stress on scarce economic resources, it’s a blunt fact that there will be an increased threat to the state from large segments of society unable to get jobs and business opportunities. While CPEC related projects and investments will stave off pressure from the government for a while, until and unless massive investments are made in education and training sectors, new business opportunities created, exports boosted and trade accelerated: the country is in for some deep problems. More and more rural to urban migration will occur as well on the backs of a declining agricultural sector, environmental degradation and lack of rural opportunities in general. This will stress city infrastructure and collect large groups of people in one place which is always a recipe for disaster during times of tense political and economic crises.  Three trends i’m uncertain about: Will we lean more towards Iran or the GCC in 2030?Will religious conservatism be less or more in 2030?Will CPEC integration occur with India, Iran or both or neither?The Iran-GCC issue is in a state of flux. On one hand we are in trouble with the GCC as they deport more of our labor force, we refuse to send troops to Yemen, strictly stay out of Saudi lead military force against Iran and have committed ourselves to defend Saudi Arabia only from a hostile invasion. On the other hand, we just shot down an Iranian drone, our border with Iran is unstable with border guards being killed and mortars being fired and delays in economic integration. The situation remains in a state of flux and it’s hard to determine whether we will stick with our current neutrality, lean towards the GCC or lean towards Iran in 2030. The religious conservatism also deserves some analysis. The long war on terror has upset the forces of political Islam who have lost key strongholds in their north western regions to upstart parties or establishment parties pursuing a primarily economic rather than Islamist agenda. On the one hand we see the old conservatism and ultra conservatism even still at play as we see ISIS encroach in the region, religious mob violence, honor killings and terrorist violence persist. On the other hand we see massive reduction in non-state Islamist actors holding sovereign territory as military offensives kick into gear, intelligence operations nab more terrorists, the western border is sealed, refugee camps emptied and more violent factions law down arms to join mainstream political activities. There has been quite an opening up of Pakistani society with more media channels having quite liberal content, more women in the work force and higher educational standards. It’s a far leap over what our society was like in the 90s. Pakistan has never been a resource rich country like the GCC so it has always had to balance some aspects of modernity and progress with its traditional, conservative form of Islam in order to remain a viable threat to it’s eastern neighbor. Nowhere is this balancing act better symbolized than by the Hijabi female fighter pilots in the Pakistan air force, walking the fine line between modernity and traditional values. What our society will look like in 2030 in terms of this balancing act and which way we swing more, remains to be seen. And ofcourse, the last point is a question over what path the future of Indian, Pakistani and Iranian relations take. CPEC integration with the giant economies of Iran and India is a goal for China as part of it’s OBOR project and even Pakistan seems quiet open to the idea. Shun ‘enmity’, join CPEC: Pakistan Army commander tells India Whether all three countries involved manage to resolve their differences and push forward in economic integration is a question that remains to be answered, although given the current border crises that just popped up between China and India, i have a pessimistic viewpoint on what the future could hold.  Pakistan, due to its somewhat hybrid identity has shifted constantly as a society throughout the decades of it’s existence and has proven fertile ground for foreign cultures, ideologies and social concepts to take root. Similarly, her position as a nexus between major competing powers and Geopolitical forces has shifted her economic, political and military fortunes considerably and they too have remained in a state of flux. Add to that the upcoming pressures of water stress and overpopulation. I could be 100% wrong about everything i predicted in this answer. Or 100% right. Or somewhere in between. That, is pretty much Pakistan in a nutshell. 13 years is a far off prediction to make. I can give some basic estimates off of what i see in current trends. These represent my personal opinions: Water stress and rationing. Water stressed cities and water rationing/water bills in place. Households are only allowed to use a certain amount of water, you have to pay a bill on water too. Water related black economy is in place with Water Tanker mafia operating in cities by paying off cops and smuggling/selling water in urban areas. Cops regularly bust poor people for hoarding water from broken city pipes. Unfortunate episodes of drought like the Continue Reading",2021-03-05T10:01:39.576Z,"Where do you see Pakistan in 2030?

The world’s challenges are complex, and they will require complex systems to solve them. Machine Learning engineers are building these systems. If this is YOUR future, then there’s no time like the present to start mastering the skills and developing the mindset you’re going to need to succeed. So here I have listed the most important skills required: Programming Skills- This is one of the main skills and mentioned in almost all the answers here. There are multiple languages which provide machine learning capabilities. Some of the popular programming languages to learn machine learning in are Python, R, and C/C++. It's up to you to decide which programming language you want to master, but it's advisable to have a little understanding of other languages and what their advantages and disadvantages are over your preferred one.C/C++ are almost as low level as you can get in programming. They’re especially suitable for developing software that is memory and speed critical such as operating systems and networking protocols. They’re also hardware interfacing programs. These are usually the languages used to program the infrastructure and mechanics of machine learning engines.R is a language that has been specifically tailored for statistical computing and data mining, making it an excellent choice for machine learning tasks. There’s a huge repository of algorithms and statistical models developed in R for various tasks.Python is one of the favorite languages of data scientists and machine learning engineers. Although a general purpose language, Python has a number of useful libraries (NumPy, SciPy and Pandas) for efficient data processing and scientific computing. It also has a number of specialized machine learning libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, Theano and TensorFlow) that make it easy to train algorithms using different computing platforms.Fundamentals of Programming and CS- Machine learning is a field that involves performing computation on huge sets of data, and therefore it requires proficiency in fundamental concepts such as data structures, algorithms, complexity and computer architecture. This is a good opportunity to take out those semester books and review your stacks, b-trees, sort algorithms, or skim through your programming book and solve a few parallel programming problems.Software Design- As a machine learning engineer, you’ll have to create algorithms and systems that integrate and communicate with other software components and ecosystems that are already in place. That is why you’ll need a strong background in Application Programming Interfaces (API) of different flavors (web APIs, static and dynamic libraries, etc.) as well as designing interfaces that will sustain future changes that will overcome your overall system. Creating reliable and flexible software requires mastering skills such as requirements analysis, developing use cases and test cases, documentation and testing.Applying ML Libraries and Algorithms- Part of your job as a machine learning engineer will be to use algorithms and libraries created by other developers and organizations. There are already a lot of packages, APIs and libraries you can use such as Google’s TensorFlow, Microsoft’s CNTK and Apache Spark’s MLib. But applying them effectively will require understanding models and learning procedures, how they apply to each technology, and the potential pitfalls.Probability and Statistics- Most machine learning algorithms are about dealing with uncertainty and making reliable predictions. The mathematical tools to deal with such settings are found in principles of probability and its derivative techniques such as Markov Decision Processes and Bayes Nets. Also of importance are tools and techniques that enable the creation of models from data. Relevant to this task is the field of statistics and its various branches such as analysis of variance and hypothesis testing. Machine learning algorithms are often built upon statistical models.Data Modelling- Machine learning often involves analyzing unstructured data, which relies on the science of data modeling, the process of estimating the underlying structure of a data-set, finding patterns and filling gaps where data is nonexistent. Understanding data modeling and evaluation concepts is key to creating sound algorithms that can be trained and enhanced over time.Now a days there are many courses available and these are the best way to kick start your machine learning journey. Both students and professionals will have an edge over all other applicants if they leverage these degree or a certification on the same. Intro to Machine Learning - GL4L- Machine learning is starting to redefine the way we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters.

But now,  Continue Reading There are a lot of trends that rise and fall in the business world every year. Likewise, 2017 is also expected to bring about some extraordinary changes in the field of project management. In this article, you will read about impactful agile project management trends that will bring about miraculous changes. 1. Agile Project Management will rise above Software Development Gone are the days when agile project management was confined to software development only. The change is quite visible. Earlier, Scrum was used only for finance and Kanban software was limited to editorial staff only. But now, the world knows about the concept of Agile project management. From pet food product development, graphic designers, UX professionals, to construction management, agile project management has taken it all over. In fact, with a decent experience and expertise, users can design an agile project management that caters to their needs. 2. Collaboration is essential for success A good project manager will need to adapt to change management over project management in 2017. Thus, collaboration has become an important factor in making projects successful today. Moreover with growing teams, effective collaboration and communication have become essential for accomplishing project goals and deadlines. This has given rise to the need of collaboration tools to keep everyone involved in the project on the same page and also keep stakeholders engaged. The need of collaboration is one of the significant project management trends for 2017. 3. Automation gains Importance There will be a change in repetitive project management tasks such as marketers filling their time sheets making their job tedious. In fact, automation tools like status alerts and reminders have been overtaken by communication tools. In fact, companies are adding bots for sharing notifications automatically and launching latest website or app versions. Today, it is easy to figure out companies heavily investing and using automated tools. 4. From Non traditional Collaboration tools to traditional project management software The year 2017 marks a significant change from non traditional collaboration tools to a full-fledged project management software. In fact, the shift is visible. Companies are now shifting from collaboration software to full-fledged project management tools like ProofHub which can fulfill all project requirements including tasks, milestones, and collaboration needs. Adapting to such systems will never be easy. It demands strong change management skills and an experienced lead project manager. 5. Emotional intelligence will take over all other skills For all new project managers out there, only a hi-fi B school degree wouldn’t be enough to get your dream job. You may call it project management personality assessments or the right candidate ‘feel’ or ‘charisma’ will become significantly important thing for a successful project manager career. Leaders or project manager with high EQ or emotional intelligence will be able to run more successful projects as compared to the ones with low EQ. Researches have said it, “Leaders who utilize their emotional resources to foster “engagement” are able to deliver significant bottom-line results”. 6. Project management certifications will lose importance PMP certifications have been popular since 1984 and there are many certified project managers as well. But today there is a big question over the value of these certifications and their cost. Project management expert at GetApp, Lauren Maffeo says doesn’t find PMP certifications worth having. She quotes, “exam content isn’t updated often enough to keep pace with today’s small business needs.” And this is why small businesses no longer want PMP certified professionals but someone who can really manage projects. Although larger companies are bound to follow the suit but if they begin to overlook the “PMP” requirement then PMP will become moot. So, if you are happy and secure in your PM job then there is no need to pay for the recertification this year. 7. Work hour flexibility will gain importance Digital tools and mobile devices have a positive impact on overall productivity of the team as it helps them to work for longer hours in a flexible manner. This has also give rise to remote working and work from home opportunities. So, employees are expected to give importance to work mobility and device flexibility over pay. More and more people are now expected to switch to a irregular working schedule that gives them flexibility to work on their own terms.

And then, create and follow a plan for yourself, personally and professionally. I'll go into this more but I need to make another point.  I dropped out myself, and I recommend dropping out in 99% of cases, BUT, leaving college is NOT necessarily going to make your life better. In one of Seneca's Letters he tells us a story about Socrates in which Socrates was asked why a certain traveler had not been improved by traveling. Socrates responded:  ""But of course — he took himself along with him."" (And brought himself back) Moral of the story? Don't seek a change in external circumstances as a solution for what might be largely internal problems. When I was in college, I made a rather unhealthy habit of telling myself that if I ""just dropped out,"" I would immediately be free to achieve all of my goals, despite that fact that I rarely went to class and so in reality had ample free time to do many of the things I claimed circumstance prevented me from doing. It was only AFTER I left college that I realized that life doesn't get too much better unless you work to make it better. Do I regret leaving? Absolutely not.  It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. College can make you... MiserableLazyApatheticEntitledSpectacularly bad at writingBroke and indebtedEtc. If you leave school you'll have an opportunity to improve yourself, but that's all it will be. An opportunity. It's up to you whether you take it. Now... Back to some more practical advice for what you can do immediately after you drop out to ""take that opportunity."" And a note in response to another answer: You do not need a job lined up. Sometimes it's best not to go immediately to work. You need time to unschool yourself and to create a plan for yourself. I’ve learned more in the last year of following my own plan than I did in 2 years of college. You can do it to. Take 30 days and follow these steps: 1) Drop out. I've already said this. Drop out and don't look back. 2) Write something everyday. Write about your interested in, about dropping out, write down your goals. It doesn't matter. The number one thing you can do for your productivity and success is to write every day. 3) Read books, lots of books. You’re finally in a place where nobody can make you do something you don't want to. You get to choose what YOU want to learn. Use this chance and read as much as you can on subjects that lend some value to you personally or professionally. 4) Set a schedule for yourself. Wake up and go to bed at the same time. Eat regularly. Set aside certain hours to work, certain hours to study, and certain hours to work out, relax or play. You're used to having these things set for you. Don't mess up like I did and let yourself waste away for the first few months until you wake up.  5) Start learning a tangible, deliverable skill. Here's the a little inconvenient truth about most college graduates: they don't have many real skills that can be used in the workplace. Employers can't find people to fill jobs. Since you don't have that piece of paper, you'll need to differentiate yourself. Find a valuable skill and learn it. Some of mine are digital marketing, photography, eCommerce and copywriting. These skills have gotten me high paying jobs for clients around the country as well as a position at two startups. Learn a skill and you'll be miles ahead of your peers. Where can you learn? I learned from a combination of various blogs I find online, internet courses, and real world experience. The last was most important. I got myself a job managing an eBay store for a client and in a few months had learned a skill, eBay and Amazon, that I have been able to take to other clients around the country. And I know I can fall back on that skill if I ever need work. If you're looking for an opportunity to get real world career experience, check out Praxis - Break the Mold. They're an alternative to college startup that places people like you in dynamic businesses around the country where they get paid and work with founders and CEO's to learn skills that they can take into any field. 6) Eat healthy and exercise. It sounds almost self helpy, but it's so true. God, is it true! Set aside 15-30 minutes everyday to get your blood running. You'll think clearer and be happier and more productive. 7) Tell EVERYONE what you're doing. This can be awkward at first, but then it becomes fun to watch people squirm while they at once silently judge you and feel strange envy that you've set out on your own path. The single most important thing I've done since I dropped out was telling everyone about what is going on in my life. Use social media to do this. It will open so many personal and professional opportunities for you. Here are some opportunities I had:  Interviewed on a podcastHired by a startupAttending the Thiel SummitHired as an educational advisor for young peoplePeople began forwarding new opportunities to me. I shot video and photography at numerous events. I got introduced to new marketing clients.I was flown across the country multiple times.All of this because I was vocal about my comings and goings. Tell people what you're up to and that you're looking for opportunities, and they will come for you. A blog is one of the best ways to do this. 8) Create something. Create a product, a short ebook, a personal blog, meetup group, an email list, etc. It doesn't quite matter. The goal is to get yourself in the mindset for creating. It's a discipline more than a skill. It doesn't even matter if it's bad. You'll get feedback on your work and you'll get ideas for new projects. Don't skip this. 9) Write down some short and long term goals for yourself and create a plan for achieving them. Read them and act on them every day. 10) Become an expert in something. Write about it, talk about it, get interviewed. If you're an expert, you can always find work.  And here's the secret. The difference between expert and non expert is 5 books read, a couple of blog posts written and a Facebook status or two. That's it. If you do that, you'll be in the top 1% for almost any field you want to enter and you can leverage that to open doors and generate income. Take 30 days and do all of these and you'll be well on your way to setting yourself up for success. One more additional tip: Consider working for free if you have to. I know, I know, this sounds bad. But it's one of the best ways you can get your foot in the door and if you do a good job, it will almost always lead to paid employment. Finally, I have an offer for you. I don't know you and I don't know why you want to leave school, but I'd love to interview you. I write regularly about this topic and am always looking to tell more stories to my audience. If you're interested, shoot me an email on Contact | Derek Magill Drop out. Paralysis by analysis is death. Make a decision and correct along the way. You can always go back.

It took me ten months to leave that life behind and start feeling like I belonged to the exclusive world of people who can tell their medians from their means, their x-bars from the neighborhood pub, and who know how to teach machines what they need to learn. The transformation process was not easy and demanded hard work, lots of time, dedication and required plenty of help along the way. It also involved well over hundreds of hours of “studying” in different forms and an equal amount of time practicing and applying all that was being learned. In short, it wasn’t easy to transform from being data dumb to a data nerd, but I managed to do so while going through a terribly busy work schedule as well as being a dad to a one-year-old.  The point of this article is to help you if you are looking to make a similar transformation but do not know where to start and how to proceed from one step to the next. If you are interested in finding out, read on to get an idea about the topics you need to cover and also develop an understanding of the level of expertise you need to build at each stage of the learning process. There are plenty of great online and offline resources to help you master each of these steps, but very often, the trouble for the uninitiated can be in figuring out where to start and where to finish. I hope spending the next ten to fifteen minutes going through this article will help solve that problem for you. And finally, before proceeding any further, I would like to point out that I had a lot of help in making this transformation. Right at the end of the article, I will reveal how I managed to squeeze in so much learning and work in a matter of ten months. But that’s for later. For now, I want to give you more details about the nine steps that I had to go through in my transformation process.  Step 1: Understand the basics Spend a couple of weeks enhancing your “general knowledge” about the field of data science and machine learning. You may already have ideas and some sort of understanding about what the field is, but if you want to become an expert, you need to understand the finer details to a point where you can explain it in simple terms to just about anyone. Suggested topics: What is Analytics?What is Data Science?What is Big Data?What is Machine Learning?What is Artificial Intelligence?How are the above domains different from each other and related to each other?How are all of the above domains being applied in the real world?Exercise to show that you know: Write a blog post telling readers how to answer these questions if asked in an interviewStep 2: Learn some Statistics I have a confession to make. Even though I feel like a machine learning expert, I do not feel that I have any level of expertise in statistics. Which should be good news for people who struggle with concepts in statistics as much as I do, as it proves that you can be a data scientist without being a statistician. Having said that, you cannot ignore statistical concepts – not in machine learning and data science! So what you need to do is to understand certain concepts and know when they may be applied or used. If you can also completely understand the theory behind these concepts, give yourself a few good pats on your back. Suggested topics: Data structures, variables, and summariesSamplingThe basic principles of probabilityDistributions of random variablesInference for numerical and categorical dataLinear, multiple and logistic regressionSuggested exercise to mark the completion of this step: Create a list of references with the easiest to understand the explanation that you found for each topic and publish them in a blog. Add a list of statistics related questions that one may be expected to answer in a data science interviewStep 3: Learn Python or R (or both) for data analysis Programming turned out to be easier to learn, more fun and more rewarding in terms of the things it made possible than I had ever imagined. While mastering a programming language could be an eternal quest, at this stage, you need to get familiar with the process of learning a language and that is not too difficult. Both Python and R are very popular and mastering one can make it quite easy to learn the other. I started with R and have slowly started using Python for doing similar tasks as well. Suggested topics: Supported data structuresRead, import or export dataData quality analysisData cleaning and preparationData manipulation – e.g. sorting, filtering, aggregating and other functionsData visualizationKnow that you are set for the next step: Extract a table from a website, modify it to compute new variables, and create graphs summarizing the dataStep 4: Complete an Exploratory Data Analysis Project In the first cricket test match ever played (see scorecard), Australian Charles Bannerman scored 67.35% (165 out of 245) of his team’s total score, in the very first innings of cricket’s history. This remains a record in cricket at the time of writing, for the highest share of the total score by a batsman in an innings of a test match. What makes the innings even more remarkable is that the other 43 innings in that test match had an average of only 10.8 runs an innings, with only about 40% of all batsmen registering a score of ten or more runs. In fact, the second-highest score by an Australian in the match was 20 runs. Given that Australia won the match by 45 runs, we can say with conviction that Bannerman’s innings was the most important contributor to Australia’s win. Just like we were able to build this story from the scorecard of the test match, exploratory data analysis is about studying data to understand the story that is hidden beneath it, and then sharing the story with everyone. Personally, I find this phase of a data project the most interesting, which is a good thing as quite a lot of the time in a typical project could be expected to be taken up by exploratory data analysis. Topics to cover: Single variable explorationsPair-wise and multi-variable explorationsVisualization, dashboard, and storytelling in TableauProject output: Create a blog post summarizing the exercise and sharing the dashboard or story. Use a dataset with at least ten columns and a few thousand records Step 5: Create unsupervised learning models Let’s say we had data for all the countries in the world across many parameters ranging from population, to income, to health, to major industries and more. Now suppose we wanted to find out which countries are similar to each other across all these parameters. How do we go about doing this, when we have to compare each country with all the others, across over 50 different parameters? That is where unsupervised machine learning algorithms come in. This is not the time to bore you with details about what these are all about, but the good news is that once you reach this stage, you have moved on into the world of machine learning and are already in elite company.

We use it a lot at Bridge for Billions, where we have a team of 15 people from 10 countries, working together on a platform in 3 languages with hundreds of users - and it works! Based on inherited wisdom from the Western Australia Aborigines people, it was initially developed by John Croft, b. He thought of it as a system thinking tool, translated into a participative and holistic methodology to foster creativity, collaboration, and sustainability within any project. Don’t you see how, for thousands and thousands of years, our ancestors would gather around a fire to share their dreams and tell stories, from which they would make decisions, plan activities, and then gather again around a new fire only to celebrate it all at the end of the day? I didn’t realize this either. But the link is real — or so thought John Croft.  In the prologue of “Dragon Dreaming in Action, A guide to designing projects for personal growth, community building and service to the Earth”, John Croft underlines that 90% of projects fail to work according to plan — the same amount as the business startups who don’t make it to their 4th anniversary. To him, it means that only 1 person out of 1000 ends up seeing their dream come true. And that’s exactly what the methodology aims to change. Dragon Dreaming as a process allows teams to build together a strong vision (dream), turn it into concrete objectives (plan) and actions (doing), and then acknowledge the whole process to move on (celebrate). No wonder it has become such a popular project management tool: by disrupting the traditional approach and creating new behavioral patterns, it unites teams around their tasks while promoting company engagement, ownership and joy through a feeling of success. Yes, all that.   Dragon Dreaming introduces a simple, playful and creative process as key to stimulate motivation, vision alignment, and engagement towards a certain task or project, working with wisdom, creativity, and a united front with each person’s strengths. So how can we engage all these different sides to work together? By considering them all part of the same creative process. Dreaming This one seems familiar. In fact, we all think this is our area of expertise: how could you not be good at dreaming? You do it every night without even thinking about it. But there’s more to it. Dreaming is where all innovation is born: no disruptive process was ever found by a purely linear executed action plan. Dreaming unleashes and maintains creativity. Did you know that an estimated 90% (yes, again) of ideas get blocked in the dreaming stage? Lack of courage, fear of failure, procrastination, lack of confidence, panic zone, insert your excuse… There are many reasons why. But the first and most common mistake is not giving yourself or your team the time and space to dream… and dare! If you’re not aware of your daydreams, you’ll never share them. And if you don’t share your ideas, you won’t be able to get a team around it or ever start planning for it. Planning Sharing your dreams is the first step to making them reality. Together with your peers, you will come up with new ideas, define better strategies and get a plan. In consultancy, there is a common saying: “plans only exist to tell you where have you failed”. To some extent, planning is what allows you to achieve the objective, learn what works and what doesn’t, and let yourself be surprised by everything else you’ll find along the way. In a nutshell, planning is what brings your ideas from dreams into reality. Doing Transformation is all about “walking the talk” rather than “talking the walk”. Most business ideas fail to last longer than 3 years, and usually due to lack of scalability possibilities, effective succession planning or… founders burnout. This is where Dragon Dreaming can help you break the system. There’s no efficient doing without creative and accurate planning, and no effective planning without a self-incorporated routine of daydreaming. While poor planning and lack of self-discipline eventually lead to frustration, apathy, and avoidance behavior patterns, building a strong bridge between dreaming and doing will keep you motivated, engaged and with a clear vision of why you’re doing all of this. Celebrating (& evaluating) As resilient and goal-oriented entrepreneurs, this is often the part where we struggle the most. When was the last time you paused to acknowledge everything you’ve done so far, and actually celebrate it? Have you really made peace with that failed strategy, while daring to start over? But wait: 25% of your time allocated to celebration? Who has time for this? What about my never-ending to-do list? Who is going to actually get the work done? But that’s exactly the point of this methodology. If you’re always doing and going back to planning and doing and planning some more without taking the time to stop and reflect on what has been done, how will you have time to dream again and design better plans for the future? Nowadays, stopping to breathe, being grateful and having fun is a privilege. We’re constantly thinking about that client we still need to reply to, or all the urgent and important tasks we’re already late on delivering. But the joy you get out of actually celebrating is as important as the first three steps of Dragon Dreaming to allow real transformation insights. “Reflect four different ways of thinking, four different ways of speaking, four different personality types. If you are a “Doer” your biggest frustration will be to work with “Dreamers” all day long. And if you are a “Planner” you find the “Celebrators” are chaotic and disorganized whilst the “Celebrators” find the “Planners” are just boring. But to make your dream come true, you need all four kinds of people in your project Dream Team.” Dragon Dreaming International",2021-03-05T10:07:52.096Z,"What are the best project management and team management tools?

There is truth in the saying fake it ’til you make it, and if you somehow have a related job experience or skill set, you might just pull it off.Know your worth and stick to it. If you know you’re worth $0.15 cents per word, never flinch. Granted there are multiple exceptions to this rule, and some can actually make a better financial plan despite reducing rates, backing down from a client who NEEDS your services is the last thing you want to do. Look, if they’re already interviewing you it means they think you’re worth the time and effort based on the portfolio, resume, or cover letter you sent. Act like you don’t need them and more often than not, they will bend. Just make sure you do it in a professional way and can actually deliver as promised, or you’ll be blacklisted from potential new clients through word of mouth.Choose your clients carefully. The ones who want to negotiate you to less than 50% of your actual asking price are never worth it. They see you as a tool to use, not someone to work with. In my experience, those willing to pay my rates and not flinch when asked for payment are the best to work with. Naturally, they also prefer high-rate freelancers because they still see higher rates = better and more professional.Have a blog. A lot of freelancers depend too much on what their resumes say and not actually have a whole website or free blog that displays all the reasons to hire them. That blog could include public feedback, your portfolio or samples, and you can even have it as a means to contact you directly. If you’re good with SEO, you might just pop up in one of their Google searches. This is by no means mandatory if you want to jump start your career, but it does help specially if you want new samples to use when applying. A blog also works if you’re totally new and literally have no work experience, but you also know the services you want to sell i.e. you can write blogs that display your writing skills.So what can happen if you’re bad at any of the ones I mentioned? If you’re bad at marketing yourself = no workIf you market yourself as a noob = low rates/no workIf you don’t know your rate = you’ll often find yourself working for peanutsIf you don’t choose your clients carefully = possibly poor experience and in the case of platform freelancers, poor public feedbackIf you don’t have a blog = If you’re good, it won’t make much of a difference. If you’re bad, you’ll stay bad.What I stated obviously works for both private and platform freelancers, and specially for platform freelancers since sites like Upwork display public feedback, rate, and previous work experience. If you’re a noob at marketing yourself, choosing your rates, or just going for any client you come across, it will show on your profile and could potentially ruin your freelancing career forever.",2021-03-05T10:12:21.113Z,"What are some of the qualities that every free lancer should possess?

I asked him to explain to me the basis for his opinion. After some investigation, I discovered that the initial implementation had a flaw that could be easily corrected. By simply changing a primary key in the database (to the one that actually made more sense from a system and business perspective), it would be possible to implement the feature the business requested. The developer wasn’t exactly convinced by my arguments, but I scheduled a meeting with him and the head of development (a manager with an excellent technical background), and the manager immediately saw that my analysis was correct. The feature ended up being implemented without the major code overhaul proposed by the developer. Situations like the one described are not uncommon when business analysts with a technical background work together with business subject matter experts and the IT team to find the optimal solution for a business problem. A business- and technology-savvy analyst can be instrumental in helping determine the business need and define the optimal solution to meet this need. The biggest obstacle for IT professionals interested in developing a BA career is the lack of well-developed business skills. Those can be thought through online courses like the one Jolt has to offer. One might argue that “soft skills” (the ability to communicate with clarity, precision, and eloquence, work well with other people building effective contacts and relationships across and outside the organization, and so on) are more important for a BA than being business-savvy. However, in my experience, software engineers who are passionate about business analysis already value and develop their transferable soft skills, so it’s typically not the main competence gap they face when they try to switch to a BA position.

I’ve run my own contracting company (basically just me, for hire) since the early 00’s (I have a man-cave/office at home full of equipment) and I absolutely love it; I work whatever hours suit me (still a lot of hours, but on my own schedule), typical gigs last between say 3 months and a year or so, I tend to pick things I’m either especially interested in expanding my knowledge of OR where I’ve acquired a bunch of practical experience on previous gigs and I can deliver results quickly (current fad is BLE - plenty of work around for that). I usually have one or two personal projects (still geekin’) on the go which are always things I’ve picked because it’s something that I want to learn (e.g. I’m getting back into FPGAs right now having not done anything on them since the mid 90’s) I know this isn’t exactly what you asked but Silicon Valley HUGELY values passion for learning and breadth of experience. As it happens I don’t even have a college degree (my excuse is that I got a job programming when I was 16, never looked back) but I do have a lifelong career being fascinated by tech - and this enthusiasm is something employers really respond well to. I put my personal projects on my LinkedIn page, for example; it shows I do this stuff for fun not just for money. Demonstrate to people you love what you do (by your actions, not your words) - when I’ve interviewed people I always ask them about their hobbies and personal projects; I want to see a passion and drive for self-motivated learning.",2021-03-05T10:13:14.746Z,"What level of engineering is required at Silicon Valley?

To give you some background,I was a regular Joe in a regular IT job from 2006 till 2009. I managed to complete an MBA from UK (2009–10) and was working there in large banks as a Business Analyst till April 2017. I and my wife were both contractors, and were making decent money, which was enough for us to buy a 4.5 BHK apartment in Pune without any loans, afford a Range Rover Evoque in UK, and live in Zone 3, London, on rent (paying a rent of £1600 per month). In short, we were living a very decent life financially, with good set of friends close by (in London and Birmingham) and had very little motivation to go back, except for my Mom, who was living in India (but my Sister and 2 nephews were living with her) . I had a friend in India who was into Construction (was a Builder) and his family has a sound background in Construction. He wanted to venture into a separate entity with me as a Working Partner (- someone who does not invest money, but works in the capacity of a partner/Director) back in 2015. I took a year to confirm, evaluating my options, contemplating whether I should venture into Real Estate and all the other factors (which I will describe below in a short while). Late in 2015, it started appearing to me as a Golden Opportunity. I was very clear since the beginning of my UK stint that I will be returning back to India. It was only a question of when, and not why, for me. This opportunity seemed like the perfect answer. So, I and my friend signed a partnership deed in April 2016 and floated our LLP. We began working on a Project in Pune and everything seemed hunky-dory. I had started wrapping up in UK and did not apply for renewal of my visa. I left UK in April 2017, on expiry of my Tier 1 visa, for the homeland. First Day I landed in India amidst the chaos of demonetization. We had more than ₹ 50,000 in 500 and 1000 denominations, but my sister who is an ex-IAS officer had “spoken” with her former colleagues at CSIA in Mumbai, where I was landing. So we got a some nice treatment from Custom Officers and our cash was cleared along with a certificate, so we can deposit it in RBI. Also, a lot of our stuff from UK had arrived in the Air Cargo terminal, and I had to go get it cleared from Customs. My ex-IAS sister had her “contacts” there too. What happened next was my “Welcome to India”. You cannot get your stuff cleared from Air cargo unless you have a “Customs Agent” certified by government to help you with documentation. You have agents for those certified agents at the gate and you can be charged anywhere from ₹2000 to 8000. Agent’s agent charged me upfront, and only inside the terminal, I get to meet my certified agent. It was 12pm by then and he very encouragingly said “Even if god decides to come down and get your stuff, he will not get it today”. I will not get much into the details, but I spent 7 hours in that terminal, running from pillar to post, talking to officers my sister had spoken with, banging my head with the agent, and somehow managed to get all my stuff by 7pm. I was hoping that the rest of my days are not like this, and God please help me like it here. None of that happened. Remaining 1 and 1/2 years in India My flat in Pune, which I mentioned above, which I had bought in 2014, was nowhere near completion, and was almost in the same state as it was in 2016, when I last visited Pune to sign the partnership. The builder had promised me that it will be ready by April 2017, had planned my return according to his promised dates, and was hoping to save on rent and enjoy my abode of my sweat and blood. But, I was not homeless.I decided to give myself and my family a break, before we join thick of things and so, went back to my home city (now in Jharkhand) for about a month. Power cuts, extreme heat, mosquitoes, drinking water shortages, no roads, scary roads, scary traffic on roads… made my and especially my 2 year old daughter’s stay amazing. My daughter was initially quite fascinated to see cows, dogs, cats, insects, ants, mosquitoes…so many other forms of life, roaming so freely. But we had to suffer a lot because of her fascination. She had hand-foot-mouth disease, some sort of viral fever, some sort of insect bite and a few more diseases. I ended up having 2 accidents in the 2 different cars we had bought on our return, and was roughed up by people who had hit my car because of their faults. But, I felt very secure and healthy in India.Went back to Pune, to join the business which was suffering a lot, thanks to the recent developments of demonetization, RERA and GST. My partner was striving to keep the business afloat, but we could see the future quite clearly for small-time builders. But, India was the promised land.The place we ultimately lived in Pune was a much smaller rented accommodation, which I had not factored in any of plans/scenarios. You don’t have inverters? You must be the kinds who enjoy stargazing. Storing water during supply hours is not that important. You can buy the 20 liter bottles which have water collected straight from gaumukh in Gangotri. All this while the builder for my flat kept promising that I will get it in June 2017, then Diwali 2017, then December 2017. Well, he was not wrong, I got the possession of the flat 1 day before I left India again on 23rd September 2018. But my crores of rupees, were well spent.When in September 2017, after delivering a small project of 47 flats, and making no profits at all, we decided to shut shop, I had already started looking out for other ventures and decided to enter the Food and Beverage (F&B) industry. Restaurants were apparently booming in Pune. After spending 3months of efforts, zeroing in on location, hiring - Restaurant Consultants, Legal consultants, Property Consultants, Interior Designer, Carpenter, Menu Engineers, Cocktail experts, Facility Management Services; I found out that it is impossible to have a 100% legal restaurant in India. I will have to pay bribes to get incomplete papers to start the business, and then keep paying bribes as and when asked for. I will have to spend around 18 hours a day in the restaurant, if I want to run it for Lunch and Dinner, because of the prevalent theft amongst the staff who leave their jobs at the drop of the hat. I would also have to invest all my life’s savings in the business and wait around a year to break even, and so eventually decided, not to go ahead with it. But, I was very optimistic about the future.All this while, i.e. for more than 6 months, my wife who was an Engineer and MBA (from Symbiosis) and was in UK with me for 6 years, working as a Business Analyst, was not getting Business Analyst jobs in India. Forget about leveraging international experience and getting better positions, she was being tested on Technical skills, which a BA doesn’t actually need. We had hoped her job and salary would help keep the monthly expenses managed, while I figure out all the other options we had considered for our return to India. She was getting frustrated and into self doubt - she wondered if she had done anything worthy in her career so far. Eventually she did land a job, with CitiBank, in January 2018. But, India is not the back office of the world.I realized, I would not be good at business, so I too should get back to the corporate world, and I too get a similar cold shoulder, like my wife. I had a cherry on the top of not being in the industry for around 8 months now. Ended up working with a startup, only because it had its customers based in North America. But, I was not disheartened.Work culture in India is a million miles away from west. Don’t expect people to show up before 11:15, if you scheduled an 11:00 am meeting and it does not involve the customers or the senior management. Daily standups at 9:30 am? What’s that? The only persons visible in office that time of the day are you and the janitor. Both look at each other- mesmerized. Thinking about maintaining a work-life balance? There will probably a time when that will be possible. If you reach office at 9am and leave at 5:30pm, you’ll be looked at quizzically, and the best part is the frowners will be your reportees. The lunch break is 1 hour, tea break 1 is 45 minutes, tea break 2 is 15 minutes, tea break 3 is 15 minutes. People leaving office before 7:30pm are not adding any value. There will be - pleasantries discussed about you behind your back; amazing and quintessential feedback to the Managers above you in the hierarchy; jokes with no sexual connotations; no boot licking; amazing professionalism; amazing etiquette; brilliant ethics and superb delivery of work. Take your people out for a dinner, tell them its on the organization and then look at the way orders are made. Its amazing. But, India is the place to work.Social life is amazing too. I had around 7 friends from my engineering college, 5 from my School and a few other close friends from my initial days of Corporate life , prior to leaving for UK. I had imagined a party every fortnight, if not every weekend. I would watch their back, and they would mine. We would be the support system of each other, like I had in UK. I guess the city life, corporate responsibilities and having a family changes all that. The friend who lived a stone’s throw away would find time to meet once in 6 months, others were a little far off, and therefore a little more difficult for them to visit or invite us. I guess, a gap of 8 years not living in their vicinity, had created some gaps as well. But, India is full of people, you will never be alone.Parents - My mom and my in-laws were a little far off from Pune. I wanted my Mom to live with us in Pune, but she adored her home way too much. I wanted our in-laws to frequent, but their business was thriving and was difficult for them to leave it alone (genuinely). We were back to doing what we did in UK - facetime/skype/whatsapp calls. But, I had traveled all this way to be with them virtually.Relatives - were always there for your support. Need an unsolicited advice? Wham!… Buying a car of your choice? Kazaam! how dare you?… Not getting your daughter’s head shaved? Immoral westernized moron! Have vacation plans? We are visiting you!…But, You get the best support from your relatives.Education is relatively inexpensive in (GBP or USD terms), as well as very comforting when you hear about the quality. It will only cost you around ₹ 1,65,000 per annum for a toddler’s playgroup, and somewhere around ₹ 3,00,000 for Kindergarten in an IB school of your choice. You can rest assured after that that your child is getting the best education in the world. But, Indian students are still the best in the world.I will not even get into the various forms of pollution as it is well documented elsewhere, and also because they were the least of my concerns.I am now in Canada, for the past 45 days. Got a PR, and now settling down here. Unfortunately, I could not go back to UK, as I had not planned for a contingency. That’s how brilliant I am! But, I am loving every bit of Canada. Both (I and my wife) have got decent jobs within a month of landing, with decent salaries (although not so decent as in UK). So, my ultimate advice would be, if you have that desire to go back to India, please do so, only after creating a backup plan for your return. Be very sure why you are going there, and if that target is missed, prepare for contingency. A natural progression is from good to better to best. And not the other way around. Hope this helps you or others who read this. Edit 1: Overwhelming response (130k views, 3k upvotes in less than a week) to what I thought would be a diminutive answer in this space, along with numerous encouraging judgements passed on me like “Loser”, “Sick Mentality”, “Spewing Venom” and the best of all “Anti-National” (not ignoring the actual love and support showered), has prompted me to provide some further clarifications: I am not anti-national and definitely more patriotic than all the keyboard warriors here. I never had any intention to defame my country, and I never will. It was probably my way of expressing my experiences (humor getting replaced by sarcasm ) OR probably the supreme capabilities of those readers who could read what I had not written. However, I will not be ashamed in calling a spade a spade. These were my experiences, and, in no manner, a generalization implied to entire India.I still support the families of all the staff (by paying salaries) I had hired, till they find another job (almost a year after we shut down). I, along with some other volunteers, ran a few road safety campaigns, standing on the roads of Pune trying to make people aware of the hazards, and getting more blessings in return, relentlessly for a few weeks. There was no use, still I tried my best. Witnessed some horrible accidents, got the victims to hospitals, managed the traffic jams thereafter, begged people to wear helmets, begged students and bike riders to not look into their phones while riding and care about theirs , as well as, other’s lives - not one person listened or paid heed. May be my attempt was not good enough, but I did try to make things right. These are just a couple of examples, and in no way seeking gratification. I hate giving justifications or claiming achievements, but I want to let this be known that I did not just “run away”.In the answer I have tried to limit my experiences to external factors which were, more or less, beyond my control. Things I could change or act upon have not been mentioned at all. If I mention them, the answer will turn into a 500 page book. So, a sincere request, please do not become mi lords and try passing judgements on my efforts, capabilities or ingenuity. I have ventured on this forum for helping others, and will keep doing so. Everyone’s still welcome to ask relevant questions, and I will try my best to help.I am obliged to all the warm wishes, love and support . Hopefully, whatever little knowledge I have about this world, I will keep sharing…thanks to you all.Edit 2 : I am overwhelmed by the response this answer is getting, even 2 weeks after it was originally posted (thanks to 3.8k Upvotes). To answer some of the comments I am getting, I recommend reading a couple of my other answers: Deepak Kumar's answer to What are your life struggles which leads you to success?Deepak Kumar's answer to Has anyone regretted moving to Canada by express entry?

Let’s push this question a little bit in the world of spoken languages. You can start to learn a new spoken language. And of course you will be able to have a conversation after some time. Then you successfully learned a new language because you are able to communicate. But it is unlikely that you will become a fluent speaker, that you know all the phrases and idioms. There are also phrases and idioms in programming languages, too. They were called “design pattern” and “idioms”. Two examples: If you say “It’s raining cats and dogs” in German it would literally mean there are falling pets from the sky. “Englisch für Fortgeschrittene” can be translated to “English for runaways” (fort -> away, schreiten -> run). But the meaning of “Fortgeschrittene” is rather people who have already done a part of the way, having intermediate skills. So you would translated it as “English for advanced speakers”. It’s unlikely that you become good enough to write literature. To understand and feel the small semantic differences in words. In C++ you can have dozends of semantic different meanings of the idea “pointer”. You will need time to evaluate all of them. Or you can learn Java - there is just a reference and no way to differentiate. It’s unlikely that you will write poems in your new language. To do so, you need an expert on your side which helps you to go this way much faster than if you would have started earlier. It’s not impossible. But be prepared of years of hard work. And it would be good to have close contact to someone who support you. You definitely have to accept a lot of frustration before you succeed. That’s part of the game. And failing is the daily experience of a young person. Learning to walk means to fall a thousand times. At the age of 35 you are not used to fail on a regular basis. You will get frustrated and you have to accept that in order to succeed. Learning how to program is not learning the way to do it right. It’s experience of not doing it wrong. So you have to learn to understand failing and fixing it as your daily business. And you will fail over and over again in order to find a suitable way. And at some point you know most of the pitfalls and avoid them before you fail. But therefore you have to fall in every single pitfall several times and accept this as part of your way instead of being frustrated that you still fail all the time after 2, 5 or 25 years. Just the pitfalls changes. :-)So at the end learning to program is not just thinking as a computer, it’s also having a toolbox with tools that help you out of pitfalls and to find out why there is a pitfall and how to avoid it the next time. The salary of a good developer is paid because it’s harder to learn to program than to use a register at the supermarket. So it’s unlikely but possible.

This may mean setting alarms for yourself, setting up a reward system (i.e. No going out on Friday unless X gets done!), and asking friends or family to partner with you by holding you accountable. If you are more likely to succeed in a classroom environment, look into PMP preparation courses and boot camps. PMP prep courses aren’t free, but what you get in return for taking them is worth the extra cost. PMTI’s four-day boot camp will not only provide you with all of the training and materials you need to prepare, but will also earn you 45 PDU’s, which is required for recertification for three more years. Tip #2: Join PMI and Schedule Your 9A0-412 Exam Before applying for membership with PMI and setting a date for your 9A0-412 exam, you’ll want to make sure you’ve met all the requirements. In order to be eligible for PMP certification, you need either: A four-year degree with three years of project management experience, 4,500 hours of experience leading and directing projects, and 35 hours of project management education.OR A secondary degree, five years of project management experience, 7,500 hours of experience leading and directing projects, and 35 hours of project management education.If you meet the requirements and are ready to pursue your PMP certification, you can register for the 9A0-412 exam and get it on the calendar. Joining PMI is part of the deal. It’s a way to gain access to the PMBOK Guide®, which you’ll need in order to study, and it’s how you are able to sign up for the 9A0-412 exam. The membership fee for joining is $129 for individuals (plus a $10 application fee) and $32 for full-time students. After you’ve joined, the renewal cost is $129, with no additional application fee, and remains at $32 for students. Retired members can renew their membership at a discounted rate of $65. How long should you allow yourself to study for the 9A0-412 exam? This will depend on your situation in life. For the average person looking to take the PMP9A0-412 exam, there are factors such as current career and family/social life to consider. Thus, three to four months is a reasonable amount of time to allow, assuming your studies will be added into the margins of your life (i.e. nights and weekends). Three to four months allows 1-1 ½ weeks per knowledge area in the PMBOK® Guide. If you are planning to take a class, which may significantly reduce the length of time you need to devote to studying, you can sign up for the 9A0-412 exam once you’ve finished the course and feel confident you’re prepared to take it.  Tip #3: Make a Plan and Stick to It If you plan to study for the 9A0-412 exam on your own, once you’ve got that 9A0-412 9A0-412 exam date on the calendar, it’s time to make a study plan. It’s important to be realistic, and not expect more of yourself than is reasonable. Look at your regular weekly schedule. When do you have free time? What are some things you’ll need to give up while preparing for the 9A0-412 exam (i.e. hobbies or leisure time)? Could you give up your lunch hour and study while you eat at your desk? On the other hand, there may be some important things you aren’t willing to give up. If you already work full time and have a family, you automatically need to work around these things. Make changes in your schedule where it’s needed. A typical plan will probably include 1-2 hours every day during the week, and a lengthier study period (4-6 hours) on the weekends. If you’re a morning person, get up early and study in the mornings before work. More of a night owl? Sit down after dinner and get your study time in. Either way, make a plan that makes sense for you and then most importantly, STICK TO IT! Tip #4: Understand the 9A0-412 Exam The PMP 9A0-412 exam consists of 200 multiple choice questions. 175 of these count toward your score, while 25 are pre-test questions and won’t count toward your final score. These are randomly placed throughout the 9A0-412 exam for research purposes. The questions are randomly ordered and do not follow the order of materials in the PMBOK® Guide. You’ll have four hours to complete the 9A0-412 exam. No breaks are provided, so you must manage your time wisely. A small part of the 9A0-412 exam will include knowing PMP vocabulary terms, so it will be crucial to make sure you know and understand these terms in order to pass the 9A0-412 exam. A glossary of these terms can be found in the PMBOK® Guide. Part of your studying should include making sure you have familiarity with all of these terms.  Tip #5: Use Supplementary Materials The PMBOK® Guide is going to be your primary source for everything you need to know for the 9A0-412 exam. However, there are other books and guides out there that can be very useful in helping you prepare for the 9A0-412 exam. The best way to get access to excellent supplementary materials is to take an online or in-person class. You’ll get the benefit of instruction, as well as study guides and aides that will enable you to prepare for the 9A0-412 exam. For those who want take a shorter, more intense approach, this four-day boot camp (available either in person or online) provides expert training, the 9A0-412 exam edition of the PMBOK® Guide, and a PMP Certification prep guide. It also includes over 1000 practice questions (more on the importance of mock 9A0-412 exams below!). For those pursuing self-study, this online course offers all of the extra instruction and help you need to study at your own pace. This is ideal for those looking to fit study time and preparation into the margins of their lives. Tip #6: Take Notes As you study each section of the guides and books, take plenty of notes. This helps in several ways. First, it ensures that you are focusing on the material in front of you, and prevents you from skimming and skipping over important materials.Second, it can actually help to get that information into your brain. For many, the act of writing information down will increase the likelihood that it is retained in the memory.Third, you can later use those notes to study.

I have seen people consuming pills, in order to cope up with depression. Most of the young professionals develop a habit of smoking and drinking in order to deal with stress. IT jobs demand tremendous efforts and stretched working hours. Sometimes weekend-working as well :(  Thus more and more people quit their job after the bond period is over and change their field. Mostly, the people with creative mindset find these jobs boring and stressful. You know the job isn’t for you, if you are only enjoying the weekends and you are dead from inside on the weekdays.  I have listed down a few important reasons due to which people quit IT jobs- Stress- As already explained, 75% of the IT professionals experience stress at work.Switching to a better job- Most of the people don’t really quit their jobs but switch to higher paying jobs. Most of the times, freshers are hired on contract basis. They have to sign a bond for a period of 1 or 2 years else they have to pay some amount to the company. Thus when the contract period is over they switch to a higher paying company. Learning something new- Some people like to explore new options for their career such as analytics or business. thus they end up quitting their current technical jobs and go for programs such as MBA etc. This also increases their chances of getting a higher pay.Entrepreneurship- Self starters are always motivated to start something new on their own. Once they get a good amount of experience in this field they go one to start their own company.Passion- Day by day, passion is gaining a lot of importance in India. People often quit their boring 9 to 5 in order to follow their passion.Every coin has two sides, even though a platitude, it’s worth repeating. There are also some positive sides of IT field which I will explain in short: Learning- You get to learn something new, everyday.Job availability- Compared to other engineering branches, IT stands tall in terms of job availability. You will often see other branch professionals switching to IT field.Growth- Well this depends on person to person, but if you are willing to work hard, growth is definite in IT filed.Quick learning- Once you are thorough with any specific programming language, you can easily learn rest of the languages.Target based work- Most of the IT jobs are target based. If you achieve you target early you can leave early for the day.Due to the recent pandemic, work from home culture is growing, due to which, commutation time is eliminated. Employees are working nine plus hours. Weekend-working is also a bad effect of availability. Employees are not having a proper work-life balance. Spending more and more time in front of screen is also affecting their physical and mental health. There are a lot of factors that decide whether to hold on to or quit the job. If it’s affecting your health, it’s definitely not worth it. But also, don’t fall under peer pressure and quit anything if you truly love doing it. Nothing is totally good or bad, it’s totally your perspective.",2021-03-05T10:17:42.085Z,"Why do a lot of IT software engineers quit their jobs after 2 years? ",Quora

Some have been successful following different paths. One thing they have in common is they’re all pessimists. The other thing they all have in common is they’re all optimists. I understand this might be confusing. How can two opposite viewpoints exist in the same individual simultaneously? But the equation makes complete sense when you consider time as a variable: they’ve made themselves short-term pessimists and long-term optimists. What I mean is this: they expect each and every discrete writing project they take to fail because the reality is, most things never get completed or published. They are acknowledging reality, and have zero emotional response when a fiction plot gloriously fizzles to nothing, a poem concept just doesn’t work out, or their personal essay fails to ever get published. Yet they are long-term optimists because they know if they work on enough writing projects, several of them will succeed, making up for all the ones that failed. And yes, that is also reality. The eternal optimist who thinks everything they write will “work out” is soon ground down by reality. Their beliefs don’t match up with the results, they start to question themselves, and constant disappointment hinders their ability to shake it off and move onto the next project. They become snakebit, and eventually bitter – which is never a positive trait for a creative. The constant pessimist never takes any action on their writing endeavors because they automatically expect everything they do to fail. And because they never really act, they do fail. They stay loitering on the sidelines moping, never actually getting in the game. In writing, mindset is very important. But it must be a reality-based mindset, with hard-nosed expectations, not pie in the sky fantasies or self-sabotaging discontent. The more you do, the more you fail, yet paradoxically the more you succeed. The pessimistic optimist writer is armored against constant failure and rejection, and it bothers them not. But they also expect success to occasionally interrupt failure, which is why they write and compete in the first place. Be a pessimistic optimist writer, and you will be a success in a world full of losers who love losing. Over the years, I’ve been blessed to meet a lot writers, in person and online.

If that works for you, read on. If it doesn't, skip to the next answer. So what can you do to be smarter starting this weekend? ONE. Identify a goal to aspire to.

Here are a few ideas, but there's a catch: you can use your weekend to start doing things in a smarter way, but you cannot expect that by Sunday night you're off the hook. What you will actually be doing is starting a few new habits, but you will need to keep developing them the following week, the week after that, the next month, and so on. If that works for you, read on. If it doesn't, skip to the next answer. So what can you do to be smarter starting this weekend? ONE. Identify a goal to aspire to. Start by asking yourself these questions: Where do you want to be in 6 months, 1 year, 5 years from now?Who do you want to become?What is a dream scenario for you: a life in a specific city, having a career in an industry that motivates you, being surrounded by smart and interesting people who contribute to your personal growth, becoming an expert in a field that requires a lot of your dedication and time?Next, get specific. Set aside several hours to do the following: Write down your top 3 goals (can be your personal, professional development, or both)Under each goal, write down 3 things you would need to do on a consistent basis to get you closer to each goal.Then, create a schedule for the week ahead so that you can devote blocks of time to making progress in the areas you've identified.At the end of next week, make an assessment of the progress you made. Did some activities take more time than you anticipated? Did you need to plan better so as not to waste time on things that are less relevant to your goals (outside of work/school)? What could you have done better? Then make adjustments to your schedule for the following week.TWO.  Stay away from TV and social media. Why? Because TV can take up your entire weekend without you even noticing. Take this opportunity to do something different. Try to be proactive (actually seek something out that will boost your imagination, or help you learn something new you can apply to your daily life), as opposed to reactive (watching whatever cable TV has on the weekend schedule). The same goes for social media: going through your Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter updates could take hours, and before you know it, the weekend is over and you haven't made a move in the positive direction you seek.  THREE. Feed your brain. Now that you've sworn off TV for a few days, you have some extra time. What to do with it? Use it to learn something new, expose your brain to different ideas and perspectives, maybe even others' point of view. You never know when you might find an idea or two you can implement into your daily life. Use this weekend to learn, be curious, wonder, question, pause, think. A. Listen to podcasts Achieve Your Goals with Hal Elrod (creator of The Miracle Morning, provides ideas to cultivate a morning routine and be productive early in the day)Intelligence Squared (forum for debate and intelligent discussion on  a variety of topics ranging from world politics to art to economics)Optimize with Brian Johnson (condensed big ideas from the best books on optimal living and also micro classes on how to apply these ideas)Happier With Gretchen Rubin (a fun show led by bestselling author of ""The Happiness Project"" with small ideas you can apply to your life to exercise your happiness muscle)Ask Altucher (Q&A sessions with entrepreneur/investor/writer, where he responds to questions from listeners on a variety of topics)Planet Money ( stories about smart people, economics, politics)Radiolab (show about curiosity, interesting ideas, science, philosophy)The Inquiry (a debate on a controversial topic in the news and 4 experts challenging each other with 2 views, for and against the topic)Question of the Day (a show for people short on time and long on curiosity, with a lot of good humor in trying to answer the question at hand)B. Read books (fiction and non-fiction) Why? It's the equivalent of living multiple lives; reading can stimulate your imagination, utilize your critical thinking skills, and ultimately, it will give you food for thought. Fiction: Dive deep into the lives of others and get lost in private lives of fictional characters, find out what makes them tick, ask yourself what would you do in their place.Non-fiction: Learn from the experiences of others in their quest to live a happier life, become healthy, start a business, excel at a skill, overcome an obstacle, live a life with more meaning and a sense of purpose.FOUR. Treat yourself. So now that you've revamped your weekend to start some new habits, you should give yourself a reward to mark the occasion. What you choose to reward yourself with will depend on your personal interests, affinities, your passions, as well as your personality. Do you enjoy spending time with friends? Get everyone together for an evening out to watch a movie together, attend a concert, catch up over coffee or dinner at your favorite restaurant, or invite them over to your place for a few hours of laughter, good conversation, and fun.Would you prefer to spend some time alone or with your family or partner? Schedule a night in, order takeout, have fun talking and eating together; or, spend an hour or two in an activity that makes you feel really good, like playing guitar, chess, painting, writing, or any project that really gets your mind engaged.Whatever you choose, it should feel like a celebration of small wins. For every hour of your weekend that you dedicated to your personal development, reward yourself so you feel like you've accomplished something worthwhile: investing in your own future.

They are quite different and require a mind set that is independent from the technical skills you receive after graduation. For instance, if you hate being at a desk for 8 hours a day, a site role can give you more variety of work and more interaction with people but you need to be willing to go where the work site is. This may involve commuting or a relocation. This can be quite exciting for a young engineer but at the same time can become a trap when you are older and would like to settle with your family. Switching between a site to an office based role can be quite hard and difficult as you advance in your career. After about 8 years, I tried to work for a contractor and I didn’t have much success. When I got a chance to be interviewed, the feedback was negative because they were looking for someone with site experience. Unfortunately, this is the case in almost all career switches when you are no longer at a junior level. Unless you really have transferable skills, the switch is very hard to make. Whatever the path you follow, at the start of your career you will work on simple tasks and won’t be managing projects or people. As the time goes by and you gain more experience and projects under your belt, your role will cover the full spectrum of activities that are expected from an engineer. As I said at the start of this article, you better choose the career path you want to take or switch career path as early as possible. I spent nearly a year working in a job I didn’t like. It wasn’t the job I dreamed of when I decided to become an engineer. Wrong choices can be painful and difficult to recover.

You won't realize how easily a human brain can kill you. 1. Sleep as much as you want to recover from your weekly tortures (managers, traveling etc). You should never have this regret when the week starts that you didn't sleep well, unless you travelled. :) 2. Get your weekly liabilities (laundry, grocery, shopping etc) done ASAP. They are your necessary evil. If you are not a party person, do you it on Friday nights, else Saturday mornings are better. Get rid of them earliest as they may keep bugging you. 3. Look for the things which may excite you or things which you always wanted to do when you were a kid. Dancing, painting, baking, swimming etc. They are very good healers and build confidence. I realized it much later in life. :( 4. Try going to atleast one social gathering every weekend. It can be a bar, club, meetup, church/temple, library meetings etc. You will realize that world is a beautiful place. Your every outing may not be the best but then you don't hit a home run on every ball as well.Also, a year from now you may not remember the dates but you can relate what special you did around that weekend. :) 5. Never say NO to any social gatherings. You may not feel like going initially but just get ready and GO. I know sometimes you will meet jerks but   it will be an experience, take that. :) 6. Join a social group, (e.g: meetup.com) if they are in your area. 7. Try doing some social work. It will increase your patience level & bring gratitude in your life. I am yet to do it but will start this month, atleast registration is done. 8. Avoid drugs, being alone you may get prone to it. 9. Go for a hiking, trail walking trips if you are fit and capable to do that. DON'T do that when it snows. :D 10. If young and single, try dating but please don't consider every social meetings as dating spot. You will only feel disconnected and will goof up on both. 11. Avoid social networking sites. They also need their weekend releases. I am sorry for breaking this rule. :( 12. Call a good old friend of yours to whom you haven't talked for ages. 13. Even if you are still unable to meet people just go out for lunch, dinner, concerts etc. Initially, you may feel like you are a loner in that place but honestly couples and groups are too busy in their own. They really won't think about you unless you are drop dead gorgeous or you create a real drama out there. I know you won't. :) 14.

After two days your brain switches to the best possible source of energy for it: ketones. Your body can exist for extremely long times without food, vitamins, supplements and all other crap that marketing has placed in our heads. Plato and Socrates fasted for 7-10 days to gain physical and mental efficiency. Pythagoras fasted 40 days before his examination at Alexandria and required his students to fast before entering his classes. During the Vietnam and WW2 wars, prisoners tell us stories of how sharp their mind was in the absence of food. Some could even read entire books from their memories. For more information, read this book: “Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption” In this book, the main character describes a prisoner who would read entire books from memory and another who learned the Norwegian language in a few weeks. Incredibly, these feats were so commonplace that prisoners simply accepted it as a fact of life that starvation increases cognitive ability.  Hunters state When we are getting into the starvation mode, our body switches into the ""hunters state."" during this process our hormone levels rise, and after a while, our mental abilities rise, our strength, endurance, and willpower go thru the roof. Our mind becomes crystal clear. Our body switches to the internal resources and begins to consume fats stored everywhere. Muscles saved as the last resort of energy. When I go through 48 hrs of fasting, I feel the magnitude of power growing inside of me. At this state (done in the way I do it - continue reading) I feel like I can run forever and there is nothing in the world that can stop me. In mammals, mental activity increases during hunger and decreases with satiation (eating too much). We have all experienced this as a “food coma.” Think about that large Thanksgiving turkey. After one big meal are we mentally sharp? Or dull as a brick? How about the opposite? Think about the time when you were very hungry. Were you tired and sluggish? No - your senses were on hyper-alert, and you were mentally sharp as a needle. The idea that food makes you concentrate better is entirely wrong. Mental sharpness increases during fasting done in the right way. My diet and schedule I skip breakfast and lunch almost every day. I usually begin feeding my body after 6 pm, and I eat a lot. I keep my fat intake high, plain carbs next to zero. Drinking tea, a bit of coffee, and plain water throughout the day. My diet: beans, cabbage, eggs from free-range chickens and zero antibiotics, all sorts of greens except carrots and other carb bearing ones. No fruits, no sugar, no sweetness, no dairy (kefir is one exception), once in a while red/white meat only from humanely raised animals, and beef liver from grass-fed cows once in a while to bring in B12. I'm staying away from the fluoride in my water and toothpaste. I've been following this regimen for the last six months, and I feel better than ever before. A clear head and a ton of energy. But I also train every day - mostly 30 min of HIIT in the morning. I'm not always following this schedule and once in a while, I eat stuff no one should ever eat. Same goes for the timing - if I'm starving and my body can't function anymore, then I feed it - it doesn't matter when. To jump-start and speed up the entire process, I recommend beginning with 36–48 hours of fasting and then continue in with intermittent fasting. You will feel amazingly light and sharp after about 34 hours. The feeling best described as you finally awoken after one long lifetime coma. Regimen formula: starting every Monday 36 to 48hrs of zero good, then continue with intermittent fasting till next Monday. Eat a lot during the feeding window of 3–4hrs daily - as much as you feel like. If it’s too hard to fast, do KETO If you have difficulty fasting, then you may have to switch to the Keto diet first. The reason it’s hard for you to fast is because you were relying on carbs most of your lifetime. Carbs create insulin disturbance in your body, this causes withdrawal and carb cravings. When you switch to the Keto - you will train your body to consume fats and rely on it as a primary source of energy. Then, when you are going into the fast, you will have no more craving, but a steady, unending amount of energy. Your physical shape Keep in mind - if you follow the regimen above, you will get very lean, very fast. If you also would like to look strong, then you will have to train every day or every other day. I exercise intensely for around 30–40 min every morning, and now, after three months, I look like a ripped bodybuilder. Your body uses fat for energy and muscles saved as a last resort. In this “Hungry Hunter” state you've got your body pumped up with natural HGH, and HGH is what elite bodybuilders and life extension clinics use. Shots of HGH cost them thousands of dollars each month, and you are getting it for free. If you combine this state with some physical training, then expect amazing results in an extremely short time. My usual training I wake up at 6–7, have a plain espresso and then train for 30–40 min - high-intensity workouts (HIT), not following any routines, doing only what my body feels like. Heavyweights, lightweights - whatever, as long as I'm covered in sweat. I also practice breath-work to alkalize and clean out my system of toxins and swim in the ice-cold water during winters 2–3 times weekly. Your mental state Your body will begin feeling good and this will create an environment for the improvement of your mental state. At this time you need to start structuring your future. Start building possible positive future scenarios and workable plans. To do that you will need to: Stop consuming information and start creating! Reading/watching grows your database of knowledge and our world doesn't need more databases. Anyone now has access to any information in a matter of seconds. Utilizing whatever experience you have so far to create something new - that’s what builds your smarts. I’ve seen plenty of examples of how street-smart people easily outperform highly educated ones. Education/knowledge is nothing if you don’t know how to use it, so this comes first. Ability to understand or predict what information you need, locate it and utilize it - that's where real intelligence is hiding! Now, if you would like to share your findings, ideas, and thoughts, please tell all of us about it below, and if it's something useful, I'll include it in the article.  Selected comments: Brandon Thomas: Longer periods of fasting increase BDNF, which is a protein that aids the growth of new neurons. Ernesto Sitoe: I totally agree. I have been fasting these days and the mind seems to work better than ever. Thanks for sharing and can say it works. Jerami Dugan: My old boss would fast for 5–7 days at a time. I thought he was CRAZY but he always had more energy than me. He swore he got his energy from the sun. I laughed but I watched him work circles around me, at 35 years older. I have yet to really try fasting for more than one day. I’m back on a plant based diet, and that alone has made huge improvements in my daily life. I was not fat to begin with but I feel much leaner already after only 2 weeks. Thanks for the read. I’m about to begin my first 2 day fast. Emmer Tagum: I used to eat 3x a day believing that my body needs a constant supply of food for energy through the day and burn it all completely on my 7pm workout. I can feel that my body was not giving its all energy. I feel sluggish and disappointed. Then one day, I decided to only have lunch, and boy oh boy, my 7pm workout never felt the same. I was sweating like an exposed ice cube on Sahara desert and my sight turns HD for like 30min (can anybody confirm/explain this phenomena?) I felt like I can go on lifting for hours at max weight. The feeling is indescribable! And then comes the best reward; An 8-hr deep slumber. Gloria Cole: Reverses diabetes Type 2 also. User-9938412290735714538: It seems to me that eating in the morning would be better so the food can digest better and give energy through the day. At night our bodies want to slow and relax and eating then would make for some indigestion and possibly sleep problems. Jone Silva: Fasting (sawm in Arabic), is one of the five key pillars underpinning the Islamic faith. The others are prayer (salat), giving a percentage of your salary to charity (zakat), making the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and, of course, a belief in the Muslim faith (shahadah). Fasting is seen as a way to purify spiritually as well as physically - a time to detach from material pleasures and be closer to God. The act of fasting is also believed to increase Muslims' piety, reminding them that others are less fortunate than themselves. Fasting involves abstaining from all food, drink, smoking and having sex from sunrise to sunset. Muslims will wake up before sunrise for morning prayer and to eat before the day's fast begins. Most will break their fast alongside their families in the evening with a communal “Iftar” meal, typically often started with dates. Jesus Busby: I looked into intermittent fasting a while ago and havent looked back, its fantastic! The max Iv gone is 48 hours but I regularly go 24 hours, maybe 2 or 3 times a week. We are not designed to eat 3 or 4 times a day and now I realise that, I don't. Well said Timofey Swati Sharma: Is is because of the hunter instincts that just comes naturally to every being when they are hungry. They get sharper, more focussed etc. The food gets into palate because we have been advanced, but that was not the case ages ago. Our ancestors used to hunt for food and remained hungry most of the time. They did not have breakfas, lunch or dinner, they had to strive hard for food and get it through hard work, both mental and physical. Ryan Dimaquibo: I agree. My coworkers judge me on this. Each person is different. I don’t talk bad or judged them on their eating habits. It works for me. I’m setting fireworks tents and offloading/ loading boxes in the heat of the day. And run in circles around them. All the while they are catching their breaths. I may be tired but my will power is strong. Ps it’s super hard to ignore the negative people and try not to say all the things I wanna say. Salah Eddine: Wow! That was astonishing. Thank u so much, sharing kind of this content can change whole life. Now no wonder about why prophet mohammed had been fasting twice a week monday and thursday. Sukanta Ghosh: Exactly the hunger is the best to occupy you thriving for the best. Prime needs of any living creature is food, so starving for food also makes us starving for anything, everything that we might feel needed. Someone once told getting stronger in one area also strengthens other areas. So What I think is hunger for food lets us thriving for excellence in all other needs, Its a remarkable psychological trick we can use to improve ourself. Somnath Balaji: Perfectly said. But one cache is that you should not even drink black coffee or tea during the fasting window. Fasting is all about bringing your digestive fire to rest. It should never be ignited during the window. So only water should be the option. To go a step further, skipping even water takes your body to a whole new level. This is called dry fasting. But it should not be done for more than 12 to 16 hours. Tugba Denizci: Most of what you are doing were adviced 1400 years ago in Quran. As you might know, Muslims fast every year for a month. Also we don’t eat every animal, the animals we eat are limited. There are also fruits mentioned in Quran that is so good for the body. I believe everything created has a purpose. Our prophet also said, a human being does not need much food to survive but if he reallys want to eat more, he shall divide space of his stomach as 1/3 for liquid, 1/3 for food 1/3 empty. English is my second language so i hope i was able to explain well but either way they are all on internet from right sources :) Prashant Singh: In Indian Culture it is Inherent. Here,ppl keeps Fast on pious/religious Festivals. Not only on Festivals,But they have Fixed days to keep Fast in every week(Mon,Tue,Thurs,Sat are deemed very religious to practicr Fast),we can find about it's benefit by just reading the Thousands of years old Hindu scriptures/Books/Vedas where many old monks and Maharishi (Who are devotees of God and survive on minimal resources)have devoted many days doing fast and meditation. This Process also known as Tapasya( तपस्या) and Sadhna (साधना).Both terms may be different in context and orientation but are close. Therefore,Keeping Fast is just one of the means/Activity to achieve some higher goal beyond comprehension. Remember it's Not the Key to Unlock the Unknown,it's just part of the whole Key. And Key itself exists in many forms,there is Not १ Single Pathway. Anasthasia: Need to show this to people who lecture why fasting and intermittent fasting is bad. I only eat one meal a day and I feel great about it. Dishita Bhowmik: Guess that’s why Sherlock Holmes used to give up eating when he was hot on a case… Also in support of what you’ve experienced, I’m a vocalist (still training) and have observed that I perform better when I am hungry or at least have not eaten anything just then. Also I’m a Hindu, and we have old traditions of fasting frequently (sometimes thrice a week) so I can make frequent observations on my body when I’m fasting. Lala May: I agree on the food point , I started the same routine which I dont eat anything during the day until 18h00 or 19h00 I started noticing that I don’t have that “post lunch fatigué” which makes me more awake, focused and engaged.. only fluids or fruits during the day Abraham T. Setiawinata: Intermittent fasting is the “Shaolin Monk’s” secret to gain strength. To make it simple, do this step: Skip breakfast, you are allowed to drink, but ONLY PURE WATER (NO SUGAR ADDED, NO TEA, NO COFFEE, ETC). Don’t eat anything until you have your lunch at 5–6 pm. At that time, you are allowed to eat whatever you want for 3–4 hours. After max 4hr, then stop eating. Have enough sleep. Repeat. Do this every day. Just only in 1–2 weeks, you will see the result. If you mix this type of fasting with exercise, it will blow your mind soon. Your body is lighter than ever before and your mind is crystal-clear. Source: Personal Experience. Sha Pvz: I totally agree. During Ramadan, when I fast for approximately 18–19 hours each day for a whole month, I find that I am very focused when at work. I get more work done than I would usually, plus I don't have the distraction of what to eat for lunch! Joshua D. McLaughlin: I committed to a 5 day fast this year… It was a really remarkable experience. Jaydeep Vekariya: I used to fast during my CA exams and benefits were apparent. High concentration and less laziness. Koen Schilting: Thanks for the good read! I fast sometimes as well up until 5 days in a row. The first 48 hours are nothing special, between 48–72 hours my mind becomes sharper. I hear and see more and I am able to process things faster. Between 72–96 hours my mind sharpens more, whenever I am in a room where several conversations happen at once I feel like I am able to hear 2 or 3 of them at the same time. Between 96–120 hours my mind is in the best state it has ever been, I have never felt so effecient, so awake. I feel like I am able to see and hear everything around me at the same time. I am able to concetrate for long periods of time and come up with solutions for problems that I otherwise would never had thought of. I have ADD, and sometimes during daily life I have problems concentrating and focussing. Life just happens without me having a lot of control over it. But when I fast that completely changes, I am in control of my mind and my attention, a 100%.  My next answer: How to control your mind Get very hungry.

Let’s get to know the details on the training in LBSNAA. Phase 1 of IAS Training In the first phase, rigorous training to the officer trainee of the Indian administrative services is imparted in a wide range of subjects to enable them to handle varied assignments that they would typically hold in the first decade of their service. It consists of district training, but before that, it consists of two basic modules as follows: 1. The winter study tour: The officer trainees travel across the country to experience its rich cultural diversity.A weeklong attachment with the Bureau of Parliamentary Studies, which exposes them to the functioning of the Parliamentary system in India.The Officer Trainees (OTs) also call on important dignitaries such as the President of India, the Vice-President of India, the Prime Minister of India and others during this attachment.2. The academic module: It is a theme- based module and covers various subjects such as: IAS in perspective/Role of the IAS in policy making national security/ law and order, agriculture /land management and administration, rural development /decentralization and panchayati raj urban management/infrastructure and public-private partnership e-governance/office management/administration.Skills such as soft skills (leadership, organizational behaviour and interpersonal skills), projects management, engineering skills and ICIT financial management and project appraisal social sector/weaker section & minorities are specially taken care of.3. District Training IAS trainees go through one year of district training which is like a drill to enable them to see, study and live the paradox that is the quintessential India- with its unfathomable diversity, myriad challenges and opportunities.District training also gives a wide range of opportunity to study the administrative set-up, interact with people, their representatives and officials in order to understand the paradigm of development as well as the effectiveness of strategies.Phase 2 of IAS Training In the second phase, the officer trainees are provided with a platform to share individual learning experiences gained in the field and enables them to articulate the strengths and weaknesses of our administration and governance.This phase emphasises in the interactive learning method and it is supplemented with special sessions with distinguished experts from within and outside the Government.The penultimate phase of training serves as a vibrant learning ground before the Officer Trainees (OTs) launch their career in public service.A typical day for an Officer Trainee at the LBANAA Academy A typical day of an IAS officer trainee (OT) at the academy starts at 6 am with morning exercise drill for 60 minutes and then the riding schedule operates simultaneously. The IAS officer trainee classroom sessions which consist of 5 to 6 academic sessions of 55 minutes each on all working days commence at 9 am. Evening hours are mostly dedicated to the sports, riding and cultural activities which are mostly less about learning and more of a having leisure time. The rest of the evening and night time is spent in interacting with the fellow trainees and preparing for the next day academic sessions. The Academy places a strong emphasis on outdoor events as part of its dynamic training curriculum. All weekends and notified holidays are usually reserved for extra-curricular activities such as community services, adventure sports, rock climbing, paragliding, river rafting, short treks, etc. The importance of physical and mental fitness in leading a life of health, vitality and peace needs no reiteration. It is all the more critical for those who have a hectic and often tension-filled career. IAS officers under training are strongly encouraged to lead a rich, varied and vibrant campus life extending much beyond the confines of lecture halls. Some examples of such experiences are as follows: Trainees are sent on treks to the greater Himalayas where they learn to cope with conditions of adversity, bad weather, insufficient accommodation and limited access to food items.Visit and stay in backward villages to understand and appreciate the realities of rural life is integral to induction level programmes.Officer Trainees (OTs) are encouraged to take up extra-curricular modules and cultivate in-depth interest and proficiency in any hobby of choice.To achieve this, they are encouraged to participate in the activities of various clubs and societies in order to express their creative potential.Recent Trends in IAS Training The Kiran Aggarwal Committee constituted by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has recommended that the total training period for IAS officers be brought down from two years to one-and-a-half years. The step was suggested in view of the strong feedback received from recent batches of IAS officers about the relative sub-optimal effectiveness of attachments in the district and the relatively higher utility of independent charges for on-the-job learning. If we assume the rising median age of IAS officer trainees (around 28 years), the training duration reduction seems a little valid as many enter service with significant work experience and less potential years of service. Moreover, the scope of training has widened over the years as a structured mid-career training programme and short-term refresher courses can be availed by the offers after four years of service. And lastly, the reduction in training or probation period would be welcomed by state governments given the general shortage of junior-level IAS officers. 6",2021-03-05T10:30:04.973Z,"What did they teach their students at Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy Mussoorie that makes an IAS an IAS?

I’ve written a post on this topic:Still waiting for those dream clients? I’ll reveal a secret! However, there are people who have many problems and they’ll usually difficult to work with and cooperate. No matter how experienced and smart we are, we had to deal with such an individual at least once or twice in our career. My worst experience, which didn’t last long because it was a small project, was with a client who was certainly a psychopath! And I’m not exaggerating, because I can recognize one! She didn’t know what she wants, she could change her mind 10 times in a minute, she was extremely anxious and indecisive, unable to concentrate and listen.She wouldn’t respect my schedule and working hours, terms and boundaries.She could call at night and during the weekend and then text me (because I didn’t answer the phone), insisting to go to her house and help her out with something it wasn’t even my job! For a service that normally finishes in 3 meetings (and it was clearly written in my contract), we had to meet 7 times!She didn’t appear on our first appointment and she was extremely late for our second one.She was able to disorganize and stress me and a contractor I worked with, in a few days' time (and we are both very organized and calm people, who love our work). I finally fired her, explaining that it hasn’t happened to me before to have such a huge problem in communication and it’s better for both of us to end our professional relationship (she wanted to assign me a new, more demanding project). She drove crazy every contractor she hired, who abandoned her running and trying to hide. She lives in my neighborhood and she still, after 2 years, hasn’t finished with her “small renovation” and she will never do.In my opinion, she is not mentally healthy. 1",2021-03-05T10:30:49.465Z,"As an interior designer who was your hardest client?

You just need to improve your skills on daily purpose by practicing it regularly when needed.  will tell you some basic steps by which you can improve your Digital Marketing skills:- Advance and Refine Your Skill Set In marketing, it's important to develop two skill types: your hard skills and your soft skills. The hard skill you need to master as a digital marketer is the ability to demonstrate a return on the marketing investments that stakeholders make. You need to utilize the data that is available to you to help others understand the benefits of marketing, beyond the bottom line. The higher the return is, the better chance you have of making real money from this industry. Then, there are the soft skills. These skills range from creativity to innovation, collaboration, and power of influence. These skills make all the difference when it comes to hiring and are the basics you must possess to become a seasoned digital marketing professional. Whether or not you're pursuing a digital marketing degree, learning must be a constant. Consult authoritative marketing websites as well as publications and magazines for the latest insights into the field. It is through all types of learning, whether perusing web articles, scrolling through LinkedIn, or attending seminars, that you should consistently update your skillset. Stay Updated With SEO  When it comes to digital marketing, SEO is one of the most important things that you can master. People with these skills are quickly becoming hot commodities because of what they can do to create visibility for brands. If you don’t know much about SEO, it’s advisable that you at least learn the basics. Here are a few of them that you can add to your list: Keyword Research: One of the fundamentals of SEO is keyword research. If you don’t know much about keywords, they make it possible for people to discover you online. When you use any search engine whether Google or Yahoo, you likely type in a word or phrase in hopes of finding information on that particular topic. With that being said, when you’re doing keyword research, your goal is to get in the mind of the consumer and choose keywords based on what they’d be searching for. Google Keyword Planner is one of many tools perfect for helping you carry out this task. On-Page Optimization: If you happen to have a website or a client that has one, then learning how to do on-page optimization is a must. This will help improve your ranking in search engines which is one of if not the ultimate purpose of SEO. A few on-page ranking factors you want to take into consideration are content that supplies a good demand as well as the shareability of your posts. Also, make sure you use appropriate URLs that contain keywords where possible, have a subject in the image alt text and include the subject in the title tag. Be Aware of the Latest Trends  Involving yourself in digital marketing also requires that you are trendy. With technology and social media constantly evolving, new trends emerge at a moment's notice. Pay attention to more than just marketing trends, however. Look at the overall advancements being made within the advertising and digital industries. Furthermore, you need a nuanced understanding of business strategy, customer experience, industry news, and sales strategy. If your focus is more on the technological aspects, things such as machine learning, microservices, and artificial intelligence (AI) should be on your radar. You need to read about and understand how emerging technologies and trends impact your company's competitiveness and sales strategy. It's advised that you look outside your practice and establish knowledge bridges into related study fields to generate a great impact. The digital marketing industry is filled with resources via blogs, social feeds, and podcasts. Know-How to Research  One of the fundamentals of digital marketing is research. Without it, you can’t effectively target your audiences or speak to them in a language that they understand. To do research, you should have access to a range of resources and be good at navigating your way around online as you can find a lot of information there. However, if you find that you’re being slowed down by error messages, you should check TechLoris to see how you can resolve those issues. It may be worth investing in a fast and efficient PC if you find that’s slowing you down as well. Develop a Strong Digital Presence  Having a wide-reaching digital presence is a core factor in becoming a successful digital marketing professional. If you hope to be hired within the industry, you need to be as visible as possible online because employers will be looking for demonstrable online skills when they research you as a potential candidate. From your LinkedIn profile to your Twitter feed, they'll be on the lookout. It also helps if you have a personal website or blog so employers can see your work and whether that work translates to their business and the skills they require. Develop a polished, executive digital presence. Everything from your photo to your bio should represent how you want to be perceived in real life. Understand Analytics  Another important aspect of digital marketing that you should have basic knowledge of is analytics. There is no use in collecting data, doing research, and carrying out endless activities if you have no idea what to do with your findings. Analytics are so important as they give you an indication of how you’re performing and what areas need improvement. With that being said, you don’t necessarily have to become a professional, but you should understand how analyses work and how to interpret results. You should be able to assess the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns, follow emerging trends, and compile target lists for email marketing. The bottom line is that understanding analytics can help you show clients how your digital marketing activities are adding to their bottom line. Understand Data  Developer and software marketer, HubSpot, reports that 40% of marketers say proving the return on investment of their marketing activities is their greatest challenge. For clients, ROI and metrics about their campaigns are critical. You must include analytics and data-driven conclusions when sending over reports and evaluating campaigns. Several marketing teams struggle to understand data or measure campaigns accurately. Everything you do in digital marketing is underpinned by analytics. Whether you're a social media specialist, search marketer, or PPC specialist, analytics is crucial to understanding success, why it happened, and how to replicate it. Knowing how to collect and analyze data as well as draw insights and recommendations from that data are paramount. You can even earn certifications from online courses that can be added to your resume, showcasing your proficiency. Use analytics as much as possible in your day-to-day decision-making and generate substantial evidence of the effectiveness of your work. Get Good at Content Writing  As with analytics, even if you won’t be doing content writing, knowing the basics of good writing puts you miles ahead. Millions of people are online right now looking for content, and it’s unlikely that they’re looking for how-to articles that they’ve read millions of times over. If you need insight into what makes good content, see a few tips below. Write Often: Writing often is a surefire way of improving your skills. Commit to writing at least once a week and explore a range of different genres whether it be an informal article, press release, or short story. The more you write and edit your work, the better you’ll get at it.Observe Competitors: If you want to know what good content looks like, pay attention to what is being shared. See what competitors are posting and what presently happens to be going viral. This should give you an indication of what your audience likes and how you can put a personal spin on such content.Study Your Audience: When you’re writing content, another strategy to improve the quality of it is to visualize and write as though you’re doing so for a single person in your target audience. Think about what they want to know as well as the type of information they’d be interested in seeing while you write.Certification  If you want to stand out from your peers in the industry, completing a certified digital marketing course will help. One of the issues facing the digital marketing industry is that there are no barriers to entry, meaning that anyone with a loose grasp of industry terminology can potentially get a position in a company. As this industry matures, recruiters are becoming savvier about what differentiates a candidate that can talk the talk, but maybe it will be a costly mistake for the company. Don’t Be Afraid to Take Risks  Present yourself as someone open to trying new things. Show that you want to take on even the smallest task if it means learning a different skill or applying one. Getting out of your comfort zone is how you will grow and how you will learn to be confident in your knowledge and talents. Every calculated risk that you take exposes you to new skills and can make you a well-rounded professional that employers may be willing to take a chance on. Never limit your potential in this industry. Focus on Yourself  A big determinant when transitioning into a digital marketing career is to focus on yourself. Take control of your career and don't wait for others to push it forward for you. Think about the goals you want to achieve and what steps you need to take to achieve them. Do you think a mentor could help you take that big step forward? Could an online class, week-long seminar, or extra certification get you that dream job? As long as you have hard work and confidence, you'll advance further than first imagined. Ensure your attitude is positive and your mind is set on innovation. Be the person that you would want to collaborate with. You want to inspire confidence while being someone who thinks outside the box more often than not.

They would definitely know about Andrew Ng’s ML classes on Coursera and about Weather forecasting using R (if they are serious). Now, I want you to ask yourself: What happens when this field becomes obsolete or congested? What do you do then? What happens if people no more require a data scientist? (This day will probably never come, I am just putting forward an hypothetical case). It took me a lot of time to write this answer and I have tried to provide a comprehensive and holistic approach to make yourself not just capable enough to be a data scientist, but much more than that. Step 1 : Get your mathematics strong and clear. The following topics must be learnt with utmost clarity: Linear Algebra: Start from basic vector spaces and go up to Singular Value decomposition. Don’t underestimate G-S orthogonalization process.Matrix Theory: Learn to find the inverse, transpose, multiplication of matrices, determinants, Eigen values and vectors.Calculus: Integrals (This must be useful ), Differentiation (See here). Differential Equations (See here).Numerical Analysis: Numerical methods to find the solution of a Differential equation and Integrals.Statistics : Distributions, Different kinds of Charts, Mean - Mode - Median (Different methods of finding each and relation between them).Probability : Basic Probability theory, Bayes Theory, What is Likelihood?, Expectation.Don’t overdo the math. These suggestions are based on the assumption that you are strong in high school math syllabus. Step 2: Start reading blogs on data science: This site is like the hub of all data science, ML and AI related posts - KDNuggetsAnalytics Vidhya (See here)Anil Batra’s Blog (See here)BzST (See here)Data Science 101Data TauFor more go here: 90+ blogs on Analytics, Data Science etc. Step 3: Keep up the learning spirit. Keep yourself updated. Keep reading research papers and re-research the sections that you don’t understand. Google all the words and phrases you don’t understand, this process can be frustrating and might force you to go “Fuck this shit! I am gonna go study something simpler”. But believe me when I say that if you cross this phase, nothing can ever beat you. Be a regular visitor of Arxiv, read papers on a regular basis. If you are on Android, Arxiv comes as an Android App too. Step 4: Start some serious data science. (By data science I mean fuzzy Logic, ML, neural nets, AI, NLP etc.) ML by Andrew Ng at Stanford (Please avoid the one at coursera).ML by Abu Mostafa at Caltech.ML at NPTEL at IIT-M (For people outside India, NPTEL is an Indian site where students can see lectures by awesome professors from IITs and other institutes of national importance).Introduction to Data Analytics at Udacity.Introduction to Deep learning at Udacity by Google.Introduction to NLP using nltk-python (here).Introduction to Neural Networks: Book by Simon Haykin. Also learn how to use the neural network toolbox of MATLAB, comes real handy in visualising concepts.Introduction to Fuzzy Logic: Book by Timothy Ross. Same instructions as above.Learning data science concepts and R (or Python) simultaneously at DataCamp.I recently came across this site and this has made me fall in love with it. Check it out here: CodeMentor.Step 5: The Real Action Starts now Now that you are thorough with the basics, dive into making cool stuff with R, Python or any language of your choice. First and foremost let me give a very useful piece of advice. DO NOT TAKE UP A HUGE PROJECT AND END UP DOING NOTHING. Because, let’s face it, you (and me too) don’t have enough patience to sit and face the same dead-end a hundred times. Instead, take up a project and implement one functionality a day. This way you will have a balanced diet for your growing data scientist brain. Learn Numpy (Numpy|Official).Learn Pandas.Learn Matplotlib, Jupyter and Seaborn.These are the basic Python modules for data science using Python. I believe learning R is far easier than learning Python. Most of the R packages required for data science come pre-installed. However, a thorough list is as follows: stringr (string manipulation)Database connection packages RPostgreSQL, RMYSQL, RMongo, RODBC,RSQLitelubridate (time and date manipulation)ggplot2 (data visulization)qcc (statistical quality control and QC charts)reshape2 (data restructuring)plyr (data aggregation)dplyrThere are many more packages, you may explore them in your own time. Tips and Tricks: To save yourself from the hassle of installing so many modules each and every time on Python, use WinPython (download here). This will have most of the modules pre-installed in it and you can also use it in portable mode.For R, download the <package name>-release.zip from CRAN, and save it in a local directory. However, you will need an internet connection to install it, for that you can simply tether your phone’s data to your pc (if you don’t have Wi-Fi).For downloading any package, simply search <package name> Python module, or <package name> R package on Google.After you are done with the above, and if you still have some juice left, dive into the following: Data Visualization: d3.js, tableau, qlikview.Learn Julia.Compete at Kaggle.Learn MongoDb.For any doubts or queries, please comment below.

However, dedicating oneself to a full-time traditional MBA is time-consuming as it involves a lot of classroom hours of learning. If you enroll yourself into a full-time MBA course, you will find it extremely hard to do justice to a job as that also requires several hours of work. A full time MBA requires full time focus Full-time MBA programs are the most popular with younger students who have recently obtained their bachelor's degree or the ones who have worked for a few years. Full-time MBA programs are structured for young graduates who can afford to leave the workforce for a while and be without pay. The workload in a full-time MBA program is more than in a part-time program. There is an attendance schedule, which can be very demanding. Also, one needs to make presentations, submit projects from time to time in a full-time MBA. This requires time and dedication. Hence one can never do justice to both together. However, one can consider an online MBA! Full-time students account for more than 90% of MBA courses. But that is changing with time. Pursuing a full-time traditional MBA is not a preferred option during a pandemic. It is not a suitable option at times due to monthly expenses. At such times, online MBAs are a boon. According to U.S. data, out of a set of students who applied for an online MBA, 91% continued their job while pursuing the MBA course. They are a great alternative to equip you with reliable lectures and training from reputed and well-known experts right from your laptop. Let’s see how an online MBA can help tremendously. Flexibility This is the most important reason why online MBA is being chosen by most people. You can be a working professional and complete your MBA for better career prospects. Online MBA courses offer flexible schedules to merge with your work related commitments. Affordability The cost of an online MBA course is much lesser than that of a traditional MBA course. Students pursuing online MBAs take away the same learning as on-campus MBAs. So that’s another reason to consider online MBAs. Networking Online MBAs are pursued by working professionals. One can thus get access to a huge network, which is beneficial at all points in life. Through your online course, you will make valuable connections with people and end up helping many. Some students may even meet potential employers and mentors. Career growth Online MBA programs have improved and innovated with current times, thereby promising placement assistance in some best firms. Thus pursuing an online MBA program is a substantially viable option for those who are working full time. Thus they don’t need to forego the opportunities of continuing to earn money as well as work experience.",2021-03-05T10:34:04.458Z,"Can I get a full time MBA degree while doing my job? ",Quora

So most of the tip Continue ReadingA good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. ~Doug Linder At the very onset, let me make it clear that I DO NOT consider myself a good programmer. I rate my coding skills as average and I am still learning and have a long way to go before I am even slightly pleased with my programming skills. Yes I am better than quite a few people when it comes to programming, but thats merely because they are lazy and like to sit on idly all day and never bother about programming. Their horrible skills make my less horrible skills look marvellous. So most of the tips I will mention below are lessons learnt from failed endeavours, they are what I have wanted to be and I am not. So lets dive in. 1.Work on Basics As it is true for any industry and any job, the conceptual understanding is the key for success. Unless one has strong conceptual foundation, he/she can never be a good programmer. The core conceptual understanding helps you in designing and implementing the best solutions in the best possible way. If still you feel gap in core computer science and your programming language specific concepts, it’s never too late to go back and review the basics. 2.Start putting question tags (how, what etc.) with every set of code you write One thing that I realized creating a clear separating line between good programmer and rest is that zeal to know what and how it is happening. There is small group of people who can never leave a code without knowing exactly what is happening when it executes. I understand that in tight deadlines, we don’t get this liberty always and hence have to leave the code just knowing that it’s doing its job. Although this is a bit different topic of how to handle such situations, but as a programmer one can always try the level best to dig into as much as one can. And believe me, this becomes a habit with time and then you do it unknowingly every time. 3.You learn more by helping others Most of us have a common tendency of turning our heads towards forums or groups only when we need help. And again a clear separation between the good programmer and rest that the formers visit these places more often to help others. This makes them learn more then they learn getting their problem solved by someone else. Within a team as well, help others to solve their problems. Believe me, understanding others’ problem in their context, investigating on that and providing solutions; will leave you much more learned than before. 4.Write simple, understandable but logical code As in almost every aspect of life, the formula of KISS (Keep it simple and short) works in programming as well. Write more logical code and avoid complexity. Sometimes people do write complex code just to prove their capability to write such codes. My experience says that simple but logical codes always works well, resulted in fewer issues and are more extendable. I remember an excellent quote Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, ""How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?"" ~Steve McConnell 5.Spend more time in analyzing the problem, you’ll need less time to fix it Spend more time in understanding and analyzing the problem and designing solutions for it. You will find the rest of the things quite easily doable. Designing not always mean using modeling languages and tools, it can be as simple as looking at sky and thinking solution in your mind. Those who have habits of pressing keyboard (for coding) the moment get the problem, usually ended us something different than the requirement. 6. Be the first to analyze and review your code Although a bit difficult, but try to break your own code before others can and with the time you will learn to write close-to-bug-free code. Always do a close and unbiased review of your code. Also never hesitate to take others view on your code. Working with good programmers and taking their feedbacks will surely help you become a good programmer. 7.Read documentation One of the essential habits of good programmer is that they read lots of documentation. May it be specifications, JSR, API documents, tutorials etc. Reading documents helps you creating that essential foundation based on which you program in best of the way. 8.You can learn from others code as well I interacted with some excellent programmers who actually have java source project inside their IDE all the time and read/refer that in daily work. They do it not only to fulfill their appetite of knowing the basics but also to learn ways of writing good programs. Reading and referring reliable and known open source code or your senior’s code, can also help you making your programming better.

Programming is a real fun, enjoy it. Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. ~Martin Fowler A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. ~Doug Linder At the very onset, let me make it clear that I DO NOT consider myself a good programmer. I rate my coding skills as average and I am still learning and have a long way to go before I am even slightly pleased with my programming skills. Yes I am better than quite a few people when it comes to programming, but thats merely because they are lazy and like to sit on idly all day and never bother about programming.

I want to believe that I met those criteria, because my background is more versatile than even I realized when I applied to Google. I am going to tell you my story with the hope to inspire you rather than simply tell you what I have achieved. I want to show you that you can do it too. I was born during the time of the Soviet Union in Uzbekistan’s Kyzylkum Desert, and I have a very ordinary family. I did not graduate school with excellent grades, but I studied quite well – although some teachers hardly believed in my potential: My math teacher called me “Dried Apricot,” referring to my dry brain and being unable to process obvious math logic. My classroom teacher believed I was only good enough for a technical school and said I shouldn’t even dream about University. They would be very surprised I have a Job with Google (Anna smiles). University time When the time came to enroll at a university, I failed my entrance exams. However, instead of lowering my ambitions, the following year I decided to apply to the best university in the country – The University of World Economy and Diplomacy. I have to admit though, my mum’s motivational trick helped a lot: she threatened that she would get me a job as a babysitter in a kindergarten class if I didn’t enter any university. Plus, I would have to cook for her everyday. And guess what? I did enter that University! No one could believe it, not even me. Was I the best student at the University? No, I wasn’t. But unlike other students who went home after their studies, I headed to my internships (don’t remember who gave me such a good tip, but it was very valuable). I did a one year internship at United Nations Development Program and a four month internship with the International Red Cross. This experience sat beautifully on my CV. Masters Degree in Poland at Lancaster University Program During my last year at University, I intensively applied for scholarships to study abroad, and I got one. It covered my MA in Politics & Society tuition in Poland and my living costs, $3000 for 1 year. That was like a fairytale for me. If I didn’t get the scholarship, my mum (a single parent) would never have been able to afford to pay for my studies. Thus, I travelled to Poland to study at Lancaster University and entered its program in Polish Academy of Sciences. In the beginning, I really struggled. Even though I studied at the best university in Uzbekistan, the level of instruction was still quite low. Imagine, I didn’t even know what plagiarism was. When I came to Poland, I did a copy-paste job for my first paper, and I failed miserably with a D-. It was a shock to me, but I was a fighter. Spending day and night in the library, I finally got my first C+, then my first B and ultimately began earning As. My philosophy professor used to say, “I don’t know if your papers are brilliant or if they’re complete bullshit.” I didn’t know either (smiles). I graduated with merit, earning my MA and feeling very proud. In the process, I gained so much valuable knowledge in structural analysis, research and academic writing. It helped me greatly on my professional journey.  Recommended to read: 3 Valuable Lessons I have learnt working in Google  Masters Degree in Italy One master’s degree was not enough for me. I got another scholarship to study Cooperation and Development in Italy. This was a more practical course rather than theoretical, and it allowed me to experience the practical side of International Organisations. What was great about this University is that it offered paid internships at interesting organisations. When searching for a University for yourself, take this important factor into consideration. It will serve you well later on. Internships As I have mentioned, the MA program in Italy offered a paid internship somewhere in a developing country. I chose Ethiopia, because they had a project on Capacity Building that was of great interest to me. For 3 months, I performed research on Human Capital in Northern Ethiopia, living in quite harsh conditions. This internship helped me apply my theoretical knowledge to the practical world. Even so, the experience was tough: my dwelling was a mud and straw house, the toilet was just a hole outside the dwelling and the food was very poor in diversity. Forget about chocolate, the most sophisticated treat was sugar cane! Most disturbing, rats were frequent visitors in the house. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the experience very much, and I learnt, learnt, learnt! Work experience After three months in Ethiopia, the organisation I worked for, Cooperazione Internazionale, offered me a six month contract South of Ethiopia, in Negelle. I accepted. My task was to research the sustainability of local farms. The central question was: why were some farms sustainable and others were not. It was an amazing experience. I saw how foreign aid negatively effects local communities, how much money is wasted, how unsustainable foreign aid is, etc. This experience changed my attitude towards charity and everything that comes with it. Ultimately, I decided that I didn’t want to work in this sector because it contradicts my values.  After that, I have found myself in Ireland, and I decided to try the commercial sector. It was 2008, a year of crisis. During the whole year, I managed to only get a two month contract at the International Organisation for Migration where I did research on Georgian and Moldovan communities in Ireland. Accenture/Microsoft I continued my search. After multiple applications, I finally managed to get job at Accenture. I was doing customer service outsourcing for Microsoft packaged goods. Salary was low and treatment wasn’t particularly good: there was a lot of manipulation and bullying. My self-esteem crashed through the floor, but I was fighting. In one year I was offered a promotion, but my rebellious spirit didn’t allow me to stay there anymore. I left.  Recommended to read: How not to give up your dreams  ServiceSource and finally GOOGLE My next employer was another American company that renewed IT licences for the largest IT companies in the world. I enjoyed working there and earned a good salary, but after a year I felt that I can’t renew licenses all my life. I was not learning anymore, and so I started searching for new opportunities. Browsing through vacancies I noticed a position for a Russian speaker at Google. My heart started beating. Why not, I decided. Instead of applying directly, I decided to get some more information from someone who worked at Google. That was a good decision. Always try to get information from insiders before applying anywhere. I have found a person who worked at Google, and he gave me valuable advise: Google looks at four main values while selecting people: Leadership, Analytical skills, Googliness and Professional Knowledge. I made sure I had good examples from my experience for all of these areas, nailed my CV to perfection and threw myself into the storm of interviews. In case you don’t know, Googlers get bonuses for the people they refer. They are, therefore, interested in you being successful and can give you useful insights and guidance. How did you prepare for an interview? As I mentioned, I contacted a person at Google, got general guidance and then compiled all possible questions in concerned categories. After that, I categorised the questions and composed the best answers, writing all of them by hand. I also collected all the information about the position I was applying for and studied Adwords products, market trends and different solutions for different businesses in the context of Adwords. Then I practiced, literally. I sat down at a desk, took a proper posture and talked through all my answers. How many interviews did you have? I had 7 interviews in total: three over-the-phone and four on-site. The first phone interview was mainly about my CV and my experience.

But my idea of a challenge has usually been making a tiny system do a big boy’s job. So here is my first: This was actually the first programming task I was ever paid for. The year was 1977, I was employee #7 in a small datacomms startup. Up till then - since 1967 in fact - I had been a hardware engineer, but hey, things change. The task was to take a reference Z-80 board my boss had put together for a Z80 and serial ports. In this case he had extended the design to have 8 ports using the Zilog Async part, plus a 9th port using the synchronous version. He had the idea it might be possible to make an 8 - 1 - 8 Data Concentrator with it. That is, taking 8 input serial ports, take advantage of their inherent bursty statistics to merge them onto a single synchronous modem link, split them out at the other end and deliver them to the 8 outputs there. And simultaneousy do the same in the other direction. We worked out the requirements on the back of a napkin over lunch one day. Literally. Then I was on my own. On a 2 MHz Z-80 with 4K bytes of RAM and 4K bytes of ROM. Data rates to 9600 Bd, or about 1 msec per byte. Only interrupt implemented was a imprecise timer running at about 750 microsecs per NMI interrupt. NMI - Non Maskable Interrupt - meant that I could not have any critical sections in the code because the only way to do that is by disabling interrupts, but NMI was specifically not affected by that, and could not be disabled. Not only did I have to figure out how to handle the data, I had to figure out an error correcting protocol across the modem link that would garuntee 100% correct delivery of all data over a link with up to 1 bit error per 1000 bits on average. This was 1977, after all, and still a Wild West in the datacomms protocol world, and none of the current ones were lightweight enough and/or reliable enough for what we needed. In 4K + 4K, at 1 usec per instruction (typically two cycles). With only one free running timer, just a bit faster than the max data rate required, to service 18 serial ports including the error correcting packet protocol every msec. And no critical sections. Or hardware CRC support. Or channel interrupts. Only the polling RTC. I came to hate polling in event driven systems like this. Apparently our competition - mainly Cisco - with their $6K offerings, were watching us pretty closely, and laughing at us. We only had one CPU in our box for all functions, when ‘everybody knew’ those data rates needed one cpu for every 2 ports plus one dedicated to the link. Hah! I didn’t know that. We shipped at $1K and took that market out from under their feet. After that we could afford to grow the engineering staff on these StatMuxes from 1 (me) to ultimately about 10. And incrementally improve the design and performance and features. Our boxes were so reliable they were often forgotten, lying somewhere in wiring closts, to be discovered several staff turnovers later by people who had no idea what they did. Until they turned them off. At last count, when I finally moved on, there were about 350,000 shipped units of all generations in the field - still running one one Z-80. And about 1000 employees averaging 10 years of employment each. This one job I think is the one I made the most difference for the most people in my career. I’m an immigrant, btw. Challenges.

What’s more, is that I’ve never had to barter for the premium prices I charge for my content marketing services. Because I’ve done such an efficient job of defining my value propositions, branding myself as an expert within my field, and getting my content ahead of the latest target audiences, I now have a 3–6-month roll for brand spanking new freelance clients. However, that certainly didn’t happen overnight. My rapid success within the world of freelancing is that the results of tons of strategic positioning, hours of diligence, and good timing. . You’ll find tips for learning the tech skills you would like to urge started, strategies for adopting “the freelance mindset,” plus tricks for building a “career safety net” before quitting your day job. Get the guide here. 1. Choose a Perfect Niche If you’re new freelancing, you would possibly feel able to take ANY paid work you'll get your hands on. But as you get deeper into your freelancing career, you’ll get to start being more strategic about the kinds of labor you are doing and therefore the clients you're taking on. In my opinion, the age-old debate of whether you ought to be a specialist or a generalist when starting your freelance career isn’t even worth thinking twice about. If you were your client and you needed someone to repair your email marketing so people actually check-in, write ads that convince people to shop for, or simply update your outdated website, would you rather hire someone who’s a jack of all trades, or an individual who’s a professional at doing one thing and doing it well? I’ll choose a specialist whenever. And when it involves my very own experience, choosing to specialize as a content marketing consultant—as against being a general digital marketer for hire—has been the only best decision I’ve made with my freelance business. Because I’ve built my reputation with clients as a talented content marketer over the past few years and regularly engage with content marketing content on various social media channels, I’ve been ready to rise to the highest of my niche during a relatively short period of your time. Aside from my blog and existing client referrals, the subsequent most consistent source of latest clients has been from business owners seeking out specific expert help through both Google and social searches just like the one above from Twitter. So to expand this instance to other fields, imagine you're just starting out as an internet developer—you can get into a distinct segment like migrating blogs to WordPress. meaning when someone searches for “help with migrating a blog to WordPress,” they will find you. 2. Clear on Your Service Offerings One major decision you would like to form early in your freelance career is what you are doing and what you don’t do. The more specific you'll be about what services you offer, the higher. Not only will it assist you to brand yourself, but it’ll also allow you to regulate how potential clients perceive you and provide you the chance to continue building your portfolio within the direction you would like to maneuver in. If you would like to specialize in becoming a wanted, highly paid Ruby on Rails developer, then you shouldn’t even consider contract offers for customizing WordPress themes or designing the user experience for an upcoming app. 3. Define What Your Ideal Client seems like Before you'll leave and begin trying to find clients, you’ll get to develop a transparent picture of who you’re getting to work best with. does one want to create websites for little business owners, dig in on new feature development for top growth technology startups, or combat longer-term contracts with enterprise-sized companies? Making these clear distinctions between who and what sort of business you’re targeting are going to be essential to effectively pitch your services. To define exactly who your ideal freelance clients should be (and the way to start finding them), ask yourself these questions: What sort of business has the issues I’m solving with my services? Can the business I would like to figure out afford to rent me? What demographic trends am I able to identify the decision-makers within the sorts of businesses I’m targeting? Think age, gender, geographic location, websites they frequent, and their personal interests. Because I do know that I’ll be more engaged and work most effectively with smaller startup teams who are performing on projects I can personally relate to, I’ve proactively chosen to form my scope of potential clients narrow. 4. Create a High-Quality Site It goes without saying that one of the simplest ways to demonstrate your technical skills is by having a tremendous portfolio site of your own. If you would like to be taken seriously as a replacement freelancer, you’re getting to need an internet site that: Showcases your expertise. Highlights relevant past experiences. Shows who you're. Includes your contact information in order that potential clients can easily find you. Plus, a stellar portfolio can really assist you out if you don’t have tons of job experience to prove that you simply know your stuff. (Read more that here: the way to Get Hired in Tech With No Experience.) 5. Start Freelancing Before Your Quit Your Day Job I’m an enormous and of starting a contract business while you retain your day job, as against immediately pursuing self-employment. In addition to the very fact that creating a high-quality portfolio website, building your personal brand, and adding to your portfolio naturally takes an honest amount of your time, it’s an honest idea to possess a couple of steady freelance clients on your roster before axing your sole source of income. I recommend growing your side income to a minimum of 50–75% of your total current income before leaving your full-time job, counting on your risk tolerance. 6. Level Up Your Skills The best thanks to justifying higher rates? confirm you've got impressive skills that are in high demand. Practice using your new skills by building the kinds of projects that you simply want to eventually be paid to figure on. Whether that’s WordPress websites, mobile apps, or something else entirely, the more you'll differentiate yourself among a sea of competition with cool side projects and examples that’ll attract potential customers, the higher. And remember that while highly trained freelancers can get paid far more for his or her work, you don’t need to head back to high school for a BS in computing to urge on the train. Taking online classes sort of a Skillcrush Blueprint can get you on the proper track and put you responsible for your education. 7. Build Your Credibility There are some ways to create your credibility within your industry. apart from creating high-quality blog content and collaborating with notable influencers in your industry, you'll write an ebook, create a web course, and line up speaking engagements to start out increasing your visibility within your niche. These credibility-boosters can assist you to add your list of accomplishments that you simply can highlight on your portfolio and simultaneously demonstrate your knowledge for more potential clients to ascertain. the broader you'll broadcast your message, the more influence you’ll build within your niche. 8. Determine Your Pricing While deciding what proportion to charge for your freelance services may be a major step toward determining your perceived value, you would like to form sure you’re charging enough to form a sustainable, comfortable living. Most clients won’t hesitate to pay higher rates for a freelancer that provides them a fantastic first impression and sells them on the power to deliver high-quality results. As long as I still deliver consistent value to my clients (beyond their expectations), I even have no trouble setting and maintaining high prices for the services I’m providing. Before setting your prices at the bare minimum you would like to charge so as to hit your financial needs, consider the particular value you’d be creating for your potential clients and confirm you’re not leaving money on the table. you'll always increase your rates within the future and hope your client stays on board, but if you begin at a price point you’re already excited about, you’ll be that far more likely to over-deliver and continue increasing your value moving forward. 9. Leverage Your Network for Introductions One of the foremost effective ways to land higher quality and better paying freelance work is thru leveraging your existing networks. Whether it’s pitching your actual friends and former co-workers on freelance help, or using their connections to form warm introductions to companies you are doing want to figure with, this is often an excellent alternative to cold contacting potential clients. 10. Perfect Your Pitching There are art and science to pitching your freelance services to new clients. Because it’s such a crucial a part of running a profitable freelance business, I created a whole online course on the subject of writing freelance proposals that convert, and that i even divulge my freelance proposal template for free of charge . Landing new clients aren’t just a matter of crafting an awesome freelance proposal. Your success depends on how you’re selecting new jobs, how you position your value propositions, and the way much research you are doing before time. 11. Blog Frequently The goal of getting an internet site showcasing your skills is to draw in and convert new clients. What better thanks to increase the amount of potential new clients seeing your website than by creating high-quality blog content that positions you as a stand out an expert within your field? In the beginning, aim for creating one or two in-depth blog posts per month, geared toward providing truly helpful solutions that your potential clients could also be checking out . Note: meaning you’ll be writing for an audience of your clients, not people in your field. 12. Guest Post on Relevant Industry Blogs & Publications Once you've got an internet site that highlights your abilities and clearly communicates that you simply offer freelance services, one among the foremost effective ways to extend your online visibility is by getting content published on the blogs and publications where your potential customers spend the foremost time. Marketing guru and consultant Neil Patel frequently share about the large contracts he lands for his business by publishing over 100 guest posts per annum . While you’ll be starting on a way smaller scale, don’t underestimate the immediate advantage of getting your content featured on blogs and publications which will drive hundreds or maybe thousands of latest visitors to your website. within the span of but one year, I’ve been ready to get my posts published on Entrepreneur, Inc, Business Insider, HubSpot, and dozens of more publications by creating extremely high-quality content and leveraging my pitching abilities.",2021-03-05T10:39:54.132Z,"How can I earn dollars by freelancing as a beginner?

One can start a consulting business alone or collaborating with like-minded professionals. A consultant is considered an expert in a particular field who may work as an advisor either to a company or another individual. The nature of advisory would depend on the sector that the consultant is involved in and the scope of work. Consultants are an important part of any business. Working for yourself rather than for an employer has its challenges, such as losing insurance benefits or a reliable paycheck. But it comes with trade-offs that, for many workers, outweigh the challenges: the ability to set your own schedule, choose your own projects, create your own career trajectory, and focus on goals that you personally value. Consulting work allows you to leverage your existing professional experience, rather than starting a business from scratch. This can be an especially profitable choice: fields that are a good fit for consulting such as law, accounting, or management analysis have the highest earning potential for self-employed workers. Like any business, there are steps you can take as you start your consulting business that will set you up for success.

David Foote, president of Foote Partners LLC, an IT career research firm in New Canaan, Connecticut, explains the business analyst career path best. He says, “There are career tracks that zigzag back and forth between IT and business. Someone might start as a business analyst, then move into a project management job, then an IT management path, then go back to an innovation path … then to process management, then move up a rung to process leadership or process ownership, and then go back over to management as manager of an IT line of business.” Today’s Business Analyst The 21st century business analyst’s world is multifaceted.

I would rather commit seppuku than fail."" This shows his unmatched dedication to work extremely hard as well as appettite for taking  risks and succeeding. An extreme personality, which combined with his intellect got him where he is today.  So while I do not intend to diminish his achievements, it seems to me that people here on Quora as well as society at large often idolize heroes and that's also happening with Elon. Yet there is more to his story. It starts with the issues the whole family apparently has with his dad and goes on to his behaviour at Zip2 and PayPal. Roelof Botha is quoted as having Musk for another 6 months as CEO would have killed the company. On page 91 Vance states that he had conversations with a couple of people who told him of far worse attributes and behaviors of Elon but did not want to go on record out of fear that he would go after them if they did.  Even Vane himself mentions in the beginning that Elon told him he had two options going forward with the book: to work with him or - if he did it on his own - that Elon would make his life/ work hell. Elon seems like a person who is super cautious about any shred of negativity that might sabotage him grooming a certain image that he wants to create publicly.  Apparently he exhibited grotesque behavior towards Justine, telling her at their wedding dance that he is the alpha in the relationship. When they argued, he would remind her that if she were his employee, he would have fired her due to her personal shortcomings. This goes to show that even an Elon Musk is far from perfect, as are all of us.     If I would boil the book down to one key take away I'd say that this is an example of a person who really chose his career. He mostly did what he was wholeheartedly convinced of and was willing to take huge personal risk - without an apparent safety net. That I respect a lot. Other than that I think in many aspects he ""simply"" is an exceptionally gifted human being.",2021-03-05T10:43:15.006Z,"What are the key takeaways from the new Elon Musk book? ",Quora
60420b74ed76476feda1ca95,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-graduate-level-non-Haas-must-take-classes-at-Berkeley?-,"The only graduate classes I took at Berkeley were in the CS department but they were also some of my most rewarding classes overall. Two especially come to mind and if you are able to program and debug then I suggest taking a look at them.  CS 262A: Advanced Topics in Computer Systems. This is an entry-level graduate course in systems that many first-year PhD students take. I took it with Eric Brewer who has experience in both industry as a co-founder of Inktomi and academia as a professor at Berkeley. In both undergraduate and graduate classes I've found that professors with industry experience were able to pass on some of that insight and provide some of the groundwork for students' engineering skills, so this is partly why I enjoyed 262A. In addition to the technical material, we also learned about graduate school, writing a thesis, and how professorships and tenure work. Remember, the class is mostly full of newer PhD students.As far as the material goes I felt I got a high overview of systems design as well as practical experience diving into one of these systems. All of the homework consists of reading papers about operating systems, concurrency mechanisms, some security, virtual machines, database design, logging and recovery, and distributed hash tables and data stores. You send in a paragraph critique about each paper and that's all aside from one take-home midterm and the final project.For our project (I worked with two others) we added BitTorrent to Cassandra (a data store that borrows from Amazon Dynamo and Google Bigtable, both covered in class) and measured its throughput. Amazon generously sponsored us with $200 worth of EC2 credit so we were able to spin up machines in the US east and west regions and look at how geography affected our system's performance. It was also cool because to tune Cassandra and explain some observations we needed to understand the CAP theorem (also covered in class and postulated by Brewer himself) and to build in BitTorrent we had to implement a piece of SEDA (an architecture, also covered in class, and proposed by one of Brewer's PhD students). Getting to learn from a leading systems expert and then applying some of his work to a production system was rewarding.It's also a solid boost of self-confidence to know that you and your teammates are able to dive into a distributed system, implement some protocols, and get the whole thing working end-to-end.CS 288: Statistical Natural Language Processing. This is the hardest class I have ever taken. It was taught by Dan Klein who is a stellar educator and gives some of the best lectures. He also put up with me for just about all the office hours, which I'm pretty grateful for.I had no formal background in statistics other than fifth-grade probability and CS 188 (also taught by Klein), which is the world's most fun AI class. This class dove into hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, smoothing, machine translation, and a host of other statistical methods and applications. That wasn't all, though. The course had five assignments, each of which was to build a part of an NLP system. More or less parts of the Berkeley parser (a fork of the Stanford parser) and other NLP systems had been gutted and equipped with test harnesses, and it was our job to fill in the core components. There was no right answer and we could apply or invent whatever techniques we liked.This ended up being a huge amount of work for me. Fortunately Java was my strong suit but I had to spend hours reading papers and lecture slides to understand the statistics well enough to figure out what I wanted to implement. There also had to be a ""novel"" component to each project. That's only a quarter of the story because then there's building the system efficiently enough so that it runs in four hours instead of 18, debugging all the statistics it tracks when you see it spit out bogus numbers, and then writing three to five pages with graphs and tables to summarize your results. I didn't know I could work that hard. (That's also what I said the semester before that. And the semester before that one.)But it was because of this high bar that I grew. I took the class because I felt a weakness in statistics. The intense debugging and profiling also made me a better Java engineer, something I didn't expect to get from a class. Studying algorithms and digesting papers made me better at understanding research. (As a non-PhD I knew even if I didn't pursue a career conducting research, it is important to be able to consume and apply it.) I'm also glad that I can understand conversations about statistics and NLP at a basic level. In 2010 I asked various engineers in the industry what the best topics to study were and they all mentioned statistics and machine learning. Finally I'll mention it again because he's a great teacher: drop in on one of Dan Klein's classes if you have the chance.The common thread between many of my most recommended classes is that they showed me that I was capable of more than I had thought. That is my most valuable realization from Berkeley. These classes also taught useful, applicable material that strengthens my strategic engineering decisions.  I also enjoyed CS 261: Computer Security with David Wagner but security somewhat of a niche topic. CS 262A is probably a better fit if you want to learn about computer software. In general you can look at the aggregated feedback from students for each of the CS courses at https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/course/CS. Ratings tend to be better correlated with professors instead of courses, so be sure to know who's teaching what. There's a draft schedule that gets updated annually to help you craft the right schedule for yourself: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/schedule-draft.html.",2021-03-05T10:44:04.406Z,"What are the graduate level non-Haas must take classes at Berkeley?

I find the journey to be deeply rewarding because: Great instructors - These are people with real extensive working experience who portray confidence in their domain. Sessions are always full of practical application of the technology being taughtEmphasis on hands-on practicals - During each session, at least 70%-80% of the time is spend inside the IDE. Each line of code is explained by instructor and executed by everyoneSimple datasets - Relatively simple datasets from various industries are provided for learning purposes. Typically not more than a dozen columns. The emphasis is on getting the foundation knowledge acrossLive Q&A - Questions can be raised in a shared text messaging dialogue box at any point in the session. The instructors will make sure all doubts are cleared before moving on to the next topicInstallation Guidance - Though it is not necessary to do any installation to follow the training (as CloudLab is provided for practices), I really appreciate the efforts taken by my Hadoop/ Python/ R instructors on guiding us through the installation process to get same working in my own local system. It is not just paper knowledge that I’m seeking.

Koontz, and Diana Wynne Jones gave me the foundation I would later need to develop my own voice.Write as much as possible. Writing my first book was hard.

But every book after that got a little easier. I truly believe the best way to improve your writing… is to write.Start with something simple. The first book I wrote was a re-imagining of the Wizard of Oz. By doing my own version of a book within the public domain I was given an existing structure to work from, which took away some of the heavy lifting involved in writing a novel from scratch. While you don’t have to follow this point to the letter, consider a topic for your first book that you either know quite well, or can base on an existing life experience/historical event/fairy tale/etc.Heavily consider writing an outline. It helps you organize your thoughts, it’s a great place to add little story details as they come to you, and after its finished it makes a great road map to follow when you start writing your first draft.Start now! Don’t just consider writing a book “one day”, starting putting words on paper immediately. Don’t let “It’s going to suck” or “I’m not a good writer” get in your way. No matter how bad your first attempt might be, it is still an accomplishment. More importantly, it will lead to an even better question… Do I want to write a second book?",2021-03-05T10:46:37.713Z,"How did you get into writing and what advice would you give to someone who wants to write a book someday?

Growing up, I heard that a lot. Until I realised that the people living by that mantra were stuck in a loop, doing the same things over and over again every day, every week, and every year. Overwhelmed, constantly behind, and with no structure to support them, they always seemed to fall back on some sort of “default” for the important choices in their lives: their job, their friends, their goals…even their daily schedule. So I did the same. In my first business, I would go to bed at silly o’clock, and wake up overwhelmed without knowing why: I knew I had a lot to do, but I didn’t know what that was exactly. Every day felt like an uphill battle, and by the end of the day…it was never enough. I was doing a lot but felt constantly behind. In the meantime, I pushed back most of my rituals, and my relationships, my fitness, and even my mental health kept shrinking. Until I understood that avoiding any kind of structure wasn’t setting me free: it was taking away my power to decide what’s important.I was constantly focusing on the small things, only to be forced to compromise on the big things. Once I started using habits and daily rituals, everything changed.Through reflection, I have been able to learn from my every day, and identify what I needed to work on.Through effortless repetition, I created a network of amazing friends, two remote businesses I am passionate about, and designed my lifestyle to include travelling and A TON of fitness (how did I live without it?). Here are my favourite 11 daily rituals that allow me to stay focused:  MORNING RITUALS 6:30 – Inner bath The first thing I do when I wake up is to drink water.Sometimes, I add electrolytes and minerals to it to make sure my body replenishes, but this allows me to rehydrate fast and get an inner bath after restorative sleep. (If you struggle to get out of bed, this will get you springing out of your duvet and towards your first bathroom visit of the day). 6:30 – Meditation Ok, you’ll see meditation a few times on the list. The truth is, this ritual has a really high return on investment. Studies have shown how meditators are able to better manage emotions, and how the prefrontal cortex (the area where rational thinking happens) gets strengthened. So you’ll be able to think more clearly, remain poised under emotional turmoil, and you’ll perform much better throughout the day. Anyway, I do 30 minutes of meditation every morning, doing a body scan and imagining to channel my breath into my heart area. 7:00 – Write in my journal Journaling is so important, as it allows me to reflect and also set my day up for success in a few minutes. I am a big fan of using your own prompts to help you on your way towards your goals. I do this quickly, writing down 3 things I’m grateful for, 3 wins I want to achieve for the day, and… 7:00 – Write my affirmations I also write my affirmations in my journal. These are 4 results I am currently working on—all written in the present tense. 7:15 – Daily workout I train hard: I have learnt that facing my physical limits makes everything else either in all areas of life. That’s why I work out at least once a day, alternating between yoga and a mix of gymnastics and callisthenics. When I travelled for 7 months, I did a 5–10 minute tabata training every morning: you can do it too, no excuse. 8:15 – Breakfast Time to get fuelled up and read a few pages from a book.  AFTERNOON RITUALS 13:00 – Restorative walk After a morning of writing, working, or coaching sessions, I go for a walk around the block (or longer). Usually, this is no headphones: just me observing people walking around and really noticing the details and solidity of the buildings around me. This is a great remedy to sitting in front of a screen for hours: it shifts your focus outwardly, and when you notice the world you suddenly feel recharged. 13:20 – Meditation Here it is again. For this quick one (5m) I use a heart monitor that helps me get centred and sync up my brainwaves and heartbeat.No need to get fancy though, just show up for your 5 minutes.  EVENING RITUALS 22:00 – Journal The journal is back. This time, I write 3 things I’m grateful for, 3 wins from the actual day (great to see whether you did what you said you wanted to do), and write down my affirmations again. 22:15 – Write in my journal Oh. What? Back again.This helps me get relaxed and really make the most out of my sleep: this way, I can optimise deep and REM sleep to repair my body and store information without needing a superlong night (or feeling constantly tired). 22:25 – Ready for bed Time to put on my eye mask and earplugs, and enjoy those dreams.Excited for tomorrow. Goodnight. – Matt “Life is so boring when you do the same things every day”. Growing up, I heard that a lot.

However given the scarcity of faculty positions, many PhDs are now moving to industry and employing their skills successfully in the corporate world. If you are a PhD and do not want to continue in academia, then do not worry. Your PhD is not a waste, in fact you can use it to your advantage. Industry offers a wide variety of challenging problems that will definitely cater to your research driven experience. Some of the classic industry jobs for you are: Consultancy: - The master problem solver. Often during a PhD you are overcome with a task which seemed insurmountable, you worked hard, researched and finally solved it. If you are a person who enjoys solving seemingly unsolvable problem, this job is for you. Some of the big names are Mckinsey, Bain and Co. etc. Expect really good salaries, but very long working hours.Quantitative Researcher: - The math loving programming whiz. If you like solving complex mathematical problems (like the ones theoretical physicist do on a regular basis, and love to code it out), this might be a perfect fit for you. You are assumed to be good programmer and have complete mastery over atleast one programming language. You would be surprised by the number of PhDs (mostly Physical and Mathematical Sciences) who work in this field. Not surprising there as the field was developed by physicist and mathematicians. A knowledge of basic finance is helpful, after all you might become a hedge fund manager one day. Companies like Goldman Sachs, Blackrock etc are well known. Competition is stiff but rewards are high.Industrial Researcher/ Research Scientist/ Research Associate: This position goes by many names, with some varying job descriptions but you would be glad to know that research is not just confined to academia, especially in fields like chemistry, biology as well as some branches in Physics like material sciences. Also if you are a computer science graduate, this is the time to go for such a job. If you want to continue doing research then this position is perfect for you. The list of companies employing people with this job description is humongous. Even Google (or Alphabet to be correct) advertises such positions.Science Writer/ Editor / Communicator: - Do you love writing or editing content. Irrespective of field there are numerous opportunities waiting for you. It goes without saying that you will be tested for your English skills (surprise surprise) as that is what most readable content is created in although it doesn’t hurt to know one other language (other than your mother tongue).Medical Science Liaison:- Heads up PhDs in life sciences, this is another sexy job of this time and pays really well. MSLs are employed by most of the big pharma companies and they publicize the products as well look at how well it is received. They also have to suggest any changes that might be required in the product. It is high paying but requires excellent communication skills and some sales skills too (just remember in any industrial job you have to have a product that can be sold, so it is a basic requirement. Remember you also had to sell why your PhD research is important).Data Scientist:- Probably the sexiest job of the century and also the most hyped. With the advent of modern machine learning techniques, traditional statistical analysis will not do the trick anymore and you need people who can research and analyse all available data and maximize profits, sales etc. for a company, using the most appropriate tools. Most PhDs have experience with data analysis at some point and that is valuable. Data Science also accepts people from varying backgrounds - from physicists to social scientists. But be careful, and read job descriptions carefully, different companies have different idea of what they feel a data scientist should do. But nonetheless an excellent additional option for PhDs. If you are well versed in R or Python or both, what are you doing? Just apply! P.S. R and Python is what most data scientist use.Software Engineering: Many physicists end up doing a lot coding at the end of the day. Especially those working in particle physics, astrophysics or those doing complex simulations. If you train yourself to write production quality code and know a version control software (like Git), you can apply for a developer job. Many physicists with or without PhD take this route. The pay in general is quite high.Patent agent/attorney/consultant: This is another possible career option for physicists/chemist/biologist out there, although this will involve getting additional training. It is a rewarding job but you might have to start as a trainee in a firm that deals with patents in the initial stages of your career.I hope this covers most of popular non academic options for you if you have a PhD.

This is a hard decision. Most of the wealthy people sacrifice it all for the career and are the best at it. They are financially successful, have a great reputation and express power. The trap here is your ego. Some of them tend to become extremely full of themselves. They neglect people and tend to lose on the family side; they find it hard to act human again, because, in business, to succeed you must be tough. b) Evolution Some people are curious. They love learning new things and can't stand doing routine jobs. Start-ups, being unstable and trying new solutions constantly, will give you the possibility to evolve, while a job at a corporation might end you up with repetitive work. c) Satisfaction You must end up with a job feeling happy. For any reason why you need the job, aim for the one you know you fit the best. Aim for that field that amazes you or makes you curios about. It is not easy to find what you are good at. It is pretty hard for someone who has a job doing X to end up on their dream job doing Y. I would suggest following a strategy of minor changes. If you really feel like you want to follow your dream, but are far from it, try settling to things closer to your target.  Take for example always wanting to work in IT, but you ended up as a cashier. Aim for smaller changes, one at a time, instead of rushing towards a CS degree from the start. Try not wasting resources on this unsettled cause (your dreams). Take a free course in programming. See if it fits.  Sometimes aim for the spark and see that it isn't really what you wanted, it might solve your problem or open up a new one, but it reduces the area of your uncertainty. It's not bad to fail but learn from your mistakes. If it will work, you will continue networking with your class, and eventually develop a likeliness for this path, followed by a CS degree in the end, not to mention friends. If you think it well enough, you will end up mostly with benefits from trying on new things. (friends, courage, happiness) 2. Seek mentorship Whatever you career will be, it is highly important to stick with best people in that field in order to aim high: - Ravage Quora of information. Ask and follow professional experience from people that mastered that career path. - Connect with important people on that field on LinkedIn. - Follow top-tier company's Facebook pages in order to get the latest news about internships, events etc. - Join groups of people (college courses, private courses, facebook groups) in order to work constantly in being ready for your desired job. It is harder to learn by reading books or online courses rather than surrounding yourself with ambitious people with whom you will constantly have projects to work on. - Participate in events in order to connect with high value mentors and build your CV with the practical experience gained. II. Trying to get a promotion a) Soft skills Learn that it's important to not forget about your ""human"" side. Don't just try and be the best at what your boss made you do. If you will follow up this idea, there is no reason for anyone to advance you anywhere else. a) Learn to interact with people - Be one of the colleagues that accepts to go out on team-buildings or out-of-company events (beer night, ping-pong event etc). - Try to understand / forgive / accept mistakes by learning more about what started them. - Learn not to discriminate anyone. Learn to understand why others say things or act different. - Try to volunteer in helping your colleagues, your supervisor, people. - Act nicer. It might be hard to even say ""thank you"" or smile, but it helps. b) Play hard You have to prove that you are that person that people can put their trust in.Don't miss deadlines, constantly try to learn new things. Don't miss the free-time by accepting to work over schedule and, at the same time, don't mix free-time activities with your work time. ---  I hope that this will help you and I'm sure you're filter the good wisdom.

You need to determine the level of the learner; i.e. what assumptions are you making about them? The better you know the target audience the better. All beginning students come into a situation with their own experience and history. The key is having a solid idea of what a particular course/module/learning object, etc is supposed to accomplish, and what level of knowledge the learner needs to have to understand and complete the objectives. Listing prerequisite skills will go a long way towards helping students be successful. Once you have the outcomes, how are you going to assess whether they understand and can apply the concepts. Knowing the outcomes and what behavior will demonstrate the mastery will inform the types of materials and experience you have to design in order for the learners to be able to execute the behaviors. Also, instructional design is an iterative process. Courses evolve based on student feedback. Each iteration makes the course stronger and more effective.",2021-03-05T10:52:33.099Z,"What are the essential skills required to be a great instructional designer? ",Quora

And now, in her PG, MD( obstetrics and gynaecology) she's getting 88,000. What all she sacrificed, Ummm, not only her, but us, her family too. :) Well we are a nuclear family of 5. Mom, Dad, Deedo (i love calling her this), Me, Brother. She was born in 1991, me in 1996 and bro came to us in 2001. So, a gap of 5-years in 2 of us lead us in 3 different stages of life always, till date, unless all of us are adults. So, when i was in 6th standard and bro was in 1st, we had to bid goodbye to our didi to Chandigarh, 190 kms from our town, for her medical entrance exams coaching. You see, how little was he, 6.5 years old! And she was his favorite in house. He used to cry every evening missing her to be home. I used to sit beside her and chatter about my day for a long time and used to go to her taking every little problem, from personal to fights with bro to my homework and drawings, she would do it all. And now, i was the elder kid in home. That sucked. I barely used to talk to her on phone, as i just used to sit beside mom and listen to her conversation with Deedo, reason being, she had to study and i was an introvert. She used to visit us every 2.5 months only for 2 days, and used to cry everytime i bid her goodbye and take a promise from her that next time she would come soon. But no, to get something we have to lose. Papa Mumma missed her a lot, of course. Papa's favourite child. <3 Haha, and we were always happy with that. :) Okay, time passed, 2008, with God's grace, she got a great rank in All India Medical test exams for UG, she got MBBS in Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bangalore. This time, 2024 kms away, but we were happy. Didi was going to be a Doctor. She used to visit us after every year for 15 days and we grew up almost without her. She graduated in March,2014, when i passed my 12th and bro was now in 7th standard. You see, he entered in teenage and me in adulthood, almost without her. Then she started to prepare for her MD entrance exams but luck didn't favour her for the first attempts. Decided to try again, second time and this time, she did a job for 6 months in Government hospital, 32 sector, Chandigarh to gain some experience, and to freshen up her mind from constant studying. This time,2015, she didn't get a rank of her choice so she decided to try again. Not an easy-peasy task, only medicos know this. Hats off to them! 2016, second attempt, again, she wanted to clear for AIIMS or PGI, Chandigarh or a good government college in All India exam. Her wish, though, was to in AIIMS. But, 2017, not yet. 3 years of her constant struggle, hard work and we had to be away from her. Why? Because in these 3 years, even when she was in home, no one from us was allowed to go her room. But we were happy, at least she was with us. I am a naughty kid at home (officially an adult but I'm a kid at home). I just used to open her room steadily, smile like an idiot, say Hi! And come back. Thank God🙏🏻 2018, she got AIIMS, Delhi, her dream college and now she is in second year MD (obstetrics and gynaecology) working from 7 am in morning till 11 pm or sometimes even late till, 1 or 2 am. Holidays? Doctors don't get that. Okay, once per month. Since then 2018 , she has got home twice, once for one day and this time for 2-3 days. But, since Delhi, is an overnight journey, we get to go there sometimes. Brother is now 18.5 Years old, I'm almost 24, Missing her since 11 years. We love her like anything. Being doctor ain't easy. Almost every doctor's life is like that. She used to be little arrogant and stubborn but since she has been doing and completed her MBBS, she's turned into such a humble person that I'm shocked.

First few months for the PhD student are very crucial and its overwhelming. You easily get nervous and start feeling the pressure. My advice would be to relax yourself. Get rid of all the formalities when you start the course. Learn your basics, and discover the field of research. The sooner you start working the sooner you will get results.Get your desk and chair: Ask your supervisor to fix your seat and make it comfortable for you. This will the be place where you will spend most of your time. Make is ergonomic. Get all the things that you usually like on your table. Buy a coffee mug (definitely YES). Get all the office supplies that you need. Being organized will help you in the long run.Do the paperwork: First week of joining the course is really frustrating. You will have dozens of forms to fill. Get over it quickly.Meet your professor: Professors are usually busy, but you will need him more than anything. Fix your schedule of your regular meetings. Always keep him track of your progress, whether you meet him or not. Send weekly summary of things you have done and things that you are doing right now. Make this a habit. Its important that your supervisor knows this, just in case you have troubles continuing the topic you chose. The sooner you know this the better.Choose the right courses: Depending on the course, you might have to take credit courses. Choose the right subjects and try to finish the requirements in a year.Read, Read and Read: Read papers, lots of them. This is what you are going to do at the beginning of your PhD. Be proactive and find relevant papers on your research topics (Google scholar, pub med are good place to find papers). Ask your boss to send you some good papers to read. Make a habit of reading atleast 2–3 papers everyday. I usually keep a box under my desk with two sections (IN and OUT). After reading the paper I place them in the OUT section. If I like the paper, I make a note on the first page of the paper and file it somewhere for future use.Literature Review: Since we are reading papers, continue the literature review. Read in and out of all that is going on in your field. Make a list of things that are still challenging or needs to be done in your field. Mark the hot topics and find where your research might fit. Therefore reading papers is very important. Read them, mark them, summarize them and organize them. Most students ignore this fact and jump right into the research. I wish someone had told me this before. Reading will give you a very wide perspective of your research field in the initial stage itself.Know what your peers and colleagues are doing: Its important to know who you are working with. Find what other students are doing in the lab. Read previous thesis in your group. Find out how many papers usually the group publishes, and where they publish. Find out whether the group has developed some in-house technique that is unique or extend someone’s work. Learn the structure of thesis contents in the group. Socialize and know who you can collaborate with. This is useful and you can ask for help when you are stuck.Know your research plan by heart: This sounds little confusing right? But you need to have a vague idea about what you are doing. What problem are you trying to solve. What are the steps that you need to learn and follow to solve that problem. Give a try to this. You can split your PhD in 4-6 blocks or sub-projects. Each one should be ambitious enough and well defined to produce a publication. Otherwise you are not being ambitious.Try to design it in a way that the first project is easy and that will likely yield results soon. why? To boost your motivation by seeing progress and early results. It’s not a good idea to wait 2 or 3 years to see the first results, I can tell you that. Set a date in the future (in 6 to 12 months) to review if your initial plan is going well or you need to change direction.Write, write and write: Trust me, the greatest challenge you will ever face in the PhD will be to write that one journal paper. Get into the habit of writing early. Write as often as you can, as much as you can, so that by the time you write your dissertation, you will have become a fluent academic writer. Try to write everyday. Learn the tools such as LaTeX or MS word. Write small reports of the experiments that you performed or the paper you read. Always report your results in form of writing. Send this to your supervisor weekly. This will make your life easy when it comes to actually writing that Journal/conference paper in the set deadline.Keep a small diary with you always: Keep a pen and diary always with you to jot down that small idea when you get one. We tend to forget small things very easily. You can never recall the same idea with the same clarity when it first occurred to you. Do not let it waste. Even the stupidest idea should go in that diary.Go to conferences (Many): Keep track of the conferences (locally and globally) happening in the year. You can check some good conferences from wikicfp. Go for as many conferences as you can, be it small or big. You will know what is happening in your field and what other researchers are doing. You will meet experts from the same field and this will help you grow your network. Practice presenting your work as often as you can, and for as many audiences as possible. Get your face out there, and practice practice practice.Stay healthy: Don’t binge on those cheese sandwiches, potato chips and burgers or instant ramen. Stay healthy. Walk a lot. Do some physical excercise and keep yourself fit. Get the right fuel for your body and mind. Eat those veggies and grains. Don’t get ill as you will lose substantial amount of time that you could have dedicated for your research. Keep you immune strong.Teach and supervise: Teaching is the best way to learn. You can supervise undergraduates as TA and get to meet new students. It is also a good practice for your future career if you are thinking of joining academia.Lead your research: Take lead positions in your project. Come up with new ideas and present them to your boss. Do not depend too much on your supervisor. Make sure you have a plan for what you want to do for the next three months ready.Find a good routine: Now this depends on person to person. Personally, I like to work from mornings to evening. For others, night time is more suitable as it gives them calm environment to work. Whatever you choose, make sure you get enough sleep (7 hours) and you are socializing regularly with people (that is why I prefer mornings as you get evenings to spend time with friends.). Its important you make time for friends and family. Take enough breaks and keep yourself hydrated.Finally, Remember why you chose to do the PhD: I had my own reasons to do the PhD and I have loved every day of it. I am what I am today because of that decision. Remember why you started it at first place. Keep your goals clear in your mind and know that their will be challenges in the way. When you get frustrated with a detail, remember the bigger scope, Connect to that feeling of pride and importance on being able to contribute to the greater problems of society for a meager salary.Good luck.

Though the name doesn't say macroeconomics, it's the best macroeconomy lectures I have ever attended.Even some specific economy courses didn't do much for me to start understand the principles and rules. Professor Gayle Allard is a great instructor and the structure of the course is very easy to follow and to learn. The course is an awesome opportunity for everybody interested in how the economy works. 4.

Professor Kermit Roosevelt provides several controversial points of view on constitutional topics with judges decisions and history in regards to it. In the context of contemporary chatter about freedom, democracy etc. this course should be able to help making an informed opinion based on existing knowledge and research up to date.

I should note: slip-ups can occur in this during development and things can be missed, we’re all human, but pro’s will at-least make an effort to test when they know they are using features that are prone to issues.Professional web developers generally cost more than “your cousin who knows how to code and stuff” but are absolutely worth their salt.Professional web developers also tend to think long term, - ”if we implement this, how hard will it be for the client to change down the road?”They will tend to come off as one of the smartest guy/gal in the room during meetings, but should not be full of themselves.[This really should apply to all professional programmers and developers] They will know a lot about a wide range of related topics and be the person people ask technical questions to, even if it’s not specifically related to the exact thing they are doing on the project. When they don’t know an answer they will usually state they will find out or provide an insight based on what they do know. They will avoid BSing an answer if they don’t know it.Related to the previous one - their decisions will tend to be more logic based than emotion based.(this may vary for developers that are also designers)When you tell them your amazing “it’ll be the next [insert existing product name or social network here]!” proposition they tend to be very calm about it and poke holes in your dream app/website/company. It’s not a personal thing - it’s that they have heard and seen it all, and they know more about how much work is involved in making said site/app and the challenges of marketing it.",2021-03-05T10:55:08.702Z,"What are the sign of a professional web developer?

I’ve also done iOS development since the very first version of the iPhone SDK was in beta in early 2008, having done Mac development for years before that. I think whether or not an iOS bootcamp is worth it depends on your goals. If your goal is to get a job as a professional iOS developer, a bootcamp can be very worthwhile. If your goal is to develop apps for fun as a hobby, perhaps not. I’m going to assume your goal is to become a professional iOS developer. There are lots of good resources for learning on your own, including books, online courses, videos, etc. All of these are really valuable. We encourage our students to get good at using them to continue their learning after graduating. I learned Mac development primarily on my own by reading books! However, compared to trying to learn by yourself, a good bootcamp can give you a big leg up. You have the opportunity to learn from experienced developers who have already been through the learning process and know what you need to know to succeed. Going through a well-designed curriculum also means that you are better able to focus on the specific skills that are most valuable in the industry. The structure imposed by a program where you are expected to learn skills and complete assignments and projects on a strict schedule can help you stay focused instead of becoming discouraged and giving up. Lastly, most bootcamps will help you with job preparation, as well as use their network to help you find opportunities after graduating. That said, a bootcamp is like any other worthwhile pursuit. It takes a lot of hard work and effort on your part. You cannot expect to coast through and become an effective, valuable developer without working hard. It’s called a “bootcamp” for a reason! Students who give it their all and take advantage of all of the provided resources tend to do very well after they graduate. Those who are lazy and unfocused obviously don’t magically become knowledgable and employable after graduating. It’s also important to realize that no matter how good the program you go through is, or how hard you work, 12–16 weeks is simply not enough time to become an expert, senior developer. Rather, you should end up with the skills you need to be an effective, contributing junior developer. Most importantly, you should be good at continuing to learn as all good engineers must do throughout their careers. Bootcamps are not a one-size-fits-all approach to learning iOS development, but for many people they can be a very valuable and effective way to learn the skills needed to start a career.",2021-03-05T10:55:45.330Z,"Is a iOS bootcamp worth it?

I felt the same when I was changing my career from sales and marketing to Analytics. So for that, I shifted from Gurgaon to Hyderabad to learn analytics and start my career in the field of analytics. I was not happy with my previous profile and to move to analytics I wanted something solid which can give me a proper path with which I can start my path for analytics. Doing research I landed across the PGP -DSE program offered by Great Learning in Hyderabad. I joined Great Learning PGP - data science Engg. program which was one of the biggest decisions I took until now. But I can say that it actually paid off. The program in itself is a well-versed program as they teach from scratch in my batch there were 60% freshers and coming from different backgrounds like Bcom, Mechanical Engg, Civil Engg, research background and due to this program they are right now working in the field of analytics as data engineers, Business Analyst and Trainee Data scientist. DSE program covers some in-demand skills like Python, R, SQL, Machine Learning and Tableau which are the basic skillset I believe you need to have to enter the analytics field. With a 5 months program in Data Science and an experienced set of Mentor to walk you through the Program and helping candidates in Placement assistance what more you can expect. I will tell you in detail how is the Placement scenario: 1: There will be many sessions for placement preparation whether it is Resume Building, practicing for the rounds for the companies even mock interviews will be arranged with dedicated faculty. These all are well planned and scheduled 2: There are many Big organizations and reputed companies that hire from this program. I can name a few in which I was shortlisted like Musigma, Cognizant, Kinara Capital, UHG, Optum, fractal Analytics, Uber, Swiggy, Mahindra and Mahindra, Tredence Analytics, OYO, and many more companies came even after I was placed. 3. After all these dedicated placements for the DSE Program, they even arranged some Career Fair in which a minimum of 15–20 companies participated. We also went to Walkin Interviews and it is quite amazing because they don't want us to miss any opportunity. One suggestion from my end would be you should keep on reading Concepts and articles from the Internet to keep you updated and connect to people who are working in the same field they can guide you better to take a step forward in this field. So the Crux of this is a place where you get Conceptual and Practical knowledge from the experts in the field of analytics with Projects and Variety of assignments to work on and a major advantage is that you are getting Placement opportunities in the reputed companies with an amazing placement record so I would suggest PGPDSE Program by Great Learning is a good place to start your career in the field of analytics.!!!!",2021-03-05T10:56:01.694Z,"Which is the best offline course for data science in Hyderabad?

Those inputs are fine.  I am going to tell you though - that you may want to know certain things and ask yourself some important questions before you try to make this career change.  The things you need to know: The traditional ""DBA"" role is going to be a thing of the past. Complex software stacks like Oracle, which is an RDBMS, will still require full time, expert DBA's, but even MySQL which is also an RDBMS doesn't require the same level of dedicated time from a DBA as Oracle did and still does. But even more importantly perhaps, all the new NoSQL database technologies such as Mongo, Cassandra etc. do not need a DBA at all. There is simply nothing for a DBA to do and remain interested for a long time. These technologies are designed for much higher availability and scalability already so a lot of the challenges that drove the DBA discipline in the relational world are no longer relevant. At least not in the same sense that most people who want to become a DBA understand.  The second thing you need to know. Software development / programming involves sprints, clear definitions of what is needed to be delivered in a fixed amount of time, and typically developers are working on one project at a time. They do not like interruptions :-). A DBA's world is entirely different. It is filled with context switching through a single day, delivering small chunks of work of widely varying business criticality and dealing with a braod range of people in the organization. Even more important good DBA's are almost always involved in break fix work so these are folks who are not only used to a 24x7 schedule but occasionally even thrive on it.  So, ask yourself if you really want to be a DBA, knowing what you do now about the job. If you still do, sure, got for it, but position yourself as a DB Engineer and not a DB Administrator. Sell yourself as someone with mainly software engineering and development expertise who understanding of the underlying data stores is the unique value proposition you offer.",2021-03-05T10:56:23.442Z,"What is the best way to transition from software engineering to database administration?

A good computer science degree will enable you to write more kinds of software and to qualify for more and more interesting kinds of jobs over your career. Here is more information on both of these. Kinds of Software People often imagine they will spend a career writing the same kind of software, year after year. But it seldom works that way. Here are some of the software development applications I wrote during my career. Navigating a ship, analyzing massive amounts of data from a seismic exploration system, writing a compiler, writing an operating system, controlling a land-based radar system (software that ran on a very powerful computer), controlling a “terrain following radar” system for a high speed aircraft (that software had to run on a very small microcomputer and yet had to be extremely fast and do a lot of fancy math computations very quickly), truck frame analysis (figuring out how thick the steel needed to be in a truck frame to handle a particular load safely). A former student of mine majored in computer science and minored in veterinary medicine and ended up spending much of her career writing increasingly more sophisticated software for use by veterinarians. These and many other software applications are where most software developers spend most of their time. Things like video games and web sites may be fun to develop, but they are only a small percentage of the software development jobs out there, and people who have done them tell me they tire of them rather quickly. They are also among the lowest paying kinds of jobs for software developers. You are paid for what you know and what you can do. You need to know more than programming in order to get the best opportunities. If you go through my list, you will note that many of these applications require a lot of knowledge of math and physics. Other applications require a lot of knowledge of other things such as biology, chemistry, medical topics or other technically difficult subjects. This is where the “science” part of a computer science degree comes into play. A computer science student in a good program will have required science and math courses - precisely because so many of the applications they may end up needing to develop will require such knowledge. And even if the courses don’t teach exactly what they need to know (for example, my physics courses didn’t really teach me how radar systems work), the background they provide (sometimes known as mathematical and scientific maturity) enables you to pick up what you need to know relatively quickly. In short, computer science prepares you for a much broader variety of jobs than something like a coding camp would do and that may come in very handy in the software development field because there will always be younger people entering the field who know the latest methods and tools and are paid less than you want to be paid. (During my working career, my company often assisted individuals without a computer science degree to get one so they could qualify for more responsible positions.) Kinds of Jobs A typical working career lasts about 40 years. Some people envision spending their entire career doing the sort of thing they started out doing. But only a few actually do that. Not only will what you start out doing become boring after a while, but it may not have the promotion and salary increase options you would like to have. Here are some of the kinds of jobs that a typical computer science graduate might have over the course of that 40 year career. Programming, testing, debugging, designing software solutions, and analyzing requirements. Those are the things one does at the start of one’s career. But before long, most software developers move up to more responsible positions, such as being the team lead for a team building a larger and more complex product, being the chief designer or system analyst (heavily involved with requirements) for a really large application requiring dozens or even hundreds of software developers, or perhaps being put in charge of devising the overall integration plan for a complex product involving both hardware and software. And after that may come opportunities to do even more responsible jobs such as managing a large project with hundreds of employees, or analyzing and improving the way an entire company does software development, or evaluating data to determine what is causing the most bugs in an organization’s software or developing better software development tools. Another possibility is writing proposals so your company can win major contracts involving development of lots of software. And most of the more experienced software developers will find themselves needing to do things like estimating the cost and schedule of a proposed software project - and managing or leading the project so that it stays on schedule and within budget. I want to emphasize the part about writing proposals and leading successful projects. These may seem like “management” or “administrative” jobs, but in the case of software development they may require extensive software development knowledge and experience of the kind that only the expert software engineers have accumulated. In many kinds of situations you need to be able to convince a higher level manager or a potential customer that your team can and will do an excellent job. After all, they are being asked to give you a lot of money to do the job. One of my most interesting experiences along these lines was a situation where my company was going to hire a half-dozen subcontractors to develop part of the software and our job was to integrate all of that software with software we developed ourselves into a product that was highly reliable and maintainable. (This product had well over a million lines of code and there were several hundred software developers involved, not to mention some state of the art hardware.) We, the most senior and experienced software developers in the company, spent enormous amounts of time working with our procurement department and our potential subcontractors to prepare contract language and statements of work for these subcontractors that would assure they “toe the line”, so to speak, and to assure that we could effectively integrate all of their software into a high quality product that could be easily maintained, supported and upgraded for at least ten years. I could go on like this but I won’t. My point is that the kinds of jobs I have mentioned all require knowledge of how to write software but they tend to require a lot more knowledge. That’s once again where a computer science degree comes into play and, indeed, where one might want to go on and get a masters degree in computer science or software engineering as one’s career advances. (Interestingly enough, one of the most important courses for my career was one on technical writing and public speaking, which prepared me to write winning proposals and give effective presentations to potential customers as well as higher level managers). As i progressed in my career, one of my jobs was helping decide which of the younger and less experienced software developers should get raises and promotions. My company had a “dual ladder” of advancement, which means that a person could spend an entire career doing technical work and still advance to a pay and benefits level comparable to high level managers. I can still recall the discussions that typically went on each year as we examined the performance and the potential of specific individuals to decide which ones got the biggest raises and which ones got promotions. I can assure you that a solid computer science background was usually part of the background of the most outstanding candidates. No, we didn’t use the CS degree as one of our criteria. But when we had made our decisions and were preparing the paperwork to support those decisions, we almost always found that a solid undergraduate degree and often a masters degree in engineering or science or math or computer science was a common denominator among the top individuals.",2021-03-05T10:58:48.937Z,"What can make a computer science backgroung programmer different from a non-computer science background programmer?

I've actually given many talks about this and participated in development of curricula (as well as program evaluation) for all of these (except it was software engineering rather than computer programming). First of all, the distinction among these is entirely man-made and somewhat arbitrary and not all agree with each other on the finer details. Secondly, there's a lot of overlap and it's compounded by quibbles over whether certain topics ""belong"" to one or the other.. Thirdly, I'd consider computer programming to be a subset or specialization within both software engineering and computer science, so i'll handle that separately, after I address the others. Computer engineering is the study of how to engineer (design, build and maintain) computers. As commonly understood, it focuses on the physical hardware. As such it is often considered a branch of electrical engineering, since most modern computers are built from electrical and electronic components. A computer engineer will know how to design electrical circuits and how to design or debug an interface between a computer and some other device, such as a network or a printer. He or she will be able to discuss differences among computer architectural approaches and will have a deep understanding of such things as computer memory organization and how to design high performance computer systems. He or she will also understand the basics of computer software, but not typically to the depth found in the other fields being discussed. A computer scientist will have a modest (often very minimal) knowledge of the hardware but a deep understanding of the foundations and principles of computing, such as algorithms, computational complexity, programming languages and software design methodologies, and the underlying mathematics (discrete math and statistics in particular). Computer science grew out of mathematics as a discipline and is responsible for such things as the encryption and search and data storage techniques we are accustomed to today but which weren't known as little as 30 years ago. Software engineering is a somewhat more recent discipline that focuses on how to engineer (design, construct and maintain) software systems. The software engineer can be thought of as the engineer who applies the principles developed by computer scientists in making software systems that you can rely on. This person will know about the same amount of computer hardware as the computer scientist and the same amount of computer science principles as the computer engineer (perhaps a bit more) but will know more than either about the principles of software development (especially the more pragmatic aspects such as how to actually estimate costs and meet schedules how to test the software and how to design good user interfaces and make it maintainable). In a nutshell: the computer engineer builds the hardware, the computer scientist develops the algorithms and principles, and the software engineer builds the software systems. That being said, there is considerable overlap, primarily due to the desire on the part of academic institutions to keep up enrollments. In particular, many computer science programs teach a lot of software engineering. They often consider it a specialization within computer science, just as electrical engineers often consider computer engineering to be a specialty within their field, and some mathematicians consider computer science to be a specialty within their field. Now let's talk about computer programming. All three of the disciplines include computer programming and both computer science and software engineering consider it a fundamental skill of their discipline. Computer programming is one step of the larger process that the software engineer uses to build systems - rather as the framer performs one essential step for building a house. But just as framing is not the only skill needed to design, build and maintain a house, so too computer programming is not the only skill needed to design, build and maintain a complex software system. And just as a person who starts out as a framer may grow in knowledge and skill to become a homebuilder, so too a programmer may grow in skill and knowledge to become a more complete software developer. These analogies are not perfect, in part because people often use titles rather carelessly in these fields, For example, many use the term ""software engineer"" because they build software and that's their job title, but some would say that a software engineer must have an engineering degree or extensive engineering experience to claim that title (I tend to agree with that - too many software developers don't know what they don't know). It's rather like wanting your physician to have a medical degree, regardless of his or her skill in medicine. Computer programming was my entry point into the field of computing. I liked it and was good at it and went on to get advanced degrees in computer science (there was no software engineering back then and I preferred working with software rather than hardware). But my career took me well beyond programming. I got involved in both the theoretical aspects of computer science and the practical aspects of software engineering. I consider myself a software expert but haven't written a program in over 30 years - i've moved on to more responsible and comprehensive jobs such as designing large software systems, leading software projects with large numbers of people, and studying/developing ways to improve how we develop software. I hope that gives you a good perspective. Some will dispute some of my comments, but that's part of the nature of relatively new disciplines like these. My answer compares computer science, computer engineering and computer programming - because that’s what I originally answered. I've actually given many talks about this and participated in development of curricula (as well as program evaluation) for all of these (except it was software engineering rather than computer programming).

EDUCATIONAL REFORMS AND INTRODUCTION OF EAMCET.  Complete computerization of TDP’s organization structure and building an organizational structure village by village to form a stable second party. Chandrababu Naidu lead this project of computerization. He built a stable coalition of non-Congress parties at the state to give a clear two-party choice for the Telugu voter. 9. EDUCATIONAL REFORMS AND INTRODUCTION OF EAMCET.  Overhauled the entire state’s education syllabus for schools. He instituted statewide entrance examinations for all disciplines of higher education vis-à-vis Engineering and Medicine to name a few called EAMCET (Engineering and Medical Common Entrance Test). Students, based on the merit of their ranks obtained in these tests, could join any state college of their choice. 10. REFORMED THE RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION EMPOWERING RURAL YOUTH.  Andra Pradesh Residential Education Institutions Society founded in 1972 with two institutes was revamped under NTR’s government in 1988 with the passing of “G.O.Ms.No.363, Education (SSE.I) Department”. The institutions were founded to provide exemplary Rural and Socially disadvantaged youth with good primary education. NTR reforms to this institution expanded the number of facilities to 220, made them directly administered by Minister of Education, with a 22 member board to guide the institution. The institution especially APRJC( Andhra Pradesh Residential Junior Colleges) flourished and ended up sending five times more students to elite institutions such as IITs and BITS, making Andhra the only state that produces so many elite experts with Rural and Disadvantaged backgrounds. 11. CREATION OF SPECIAL COMMANDO FORCE FOR ANDHRA PRADESH.  NTR created a new commando force for the state and was very successful in combating naxalism both ideologically and militarily. Communal rioting in Hyderabad had been put to rest for good during his term. 12. NTR PUT AN END TO ANNUAL COMMUNAL RIOTING IN HYDERABAD DURING GANESH NIMMAJAN.  13. TOOK VIZAG STEEL PLANT LIVE.

These statues were later demolished by Telangana Agitators. 19. HE GUARANTEED ONE LIGHT BULB PER HOUSEHOLD TO GIVE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO THE LOWEST ECONOMIC CLASS OF RURAL ANDHRA PRADESH.  Those were days when villages and households didn’t have electricity and Mr.NTR gave electricity to every household and gave subsidy on electricity connections with one bulb. 20. HE REFORMED WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FROM MAJOR RESERVOIRS IN THE STATE BY GIVING FARMER ORGANIZATIONS (RAITU SANGAM) A SAY IN PLANNING.  21. BUILT 500,000 HOUSES TO THE POOR REPLACING THE THATCHED HOUSES.  He started a low-income housing project and built 500,000 houses in five years to replace thatched houses. The program continued for nine more years under his successor Chandrababu Naidu and added another 1 million homes. 22. ABOLISHED THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL CALLING IT AN UNPRODUCTIVE EXPENSE.  NTR abolished the legislative council calling it an un-productive expense to the exchequer, an un-elected un-representative body used to distribute political favors to out-of-work politicians. This was revived back in 2004 by Congress party. 23.

TOOK AGGRESSIVE STEPS AGAINST GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES TO MAKE THEM WORK.  NTR reduced the retirement age for government employees to 55 from 58. He used the National Security Act (NSA) to successfully crack down on the general strike called by government employee unions demanding bringing state government employees to central government employee pay levels. He used NGO (Non-Gazetted Officers) core to conduct exams on time across the state when state government teachers union called for a strike and threatened to ruin an entire academic year for the students. He furloughed the entire work force of Housing Construction Corporation a state government organization will fully pay till retirement claiming they did absolutely no work and that closing that organization would save money even if the state gave the employees free salaries. He claimed the secretariat employees got in the way of doing people’s business and moved his office to a private ashram outside the city. 27. IMPLEMENTED RESERVATIONS IN LOCAL BODIES OF ADMINISTRATION.  He successfully audited and brought the actual implementation of local body reservations program (for women, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) compliant with the law. Even though the law was passed 15 years before he came to office, it was never fully implemented. He successfully passed 55% reservations for backward castes in professional educational institutes but was rebuked by the High Court and was forced to withdraw the legislation. 28. INTRODUCED PRIVATE BUSES AND ASKED APSRTC TO COMPETE WITH THEM.  NTR successfully repealed the Andhra Safe Road Transport Act that nationalized private bus services saying he wanted to encourage small business allowing for private buses to compete with government road transport. He changed the mandate of government transportation to provide road service for under-served markets (villages). Every village got road service during his tenure. He was however unable to deliver on his promise to relax the 1976 Urban Land Ceiling Act and 1975 Agricultural Land Ceiling Act. He argued that the land ceiling act interfered with small local entrepreneurs but was providing case by case exemptions to the politically connected and multi-national-corporations. 29. OFFERED POWER TO FARMERS AT RS.50 PER YEAR.  NTR offered subsidized electricity to peasants (farmers earning less than Rs 12000/yr) at Rs 50/year for all the power used by a single pump set. 30. INTRODUCED SUBSIDIZED CLOTHING SCHEME FOR WOMEN.

He initiated the investment study for three ports in Nellore, Machilipatnam and Kakinada. He funded the construction of a rural road network, the total miles of road laid (22,000 miles) is more than half of all the state roads in existence till date. NTR’s upgradation of the road network and air connectivity to Tirupati and his key role in the National Front Government helped him push the funding of Radar Research Center in Tirupati with the mandate to provide outer atmospheric forecasting to significantly accelerate the weather forecasting capabilities of Andhra. Its three objectives were supporting Sriharikota into accelerating the launching of education satellites for rural education, enhancing water resource planning capability to reduce wastage of river water while providing reliable agricultural water supply and enhancing rural primary education with long distance learning programs using edusat and televisions is primary schools across rural Andhra. 33. INVITED EDUCATED YOUNG PEOPLE TO JOIN POLITICS AND MOLDED THEIR CAREER.  The Current CMs of Telugu States KCR and Chandrababu Naidu both nurtured under NTR as Ministers.

SHIFTED THE TELUGU FILM INDUSTRY FROM CHENNAI TO HYDERABAD.  He was known for distinguishing Andhra Pradesh from its parent, the erstwhile Madras state, and gave it a distinct identity. Under his tenure, he shifted the Telugu film industry from Chennai to Hyderabad, giving it a distinct identity from Tamil cinema and benefiting Telugu film producers and distributors and theater owners in Andhra Pradesh. 35. UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED THE TELUGU’S PRIDE SRI P V NARSIMHA RAO IN ELECTIONS, SO THAT A TELUGU MAN WILL BECOME PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA.  NTR extended un-qualified support (cleared an MP seat and did not field a TDP candidate) to Congress leader P. V. Narasimha Rao resulting in the latter winning from the state for the first time in his long career with a record majority. While the Congress wanted Rao to be a powerless un-elected (Rajya Sabha member) yes-man of the Nehru-Gandhi family, NTR actively made sure Rao had independent power. This earned Telugu people some influence even when Congress was in power at the centre. NTR formed an alliance with MP’s from Tamil Nadu claiming that his Telugu Ganga Project will give Chennai water, making the Telugu Ganga project an interstate centrally funded project. His personal rapport with Venkaiah Naidu of the BJP also helped his influence at the central level. Hence, irrespective of who was in power at the centre, NTR and TDP were very influential in making sure the poor in Andhra Pradesh had representation during his tenure. 36. FOUGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS TO TELANGANITES.  NTR followed in the foot steps of Kasu Brahmananda Reddy (Who passed GO 36 and resigned voluntarily to make way for P.V.Narasimha Rao – a Telanganite) and passed G.O 610 (requiring an audit and implementation of local reservations for telenganites) in December 1985 to be fully implemented by March 1986.He further fought a case against GO 610 in the high court and won!! the right for the chief minister to implement G.0 610. He followed up the court ruling with GO 674 (requiring repatriation of non-local government employees) to conform to GO 610. His support for P.V Narasimha Rao, as Prime Minister by helping him win outside Telengana as an MP were very instrumental is furthering his United Andhra Stand. 37. MADE USE OF HIS NATIONAL FRONT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND HELPED AP TECHNOLOGICALLY.  NTR played a crucial role in the National Front Government helped him push the funding of Radar Research Center in Tirupati with the mandate to provide outer atmospheric forecasting to significantly accelerate the weather forecasting capabilities of Andhra. Its three objectives were supporting Sriharikota into accelarating the launching of education satellites for rural education, enhancing water resource planning capability to reduce wastage of river water while providing reliable agricultural water supply and enhancing rural primary education with long distance learning programs using edusat and televisions is primary schools across rural Andhra. 38. CREATED MANDAL REVENUE SYSTEM AND UNIFIED THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES.  Brought all the Adminstrative offices to every Village calling it Prajala Vaddaku Palana ( Taking the Administration to People ). 39. REFORMED TIRUMALA TIRUPATI DEVASTANAMS ADMINISTRATION.  He reformed the administration of Tirupati and converted it into a modern tourist attraction. (Computerized registration and transparent board to run financial system.) 40. FORMED THE FIRST “ANTI CONGRESS” CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  NTR founded a national political coalition of non-Congress parties called The National Front in 1989 and was elected its founding president. The National Front came to power at the centre the same year. His brain child of a highly federal party formed by a coalition of all the locally popular secular regional parties was successful and signaled the end of single-party domination at the centre.

The highlights of his teaching are: He treats every student as a Newbie. He does not expect them to know anything.He makes sure every student is on the same page before moving to the next topic.He clears every student’s doubt during the lecture itself. He also clears students’ doubts any time the student wants it cleared. I have emailed doubts post midnight and have got answers for them within an hour.I recognized and appreciated these aspects when learning about plugins, apps and websites which enhance the value of the blog. I am a techno phobe who has previously struggled with technology and its features. I was very scared when I started using the apps and plugins because I was sure I would be confused. But now, even after just three classes I can handle the plug ins and apps better. I would even go to say if teachers in schools and colleges taught in the same way, the learning quotient of every class would go up. This was his delivery part!

He is aware of all the latest tools and methods in content writing.He also has a grasp on coding, analytics and other related topics.His syllabus is prepared to make your writing becomes profitable for you. Hence you learn about the tools, the keyword tactics and more that aren’t costly. Infact most don’t cost a dime but genuinely benefit you.What does this mean for you and me? It means we don’t have to put our money on expensive tools and sites to get the website running. We can instead save up all that money.Even if you want to buy a few expensive tools, you can do it after you start making money, thus ensuring you don’t run into losses. All this thanks to the knowledge gained in the IIM Skills Course.This was also very comforting for me. I was not very confident of using expensive tools properly, considering I am a technophobe. Had I been forced to buy them, I would have beaten myself up for not making the best of expensive tools. Instead, I could use simple tools that were free and was able to learn at my own pace.

It is not actually valuable but needs to be part of the Book to truly explain the valuable content and give it the credit it deserves. That being said, all I am focusing on when I read are the 10–50 pages worth of real value. I am looking for the ideas that will change my life, not the stories surrounding those ideas. I still read most of the books, and will sometimes remember something about the book when I read or hear something similar, but I mostly do not recall it. For me, the best way to remember more of any book I read is a very simple concept: Reading it again. The second time through a book is ALWAYS better than the first time through because you know what to expect. This makes you look more closely at the key concepts presented in these books and you will be able to connect everything in the book far easier. This will make you recall more in various ways: You have more areas to connect the important information to because you read between the lines.You have repeated the valuable content, making it more likely to be transferred to your long-term memory.You know what to look for and pay more attention when you know there will be less static.I often buy both the audio version and the written version of any book and will read the new book whilst also listening to the audio of the last book I read (Not at once but during the same day I may read the book and listen to the other book multiple times and freely switch between them). And I usually remember way more from listening to the book when I “read” it a second time, aka listening to the audio the first time. If that seems to much for you, then what I suggest is instead to take notes as you read and review them a week after having finished the book. Just like with anything else in life, the only way to really get good is to practice. In terms of books, this means reading it over and over again. And if you think there is no value in that I would suggest you look at Bob Proctors story. He is a multi-millionaire who says he has only read one book that he attributes all his success to.

Aside from the obvious physical presence of an interview. I would assume both a personal statement and interview would include telling personal stories. A2A: You are right in assuming that both the personal statement and the interview involve telling personal stories. Applications to other professional schools like business and law schools also involve personal statements, which provide a tiny glimpse of what make the applicants tick. But a career in medicine requires longer/deeper commitments and personal sacrifices that cannot be assessed on paper alone. Although intellectual ability and record of achievement are important factors, the personal interview gives the admissions committee another dimension by which to evaluate and understand other traits necessary to foster the development of a competent, compassionate, and responsible physician. The ability to communicate and interact, social consciousness, maturity, personal integrity, tolerance, service to others, and motivation for a career in medicine are among the characteristics sought. The other purpose of the interviews is to serve as a valuable recruitment tool, provide a resource for answering questions, and help the applicant determine whether the institution is right for him or her. It is a perfect time to ask questions. All interviewees have a chance at acceptance. Certain “failed personalities” stand out, and can harm the applicants. To stand out by merit is more difficult. But doing well will help in the stratification of admittable applicants come time to make final admission decisions. You will need to take good notes at the end of the day as memory fades after going through so many interviews. Ask the Experts: Preparing for Medical School InterviewsAvoid Common Mistakes on the Medical School Personal StatementCreate an Artful Essay for a Standout Medical School Application   Ask the Experts: Preparing for Medical School Interviews How important is the interview in getting accepted to medical school? Filomeno MaldonadoThe interview is very important in getting accepted to medical school. Although intellectual ability and record of achievement are important factors, the personal interview gives the admissions committee another dimension by which to evaluate and understand other traits necessary to foster the development of a competent, compassionate, and responsible physician. The ability to communicate and interact, social consciousness, maturity, personal integrity, tolerance, service to others, and motivation for a career in medicine are among the characteristics sought.Norma WagonerThe majority of medical schools in this country interview applicants. It is an expensive and time-consuming process. Thus, one can assume that the schools will value what their faculty and students learn about an applicant. The interview process, in many respects, is designed for the applicant as much as the school. Interviews serve as a valuable recruitment tool, provide a resource for answering questions, and help the applicant determine whether the institution is right for him or her. From the school's standpoint, a sizable component of the information gathering focuses on important character traits that include such things as integrity, commitment to medicine as a career, conscientiousness, strength of interpersonal skills, empathy, and reliability. The transcript gives some indication of academic strength, but some aspects of the interview will focus on problem-solving skills, research interests, creativity, and challenges that bring out one's best potential.What general tips do you have for preparing for the medical school interview? Filomeno MaldonadoWhen one is invited for an interview, it is especially important to prepare for the interview visit in three distinct ways: timeliness, attitude, and uniqueness.Once invited do not procrastinate, confirm your interview immediately. Communication with the medical school is critical. Know the interview schedule in advance if it is at all possible. If the entire schedule is not available, find out at least the time that your interview will begin. Allow some time to be flexible. In other words, give yourself the time you need to get your bearings, find parking, and find the location of the interview. After your interview, don't run out early. Leaving early may give the impression that you are not interested. Give yourself the opportunity to explore the institution or ask more questions. Also, avoid scheduling multiple interviews too tightly. Again, don't be late. Faculty's time is valuable!Attitude, attitude, attitude - it is all so important! SMILE! Be pleasant to everyone you encounter during the interview and be pleasant at all times even if there are snags in the schedule, etc. Also, remember that you are under observation the entire time you interact with the medical school.You bring your own uniqueness to the interview, and it is essential that that uniqueness gets you noticed. For the most part, people notice exceptional deviations from the normal pattern, therefore, it is important to be noticed for something positively. Leave your mark. While you are at your interview, add to the positive feeling that you have already worked so hard to create via your application. Bear in mind that people forget much of what they learn, and forget it quickly. Make certain that the interviewers remember you.Lastly, convey a healthy self-understanding and demonstrate humility. BE YOURSELF, for interviews can bring out betrayals of character. Be prepared to respond to all kinds of questions, many unrelated to the study of medicine. Similarly, be prepared not only to discuss your motivation for a career in medicine, but also any activities or experiences that are relevant to your goal, and times you have served others.Norma WagonerHere are 10 tips that I have recommended to applicants:Prepare a few questions for the interviewer, but don't ask about strengths and weaknesses of a program - be more creative.Keep a positive, upbeat attitude. Be open, honest and believe in what you say. Stay away from a recitation of prepared answers.Be aware of your body language as it conveys a significant amount of information regarding your confidence and demeanor. While cultures may differ with respect to greeting others, a firm handshake will be anticipated in most cases. It is important to look at your interviewer when responding to questions. Sitting in a comfortable position also denotes a level of confidence when communicating with others.Find a way to convey some uniqueness about yourself in the interview.If questions are focused on the academic record, don't make excuses - provide the best forthright information or explanation of personal circumstances that were occurring at the time. The interviewer knows you are human.If you are unable to make the interview, don't just fail to show up. Professional demeanor dictates your telling the school the circumstances that prevent you from attending.BE ON TIME. If you are uncomfortable on how to get to the interviewer, call and get directions. Remember that traffic or weather conditions can create difficulties, so be prepared.Treat everyone with respect - courtesy leaves a lasting impression.Dress appropriately. Select a comfortable outfit and wear it in advance of the interview to ensure that no problems arise.Relax and be yourself. Confidence, poise, and thoughtfulness are important ingredients of success.How prepared do I need to be to talk about different topics? Filomeno MaldonadoBe prepared to respond to all kinds of questions-many unrelated to the study of medicine. Why not talk about genetics, chemistry, or for that matter social issues? How extensively you discuss a different topic like genetics or a societal problem depends upon the context in which the question is asked. Take your cue from the interviewer. Bear in mind that there is a purpose to these kinds of questions, which is often to derive your breadth of knowledge on a variety of topics and your ability to articulate your point of view. This gives the interviewer insight into your ability to communicate and interact, which obviously has many implications. Below is an example of an interview question that targets social issues: ""If you were asked to give a keynote speech to your graduating class about societal problems, which problems would you focus on? What major points would you make?""Norma WagonerInterviewers are not likely to ask an applicant to recite the Henderson-Hasslebach equation, although for those interested in research, a question of why this equation is important in science could arise. In general though, the topics are more focused on learning about the applicant, his or her interests, challenges, commitment, and future plans. For the applicant, it becomes more valuable to convey information that reveals personal character traits, rather than the ability to demonstrate a depth of scientific knowledge across several disciplines. For those applicants who have extensive research backgrounds, being able to converse intelligently on their research projects is important. Many of the interviewers are engaged in research and often times the school tries to match the interviewer with an applicant doing similar work in order to get a more in depth analysis of the applicant's understanding of the project they are pursuing.What sorts of questions should I ask during the interview? Filomeno MaldonadoAsk questions that will help you become better informed about the school and its resources, accomplishments, and opportunities, such as inquiring about faculty, the student body, the research enterprise, internships, combined degrees, graduate studies, residencies, study abroad opportunities, health and fitness). If this is your first time in the community surrounding the medical school, inquire about local history and educational opportunities, particularly if you are married and have children. Ask about the location in proximity to other communities or major cities, the arts and culture, parks and recreation, and other attractions.Norma WagonerBe sure to read the information about the school on their web site, so that you don't ask questions about something for which information is readily available. Be creative in your questioning. A few examples might include: 1) ""If I were to ask the students in your first-year medical school class what they would like to change, what areas do you think they would emphasize?"" 2) ""How do you see the cost of a medical education affecting the students here?"" 3) ""What do faculty members feel is the most unique aspect of this medical school, such that they would encourage their sons or daughters to attend?""  Avoid Common Mistakes on the Medical School Personal Statement Many medical school essays start out the same way, so avoid common cliches to stand out. By Anthony Lafond, M.D., Contributor | July 7, 2015, at 10:40 a.m.  A good medical school personal statement can be the difference between an acceptance letter and a rejection. ​When I was applying to medical school, the MCAT still contained an essay portion, and a common maxim about the essay stated ""A good one may not get you in, but a bad one could keep you out."" This resulted in many students not working too hard on their essay techniques. Today the essay is gone, so students tend to focus on the numerical aspects of their applications, which are important. But some students focus on these to the detriment of their personal statement. Statistics from the Association of American Medical Colleges show that even students with stellar GPAs and top 5 percent MCAT scores can fail to gain admission. With the new MCAT, the association has highlighted its aim to widen the range of students admitted to medical school. The personal statement part of your application is the greatest opportunity you have to show schools why you should be admitted into medical school and what you will contribute to medicine – but there are a few pitfalls to avoid when crafting it. All students have their own reasons for wanting to be a doctor. The problem is most of these reasons are presented in a similar manner in personal statements. Many admissions committee members and advisers I have talked to report thousands of essays that all start the same way: ""I have wanted to be a doctor since,"" ""My dream of being a doctor began when I was a child playing"" or ""I have always wanted to make a difference."" While these stories are likely honest and heartfelt, the essays risk getting pushed to the side in favor of an applicant with a story to tell that complements his or her application. While it is important to give your reasons for pursuing medicine, a more personal and engaging essay will resonate with readers. I was ""lucky"" enough to grow up in a family with extensive experience with hospitals, surgeons and medicine because of myriad medical complications resulting from birth defects, diseases and disabilities. When it was time to write my personal statement, I had ample material. This need not be necessary. Think outside the box. Even nonmedical or academic experiences can inform your decision to become a doctor. You should also browse online through sample essays to both be inspired and learn which cliches to avoid. The next most important point to get across to schools is to show – not tell – them why you will make such a great addition to the ranks of physicianhood. This does not mean summarizing all of the achievements, honors and experience you painstakingly outlined in your centralized application. Simply giving an executive summary of your accolades is not personal and does not offer any insight into what you can bring to a school. [Learn about four common mistakes that lead to medical school rejection.] If you had a great volunteer experience, show how it affected your life. Did you participate in some exciting research? If you can build a story around it or offer some insight as to how it will inform your career as a physician, then by all means bring it in as a part of your essay. Otherwise, leave it where it belongs. As a physician, you will spend your whole life learning and a great physician is not infallible. Not everyone who is admitted to medical school had a perfect academic record. Many of my successful students were nontraditional applicants, struggled during freshman year or overcame some personal obstacle to continue through school. They used these experiences. Don't ignore potential red flags – embrace them so that you can put them in the best light possible. This does not mean justifying or excusing mistakes. You cannot undo the past, but even education gaps, a C grade or a lackluster semester is a learning opportunity. Academic adversity can be used to show medical schools how these experiences have made you a stronger candidate. You will likely be asked about anomalies during your interviews so it is better to address them head on. You would never rush through your MCAT prep or final exam preparation, so do not throw four years of hard work away by cranking your personal statement out in a week. Take your time. Start early. Begin by thinking about experiences, people and activities that have brought you to this point in life. Ask yourself, why do you want to be a physician? When studying for the MCAT, I advise all of my students to take a day off per week to avoid burnout. I encourage them to use this day to work on other, less tangible parts of their application – and premeds will know how their peers hate doing something that's not premed related. The online applications are standardized, so it is easy to determine what you need long before the application is due. Work on your letters of recommendation. Why not use this time to also get started on your personal statement? This gives you time to draft and rewrite, and seek out as many eyes as you can get on your personal statement. Do not just ask physicians and medical professionals to read it. Many of the people evaluating your applications never attended medical school and are not clinical professionals of any kind. Have family, friends and even friends of friends read your drafts. The more varied an audience you can engage, the better your story will be told. Unlike the old MCAT essay, a good personal statement can get you in.

Create an Artful Essay for a Standout Medical School Application Medical school hopefuls should be specific about past experiences and future career goals in their AMCAS materials. By Anubodh Varshney, Contributor | May 6, 2014, at 9:42 a.m.  Taking time to outline your career goals and reflect on why you want to become a physician will help you submit a compelling, specific AMCAS application. Completing the American Medical College Application Service application is a crucial step in the medical school admissions process. The centralized online service, provided by the American Association of Medical Colleges, allows first-year students to submit a single application and send it to the participating schools in the U.S. where they want to apply. With admissions committees sifting through thousands of applications each cycle, it’s important for applicants to do everything they can to stand out from the crowd in a positive way. Below are some strategies to help medical school hopefuls ​accomplish just that. 1. Take time for self-reflection: Having recently gone through the residency application process, I can tell you firsthand that the value of self-reflection cannot be overstated. Take some time to think about what you want out of your career as a physician. Explicitly identify and write out your career goals, as well as how you intend to get there. Some examples may include becoming a leader in academic medicine, focusing on medical education, building a career in global health or biomedical research or practicing in a rural community and helping the underserved. Also, use online sources, professors, mentors and peers to research what steps you need to take to achieve your goals. You should hopefully have at least an idea of the type of medical career you want. 2. Tell a story: Now that you have identified your goals, craft your AMCAS application​, personal statement and secondary essays such that they tie together and exemplify your passions. Every activity you list and describe in your AMCAS should demonstrate how it has helped you in your pursuit of your goals. Though schools will have different secondary essay questions, make an effort to integrate your story into each essay. Use your personal statement to tie together any seemingly disparate involvements described in your AMCAS and secondary essays. 3. Describe​ specific roles and actions:​ This ties back to developing and conveying your personal story. Make a conscious effort to describe your specific roles and the qualities you have that led​ you to success in these roles in the activities you list on your AMCAS profile. For example, rather than describing your role as recruitment chair for an organization as ""oversaw the yearly recruitment process and budget,""​ try something like ""worked to expand membership by 50 percent by increasing recruitment programming, developing a new marketing campaign and devising ways to expand the budget through novel fundraising efforts."" [Find ways to weave a story throughout your medical school application.] The second description is much more specific and will give the admissions committee a better idea of the leadership and motivation it took for you to succeed in your position. Remember, admissions committees read thousands of applications touting multiple leadership positions. Keep things specific and interesting in order to stand out. 4. Use the 80-20​ rule for your personal statement: Your​ personal statement should focus 80 percent on where you’re going in your education and ​20 percent on where you’ve been and how it relates to your​ academic and life journey. Keep the focus of your personal statement on the future, as the remainder of your application will detail your past accomplishments. Give admissions committees an idea of what you hope to contribute to society through a career in medicine. 5. Have your materials proofread by multiple people from various backgrounds: Admissions committees are often made up of more than just medical school professors. They may include administrators, students, residents and others. To ensure that your overall message is being portrayed clearly, have your entire application proofread by both medical and nonmedical professors, your English major friends, family and other peers. The more perspectives​ you can get, the better. As you begin to fill out your application for medical school, you will have to deeply think about and understand why exactly you are pursuing a career as a physician. From there, everything in your application should be centered on conveying this message clearly to admissions committees, while highlighting which experiences you’ve had that have led​ you down this road. If you can do just this, you will likely stand out from the thousands of other applicants who simply regurgitate their resume in their application, without giving any real substance to their goals and reasons for applying to medical school.

Image source Let’s be brutally honest - a startup doesn’t have the money-power required to actually REALLY vet a potential employee. If the startup is doing what it should be doing (i.e. focusing on making more money or getting more clients), a startup also does not have the luxury of time. Most startups need people to do something immediately. That is the only way that one can compete with a bigger company - be better, faster, and cheaper.Usually the funding of a startup comes from someone’s own pockets - family, friends, or hopefully early-stage-investors. All the funding comes with either trust, or demands - both can’t be played around with for the convenience of hiring.Startups hence can’t afford to hire people months in advance and hope that something would come along that suits the hiree’s talents.Most of the time, a startup hopes to hire people who are multiskilled in different areas, and those who ask for not-too-much money (at least at the beginning, till they have proven themselves). Most startups actually hire people for a short-time, after a very quick initial interview, and then test them on-the-job. This part can also be done by a software. But it is no secret that a human can’t take over the job and the experience of an HR - an HR is a person who has been trained to do a very specific job, and to do it very well. Hence, the best bet for any company is to hire a group of HR and let them choose a good well-qualified candidate. This is why HR departments exist in the first place. This part can only be done well by a human - at least with current technology. But of course, an HR’s time is spent on many other things as well:  The more the number of mundane tasks that the HR has to do, the lesser the time the HR has to focus on the things that really matter. This is why AI is such a good tool - it helps you focus where you need to focus, and it takes over the rest. But that’s all that it is - a tool. At the end, a human needs to sit across from the company’s managers and understand their needs and requirements. They need to sit and make a game-plan. You can’t hope for the same quality without putting in any human effort in HR. This is why big companies have started using services like Apifonica to Connect with customers across every channel and country | Apifonica. Apifonica talks to you, understands you requirements, and together with you comes up with a script that should be used to filter out new employees. Once this is done, they let the AI do the initial filtering. The AI calls tens of thousands of people - if required - for excessively cheap costs. This is important for startups who can reduce the filtering time, and still have thousands of potential leads. The time required on filtering each candidate is drastically reduced in this way. The more the number of candidates, the more the time-saving. This process is especially useful for companies who are hiring entry-level employees, as shown in this case-study where the recruiter was able to finally find the candidates that they needed after failing for months with traditional hiring processes (and losing thousands of dollars in the process).  This leads to a drastic reduction in cost entailed by the recruiter, as well as improves hiring efficiency. Because the script can be translated to hundreds of languages, the efficiency of hiring also improves drastically. What’s more, no preconceived biases on the part of the recruiter would hamper the recruiting process, ensuring that only the most qualified candidates reach the final round of the hiring process. Also, as every individual automated telephone call costs nearly nothing, you can give the candidate a lot more information and make sure that they are coming-in with a realistic understanding of what the job entails. That ensures better employee retirement, and further reduces the cost of hiring a new employee. So, what are the best HR softwares available for a fast growing Start-ups? A human, using AI.

So, the first name is YO YO HONEY SINGH. He is the one who brought and promote the Rap and hip-hop genre in India. Starting he did few Punjabi Films as a composer. After getting the success he started doing Rap in his own compositions with fellow Punjabi singers. Soon, he became a nationwide Star and even got the chance to work in Bollywood. He worked with stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar and many more.  I personally feel within a short period of time he got really huge success and here comes his downfall. He started demanding more money, he got into bad habits such as alcohol addiction, he even misbehaved with the audience in a few of his concerts. If you notice a few of his last songs, you will notice that in many of them he is just praising himself and showing how big he is, that shows his overconfidence. He was on top of his career but he didn't make it and to fight with his alcohol addiction and other medical issues he quit Industry for 1 year. Nowadays Bollywood is a big thing, you just can't quit and come back with a bang. There are many people to take your place and the same thing happened with Honey Singh. As he took a break other Rappers took his place such as Badshah, Raftaar, and Ikka etc. I was a fan of Honey Singh songs but it been almost 2 years he didn't release his any single. Out of all this young talent I personally like Badshah but sometimes I miss Honey Singh too. Badshah needs competition and I need good songs from both of them. The second name in my list is the comedy Kings KAPIL SHARMA. We all know that he started his journey from scratch and with his dedication and hard work he created history on Indian Television, even got the break in Bollywood but I feel this sudden success is all over his head and it's affecting his career. Kapil host a show called The Kapil Sharma Show and recently the soul of the show Sunil Grover left the show because of Kapil's behaviour band arrogance. This is the reason for him to quit the show--  The cast and crew of The Kapil Sharma Show were onboard a 12-hour flight from Melbourne to Mumbai on March 16. According to an eyewitness, who spoke to Hindustan Times, Kapil Sharma had consumed an entire bottle of Glenfiddich whiskey and was visibly drunk. His team began eating food which was served by the cabin crew soon after takeoff from Melbourne. This made Kapil furious who expected others to wait for him as he was still drinking. Kapil’s words, “Jab maine khana shuru nahi kiya toh tum logon ne kaise le liya khana?” were so loud that it made other passengers take note of the trouble. The eyewitness said that Kapil’s co-stars also became so uncomfortable that they preferred to return their half-finished food trays to the crew. Kapil continued to swear and a woman passenger, not part of his crew, complained of bad language. This is when Sunil Grover, who plays Dr Mashoor Gulati on the show, stood up and tried to take charge and calm Kapil down. According to the same Hindustan Times report, the eyewitness revealed that Kapil became so furious that, ‘he got up, took off his shoe, and hit Sunil. He even pulled Sunil’s collar, and repeatedly slapped him.’ The scuffle became so dirty that it could be heard by the passengers in the economy class too. Kapil’s team said they were too scared of Kapil’s behaviour. The eyewitness said that Kapil, on top of his voice, said, “Tum logon ko maine banaya hai. Sabka career khatam kar dunga. Sabko nikaal dunga main.”Apart from Sunil Grover, even Chandan Prabhakar and Ali Asgar have boycotted Kapil Sharma Show’s shooting for the second consecutive day. Kapil did not stop there. Pointing out at Sunil’s exit from Comedy Nights With Kapil, the drunk Kapil went on repeating to Sunil, “Gaya tha na tu toh. Aaya na wapas mere hi paas.” The cabin crew threatened Kapil of calling the security upon landing but to no avail. Kapil reportedly called Kiku Sharda and Ali Asgar daily wage earners. He also threatened to destroy their careers. “Main banaya hai tujhe. Hai Kaun tu? Sirf Rs 10,000 per day ka artiste,” he is reported to have told Kiku I really like both Honey Singh and Kapil Sharma and I hope they will learn from their mistakes and will have a successful life.

Read carefully if you want to know. I started freelancing back in 2013 and didn’t have any idea about it. I just jumped into the ocean and and tried to survive. But that didn’t work. But I got a new addiction of making DOLLARS online. Let’s skip my story. (You can read other answers of me for that) . . . What I did wrong when I started: I was focusing on money only. Here money mean small amount of short term money like $5, $10 or even $100.I was too restless that I used to ask clients to pay me before even I finish the work. The reason was “I used to think, the client will scam me and won’t pay me”. Because I didn’t know, who the clients are and what they do.I used to exchange my time with money. I was in writing, typing, data entry. I want to do more work to get paid more. That time my price was $3 for 500 words content. I failed because, whatever I do, I can’t write more than 1000–1500 words a day out of thin air. And there is always a difference between the writing of a student and a professional writer. And there is always a difference between an Indian writers and English speaking writers. You can’t beat them.I was about to quit not because I was getting work, but because at the end of the day I used to be exhausted. It took me several months to make $1000. It was not enjoyable. If you can’t enjoy your work, it’s better to leave that work. . . . But I didn’t quit freelancing. I quit the skills like writing, typing, editing where I had to do a lot of hard work to make only few bucks. . . . Then I tried web designing. Learnt it first. But it didn’t work out because, I couldn’t be a master coder anyway. There are agencies and giants out there in freelancing market. . . . As a lazy person finally, I started doing Packaging Designing. I liked it because it got a lot of life. It’s great and easy to work with colors than coding in a black background or writing on a white background. I already had a bit brand sense like if it is a girl product, I must use pink. If it is a boy product, I must use blue. It was damn easy for me. Look at the Diet Coke packaging below:  Image source- Google images It has only grey background, coke logo, some texts and that’s it. How much the packaging designer would have got paid? Leave it! . . . What I did right is: First, chose the best freelancing platform who I was comfortable with. I chose a skill which already have a great market. Increase in population demands more products. More products demands more packaging.I learned it. I got used to the industry standard platforms.I made a good portfolio.Made good communication with the clients.Every time I got a new project, I used to study the packaging of the similar products of big brands. HERE ARE SOME MASTER TIPS: Most importantly, don’t focus on money only. Don’t ask for small amount of money. Small amount money means, you have to go for more projects. More projects means more time and less quality. More distraction. So, ask for big amount of money. Stay focused and be loyal to the client. The client, who is running a million dollar business, he can definitely pay you few hundred/ thousand dollars more if you are committed to provide quality work. And high paying clients are always genuine and ethical.",2021-03-05T11:14:23.459Z,"How do I freelance in India? ",Quora

This interest was the result of being obsessed with planes and cars when I was 17 and about to join college. Little did I know that this is the thing I may have to do all my life. It wasn't like that I didn't enjoy studying mechanical engineering but I never got interested in practical part of it. During campus placements, I got job in core mechanical field and still working in it. I don't enjoy a single bit of what I do. I had interest in coding but due to lack of proper guidance and knowledge, I thought I'll never be able to grow in IT industry having mechanical engineering as background. I neither was nor is the type of person who liked doing repairing job, learning its designs, smelling lubricants' ordors all day, hearing above normal decibel level sounds and many a times working under hot sun. I like being(who doesn't??) in front of computer doing coding, enhancing my skills daily, probably increasing my market value, being in cities and having a white collar job. If we analyse at basic level, a mechanical engineering student studies fluid mechanics, theory of machines, production engineering, heat transfer, thermodynamics, advanced mathematics etc and on the other hand, a computer science student learns languages C, C++, Java, Python etc. Even if, being a mechanical engineering student, I work hard on learning my subjects, I may never use them in real life. And in professional life that hard work immediately looses its value. Its useful for teaching and research purposes only. On the contrary, the more I work hard in enhancing my coding skills, more will be my market value and it will be directly proportional to the money I will earn. Once out of college with a mechanical engineering degree, all the learning looses its meaning. Being a mechanical engineer, I can't even switch to other companies because salary hike in switching is almost negligible even after attaining sufficient skills. This is the biggest factor why mechanical engineers are on lower side of earnings. Secondly, there is very little scope of freelancing. That means, I have to be a maintenance engineer or a mechanical design engineer all my life and will always have to work for someone. And thirdly, getting a job in the heart of a city is almost impossible for a mechanical engineer. On the other hand, my friends from computer science who started their professional life with same salary as mine are now earning double or more compared to my present salary with international exposure that too sitting in an AC office with talented people (and hot chicks :P) around in an office building located mostly in metro cities. On a lighter note, why on earth would someone choose a career field where there are no girls throughout the college and professional life. Anyway, no matter how much I comfort myself by thinking that grass is always greener on the other side, but the reality is that they atleast have grass on their side and not the burnt bushes. Actually, India directly jumped from primary sector to service sector(IT) skipping secondary sector (industrial)in terms of its economic growth, so my dislike and lack of interest towards mechanical engineering may sound absurd in German or American context where career in manufacturing and mechanical engineering is still rated good owing to their continuous work towards research and development(R&D) and here, in India, we get stuck in maintenance & repair part only. So, the only option to get out of this was going for an MBA. It could have helped me in changing the career direction but I didn't do it because of financial constraints. This is the biggest career regret I can think as of now. For aspiring engineers, Mechanical Engineering is NOT an evergreen branch, so go for mechanical engineering only if you have an exceptionally high interest in it. 1) Opted Mechanical Engineering instead of Computer Science.2) Not doing MBA.

Applying them to dynamically filtered subsets seems to be the point where most rookies stumble.The statistics and logic behind machine learning algorithms. If you cant explain it in English, you don’t really know it. Sure you can apply the library functions, but it will be harder to explain your models or even tweak parameters for corner case scenarios.Domain:Try to pick up functional domain language by asking Qs from seniors, reading books and newspapers and applying common sense. Don’t look down at non-technical folks, like sales, accounting or marketing. These groups are often the best resources because they are closest to money and customers.You’ll be a better data scientist if you know how the business works, how revenue is generated, and deeply understand what problems you are being asked to solve (and why).Become better at asking probing Qs. Don’t just take people’s literal requirements as the Bible. Sometimes people make incorrect correlations between the requirements they provide and the question they really want to solve. So ask even if you think you will look foolish.The list seems small, but it does take some time to learn them all.

The field of software development suffers from what I call “job title inflation”. In other words, many who have the job title “software engineer” are not true software engineers, but rather programmers (or perhaps a little more). So what is software engineering? It is doing all the things necessary to produce high quality software that someone can depend on. One way to explain what all of those things are is to see what the experts in the field say. In approximately 1998, a group of organizations including the two major technical societies in computing (the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE computer society), along with about a dozen major corporations that develop really high quality and highly complex software initiated an effort to define what a true software engineer needs to know. After several years of intensive work, this effort resulted in a document entitled the “Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge” (often referred to as the SWEBOK). That guide is now in its third version after having had extensive review and revision by over 1000 experts around the world. It is maintained by the IEEE Computer Society and can be purchased from them as a printed book or downloaded as a PDF for free at www.swebok.org. The SWEBOK defines 15 knowledge areas that are considered essential for true software engineering. Each of those, in turn, is divided into a dozen or so more detailed topics. One of those 15 is software construction (programming) and the others are things like software requirements, software design, software configuration management, software testing, software quality, software project management, and many others. The SWEBOK document also has an excellent list of reference material. There’s quite a lot involved in true software engineering. A review of the SWEBOK document is a good place to start if you are trying to understand all that is involved in actually doing real software engineering. But that’s just the basic knowledge. There is also the issue of experience, both in developing software and in understanding the applications for which one write software. Note that true software engineering enables one (or, more often, a team of software engineers) to develop a highly complex software package such as that required for an air traffic control system or a nuclear power plant or a modern aircraft or automobile. An example illustrating a project of that scope would be very large. Below I have provided a simplified example of what it would take for engineering the software of a somewhat smaller software application. It is based on several products I worked on during my career: a navigation system for a ship,a software package that was a precursor to modern word processing systems,a radar system for commercial helicopters,an operating system for a supercomputer,and several others.Below, I have listed the activities that a software engineer performs when developing a large, truly professional, high quality, software application. Note that although I have listed the activities of software engineering in a particular order, many of them occur concurrently with each other and, often, you do some of them repeatedly. Understanding the problem to be solved. This often requires extensive knowledge of the application domain. Software for navigating ships or aircraft requires much different knowledge than software for solving business applications, which in turn requires much different knowledge than software for a safety-critical medical device, which is far different from software for a smart phone application.Understanding the available technologies. What hardware devices will be involved and what will they be able to do and what will software need to do. This is sometimes called systems engineering and, to the extent that it is needed, it requires engineers who know multiple technologies. Early in my career, individuals who did this work presented their results to the software team, but as software became more and more important in the design of complex systems, software engineers became more and more responsible for and involved in this activity.Making decisions about what software development tools, languages and development methodologies make the most sense. This is an analysis and planning activity that requires knowledge of multiple languages, tools and methodologies. You don’t just take your favorite programming language and go with it. For example, you may be using a computer for which your favorite language has no compiler or your favorite language may be ill suited to the application.Participating in decisions about which parts of the software should be developed by which organizations (in the case of a large project, there may be multiple organizations involved). These organizations may not all be part of your company. If some of the software is to be acquired from or developed by another organization, you may also need to get involved in establishing and negotiating the contractual obligations and other requirements you will impose on those suppliers.Deciding on how the software will be broken up into independent packages, often known as “configuration items”. I.e., what will the major parts be.[Although not a software engineering function per se, you might also be required to help write proposals to potential customers, explaining how you will develop your software and why yours is an appropriate approach for the specific application. Often, large projects are competed for by different companies that have the appropriate expertise.]Determining the requirements for the software and how they trace to higher level system level requirements. Typically, requirements are first established by customers or by higher level engineers who define them in their own terminology. The software engineer must translate them into terminology that makes sense to software developers. Often, this involves a lot of discussions and even debates with customers and others to iron out details and determine exactly what is required. A common problem is for customers not to really know what they want or, on a big project, for different parts of the customer’s organization to have different opinions as to what the requirements should be. It is also essential to establish a requirements change management approach. Requirements are frequently changed (usually by customers but occasionally by engineers who realize that the original requirements are too costly or technically infeasible). You need to be able to understand the consequences of proposed changes on software cost and schedule so that when changes are proposed you can let decision makers such as customers or higher level managers know the consequences (typically, changes require schedule slips and cost increases).Developing a comprehensive plan for developing the software. Taking into account such issues as available budgets, time constraints and schedule goals, risks, and available resources, one must devise a plan for how to develop the software. This helps you to know how many people and what equipment you need as well as how much money and time you need. Although a good plan requires you to have a reasonable understanding of the requirements, you often must do much of your planning as part of step 6 (above), because customers often decide which contractor to use based on the quality of their software development plans.Developing the architecture of the software. This actually begins at steps 4 and 5 (above), but you have to flesh out a lot of detail here.Developing the detailed design of the software. This is where you get to all of the really fine but very important details.Writing the code. At last, in step 11, you start programming.Devising an effective integration and test plan for the product and the software. This also begins earlier, but after the programming starts the integration and test activities become important. On a large project, it is critical to have thought this out well.Conducting the integration and test processes and, when problems are found, figuring out what went wrong and why and re-doing whatever of the previous steps need to be re-done in order to fix the problems.Determining how the product will be delivered, installed, maintained, and upgraded once in the customer’s environment. Then implementing whatever tools and capabilities are needed to make that happen. (Think about all the things needed to make software updates function properly, for example.)Determining what quality criteria are appropriate for the product and implementing various reviews, inspections, and other mechanisms for evaluating quality and assuring that quality standards are met. [This activity also begins a lot sooner and in parallel with much of the above.]Establishing and maintaining a configuration control approach for the project and implementing that approach. This involves things like naming conventions for software versions and software components, methods of authorizing changes and making sure that changes don’t overlap each other and cause problems, making sure that the right version of each component is the one used for each version or release of the product, etc.Documenting many things along the way so that those who must maintain and support the product after you have moved on can understand all aspects of all of the above.There’s a lot that I’ve left out of the above, some of which might only apply to some projects. A small project such as a web site or a typical smart phone app might not require as extensive an approach as I’ve described here, but you asked about what software engineering is and I thought I would give you an idea of what real, professional software engineers spend their time doing. I should also mention that some methods of software development, such as “agile” methods, are highly iterative, meaning they go through much of the above repeatedly, although not necessarily with a high degree of discipline and rigor for each iteration. I should also mention that a really big software engineering project involves a large team of people and people management skills are going to be required of all participants, especially team leaders and others with higher levels of responsibility.",2021-03-05T11:17:23.709Z,"What is software engineering and some examples?

It is a career option that offers great flexibility, money, and satisfaction. Also as the world is getting more and more wired, thanks to computers and Internet, there are more and more people choosing technology to make their life easier and efficient. So you'll always be in a job. CompTIA (Computing Technology Industry Association) Certifications 1) CompTIA A + Preparing for this certification involves learning computer hardware, troubleshooting, and assembling and re-assembling a computer. Normally an individual would attend an institute level training and learn all the essentials that are required for the certification. Passing this certification requires you to clear two exams. The first one is generally known as CompTIA+ Essentials and the second one as CompTIA A+ Practical Application. After completing this certification you can get an entry-level hardware or a field technician job. 2) CompTIA N+ After CompTIA A+ certification people normally go for N+ certification. CompTIA N+ certification requires in-depth knowledge of the basics of networking, various network topologies, understanding various networking equipment, network management and efficient ways to handle a small computer network. A number of people go for the CompTIA N+ certification; not the A+ certification. While having both A+ and N+ really helps. 3) CompTIA Linux+ If you would like to start your career in Linux then consider this one. This is definitely not an entry-level certification but considering you as an individual who is looking to make a career in the IT industry having this at the back of your mind will not do any harm. Not many people start with Linux because it is very much command driven and learning and working with command line utilities is a bit difficult. The job market for Linux is still unsaturated and with the right skills and knowledge you could land up with the highest pay-scale compared to your friends. CompTIA certification is considered as an industry standard which means employers look for people with those certifications. Also, all the above certifications do not retire, that is to say, they do not need you to re-certify the same. There is generally a re-certification rule but not with CompTIA certifications. Cisco Certification 3) CCENT (Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician) If you want to make your career in the networking industry then passing the CCENT certification is your ticket to enter the field. Cisco is the leader in the computer networking industry and Cisco certifications are always in-demand. Requires only one exam and generally, the next step is to get CCNA certified. Re-certification should be done in every three years to retain the credentials. Microsoft Certification 5) MCTS (Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist) There are no prerequisites for this one as well. Though Microsoft recommends having at least some work experience before getting certified, it is common to get MCTS certified without having real-world experience. With examinations on Windows 7, Vista which you may have used daily you can certainly get this certification very easily. Getting MCTS credentials requires to pass one to three exams - meaning if you clear one of the exams you get MCTS and after giving five of the exams in the series you would be MCITP. There is a wide range of specialization that you can opt for, hence the word one to three exams. Such as getting "" Enterprise Desktop Support Technician on Windows 7"" requires two exams whereas for "" Server Administrator on Windows Server 2008"" you'll have to clear three exams. Expect to work on tier 1 desktop level jobs. Those were the top five best entry-level certifications that are and will always be in demand. No certification can ever guarantee a job, but with the right skills and knowledge you will go a long way, and certifications do just that.

Experts say that if automation is not planned well and addressed holistically, it can lead to disaster without a doubt, affecting 60% to 70% of the current jobs. They will either get marginalized or eliminated once and for all. It is also said that automation is threatening 69% of the job market in India, while it’s 77% in China, according to a World Bank research. The fear that AI will replace endless jobs can be justified to a certain point but it’s not completely true. I believe that it’s not just the threat that AI carries with it but it’s also about weaving technology to create more jobs. Technology leaders are drumming up the thought that the emergence of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and automation is going to be the new drivers of employment. This era of digitization and automation will create newer career choices for IT professionals. According to the report 'How Automation is Changing Work Choices' the new job roles that will dominate the IT workforce are within digital domains such as Big data, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity etc. While there is a risk to jobs due to these trends, the good news is there are also a lot of new jobs opportunities that are getting created in areas like cybersecurity, cloud, big data, machine learning and AI. It is clearly a time to pivot career for IT professionals to make sure they are where the growth is. There are other industries that have also started to look from the optimist’s viewpoint embracing the fact that AI and automation can save them a lot of cost by creating an increased demand of products within a shorter period of time, generating more profit and paying higher wages to the employees. Based on the landmark 2013 study that inspired “Will Robots Take My Job?” we’ve rounded up some of the marketing and sales roles most likely to be replaced by robots, bots, and AI in the next few years. This study analyzes the likely probability that a job will be replaced by automation and computerization -- based primarily on the level of routine a job has and the specialized training and social intelligence required to complete it. It’s not an exhaustive list, but it gives you an idea of what your life could look like in a few years. 10 Careers AI Will Replace (and 10 That Are Safe) Most Likely to Be Replaced 1) Telemarketers Likelihood: 99% Why: You probably already receive robo-calls on behalf of various products and services, and career growth in the telemarketing space is expected to decline by 3% by the year 2024. This is largely in part because of the requirements to be successful: Unlike other sales roles, telemarketers don't require a high level of social, or emotional, intelligence to be successful. Think about it -- are you likely to purchase from a telemarketer? Conversion rates for direct telephone sales are typically less than 10%, making this role a ripe opportunity to be automated. 2) Bookkeeping clerks Likelihood: 98% Why: Jobs in this role are expected to decline 8% by 2024, and it's no surprise why -- most bookkeeping is becoming automated, if it hasn't been already. QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Microsoft Office already offer software that does the bookkeeping for you that's much more affordable than a person's salary, so it's no surprise this job has such a high probability. 3) Compensation and Benefits Managers Likelihood: 96% Why: This one is surprising because the job growth is supposed to increase 7% by 2024. But just because there's demand doesn't make you safe from automation. As companies grow in size -- especially across multinational markets -- a human and paper-based system can present more hurdles, time delays, and costs. Automated benefits systems can save time and effort for providing benefits to large numbers of employees, and companies like Ultipro and Workday are already being widely adopted. 4) Receptionists Likelihood: 96% Why: Pam predicted this back on The Office, but in case you're not a fan, automated phone and scheduling systems can replace a lot of the traditional receptionist role -- especially at modern technology companies that don't have office-wide phone systems or multinational corporations. 5) Couriers Likelihood: 94% Why: Couriers and delivery people are already being replaced by drones and robots, so it's only a matter of time until this space is dominated by automation altogether. At the same time, this space is expected to grow by 5% by 2024, so it might not happen as quickly as you think. 6) Proofreaders Likelihood: 84% Why: Proofreading software is everywhere -- and we use it a lot here at HubSpot. From Microsoft Word's simple spelling and grammar check to Grammarly and Hemingway App, there are a lot of technologies out there that make it easy to self-check your own writing. 7) Computer Support Specialists Likelihood: 65% Why: The field is projected to grow 12% by 2024, but with so much content on the internet with instructions, step-by-step guides, and hacks out there, it's no surprise companies will rely more heavily on bots and automation to answer support questions from employees and customers in the future. 8) Market Research Analysts Likelihood: 61% Why: Market research analysts play an incredibly important role in the development of messaging, content, and products, but automated AI and surveys can compile this information more and more easily. GrowthBot, for example, can conduct market research on nearby businesses and competitors with a simple Slack command. 9) Advertising Salespeople Likelihood: 54% Why: As advertising shifts away from print and TV and towards web and social media landscapes, people simply don't need to be managing those sales for marketers who want to buy ad space. More social media platforms are making it easy for people to buy space through free application program interfaces (APIs) and self-serve ad marketplaces to remove the salesperson and make it faster and easier for users to make money -- and that's reflected in the projected 3% decline in the industry. 10) Retail Salespeople Likelihood: 92% Why: If you've visited a mall, car dealership, or furniture store lately, you might not have been assisted by a salesperson at all from start to finish. Companies are democratizing the shopping experience with features like self-checkout, and the modern buyer is much more internet-savvy and more likely to do internet research and make a buying decision on their own. Most Likely to Be Safe (For Now) 1) Human Resources Managers Likelihood: 0.55% Why Not: It's kind of in the name -- but your company's Human Resources department will likely always need a human at the helm to manage interpersonal conflict with the help of non-cognitive and reasoning skills. The field is projected to grow 9% by 2024 as companies grow and need more robust structures for supporting and helping employees. 2) Sales Managers Likelihood: 1.3% Why Not: Sales managers need a high level of emotional intelligence to hit their quotas each month, network and collaborate with customers, and motivate and encourage the larger sales team. Managers also have to analyze data and interpret trends, and the high levels of intelligence required -- plus the constant need to adapt to new situations -- makes this role safe from automation. 3) Marketing Managers Likelihood: 1.4% Why Not: Marketing managers have to interpret data, monitor trends, oversee campaigns, and create content. They also have to nimbly adapt and respond to changes and feedback from the rest of the company and customers, making this another human-forward career AI isn't quite ready to replicate. 4) Public Relations Managers Likelihood: 1.5% Why Not: Successful PR managers rely on a network of relationships and contacts to procure press placements and buzz for the companies they represent, making this another completely safe role. PR managers who have to raise awareness around an issue or mission need a particularly human touch to raise funds or get people to participate in a campaign, too -- and jobs are expected to grow 7% by 2024. 5) Chief Executives Likelihood: 1.5% Why Not: It's nearly impossible to automate leadership -- after all, it's hard enough to teach it. Chief executives have to inform broad strategy, represent companies' missions and objectives, and motivate huge teams of people working for them. Companies may answer to stakeholders and boards of directors, who likely wouldn't want a robot giving them an earnings report, either. 6) Event Planners Likelihood: 3.7% Why Not: Event planning is a growing field, and if you ask anyone on our events team here at HubSpot, whether you're planning an event for employees, customers, or an industry event with tens of thousands of attendees, the planning process has many, many moving parts involved. Planners have to coordinate and negotiate with vendors, contractors, and freelancers to make things come together, and the organizational and people skills involved will make this another near-impossible role to automate. 7) Writers Likelihood: 3.8% Why Not: (I breathed a sigh of relief on this one.) Writers have to ideate, create, and produce original written material. AIs can do some of this with title suggestions, writing prompts, and automated social media messages, but blog posts, books, movies, and plays will likely be written by humans for the foreseeable future. 8) Software Developers Likelihood: 4.2% Why Not: Software engineering and development is hard enough for human beings to do, and the time and skill investment needed to create applications, software, and websites will be tough to replicate -- especially since developers need to execute perfectly to create great products for customers. The field is expected to grow by 19% by 2024, so if you're a software developer, you're sitting pretty for now. 9) Editors Likelihood: 5.5% Why Not: While some of the load can be lifted from editors with the automated proofreading technology mentioned previously, editors have to review writers' submission for clarity, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and originality. While there is some software that can spot-check for clarity and scan for plagiarism, the editor role must be carried out by a human in order to read work as another human would. 10) Graphic Designers Likelihood: 8.2% Why Not: Although there are some AIs taking small (and somewhat creepy) steps in the graphic design space, graphic design is both artistic and technical, making it an ideal role for a human being to carry out. Like writing, all work needs to be original and created to the client's wishes, so graphic design needs to be created with a human artist and editor all-in-one. The Bottom Line Is Let us not forget the fact that when automation kills few jobs, it creates others. We cannot all be pessimists about the changes which AI is bringing but should be ready to recover from the short-term adjustment period that our economy may face in the coming future. Of course, it is predefined that AI will make some labor obsolete but we cannot hide from the bigger picture of the potential benefits that AI will bring along, easing its way into the economy retraining humans for jobs overlooking a new set of activities. This technology is giving a new meaning to businesses and our lives. Can’t wait to see how this technology unfolds in the coming years. You may have heard about the theory that “rise of the robots” is deemed to end almost half of the industry’s workforce around the world. Experts say that if automation is not planned well and addressed holistically, it can lead to disaster without a doubt, affecting 60% to 70% of the current jobs. They will either get marginalized or eliminated once and for all. It is also said that automation is threatening 69% of the job market in India, while it’s 77% in China, according to a World Bank research. The fear that AI will replace endless jobs can be justified to a certain point but it’s not comp Continue Reading",2021-03-05T11:20:01.569Z,"What jobs will be taken by AI in the near future? ",Quora

It’s good as it will take your Java development career one step ahead. Well, I’d like to submit a response to this question to the best of my knowledge. Java is no doubt an ever-demanding programming language. Oracle offers a number of certifications to validate and recognize the skills of Java developers. Getting an Oracle Java certification is not hard but yes you need to follow the right process. Simply put, becoming an Oracle Certified Java Developer is basically a five-step process, these are: Choose a Java certification and know about the required examsRegister for the exam and schedule the examUnderstand the basic exam detailsPrepare well for the exam objectivesAppear for the exam and clear the testHere, in the following sections, I’ll provide a detail description of these steps. Choose a Java Certificate programThe initial step is indeed to select the certification. For beginners, OCAJP is the first step. Those who are already OCAJP certified have to go with OCPJP. One must possess knowledge of the exam number for the concerned certificate. For example, exam number 170-850 is meant for OCAJP for Java SE 5/6. Exam number 1Z0-803 is meant for OCAJP for Java SE 7. Exam number 1Z0-808 is meant for OCAJP for Java SE 8. Exam number 170-809 is meant for OCPJP for Java SE 8. Exam number 1Z0-815 is meant for OCP Java SE 11 Programmer I, and 1Z0-816 is meant for OCP Java SE 11 Programmer II. So, the very first step is to choose the right certification as per your knowledge and experience. Register for the examAfter selecting a Java certification, you will have to register for an exam. In this context, the first one has to buy an exam voucher and fix the date for the exam and test center as per his convenience. It is here to note that an examination voucher is valid for six months from the day of purchase. The voucher expires or gets useless otherwise. Hence, it is recommended that one should prepare well and schedule the date only after being confident enough. The examination center is also decided by the concerned candidate. One must note that the Oracle Testing Centre only delivers the tests. It means one can buy vouchers over the web through Oracle and register as well. There, one can schedule the exam as well. Through the process, an Oracle Web Account with an Oracle Testing ID will be created. Also, an account at Pearson VUE will be created. Get familiar with the exam detailsSo, when you have registered for the exam, it is the time to understand the exam details before moving to the preparation. It’s even better if you have already started your exam preparation. Consider you will start with the OCAJP certification. In general, you will get 150 minutes to complete the entire set of questions. There will be around 77 questions in total for the examination. To clear the examination, one needs to fulfill the minimum required score. One has to score 65% for clearing the examination. This means out of 77; one has to give a minimum of 50 correct answers. In general, there are 3 formats in which the examination is conducted. The first type is the multiple choices, which are mostly for the OCAJP exam, tests meant for associates, as well as expert and professional. The other type is project-based, where an assignment is assigned. In general, master certification tests are conducted in this format. Finally, the essay fort is where one has to answer questions based on the assignments submitted. OCMJEA is conducted in all these formats. Rest, I’ll suggest you visit the official certification page for the certification you have chosen and registered for, to get the exam details. Prepare for the exam with a focus on the exam objectivesThis is the most tricky and strategic part of the entire process but is equally important. You first need to understand the exam domains and topics covered in each domain, as according to them only preparations have to be made. For instance, for the OCAJP exam, for which I had to cover topics like data types, arrays, etc. It is always advised to decide well and select the subjects one by one for the preparation. For this, check the official website and follow a preparation guide. Thus, prepare well and get ahead to take the exam. You can take online courses and practice tests to prepare and test your preparation level. You can also join study groups and discussion forums to solve your queries. Appear for the exam and get your resultsSo, if you are confident enough, it’s the time to appear for the exam on the scheduled date. The good news is that the examination hall is not as scary as it is in general. There will be one computer and the candidate. However, this also means that there is no chance of any malpractice. Just be calm during the exam and do your best. The results of multi-choice tests are immediately made out, post completion of the test. In the other two cases, that is assignment based and essay; one has to keep patience for some time. One can check the result, as well as regarding certification, through the Cert View site of Oracle. It is here to note that the Cert View site is the management site for whole types of Java certifications. However, even if the result is immediately declared (and you cleared), but the certificate is not assigned immediately. Oracle has to grant the certificate, the notification of which is sent through the mail. In general, it is delivered in certificate format or electronic mode. However, one may also opt for having the certificate printed; in this regard, one has to request Oracle about the same, details of which are given in notification mail. So, it’s all about the process of becoming an Oracle Certified Java Developer.

I went on to win not one but two California State Fair awards in the 8th and 9th grades of Junior High School for my residential drafting ability plus my ability to build a Type-V house model at 1-inch to 1-foot scale. I had won a Blue and a Red ribbon in the most populist state in America and I had yet to set foot in high school. My high school experience was must less impressive as it was pretty clear that the photography teacher that taught drafting at my high school sadly did not know more that me about the topic. My learning curve was zero but fortunately for me I was told by the various colleges that had Architecture programs, thatI now needed to learn more about art and freehand sketching and that was big news to me. Whereas I was already a proven expert in drafting at a very young age, drawing “freehand” was a completely different animal that they strongly encouraged me to explore. To this day I would say that I could draw anything that is not alive, like people,animals and plants. I was “eyes wide open” when I showed up as a Freshman or 1st year at USC in 1987 and fortunately I had gone thru a Summer Architectural program at Woodbury University the year prior, so I knew that USC was the Best program for me. I had learned that any Architectural University program in California was going to be a huge challenge. What I was also prepared for was that Architecture was a very demanding and time consuming major. Design studio alone was 4 hours a day,3 days a week and that was just one class which does not count all of the additional hours daily and weekly required to complete all of the design assignments. Unlike all of the other majors on campus, a Bachelors ofArchitecture degree is a 5 year program so you get to see your other friends graduate and then stick around another year and pay another year of tuition,fees and rent near campus as your friends are already starting their careers making money in the real world. Also unlike other majors, you start Architectural design classes from day one and have to finish 10 semesters of design. You don’t have luxury of taking non-major general education course first for two years and then your core courses, thus the acceptance of transfer students into Architecture school was rare, I can only think of a few. At USC, I loved the diversity of students that were attracted there, not only racially but also globally. I graduated with students from all over Asia, Europe, and even Pakistan and Argentina. I never found Architecture students to be highly social creatures as the major tends to attractive more introverts than extraverts. USC was a very competitive and intense architecture program. It was hard to get in and harder to finish. Everyone seemed to have some level of design talent and there was always an informal competition within the design studio when our projects were presented weekly. The stronger students were always trying to out do one another. Like all competition, it made everyone a better designer. Architecture students “live” in the design studio and would sometimes set up sleeping cots to rest in and the architecture building is the only academic building on campus that had showers. Pulling all-nighters was rather common through out the semester, not just during midterms and finals week. I would have to do that at least a few times each semester,thus I always felt that we made for great roommates in college as were seldom at home. We had classes until 6PM at night almost daily then I would break for dinner somewhere on campus and then head back to the design studio until midnight, so yes, I rarely saw my roommates. The first five semesters at USC all of the students did the same design projects and studio sizes were typically 15-16 students for each design professor. It got a lot more interesting the second semester of 3rd year when you were introduced to what they called ""Topic Studios"" for the next 4 semesters. This is where you could truly tailor your design education to match your interests, so at the beginning of the semester all of the qualified students would gather to hear the professors explain what topic studio they were going teach that semester, such as multi-family housing, hotel/resort, office towers, etc. Students would submit their first, second and third choices and students with the most seniority got first choice. The final tenth semester was your thesis design class which you got to pick your own design project after taking a thesis prep course and creating and submitting a very detailed book of research on your design topic of choice. Since USC Football is such a huge deal, I would always get out and attend all of the 6-7 home games at the Coliseum and I might take that whole Saturday night off to find some fun but I was back in the design studio or computer lab each and every Sunday. You just never felt free to hang out and be a regular college student as there was always an assignment due. It was such a huge relief to graduate as I now had so much more control of my time and schedule. I recall at the end of one semester that met with my design professor to challenge the “B+” I was given but she said there was one week when I only came to class with 2 designs for an assignment and she expecting three, thus I was not deserving of an “A”. Architecture students are not necessarily the brightest ones on campus but they are the most creative and hard working. Dropping out is common as it and some professors seem to take pride in thinning down the herd. First year always started with 120 students and our class of 1992 graduated just over half of those students 5 years later. When I was in Architecture school from 1987-1992, computers were common but not for design work. AutoCAD version 10 was out but not taught at USC and that is what most job openings at the time required, so I had to teach myself after graduation. USC did offer a“computers in Architecture” class that I took but it turned out to be a Fortran computer language. That was a whole lot of effort to draw lines on a screen. Shortly after I graduated USC had computers at each students desk throughout the architecture school, so I just missed that huge upgrade in technology on campus.

In this case, I’m describing the job of an English Literature and Linguistics professor at a small liberal arts college, where I teach a 4/4 load, and I am mostly responsible for teaching and mentoring students rather than doing cutting-edge research and publication. I’ll talk a bit about R1 researchers in my answer, though. Morning: I typically get up around 6:00 a.m. putter around a bit with breakfast, then, shower, dress, and walk to campus (about 1.5-mile round-trip each day). Once there, I teach my first class—usually at 8:00 a.m., but sometimes at 7:00 a.m. if the Department needs someone in that slot. This is by choice, as I’m a morning person, generally, and I volunteer for early classes so that my colleagues who commute don’t have to get up so early. The class will be 75 minutes long if it’s a TR (Tuesday/Thursday) class, or 50 minutes long if it’s a MWF class. There’s a brief 10 or 15-minute break, then I usually teach a second class right after that—though some semesters I may not teach again until noon or 1:00 p.m., depending on how the schedule works out. In the fall, I tend to have two classes for freshman composition writers, plus one class in British Literature survey up to 1800 for the English majors, and the last class is usually either Historical Linguistics (History of the English Language) or Advanced Grammar for Linguistics majors. If one of my colleagues is on sabbatical, I might instead do her Shakespeare class that fall, though it’s not my strongest field. In the Spring semester, I typically teach two General Education surveys of Western literature (Greco-Roman up through the end of the Renaissance), one class on Advanced Research for the Honors program, and then a fourth class of my choice—typically something medieval like Chaucer, Arthurian legends, Old Norse sagas, literature of Courtly Love, etc., but sometimes Greco-Roman mythology, the Inklings, or Science Fiction novels if a group of students seem interested. On MWFs, I typically have finished my classes by 10:00 a.m., and then I have office hours from 10:00-a.m. until 2:00 p.m. each day, often eating lunch in the office. During office hours, if students come by, I will sit down and chat with them about their projects, read through rough drafts of their research, and explain things they have questions about and so forth. Sometimes, I will walk over to the library with them to show freshmen individually how to the use the online databases, distinguish between peer-reviewed sources and popular sources, and so forth. If no students swing by during that time, I will instead prepare lectures for the next day or spend that time grading papers (which is an endless, endless chore for English professors, since unlike our colleagues, we may assign 5–6 lengthier writing assignments each semester as opposed to 1–2 essays, and we don’t merely mark the grammar problems but usually actually write up explanations in the margins to explain the grammar in detail). If there’s an upcoming examination, I will also prep in advance 2–3 versions of a midterm exam for those classes (typically one unique to each section plus a spare version to use as a makeup exam if students miss the test.) Lunch: If my schedule that semester allows it, and I’m not eating lunch in the office, I normally eat lunch in the faculty lounge, where there’s a fridge for my department to store some food. Sometimes, a small group of 2–3 of us will wander off to faculty dining room in the cafeteria, but that’s expensive. Other semesters, I may be scheduled to teach through the noon hour or have office hours through the noon hour, so I then usually skip lunch, sneak lunch in my office, or just have a big breakfast before going onto campus instead. Office hours then continue until 2:00 p.m. Early afternoon: Typically, after 3:00 p.m., the day varies greatly. If there was a recent crush of papers, I may still continue grading until I go home around 5:30 or so for a brief supper, and then continue grading essays and homework until I go to bed. On other days, the afternoon will be eaten up by meetings, as faculty members are usually on 2–3 different committees each semester. (In my case, I’m on the Honors Program committee, so we meet regularly to parcel out bureaucratic work, hear appeals from students, and supervise Honors projects, plan field trips for the Honors Program, and so forth). In other parts of the semester, I will need to schedule advising sessions with the half-dozen to a dozen students majoring in English who are assigned to me as my protégés. About two weeks before classes open up for registration, they will be assigned to come visit me individually, and we’ll sit down, look at what classes they have taken, and talk through what courses they need to take to graduate on time, talk about careers after they graduate, opportunities for internships, scholarships, or study abroad, and so forth. On other semesters, I may be planning to take students to Europe in the summer for a study-abroad class, so there’s an astonishing amount of time necessary to make all the travel arrangements, get in contact with museums to schedule group tours, arrange for cheapest lodging possible, and get in contact with scholars, writers, and poets over there so they can meet with my students. (Sometimes, because of the difference in time-zones, you have to do that at godawful hours like 4:30 in the morning so you can catch the Irish hostel-owner when she’s awake and in the hostel.) I’m also a manuscript editor for a scholarly journal, where it’s my job to farm out submitted articles anonymously to reviewers who are experts in the field, and poke them and prod them into doing their peer reviews in a timely manner. That’s generally on-going work that comes and goes in spats, but since my journal only has one issue per year rather than four, it’s not too bad. If there are no bureaucratic jobs to be done right-away, teachers will usually schedule themselves for 2–3 hours of research time each day. Part of that will be spent in the library, simply reading the most recent publications in your specialty to stay abreast of the field. For me, that’s medieval literature, so I try to schedule time to read everything published in Speculum and Studies in the Age of Chaucer, the two most relevant journals for my specific interest. I also schedule for myself an eight-hour marathon each December to drive up to a larger library in Knoxville, where I will force myself to read through The Year’s Work in Anglo-Saxon Studies, which does an annual summary of all published work about Old English topics. Part of that time is also research for specific projects you would like to present at academic conferences and / or submit to journals, especially for R1 schools. For medieval studies, that means getting access to images of medieval texts. In the bad old days, lit teachers would have to contact monks in European monasteries and arrange for them to get you copies and/or contact museums and arrange to get microfilm copies of made (and mailed to you) of relevant unpublished texts. That used to take months, but now such things are increasingly available online in digitized form these days. If the material is in Latin or a language you are weak in (in my case, Old French is my Achilles’ Heel), you will also need a spend a few hours translating it and typing it up, puzzling out the scribal abbreviations and comparing them against paleographic samples so you can figure out what the abbreviated words mean. God help you if the 14th-century scribe had bad handwriting. If it’s a language you don’t speak at all (in my case, German or Old Norse), you may have to beg a colleague to help you or pray that some other hard-working scholar has translated it into a language you can read. If I’m not in the middle of an unfinished research project (and I tend to do a lot less research than R1 professors would), I may spend some of that time updating my knowledge of literature generally. At small schools like mine, professors teach many general literature surveys to non-majors. I’m competent to teach classical Greco-Roman mythology and European literature up through the Enlightenment at the undergraduate level for general education, and sometimes get stuck doing 19th-21st century stuff in a pinch, but the more modern writings are not my strong spots. So, I usually try to read one recent journal article on each literary work I teach the next day, just to spot-check myself and make sure my knowledge is roughly up to date. Late Afternoon: I supervise several clubs and organizations for students on campus, and these often meet in the late afternoon. One group, the Old English Club, has five of six students in it who have fallen in love with the language of Beowulf, so we will meet once or twice a week in the late afternoon and practice translating some Anglo-Saxon prose or poetry for fun, rather than for a grade. Another, larger organization is the AX Honor Society, where I am one of the faculty sponsors. That is a massive time-sink, as we have regular meetings, and we have to organize tons of fund-raising for ourselves by hosting games and events on campuses so we can generate enough funds for our local chapter to send representatives to the National Convention each spring (plane tickets, hotel lodging, etc.). We also have our members submit research papers to conferences, essay contests, and a ton of other activities, so right around February when those contests happen, I might do about 30 hours of extra work over the course of two weeks, reading through submissions, selecting candidates, helping them revise papers, helping proofread posters for the science kids doing poster presentations, hearing them practice their presentations to get it down pat before the national convention, and so forth. Typically, I usually host one study session each week in the late afternoon for my struggling students. If several students bomb the mid-term, I usually lean on them to set up a time where they and I can meet outside of class once and week and just review/go over material they found confusing or didn’t understand the first time. A large part of these sessions is simply teaching them how to study effectively—i.e., actually buying and reading the textbook, annotating it with their own marginalia in the form of questions and comments; actually taking notes in class rather than simply sitting and listening; actually handwriting and re-copying the notes rather than typing them on their phones during lecture, and so forth. (You can tell students all this stuff verbally, but it doesn’t really become “real” to them until they bomb the first big test.) Evening: This varies a great bit. I tend to stay late at the office if I have a lot of work to do, as I have trouble concentrating on work at home, and I psychologically associate my office with “time to work” and associate my house with “time to play video-games, read trashy paperbacks, watch movies, or hang out with the wife.” So, if there’s a lot of work to do, I usually stay at the office until 5:00 or 6:00 p.m., then run home for supper, then possibly return to the office for another hour or two. Many of my colleagues have events they do in the evening after supper (such as my American Lit colleagues having events at the Appalachian Center), and I try to show up to those to support them, if I’m not exhausted. On the other hand, sometimes there’s not a lot of work to do on a given day—especially after the first week of class and just before students turn in their first big paper on the third or fourth week of class. In those cases, I may come home early at 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., but clocking out so early is generally a bad habit if you want to be successful in your career—especially at larger research universities. Around midterms and final examination times, I usually also go into the office for ten- or twelve-hour shifts of grading on the weekend as well. (Typically, during the 9-month school year, you may put in far more than 40 hours of work each week, even if you are “officially” only in the classroom 12 hours each week). That’s balanced a bit by more free time in the summer, as many professors only teach 1 summer class and then have 2–3 months of vacation time. I hope this information is helpful to you—thank you for asking. This will vary greatly depending on your field of study and whether you are at an R1 research institute (where you are hired to do research first, and teaching a bit of graduate classes is secondary) or something more like a teaching institute (where you are primarily hired to teach undergraduate students, and research is secondary). In this case, I’m describing the job of an English Literature and Linguistics professor at a small liberal arts college, where I teach a 4/4 load, and I am mostly responsible for teaching and mentoring students rather than doing cutting-edge research and publicatio Continue Reading",2021-03-05T11:27:18.440Z,"What is a typical day in the life of a professor like?

Dreamy eyed noobs that we were, we made tons of mistakes.  I'll mention the top 5 mistakes we made that led to our failure. But first the story to give you some background: July 2014 In July, we started building smart internet connected switches that learn from user behavior and automate all the electronic appliances in a home. We felt that it’s a pity that our search results and news feed are personalized to us but our homes, where we spend most of our time, are not. We had a vision that our switches will learn and personalize the electronic appliances in a home to its owner. We decided to name the company Lumos.(Yes, I am a big Harry Potter Fan!) We took some pre-seed investment from an angel investor and headed off to our alma mater IIT Gandhinagar to get incubated. We converted a lab into our office space and the Lumos saga started!    The Lumos Team at Work! We built like crazy. That’s the thing about us engineers; if you give us something interesting to build, we will forget everything else and just build. Our first prototype, which automated lights, was ready in 45 days. The second prototype, which could automate lights, fans, ACs and water heaters was out in another month. This is really fast according to hardware standards. November 2014 In mid-November, we got a product designer on board to design the final product. In December, we were already in talks with investors to raise the next round of funding.   Our First PCB (That did not work :P ) We were on track to have a market-ready hardware product in less than one year. We were pleased with ourselves. The investors were pleased with us. Life was a bed of roses. December 2014 Until it was not. We had underestimated the work that goes into making a market-ready hardware product. We had overestimated the demand and utility of our product.  Hardware products sell at 4x–5x the component costs. How did we not know this?! We were wildly wrong about the price at which we thought our product would sell. And when all this realization came together, shit got real. January 2015-April 2015 We were forced into a deathly spiral of pivots that almost killed the company. We made bigger mistakes. We left IoT as a sector. We lost a cofounder on the way. The pivots are a long story. I’ll save it for another day. Now that you have some background, here are the top 5 mistakes we made in Lumos and what we learnt from them.  Mistake 1: We were neither experts nor target users of the product that we were building. We had never used the existing home automation products in our homes. We were not experts in the IoT sector. When you have new at something, you give yourself the famous Dunning Kruger Pass on your decisions. “The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate.”   And we did give ourselves the Dunning Kruger pass. Had we been users of existing smart switches, we would have known that the incremental value that our product was offering was quite low. Had we been experts in IoT, we would have known how to price hardware and the difficulties in building it. By avoiding this mistake, you can avoid a lot of other mistakes which happen as a result of this one. Learning: Work on something where you are either an expert or a top user. If not, become an expert/top user. Homejoy founder Adora Cheung herself worked as a professional cleaner to understand the business. Mistake 2: We did not do the due diligence on the idea before we started building the product. We did not understand the market and competition well enough. We also did not figure out the persona of our customer. And whether that customer was looking for the value that we were providing. We did not question whether we would be able to provide that value in that first place.(Machine Learning cannot read the human mind. Not yet!). It is always possible to validate or disvalidate a lot of assumptions about the product, market and competition without building the full-fledged product. One way we could have done it was by selling existing products to our potential customers. Learning: I learnt this very useful method in an accelerator. Make a thorough list of hinge-breaking assumptions for your market, product and competition. Hinge breaking assumptions are those that can make or break your company. Rank them according to probability of the assumption being wrong and subsequent risk to company. Start validating from the top while building as less as possible.   Mistake 3: We let sunk cost bias affect our decisions about pivoting. It was not that we were clueless about the problems in our product. We had doubts in our minds. In a startup, you almost always have doubts. But we had built so much. We were in love with our product. And we were not ready to ask the difficult questions.   Is it okay to be doubtful about your product? Is it okay to voice your doubts and bring the team morale down? Or make your cofounders feel that you are not as committed to the idea and the vision as they are? It helps to be transparent about your doubts with co-founders in the long run. It would have saved us a couple of months and some money. Learning: It is absolutely necessary for founders to be committed to the vision of the company. However, there are multiple ways to achieve a vision. Don’t fall in love with one way. Accept the possibility that you might have to start things over from scratch. Build a culture of transparency in your company. Encourage dissent among cofounders and deal with it objectively. Mistake 4: We were trying to do everything for everybody.  We were making switches that could automate your lights, fans, ACs and water heaters. We would have tried to automate your TV, Fridge, Oven and Car as well had it been feasible to do so. We were pitching power savings as well as luxury. This made the product and the pitch very complicated. Learning: As a startup, you are constrained in resources. So it is always better to identify and solve one problem very well instead of solving n problems in a so-so way. Nest solved the heating problem. Dropcam and Canary solved the security problem. Try to be a drug for your customer instead of being a vitamin. Mistake 5: We underestimated hardware. Building a successful startup is hard. Building a hardware startup is 10 times harder. Pebble, with all its Kickstarter success, is still in troubled waters. Building a prototype is the easiest part of building a hardware startup. The real challenge comes in product design, production engineering, manufacturing, distribution and marketing/sales. And you need to have friends in China. Also, hardware product validation and iteration cycles are much longer than software ones. Getting funding is relatively difficult; VCs ask for traction(~$1M on Kickstarter/Indiegogo last I heard)because of the inherent risk in a hardware startup. Managing cash flows is hard because you have to pay your vendors months before you get paid from your customers.   Source: The Lean Hardware Startup: Investing in Hardware Startups Considering all this, we were not the right team to build a hardware company. Learning: Understand what you are getting into if you are starting a hardware company and plan accordingly. Get experienced people on your team or get into a hardware accelerator like HAXLR8R. Today. Eventually, we ended up leaving hardware and IoT and decided to build something that solves a problem that we had experienced. Since Gandhinagar(where Lumos was located) does not have many startups, interacting and sharing experiences with other entrepreneurs was always a big problem for us. Also, we had to subscribe to a lot of blogs (crowded inbox) just to stay updated with top content on Entrepreneurship. We decided to build FundaMine to solve this problem.

It works, it doesn’t need a lot of maintenance, and it doesn’t have bugs. People can depend on it. One of the most important things you look for is code that was developed by someone or some team = a team that knows a lot more than simply how to write code. Good code is only part of what it takes to make good software. Here’s a bit about my journey and how I learned all the things necessary for software to be really good. I was very good at programming in the early part of my 48 year career. [I’m counting all of my years working internships during college.] That is to say that after about 5 years I was competent, after about 10 years I was good, and after about 15 years I was very good. But by then I had learned that programming is only part of what is involved with genuine software engineering. After that I learned about many other things such as how to do it right the first time, software quality engineering, software planning and estimating, how to write successful, winning proposals, how to reduce the time required to write software by using cycle time management techniques, how to lead and manage successful software development teams, how to measure and improve the software development process, how to integrate a complex product involving both software and hardware, and - perhaps most importantly - how to put together a successful product development team and manage them to a successful completion when the product involves both state-of-the-art hardware and innovative software. Later in my career I learned how much of a challenge it can be to put together a complex product that involves software developed by subcontractors, off the shelf software, “free” software, “reused” software, and customers who cannot make up their minds about requirements. I also learned what it takes to write “safe” software - that is, software that can be relied upon in safety-critical applications such as medical devices or aircraft. By the way, I no longer consider myself a very good programmer. Why? Because all those other things I mentioned, some of which resulted in job promotions to positions of higher responsibility and higher pay, also kept me from keeping up with all the details of new development methods and tools during those later years. [I have a chart showing which languages, development methods, and so forth were most popular each decade of my career. The point of the chart is that every ten years things had changed quite a lot.] Instead of keeping up with new languages and tools, I was learning about things like managing a project to keep it on schedule, how to write a statement of work for a software subcontractor so that everything will turn out OK when it comes time to integrate their software with our own or, even more of a challenge, when it comes time to upgrade or maintain our product and get their part upgraded or maintained as well. I had a lot of programmers working for me and they kept up with the latest technical details while I was focused on other matters. Some of my lessons learned from a career in software development: You always need to keep learning. The field changes too fast.There’s a lot more to software engineering than programming and you cannot necessarily be the top expert in all aspects of it.Software engineering is a team effort - you have to rely on others to do their specialties correctly if you want to have successful results.You have to understand the application domain if you want to write good software. Writing software for a radar system is a lot different from writing software for a smart phone app, which in turn is a lot different from writing software for a medical device or a factory automation application or for the internal network within an airplane or … (I could go on and on).In the end, writing good code is a lot more important than writing code quickly. (Unfortunately, too many customers and higher level managers don’t understand this. They would rather do it over multiple times than do it right the first time.)

I was ready to throw in the towel and call it a day. Just before signing off, I noticed one last job listing. It stood out to me because it sounded like it’d be an interesting project to work on. But when I saw that the client wanted monthly work done for an entire year, I told myself it was probably out of my league – there was no way I could get an interview. Since I was still pretty new to Upwork, I’d been sticking mainly to the small jobs, just trying to “get my feet wet.” Still, I couldn’t help but read the full job description, if only to torture myself. My suspicion was confirmed the moment I clicked to read more… The client wanted a freelancer with credentials and experience in Electrical Engineering. I sighed, realizing this was one of many Upwork jobs I simply wasn’t qualified for, at least technically.  Then I had a crazy thought. What if I sent in a proposal anyway? It’d be good practice, and, more importantly, I didn’t want to quit for the day without at least applying to at least ONE job. Then, an even crazier thought… Since I wasn’t even expecting to hear back from the client — let alone win the job — why not be the highest bidder, too? I had nothing to lose, so I decided to go for it. Without a second thought, I fired off the following proposal to the client: Hello [first name of client] I see you are looking for an author who can ghostwrite 2,000 word articles twice a month in the portable power field. You want your content to generate interest, leads and opt-ins by writing actionable business oriented copy. I write long form content. If we were to work together I could create multiple mock-ups of articles before writing them so your article will have the content you want in the voice you desire. Content and voice are key to generating leads. If your content is geared towards electrical engineers you will generate leads by writing content that helps them solve their problems. Here is just a few ideas I have for ‘problems’ portable power solves. *Easy to move quickly in rough terrain. (which is great for both mining and entertainment.)*The power source is reliable in any condition.*Your power source is long lasting and effective no matter the energy demands. If you are interested in creating content that solves these problems and generates leads, I am available to talk. Regards, Jesse G. I figured it was such a long-shot that I promptly forgot about the whole thing after clicking “submit.” You can imagine my surprise when, two hours later, I received a message back from the client. He wanted to schedule a phone interview with me! My fleeting pleasure was quickly replaced with self doubt. Was this for real? Didn’t the client see that I was the least experienced, most expensive choice? I hadn’t exactly mastered the Upwork interview process yet…and to be honest, I felt a bit out of place. Rather than wasting my time (and the client’s), I decided right then and there to decline the interview. Unfortunately, my fingers seemed to take on a mind of their own, and I found myself typing out a response to the client, confirming the interview for 2 hours later. I hit the “send” button quickly, before I could change my mind. Though it was nice to finally have SOMETHING to show for the two hours I’d spent sifting through the Upwork jobs that day, I was in over my head. I’d jumped out of the frying pan…and into the fire. The accidental Upworker Like many people, I initially stumbled across Upwork pretty randomly. It all started back when I was performing stage hypnosis shows. Yeah you read that right. I am a comedy stage hypnotist. As far back as I can remember, I’ve always wanted the freedom and income potential of being my own boss. Unfortunately, the rewards of stage hypnosis were pretty limited. I had to stick to a strict travel schedule, and there were only so many shows I could perform each year. In other words, my progress had struck a plateau. Eventually I traded in my hypnotist watch, and opened up a coin, jewelry and gold shop.  My store I opened up the doors right at the start of the precious metals boom. But even though business was rolling in, cash often left just as quickly as it came. Worse yet, after about a year of doing the books, I finally realized that unless I aggressively expanded my territory and opened new shops, my income couldn’t grow. I had hit another hurdle. Nothing seemed to be working. It felt like the economy was rigged against me. I went through some pretty negative self-talk, which didn’t help. Then I came across Ramit Sethi’s Zero To Launch course, which promised to teach me how to launch a successful online business. I’d been reading Ramit’s blog for years, and I liked the idea that I could grow an online business as big as I wanted to, without worrying about the physical limitations I’d run into in my previous ventures. There was just one “problem”…it takes months or years to see results from an online business. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t in a rush. But I was looking for a way to support myself (and have control over my schedule) WHILE I built my online business. And freelancing on Upwork seemed like a great way to do that. Thanks to Danny’s Secrets of a Six-Figure Upworker course, I’d already learned quite a bit about how to make money on Upwork. And I’d landed a couple of small gigs, which was great. But now I was in danger of wrecking my Upwork career before it even got off the ground. I needed to figure out a way to ace this interview, and I needed to do it fast. Of all the Upwork jobs I could have applied to… Even right after agreeing to the interview, I thought about calling the whole thing off. It seemed a little intimidating to jump on the phone with the client when I obviously lacked the credentials he was asking for. Especially since there were several competitors who DID appear qualified. And they were charging less than I was, too! Then I remembered something Danny had said about the competition on Upwork not being as stiff as it often seemed. AND the fact that lots of clients were willing to pay for VALUE. I went back and took a second glance at the client’s Upwork history:  And you know what? He seemed like a REALLY GOOD client. Out of the 18 Upwork jobs he’d posted, he ended up hiring someone 78% of the time. And he’d spent almost $10,000 on Upwork this year alone. This gave me a hunch that he might be exactly the type of client who IS willing to pay for value, rather than just going for the cheapest freelancer. And while my competitors may TECHNICALLY have been more qualified, I figured I could offer more value by outworking them, outsmarting them, and…upworking them! (Bad joke, couldn’t resist.) I started to go from feeling unsure, to bouncing up and down like Rocky right before the big fight. Okay so Eye of the Tiger wasn’t playing anywhere, but it was there in spirit. I was determined. If the client wanted the cheapest freelancer, or the one with the most technical experience, then that was fine by me. But either way, I was committed to doing everything I could to get the gig. My interview with the project leader was in two hours. Time to start training hard. I brought the entire artillery to the gunfight Without a moment to spare before the interview, it hit me: I could WOW the client by over-preparing to the point where I knew more about his needs needs than even HE did. That would give me a big leg up compared to my competitors, who would probably be talking all about themselves during the interview (“Here’s MY experience…here’s why I’M qualified…here’s why you should hire ME…”) So I went into Private Detective mode and started doing some serious homework. This is the “deep dive” research process I went through: 1. I looked for clues about the client’s business. You may have noticed that the job posting didn’t contain any specific information about the client. But their Upwork username did (it was their business name). If I didn’t have my detective hat on, this key piece of intel would probably have gone right over my head. But being under pressure forced me to be on the lookout for any helpful info I could find. Just as importantly, this was information my competitors would likely miss, not care about, etc. 2. I figured out who the END-CLIENT was. If you look back at the job post, you’ll see that the client who posted the job was looking for someone to ghostwrite for one of THEIR clients. This is a subtle but very important point. It meant that the person interviewing me (the “client”) would be very concerned with making HIS client (the end-client) happy. That would be his #1 goal. My competitors probably didn’t realize this. If you asked them, they would likely say that the client’s goal would be to “hire the best writer” or “hire the most experienced freelancer.” WRONG. The client would want to hire someone who makes him look like a genius to HIS client! Everything else would be secondary. So the more I knew about the client’s client, the better I’d look in the interview. 3. I read through the end-client’s entire website. Not just their home page, but every page, top to bottom. I checked out their team, their customers, their products and services, their company’s history, etc. I wanted to make sure I went into the conversation knowing EXACTLY who they were, what they do, and who they do it for. Remember that the interviewer’s top priority would be to take care of this client. “Writing” was just a small piece of the overall puzzle. If I wanted to win this job (especially as the most expensive freelancer applying) I needed to become an expert on the end-client, quickly. 4. For good measure, I went through their COMPETITORS websites, too. Business doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Every company has competitors who threaten to eat their lunch. If you really want to help a client, you need to understand who they are competing against, and how they measure up to what those competitors are doing. Keep in mind that clients want to work with freelancers who have their back. Knowing this extra bit of info would give the client confidence that I am the type of freelancer who offers lots of value and is willing to go the extra mile to help them succeed. 5. I researched their products and services. I wanted to get a thoroughunderstanding of the client’s business. Not just their industry, but the real reasons WHY their customers buy their products and services. I even went to Amazon and read dozens of customer reviews on many of the products they sold. I focused mainly on the 5 star reviews, since those customers were the most satisfied (though I also looked for negative reviews, since those represented potential opportunities for improvement — remember, being an awesome freelancer is all about helping the client as much as possible.) 6. I called their actual customers on the phone. Yes. I am crazy. But if you want extraordinary results then you have to be willing to step out on a limb. So I called real companies that have purchased the products being sold by the end-client, and I asked them questions about their experiences. Some of the reps I reached weren’t so friendly. A few even hung up on me. But there were a handful who were happy to give me a few minutes of their time. The information they gave me was pure GOLD, and I got some amazing insights about their purchasing behavior that even the client would likely not be aware of. Do you think this would affect how much the client valued me as a collaborator? Damn right it would. HOW MANY OF MY COMPETITORS WOULD EVEN DO 1/10TH OF THE AMOUNT OF PREPARATION I DID FOR THIS INTERVIEW? The answer is almost certainly…none of them. I was choosing to put myself into a Category Of One. By the way, you if doubt whether or not it was worth the extra time and effort, I want you to keep 3 things in mind: This client needed two articles every month for at least a year. In other words, this was a LONG TERM job, so it was undoubtedly worth going the extra mile to snap it up.Remember that the client had paid out almost $10,000 for various Upwork jobs so far. So there is every reason to believe that this initial research would pay off at least 100x, especially since it was likely to make a lasting impression on the client (one thing I learned from Danny is that clients like to find a freelancer and stick with them).All of my preparation for the interview took me just two hours TOTAL. So at the end of the day it’s a small price to pay in order to win the job.By the time the interview rolled around, I had some huge advantages over my competitors. I knew exactly what the end-client did, who their competition was, how their customers made their purchasing decisions, and even the exact type of words their customers used to communicate their wants and needs. And I’d used that info to create a list of ideas for different pieces of content that I thought would benefit their company. I was 110% prepared. The only thing left to do was nail the interview itself. The interview The client called me at 4pm sharp. I looked at the number on my screen, brushed away all lingering feelings of doubt, and swiped to answer the phone. The moment the client started talking I knew exactly what I needed to do. Instead of letting him ask the questions while I played the “good interviewee,” I decided to LEAD the conversation. A bold move, but remember, my goal was to stand out, not fit in. I told him I’d like to start by asking him some questions. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence that made me wonder if I went too far. When he finally answered, he sounded very surprised, but agreeable: “Oh, uh…okay. (YES!) Without wasting a second, I immediately asked him for more details about his goals for the project, what he was trying to accomplish, and what would have to happen in order for him to consider the project a success. Like the information I’d gathered previously, this was extremely important intel, but more importantly it would show the client that I CARED about helping him (and his client) produce RESULTS. Next, I gave him a rundown of what I’d learned while researching his client’s company, their competitors, the products they sell, the reviews they have gotten, and even the insights I was able to dig up on their customers’ psychology and preferences. Then I threw out a few suggestions for the type of articles I thought would work best for what they were trying to accomplish. I even capped the whole thing off by telling him I talked with his client’s customers! I told him about what they said and how the language they used would be great to include in their copy for maximum effectiveness. There was another dead silence as the client appeared to be in utter shock. When he finally spoke, he told me, “I was only calling you because it was a matter of company policy. I had no interest in hiring you.” Then, after another pause, he continued: “But you are the ONLY person we’ve talked to that did this kind of research. I’ll have to clear it with my boss, but…I think we are going to hire you.” They did.  As you can see, I’ve earned $250 writing for them so far. But remember that this is an ongoing MONTHLY contract. By my calculation, it’ll be worth $6,000 to me over time. (And that doesn’t even include potential work the client may hire me for afterthis contract is up.) YOU can make money on Upwork, too Let’s go over some of the key takeaways from this story. When I first looked at some of the bigger Upwork jobs that get posted everyday, I was worried I wasn’t ready. My mind was telling me a story that I didn’t have the credentials, the portfolio, or the experience I thought I needed. But the reality was that I was keeping myself from getting some of the bigger, better Upwork jobs that were available. Yes, I was technically less qualified than some of the bigger guys. And they charged less than me. But I was able to overcome that by focusing on what the client wanted. Qualifications, credentials, and experience may be hurdles, but they aren’t roadblocks. Just because you don’t have “X years of experience” or specific industry knowledge, doesn’t mean you can’t make up for that in other ways. The only question is, will you?

The Top 6 PMP Training Centers in Phoenix There are plenty of PMP training providers to choose from in Phoenix and neighboring cities such as Tucson, Mesa, Chandler, Glendale, Scottsville, Gilbert, Tempe, among others. However, it is crucial to note that not all deserve your resources and time. So, how do you choose a training institution that provides the best value for your money? This article aims to give you an assessment of the various top PMP training institutes in Phoenix. As we give you detailed information on each training PMP centers in Phoenix, we shall weigh on how they each score in the factors mentioned above. We will also give you our take on why PMTI is the best PMP training provider in Phoenix. Note: While all the below listed Phoenix PMP training institutions provide the 35-hour training session required to sit for the PMP exams, the quality of training varies significantly. This is the reason we highly recommend Project Management Training Institute (PMTI) since we offer top-of-the-class PMP certification training in Phoenix and the surrounding areas. 1.Project Management Training Institute (PMTI) PMTI has been the leading choice for thousands of candidates looking to obtain their PMP Certification since 2003.

Project Management Academy Project Management Academy offers in-class PMP certification training in Phoenix. Their training satisfies the 35 contact hours required by PMI and is conducted by qualified instructors. Similar to PMTI, students are provided with a variety of study materials, including the PMBoK® coursebook, PMP Strategy Guide, practice questions as well as other resources. Students are also provided with online lecture videos prepared by their course trainers. According to their website, the institute offers a 100% money-back guarantee, but their success rate is not indicated. At PMTI, we boast of a 99% success rate in addition to our 100% genuine money-back guarantee. Project Management Academy also has a smaller alumni community, in comparison to our 100, 000+ alumni. 3. Simplilearn Simplilearn offers many courses on different subjects, including Business, IT, and Management certifications. Simplilearn offers PMP certification training encompassing 35 sessional hours as well as real-life project management situations and case studies to assist students in learning. While they boast of a robust online course, they don't offer in-class training sessions, which may not be ideal for students who must attend an actual classroom to understand crucial PMP course contents. This is the real reason why we at PMTI utilize the 4-day boot camp format to cater to students that must establish real-time contact with the instructor to understand course concepts. Even though Simplilearn is a well-established training company and they have been providing good quality courses for almost a decade, we would suggest you look at other options. 4. GreyCampus Based in India, Greycampus specializes in providing online and offline training for working professionals across the globe. They offer training in project management and also other fields, including Networking and Scrum, Information Security, Quality Management, Service Management, among other areas. Greycampus provide PMP certification training in Phoenix using the 4-day boot camp format with the classes led by qualified instructors. Founded in 2014, Greycampus is relatively new, with a meager 30,000 successful PMP alumni and a PMP exam success rate of 95%. Even though these numbers might seem impressive, our advice to PMP aspirants is to choose well established PMP training providers. Not only do they have the experience, but they also provide quality training and have higher PMP success rates. For example, in our 16 years of operation, we boast a PMP exam success rate of 99% and an alumni base of over 100, 000 students Greycampus also has a poor online reputation, with multiple negative reviews. There are numerous complaints from frustrated students regarding their poor customer and technical support. There are also negative reviews concerning the quality of study materials; for example, their practice questions were found to be too easy. While Greycampus' PMP certification course is comprehensive and includes the necessary materials required to prepare for your PMP exam, we believe Greycampus still has room for improvement. 5. Edwel Established in 1992 and with over 25,000 project managers alumni spread out the globe, Edwel is among the oldest institutions that provide PMP training. The training at Edwel is conducted using the 4-day boot camp involving instructor-led classroom sessions. The institution provides students with study materials upon registration, including PMBOK® guide book, PMP course manual as well as PMP exam sample questions. Edwel is indeed a veteran when it comes to training students to sit for the PMP exams, however, basing on the years present as well as the number of graduates, PMTI has indeed contributed significantly to project management training, attributing to over 100,000 graduates in 16 years only. Their website is also skimpy on information regarding the institute; for example, there is no info regarding Edwel's cancellation and rescheduling policy, their REP status, and customer service hours. 6. Project Management Excellence Center (PMEC) Established in 2004, PMEC offers professional training for PMP, CAPM, Agile, Scrum, Six Sigma, and more. There are a few drawbacks of PMEC's PMP training course. First and foremost, students are not provided with essential study materials such as the PMBoK® guide book. The PMP exam is hard, and to be adequately prepared; you require adequate study materials. Secondly, even though PMEC offers a 100% money-back guarantee, their success rate is lower compared to PMTI's success rate of 99%. On the bright side, they provide lunch and snacks during class sessions, but even though this is a nice perk, it does not play a huge role in ensuring PMP exam success. PMP Certification in Phoenix: The Bottom Line Project Managers looking to advance their careers should strive to obtain PMP certification as it is currently the most sought-after professional credential in the project management field. It's mutually beneficial to both the employer and the employee. With so many institutions offering PMP certification training available, it can be daunting to choose an ideal institution. Nonetheless, the most critical factor to consider when faced with such a dilemma is the quality of training offered. A high pass rate can be an indicator of excellent training, but you must also consider other factors such as money-back guarantee as it boosts your confidence when sitting for the exams.

This will never allow students to think as an entrepreneur or find solutions to the problems that exist today. Interacting with several citizens in United States, their education system help them decide their future and it very common to see software engineers choose the different field from photographers to Social Media experts. Indian professionals can never take such decisions since they are never trained to do so and also because of the huge disparity in payments.

Dual Employment and Indian Labour Laws Apart from ‘Section 60 of Factories Act, 1948’ which does not allow a person work on two different factories on the same day, there are no laws which restricts from doing what you like. However, both Public and Private sectors in India doesn’t allow a person to get engaged in another employment or dedicate themselves in another activity which may credit them financially. Indian Court also has favoured the organization who terminated their employees for getting engaged in dual employment. These are often defined by the terms and conditions of the offer letter provided by the company during the time of employment. This is where most of the world class innovators has merits on. They are allowed to chase their passion without affecting their jobs schedule, even while playing key roles of their employers.

In the past decade, entrepreneurship has emerged as a popular career choice among both students and working professionals. A survey revealed that majority of the Indian workforce would like to become entrepreneurs, and their numbers are far higher than the global average. Out of these, a over whelming majority of people were considering quitting their current jobs to start their own business ventures. In another survey, it was found that more than 60% Indian youth believe that entrepreneurship is their calling for good livelihood prospects and would like to study it during their academic years. There are several reasons why entrepreneurship is gaining momentum in India. * The rise of the Indian startup ecosystem, which is currently third-largest on the global index with 50,000 registered startups, has created a new wave of opportunities that aspiring and seasoned entrepreneurs want to leverage. * The Indian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) sector comprising approximately 30 million units has also fueled the passion for entrepreneurship. * India is home to 111 family-owned businesses (in multi billion space), third-highest in the world after the US and China - there is a section of the millennial generation who are ready to take the reins of their family businesses and carry forward the legacy as successor entrepreneurs. These statistics indeed portray an optimistic future of entrepreneurship as a career in India. However, the entrepreneurial activity is still lagging behind its true potential. Only 5% of Indians establish their own business, among the lowest rates on the global platform. On the other side of the spectrum, business discontinuation rate is among the highest in the world at 26.4%. Now, while there are umpteen reasons why people don’t venture into entrepreneurship or fail in their businesses, a key reason is lack of business skills. There is no doubt that some skills are learnt on the job, but a strong pre-foundation in these skills can yield better learning outcomes. It can also eliminate the fear and risk of failures which is the biggest concern of 71% young entrepreneurship aspirants in launching their own business. MBA Can Provide Solid Foundation for Entrepreneurship MBA degree is not a mandatory requirement or eligibility for entrepreneurship, but it does offer valuable business knowledge, skills and insights to mitigate failures and augment the likelihood of success. Let’s understand how an MBA can make you a better entrepreneur: * Provides Business Management Education The entire curriculum of MBA is focused on imparting knowledge related to marketing, human resources, finance, operations, strategy and all other functions that are required to run a business. A number of B-schools have also begun to offer niche electives and specializations in the upcoming entrepreneurial fields like technology, agriculture, healthcare, telecom, energy, etc. to provide domain-intensive skills. In fact, some B-schools also have dedicated programs or subjects on entrepreneurship. An academic background in business management can come handy in running their own business. * Aids in Soft Skill Development An MBA student requires you to participate actively in projects, case studies, presentations, internship, group work, role plays, mock situations and many other hands-on modules to apply theoretical concepts to practical experience. This leads to the development of soft skills such as communication, leadership, decision-making, collaboration, analytical thinking, time management and problem-solving which are hallmarks of successful entrepreneurs. * Builds Professional Network During MBA, you form connections with fellow classmates, alumni, faculty, industry experts and many other people from different walks of life. These connections build a pool of potential co-founders, employees, investors, mentors or customers when you become an entrepreneur. Since you have already known or worked with people during the MBA program, you can reduce considerable time in building the right teams or getting access to resources when you become an entrepreneur. * Acts as the Incubator for Entrepreneurship Ideas Many B-schools make conscious efforts to promote a culture of entrepreneurship on campus by setting up of startup or innovation labs, conducting startup pitch competitions, inviting startup community for talks and undertaking many other academic initiatives. This, in turn, provides you with a safe and conducive environment to hone or refine your business ideas or models with the help of on-campus expertise and guidance. * Gives Credibility to Your Resume MBA is a very demanding program. You are expected to undergo a rigorous academic schedule that tests your intellectual and emotional calibre. You need to juggle several things together and learn to go beyond your comfort zone. Entrepreneurship is no different - it is a challenging career where you have to wear several hats like a pro. MBA not only prepares you for the responsibilities and challenges of entrepreneurship, but it gives credibility to mentors and investors that you have it in you to make your mark as an entrepreneur. MBA should be seen as the stepping stone to entrepreneurship. It gives you the knowledge, skills and most importantly, confidence to become an entrepreneur.

Also, if you have a long career like mine, the value of the specific benefits change over time. Below I will tell you where I found my MBA helpful and not so helpful over the 3 different stages of my career. Pre-MBA (Teens and early twenties), 1 to 4 person start-ups: During this stage, I founded a small sole proprietorship business, and worked for an entrepreneur in one 2-person start-up.MBA program (my actual degree is an MS in Industrial Administration from Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, but you can think of an MSIA as just a very quantitative focussed MBA.First 10 years Post-MBA (Late twenties and early thirties), Technical Management roles in a big company: I worked for a major computer company (HP) serving in both their corporate computing center developing systems to increase productivity and improve company operations information systems, and in a product division leading an R&D project management team.10+ years after MBA: (Late thirties to present), Senior Management Roles in Startups: I have worked primarily as a senior executive and/or founder in several start-ups in Silicon Valley.There are two benefits of the MBA: 1) What I learned from the curricula, and 2) the value of the connections I made by getting my MBA. Let me show you how I assess the value of each of these at different stages of my career. Stage 1, Pre-MBA career: Curricula: My MBA program would not of provided me any benefit in the first business I founded, a graphic design and printing business that supplied campus departments and organizations with posters at my college. The most important skill for me here was knowing how to design and layout appealing posters, and how to set type and operate letterpresses, and create photo ready copy. None of those skills were taught in my MBA. This was a simple part-time hustle, I didn’t incorporate or anything. Mostly I was selling the products of my own mind, physical labor and time - and a few student employees I hired for different projects. While the business provided me a great income as a student, I wasn’t intending it to become a long term business. I sold my business to my employees when I left for Graduate business school. The business skills in the MBA curricula would have been overkill. Marketing & Sales was just introducing myself to my customer prospect, and accounting was just a checking account, a list of suppliers, a wall chart of upcoming projects and their due dates, and my appointment calendar for scheduling work hours. My MBA might have been of some limited value in the start-up (which sold small business accounting systems) when I was discussing accounting needs in business jargon with customers, but not a significant amount, and I was able to learn what I needed on the job. Connections: I already knew the people who became my customers, employees and suppliers in my own start-up, so my MBA alumni network would have been of no value at that time. Similarly, I was not responsible for finding new customers at the start-up I joined, and the network I developed would not have benefited me much at that time. Stage 2, First 10 years after MBA, Technical Management roles in a big company: Curricula: A lot of the MBA curriculum was extremely helpful for me in working for a large company (HP) and understanding a bit about all the jargon terminology of all the operations and the best practice models and systems commonly used to manage different functions of the business which I served: R&D, Marketing, Sales, Manufacturing, and Accounting. The MBA curriculum helped me talk intelligently to people in each functional area. The practical curricula I had in Operations Research, Statistics and Information Systems were directly useful for me on a daily basis to solve problems for each of these departments. Two functional areas I didn’t interact with were the Finance and Legal departments, so the Finance and Business Law curricula were mostly unused for those first 10 years. Connections: I wasn’t doing sales or marketing, and I wasn’t looking for a job at any time during this period, so my MBA Alumni network and connections didn’t help me much professionally in any of those activities. I was however as a hiring manager and often relied on my MBA connections at other companies to introduce me to candidates that I should interview, or to provide reference check information about candidates I was considering. I also ran speaker series to get my engineers regular access to thought leaders and experts in the fields we were working on. My MBA network was often instrumental in finding, contacting and persuading these experts to come talk to our team. Stage 3, 10+ years after my MBA. Senior Management Roles in Startups This was the stage of my career when my MBA was most valuable, both from a curricula and a connections standpoint. Curricula: As soon as I left a big company and began working as a senior executive or founder at start-ups, the curricula of most value to me changed. As I was doing more management level activities and less individual technical work, I found that the Operations Research and Information Systems curriculum became rarely used. The Information Systems curricula also became obsolete much faster, due to the high rate of change in Information Technologies (and the fact that most of my companies were continuing to push the innovation envelope in this area. The Operations Research knowledge I gained in my MBA program has been used occasionally over this latter stage to optimize manufacturing or distribution operations for some of the companies I joined or formed. If I had not learned how to do so, I might have hired a professional to do so for me. Doing it myself, just allowed my start-ups to be a bit leaner. Probability and Statistics curricula has always been great value to me. One of my start-ups developed cutting edge Bayesian network predictive analytics tools for big data. My Probability and Statistics knowledge was crucial to my being able to both manage the R&D team developing it, and in doing the product management to explain it and sell it. But even in my other businesses, I regularly use Probability and Statistics to forecast the future, do sampling for quality assessment, etc. Note: When I got my MBA in 1980, Bayesian Statistics was only briefly covered as theoretical grounding for probability and statistics. But those techniques were considered impractical for more than “toy” problems of fewer than 10 variables and a few thousand observations, because computer power needed to make the calculations for datasets with more variables or records was 1000 times what was available at the time. So, nearly all of my MBA class was focussed on use of Descriptive Statistics and understanding the implicit assumptions which, if false, might lead to misleading predictions. By the early 2000s that 1000x improvement in computer power had occurred, and desktop computers could be used to build Bayesian networks of up to about 100 variables on datasets of a million or so records (which is why I was involved in a predictive analytics startup at that time). Even though my course work did not spend much time on Bayesian Statistics, I got enough of an introduction to be fascinated by them and to recognize the opportunities to use them when the required power was finally available. As we approach 2020, we are nearing a 1 Million times improvement in performance by 1980, making use of Bayesian methods now practical for datasets with 100,000s of variables, and billions of records (Big Data). Even our mobile phones now have the power to use these methods. So, I would expect these methods and other machine learning techniques to be covered in a numerical methods and statistics course in much greater depth, and I think that would lead to more widespread use, and better predictions by managers educated in their use. Curricula that became newly important to me: As I moved more out of technical management into senior management, I found myself using more of what I had learned in the Organizational Management curriculum to motivate and manage more people. I used more of my Management of Innovation and R&D curriculum, because now that was usually my chief responsibility. Also Business Law and Intellectual Property (Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, and Trade secrets) Law became very important, as I now needed to make sure that our R&D was fully protected, and that we weren’t incurring liabilities of infringing other company’s property. Intellectual Property law and procedure can be very non-intuitive. Your Patent Attorney will happily explain all the confusing detail each time you talk if he or she is billing by the hour. But that’s a more expensive education than taking an MBA class or even just learning procedure from books like Patent It Yourself. Indeed, I regularly advise my technical entrepreneur clients to at least read such a book or take such a class even if they never expect to do it themselves and always plan to have a patent attorney draft patents for them - simply because once you understand the issues and procedures you can talk quickly and precisely with your attorney and avoid many of the landmines the patent office uses to become a fee machine that consumes your money. I also needed to make sure that we had proper Non-Disclosure, Confidentiality, Invention and Employment agreements with all our staff, so Labor Law curricula helped me avoid potential mistakes. Also, in addition to contracts with our employees, I had to negotiate licensing other company’s technology, or licensing our technologies, products or services to them. We had to develop sales contracts, terms of service and End User Legal Agreements. My Contract Law curriculum made it possible for me to interact with both our own attorneys and the other contractual parties, very efficiently. (Again, it is expensive to have your attorney’s having to educate you about how the law works when they are billing you by the hour!) With senior roles with Profit and Loss responsibility and managing annual budgets over a million dollars, Management Accounting became very important to me to identify where there were cost or revenue generation problems. I am glad that I learned the theory, and not merely the common practices, as it helped me understand why some management accounting practices can encourage naive managers to actually waste their money rather apply it usefully, as well described in The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement. Ironically, many people who regularly use management account due so with faith rather than understanding, and have to learn the theory to understand how make the accounting the servant to the manager and not the master of the manager. As I became involved in the fundraising activities, investor relations, and board meetings, my General Accounting and Financial Reporting curricula became very valuable to me, in preparing and assessing Balance Sheets, Income Statements and Sources and Uses of Funds statements. When I was creating financial forecasts for attracting investors to new companies I was founding, these were critical. Even if I was working with a CFO or accountant who was preparing these documents, there is a lot of back and forth that happens in the early days of projecting a start up’s future finances. As with my observation about how knowing basic law principles saves a lot of time and money when talking to lawyers, so too does knowing basic accounting save money when you are talking to professional accountants and tax preparers. As I became involved in founding and financing startups, understanding Finance and Investments from both an investor and from an entrepreneur standpoint became very critical. Knowing how to assess and compare different streams of cash spent and cash coming in over time (net present value, time value of money, internal rates of return, etc.) is crucial for sophisiticated investors like VCs to compare investment alternatives. Since start-up compete for funds from such investors, that makes it equally important to the founders putting together pitches and forecasts to know how they will compare. The more involved I am in raising funds, the more I rely on concepts I got from the Finance curriculum. Also rules about information efficiency, diversification, etc. guide my own personal investment planning. Over a long career, you are almost certain to see both highs and lows of business cycles. A shrinking economy means investors may choose to wait, or may panic about all risky investments and dump them in favor of cash and gold positions. If you are raising money, you may find the tap turned off suddenly as happened in the Dot Com Bust, and in the Great Recession Credit Crunch. You’ll probably see customers putting off purchases too, cutting your sales. Your suppliers may go under. Tariffs might help you get higher prices or sell more, or they might increase your costs. Inflation can increase your costs of borrowing or increase the amount of money your customers have to spend. Forewarned is forearmed, so it is good to be able to have good predictions for your forecasts of future growth. That’s where having enough exposure my Macro Economics curriculum has helped me most in understanding daily financial news. I also have to set prices for my own products and services, and to predict how competitors will behave. Will they match my rate cut? What happens if I don’t match theirs? That’s where my Micro Economics curriculum has helped. In the end, nothing happens in business until someone sells something to someone. Understanding how to find that someone, how to attract and persuade them, to develop relationships and retain trust, how to determine cost of customer acquisition and retention, and the lifetime value of a customer, is at the heart of every new venture I create. Much of that knowledge came from my Marketing curriculum Lastly, I should mention that my MBA included an Entrepreneurship curriculum. I think that curriculum really helped prepare me for how to write a business plan, and realistically understand the problems I would face as an entrepreneur. Connections: The minute I started working as a senior executive at start-ups that’s when I was really able to appreciate the value of the connections I formed in graduate school, and through the alumni network. I regularly use this network to find new opportunities, new employees, new customers, new suppliers, new distributors, new technologies, and especially to get warm intros to investors and other potential business partners. An alternative career: Sir Richard Branson has had far more entrepreneurial successes than I have, and has achieved a far larger net worth. Sir Richard lacks an MBA. That’s surely proof that it is not an absolute necessity to have an MBA to run your own successful start-up. In fact, Sir Richard explains he didn’t really understand the difference between Turnover (aka Gross Sales aka Revenue) and Net (aka Profit) until he was in his 50s!. That’s a very basic and important distinction taught at the beginning of any General Accounting or Financial Reporting class. Failure to be mindful of that distinction can lead to companies that are never profitable, or which are profitable, but face bankruptcy from a “cash crisis”. Had Sir Richard taken such a class he would surely have learned the difference far earlier, and maybe understood some discussions about his company’s finances a little faster or a little better. And he would be the first to encourage any entrepreneur to get some knowledge on such topics, whether via an MBA or through some other way. But clearly, lacking the understanding of even basic MBA curricula has not prevented Sir Richard’s success. And he does employ many people who do have that kind of exposure. So, you too might be able to succeed at your startup depending on others for what you don’t already know yourself.  Sir Richard also missed the opportunity to get the connections that attending a business school can provide you. But Sir Richard also has a way of easily creating his own connections, and that hasn’t held him back either. I confess that making connections is harder for me, but I appreciate their value and work at it very hard. I got a lot of valuable connections in my network simply as an alumni of a prominent business school, with vary little effort, and that was a good value for me. Summary: You don’t need an MBA to launch a start-up.For many small businesses it might not even help.If the school is prestigious it might open employment opportunities with big companies that compete for talented employees.Depending on what you are doing in your career you might find some of the technical courses of value early in your career, while completely different courses might be the valuable ones at a later time in your career.You will at least be able to talk efficiently and clearly with other MBAs, lawyers, accountants, economists, investors and other professionals once you learn the jargon of each of the disciplines. The larger your company, and the wider your scope of influence the more often you will have to talk to such people and the greater value that efficiency will have for you.If classroom learning isn’t your strong suit there are plenty of other ways to learn this material. Some employers may be a degree snob and require an MBA degree to hire you. But if you are starting your own business you don’t have to be that kind of employer, and you can hire yourself anyway. When no degree is required, you can spend time learning what you need at the time you need it.If you do get an MBA, choose the school thinking about the value of the connections it can create for you. The value of the connections that your MBA and school alumni network may increase as the scope of your startup or management responsibilities increase. At some point the value of those connections may be far more than the value of the curricula.",2021-03-05T11:34:17.251Z,"Do you need an MBA to start your own company? ",Quora

I used to write about JEE and technology, as these were the domains I knew about quite well. The key to great writing is producing quality content. As a beginner, your focus should be more on quality. When I started, I didn’t know anything about SEO, marketing, optimizing content, etc. All I did was focus on quality, authenticity, and making my content an interesting and useful read. Once you’ve decided your domain, you can register on sites like Upwork, Freelancer, etc. Although I never tried this, I have seen many people do this. However, I have heard that these platforms are very competitive. So I’ll tell you now what I used to do :D I used to search on the internet about the blogs of the domain I had decided to write on. Doing this search helped me find the companies who are looking for the content of the domain I wanted to write. I then directly used to reach out to these companies showing my interest in writing (if you find the email ID or LinkedIn profile of someone from the content marketing team, that’s a plus!). As and when I had got some experience and had really good content to showcase, I reached out to newer clients and showed them my previously written content (for other clients) before they would start to work with me. Approaching clients this way lead to a higher conversion rate for me. So, this answer was about how to start freelancing.

It helps to give you a solid grounding in design theory and practice, skills and aptitudes which help you in your profession, which is not expected in a short-term certification or diploma course. So, do not hesitate to take up a formal 3-4 years, of course, to do well and get good designing jobs. Many start-ups and many MNC companies are looking for freshers as graphic designer jobs in Bangalore or graphic designer jobs in Gurgaon, the cyber hub cities of India. 2# Upgrade your software skills Candidates in designing jobs should have knowledge of the use and application of different design-related software on laptops and tablets. Practical software training is necessary. While a formal academic course helps in understanding the principles and concepts, specific software skills in designing are also needed, which keep on upgrading time-to-time. So, candidates should know how to keep themselves updated in these software skills. The most commonly used design software includes Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and/or InDesign.

This way, too, you can start a network base, it adds an upper hand to your portfolio and you get noticed. Doing good work for a really good cause is itself a big reward. But make sure that people do not take advantage of your unpaid work. 5# Expand your network and online presence The idea of networking is an important way to get your name known in professional work. Create an impressive portfolio. Give a detailed description of the projects done so far. Elaborate on your designing skills. Attend job fairs to meet prospective employers. Social media helps to create an impressive professional network online. 6# Never hesitate to take up half-done projects Remember to consider your peers not as rivals but as a support network.

From there on, you’ll see its a straight forward exam which tries to gauge how much you are aware of and apply widely accepted project management practice. As there will be many practical scenario questions in the exam, you don't have to worry about knowing all concepts word by word. I’ll share my 10 step experience for comparison. After completing 35 contact hours course, I could not take exam for about a year due to personal reasons. So a year after [STEP 1] I scheduled my exam as a first activity by paying the fee. This helped planning my approach as the clock starting ticking. Prefer to choose early morning time slot for your exam as you’ll be fresh and have rest of the day to party after passing exam. As I’ve already completed 35 contact hours course, I prepared a one page cheat sheet [STEP 2], which contains the knowledge area and process group table along with all the formulas and terminologies the I tend to forgot. [STEP 3] I started to recreate this cheat sheet every day without looking at the source and clocked how much time it took to complete. Over a course of 20 to 30 days of practice, I managed to reproduce this sheet correctly in under 7 to 9 minutes. As the exam has 200 questions, you wont have much time thinking deep to recollect tough formulas, list/orders or flow of knowledge areas and processes groups; this sheet will be handy. Now comes the actual preparation for the exam. After choosing a material (PMBOK, Rita Mulcahy, prep guides or others.) [STEP 4] please stick to it. Since all you are trying to do is to understand why those knowledge areas are placed under those process groups and how the tools/techniques help sail a project; one material will help you a lot rather then referring multiple materials. Read thru each knowledge areas and [STEP 5] immediately solve at lease 200 to 300 questions specifically on that knowledge area; you can find many websites offering knowledge area specific questions and answers. This will help you experiencing the kind of questions you’ll get in exam. Step 5 should be done during the last 2–3 weeks prior to your exam. [Step 6] During these weeks you should also take full 4 hours exam in one go, this will help overcome fatigue and exertion. Do this at least 2 to 3 times to get comfortable. [STEP 7] Night before the exam, get good sleep. Many fail here and get exhausted the next day, you’ll need all the energy to get thru. On the way to your exam centre, [STEP 8] refer your cheat sheet to recollect all concepts. of course avoid self driving or being late to avoid unnecessary panics. PMP exam starts with 15 minutes of instructions about the exam; this 15 minutes is not included on your 4 hours. You’ll need only about 4 to 7 minutes to run thru the instructions if you are a swift reader.  [STEP 9] You should use rest of the time to recreate your cheat sheet (step 3 comes handy here) on the rough paper that the exam centre provides. It should be easy as the contents will be fresh on your mind. Once you run out of 15 minutes of instruction time, whether you press start button or not, the exam starts with the first question and your clock starts ticking. As you’ll mark few questions to revisit, [STEP 10] keep a checkpoint after every 50 questions to look back how many questions you’ve marked for revisit. This will allow planning your pace and time allocation at the end to revisit marked questions. Final suggestion - Even if you’ve answered all questions and have few minutes left, do not rethink on the questions you’ve already answered. This will unnecessarily stir confusion/doubt and make you to relook at those questions. This approach helped me and I wish it could help you too. All the best preparing and becoming a certified Project Management Professional.

I used to ask this question to almost every person I met; my friends, family, relatives, everybody. But sadly, no one could give a suitable answer. Not just in school, when I completed my graduation, I was confused about which college to choose? I am from a small city and wasn’t exposed to this fast world. So I needed guidance. After completing my post-graduation, I was confused about whether I should go for the core job (related to my degree) or should I follow my passion for writing & digital marketing? Almost at every stage of my life, I needed guidance and support from the ones who have complete knowledge of the market, who can make me realize what my strengths are and what career path I should choose. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find such a person. Not just me, this story is applicable for the majority of people in India; those who were a student or are living a student life. In our country, it’s difficult to find proper guidance or you can say career counselling. People think ‘Counselling’ is a bad thing and society wouldn’t accept someone who has been counseled. However, the reality is every student needs career counselling. They should be aware of their strengths and weaknesses; what they are capable of and what career path would be the best choice for them. Today, our Indian government also understands this requirement. In the current times, India needs more than 1.5 million career counselors to cater to 360 million students. Therefore, it’s important to guide students, make them aware of what they can do and what they can’t. This is why career counselling is important. Hope this answers your question.
