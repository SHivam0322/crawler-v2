Before the advent of the internet data was was stored in the data centers and access to it was very controlled.  Only people within an office premise could access the data from company issued devices (desktops, laptops, dumb terminals).  Access to office premises and data centers was controlled via access cards, keys, security guards, etc.  If there were communications between companies, it was done via private lines and the controls were similar across organizations. Fast forward to the internet era.  It can be thought of as moving your organization from a gated community to a non-gated community.   The physical boundaries of the data access layer have been pushed beyond the physical office premises using internet as the transport.  Properties on the internet are accessible by anyone from anywhere.  As a result the number of threat vectors have increased exponentially. In my opinion this is where cybersecurity comes in.  Although the security controls within the data center have not changed much but the security controls to protect the data access layer exposed to the internet is constantly changing and so is the the threat landscape. The inherent risks can be placed in two buckets: Internet Property Environment:Web server configuration issues/vulnerabilitiesWeb application programming issues/vulnerabilitiesFirewall configuration issues/vulnerabilitiesRouter configuration issues/vulnerabilitiesIDS/IPS configuration issues/vulnerabilitiesApplication firewall configuration issues/vulnerabilitiesSecurity Incident detection & response issuesetc..End user environment, the environment the use uses to access the Internet property:Handheld device OS configuration issues/vulnerabilitiesHandheld device application configuration issues/vulneratilitiesAbove two points can be extended to laptop, and desktop configuration issues/vulnerabilitiesUsers own password management methodology, if this is weak, no state of the art technology can prevent the aftermath.Users awareness of how to navigate the internet, and ability to distinguish good from the bad.In a nutshell every  Information Security team should have a dedicated cybersecurity team to stay on top of the above two risks.

I’m going to tell you the path to become a professional in the field of cyber security ( This is my Honest Opinion). Problem : Just a Beginner. Goal : Cyber Security Professional. We Indians lack most of what other developed nations might have - Time with a computer since childhood. Our generation is relatively new with computers and for a 10th class or a 12th class student Networks, Databases, OS are few things unheard of (Not all, but most states). With this situation prevailing in the country I guess, the best solution to deal this is to interact with the Computer in a very productive and daily fashion. I’m answering this keeping in mind the person has very minimal knowledge. Step 1 : Get used to installing Games , Softwares ( Cracking ) , uninstalling Malwares etc which would require you to understand how a program is loaded into the PC and how to eliminate it when unnecessary. Step 2: Browse through few FB pages, Blogs, Web sites about Tricks and Tips for Windows, Android, SMS tricks, Bash scripts etc. Mind it these tricks are basic building blocks to Hacking. ( Not Cyber Security yet but we shall get there ) Step 3: Easier step when you’re familiar with few tricks now show them off to your friends and also, try to help your friends and relatives as much as possible with their problems in Mobile Phones or Computers or whatsoever ! This will help you understand Trouble-Shooting problems and trust me it’s a real help. Step 4: Now you’re into the Basic Knowledge of Hacking from Minimal to Basic is a good leap. I would suggest now you start getting into Cyber Security stuff, it starts here with first getting to know few terms in the field such as Malwares, Attacks, Phishing etc. Always be updated with HackingNews website, they’re AWESOME ! Step 5: You can use YouTube and few good sites out there like NullByte (just google them) There are many tutorials out there for you to try and learn step by step. I would say start from learning how to install an OS to a small metasploit attack. This step is gonna take lots of research and your interest will build up as much as you learn. Do you know why? Because the Fun has just begun ! Step 6: Now you should be familiar with OS (installing) , Few tricks up the sleeve, Few tutorials here and there in mind. Actual Security will start now.Tip 1: Always google for the term you encounter the first time, like EXT4 while installing Linux just google it, understand the hell out of it. Tip 2: Start learning a Course whether it is Linux, or HTML or C or whatever just start ! Tip 3: Always practice what you have learnt. Theory <<<< Practice. Step 7: Dude, you’re half way down to achieving what you wanted, just keep your focus on important stuff and the import stuff lies in Linux, Networks, Hardware, OS, Programming, Scripting. If you learn them you’re a professional already but the Security part lies the LoopHoles and issues associated with the courses you learn. Welcome to the world of Cyber Security.Cybrary - Online Cyber Security Training, Free, Forever is the place you need to start from. Step 8: Always think like a Hacker ! You should be like “ Where’s the loophole, how can I get in, what mistake did the programmer do?” etc.Now download a C|EH study guide or a video tutorial course from places you can easily google. Tip 4: Always Always and Always maintain a Running notes when you’re watching a video or reading a book. Step 9: Take up a certification exam , try your level best to achieve it with good score. Sec+ is a good certification to start with. Meanwhile if it’s possible on the other hand it is in best interest you take a Computer Science degree, all the things you learn online on your own start to unveil as you progress in your degree. Step 10: Congrats you are a certified security professional already by now.Attend Security conferences and conventions in India in the year and keep yourself updated and meet new professionals all over the world. The Key is if you know how to make, you’ll better know how to break! Dedication and loads of enthusiasm is very much required as a pre-requisite for what I’ve written above. The Hacker News — Cyber Security, Hacking News Home - HackersOnlineClub http://www.null-byte.wonderhowto.com Learn Pentesting Online Welcome to SecurityTube.net Few links I have provided and the rest is up to you ! I have provided the best way I could think of and have followed my own, I have just mentioned the path to become a Cyber Security Professional , you could ask me in comments about any step I mentioned in particular, I would be more than happy to answer you!

You have to get passed HR. I personally don’t have a very high opinion of HR when it comes to technology roles, there are a few exceptional individuals, but generally they don’t have much clue and just follow the bouncing ball. The issue for working in any sizeable organisation is that you have to tick the boxes before you can even get to an interview. I recommend you find a small IT business who does some networking and a little bit of security on the side, arrange a meeting with the guy in charge and convince him to give you a go as a casual (what that means is when they have work they pay you to do it, when they don’t have anything you’re on your own) There are a number of top universities who put all their course material on-line, here is your opportunity to “audit” a university degree when you have available time. Every bit of work you can get goes on your resume. Keep trying to get the next job and step up to more interesting roles. Once you have sufficient academic knowledge find yourself a subject of interest and write an academic paper and use it at a meeting you arrange with the nearest credible university to show capability and explain that you need a scholarship (try for a Grad Cert or Masters based on demonstrated ability and experience) it may take a few goes. Do this diligently and inside 7 years you can have an advanced degree and career in cyber security, all starting our self taught. Probably not what anybody starting out wants to hear “7 years of hard work” but seriously it will go in the blink of an eye. I’ve been around this industry since 1988 and have learned a thing or two.

Certifications DO NOT matter. I repeat certifications do not matter. Certifications are like icing on the cake but without cake you have no value for icing. So to answer your question how can you get a job as a cyber security expert, it depends on lot of things 1. Your background 2. Your interest (red team versus blue team: red team attacks and blue team defends and both are equally important) 3. Market/job opportunity You can be an inch deep and miles wide in security or you can be inch wide and miles deep. For example there are different skill set required based on at which layer(network, OS,application , data) you are providing security. For example 1. Network security (IPS, proxy, web filtering, email filtering, firewall, APT detection, next gen firewall and so on ) 2. Endpoint security (mostly desktops,mobile and laptops) 3. Application security (code review, white box testing, black box testing and all three requires different kind of skill sets) 4. Server security (web server, application server, database servers) 5. Data security ( encryption, DRM, tokenization, compliance , data classification and policies and so forth) 6. Network forensics or endpoint forensics 7. Incident response and security monitoring 8 malware analysis and reversing 9. Hardware hacking (p0wning IoT devices smart meters, phones or Barbie dolls for fun) 10. Surveillance (man in the middle for cell phones, sessions , cookie stealing, and so on) These are some of the high level buckets you have to think about and what matches your background. But before you do that I would strongly advice following . 1. Read the entire TCP/IP illustrated volume I and when you finish it, read it one more time. If you can't finish the whole book atleast read first 10 chapters. You can thank me later. 2. Read basics of port scanning on Port Scanning Basics this will give you an idea on how the first stage of attack is (reconnaissance) is conducted. 3. Read up on cyber kill chain Title 4. Download kali from Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Linux Distribution and learn the tools by testing it on your own servers or desktops. DO NOT scan or run any attack tools from Kali on the digital asset you do not own. Laws are strict. 5. Once you are familiar with Kali and tools, Start with CTF (capture the flag) and try and solve few challenges. CTF365: Capture the Flag Now you have basics to conquer any advanced stuff in network and data security. For application security specially for white box testing or security code review you should have some programming background. Application security , malware reversing and security monitoring are really hot. Depending on the vertical you choose data security and compliance can be really in demand for example financial , healthcare or retail. Last but not least, there are ton of books on the topics I mentioned above , and ton of material on Phrack Magazine ::. Which is really advance. Now after all this if you say on top of this I have CISSP or CISA then it holds some water but it won't automatically get you a job just because you are CISSP . By the way there is an inside joke within security community but may be will table that for some other time. Good luck and I promise, you will never ever be bored in security.

The market for infosec professionals is so wild, that it’ll eat almost anyone with any interest in security and some technical acumen. Software engineers can easily become information security specialists … and they bring a lot to the table, for organisations that need that kind of skill set. The work required for software engineer/programmer to become security specialist will vary a lot depending on the person and their existing skills, aspirations and predispositions. If you are a software engineer, then I would recommend to learn more about application security and then move into secure software engineering roles. While in that position, your goal should be to gain exposure to technologies and security processes. This will make it easier for you to switch between other professions within the cybersecurity industry. If for example you’re a software QA engineer and you know how to test software, it doesn’t take much to start including security tests in your day to day work. It will allow you to realize after a couple of months that you’ve gotten the grasp of quite a few security issues! If you’re a network engineer, then it makes sense to learn more about infrastructure and network security in order to move into positions such as network security engineer, incident response engineer, or a network penetration tester. This approach should help you if you want to transition into cyber security at low cost and low anxiety. It makes it easier to make that transition, because if you have a solid background in building something it will come easier to you to figure out how to break it and secure it. If you’re comfortable in a given specialisation, you won’t feel scared of the amounts of new knowledge you’ll need to possess and this will lower stress to ease you into the learning process. So a software engineer who wants to transition into security role, should try applying security principles to whatever they’re currently doing — try to learn how to break the things they’ve built, and then how to make them more secure and impenetrable as possible. If you reiterate enough, you can become a security-savvy engineer who can easily add ‘security’ in front of their existing job title and becoming a security specialist in any given field. I would suggest adding some good eye opening resources to your knowledge base. One that holds value for all types of security operations is learning about basic Security Architecture Principles. And then learning more depending on which fields of cybersecurity you want to explore. Here are some great materials for Web and Mobile Applications: OWASP TOP10OWASP Application Security Verification Standard(ASVS)OWASP Security Code Review GuideOWASP Web Applications Testing GuideOWASP Mobile Testing GuideNetwork and Infrastructure Security: Fantastic Security+ course from Professor Messer to widen your horizonsStudying security benchmarks, to learn how systems should be hardenedAny renowned book on Penetration Testing, to learn offensive mindsetBut the most foolproof and effective methods of learning security skills to me is doing the following: google stuff out. Start doing some fundamental research in your craft and google is your best friend here, and always will be. Sooner you learn the art of googling, is better because we use it a ton in our day to day work. If you’re writing code in C++, then google “C++ security vulnerabilities”, or “writing secure code in C++”. If you’re deploying apps in cloud, such as AWS, then google “how to secure AWS applications”, “secure deployments in AWS” and so on. Learn as much as you can from search results and from the latest news, this will expand your security expertise as time goes by. This way you’ll learn security skills relevant to what you’re currently doing and keep up with the latest cybersecurity trends, which will allow you to live and breath that knowledge and put it to practice in your projects. You can become valued security professional from any IT specialization I often get a question on how to become a security professional. And my answer is – by becoming a professional in any other field, or by working your way up from anything you’re currently doing. Reverse engineer requirements from job offers in your area and learn what they want you to know. Then strike at them as soon as you feel comfortable with your skills. Research & reverse engineer job offers & learn & practice & go on interviews & understand what you were missing and why they haven’t accepted you & learn the missing pieces & rinse & repeat until you get a job. Appreciate the journey and don’t underestimate the value of having a varied background, do it all at the beginning because you’ve got time. I started my adventure in IT from the very bottom, working as a computer technician, network admin, web programmer, and system administrator. After many years, I got involved in security. I do not regret the time I spent in previous positions because taking an indirect path provided many valuable experiences, all of which gave me perspective. My range of experience allows me to understand the problems many employees face, enabling me to make better decisions for the companies and teams I work with. I believe the security industry could benefit greatly from more diversity However, if we’re considering a position where you have zero experience in security whatsoever, but have experience in other fields of IT, then I recommend becoming an expert in a different field. Start applying security concepts to your field of specialization. This has worked for so many talented professionals I know. Too many people want to get into security without prior experience in anything IT related. This doesn’t make most of them very valuable professionals because they tend to make myopic decisions without considering business context. Security is merely an addition to business operations, designed to support its longevity. It doesn’t exist on its own. You can read pentesting and bug bounties blogs, but pasting random payloads without deep understanding will prevent you from contributing much to your organization. Dive deep into anything you learn, stay curious, and enjoy ‘expert’ status in a few years. Here are a few viable and popular career options: Web App Security Tester – Some skill in coding is good. It’s not necessary, but it is beneficial and it’s usually what separates wannabe experts from true experts. Learn how software stacks work and get a handle on web programming languages like Java, PHP and their respective frameworks. To break something and improve its resiliency afterward, you should understand how it all works. Once you review all the OWASP resources, you’ll know what to do next Network Security – Simple bash/perl/python/ruby coding if any. Create a local lab network consisting of various components. Deploy services like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and research how to secure each element. While building, study what issues can arise during configuration and maintenance so you know what to avoid and how to test them when sysadmins hadn’t the time, interest or knowledge to do so. Then, focus on PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) Technical Guidelines to discover ways in which penetration testers and hackers can attack your network. Reverse engineer their methods to build proper defenses against future attacks. Compliance and Auditing – Zero programming skill required for most roles. Learn about underlying technology and business models. You want to understand how businesses operate so you can protect them and ensure new regulations don’t hinder company innovation. Grab some good business books and gain business exposure by learning from executives and managers with real-world experience. Study industry best practices, like those from the Center for Internet Security, as well as regulated standards like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, DISA STIG, ISO 27001, SOC2 to understand how to make your organization compliant without negatively impacting productivity. Cryptographer/Cryptoanalyst – Depending on a chosen niche, coding may be just an addition for tests of implementations, protocols and algorithms cracking. If you want to become an expert in this field, I recommend attending a university with strong mathematical and cryptography programs. This is a fascinating field that requires prior and substantial mathematical knowledge, so if you go through heavy math, learning to code will be your least worry Security Consultant – Depending on the context, most roles require zero coding, some require some. This position will help you gain experience working in IT or IT security, so you can understand the business and broaden your horizons. If you decide that you want to stay in consulting, research what big companies are doing, technology they use, and regulations they’re subject to, then learn how to manage these for them. Vulnerability Researcher – All-in or ZERO. This narrow specialization requires focus in at least one field. Become proficient in at least one programming language, framework, and operating system. Then focus on a narrow set of functions in a given product or service. Examples include studying assembly, C programming language, learning how video transcoding works, and identifying weak spots in a library such as FFmpeg. Zero coding is required if you want to be a bug bounty hunter, who keep calling themselves “vulnerability researchers” Software Security Expert – Software engineers often become security experts. Be proficient in at least one technology stack, then apply all relevant security knowledge to making products safer. Strengthen security across your organization, responding to the demands of your colleagues and customers. If you want to speed up the process of becoming values security professional, pick technology that truly interests you and learn as much as you can about it. So instead of being Web App pentester, become a Node.JS security expert. Be a specialist, not a generalist. Go for a narrow niche. Find something that sparks your curiosity and become passionate about it. Know things only 0.01% of people using the technology knows and your pockets won’t be able to hold amounts of money companies will pour into it The most important advice here is to look for employment as soon as possible because nothing can beat the quality of learning you get on the real job. It’s the actual job and job market that shows you what is required and what is not. Almost ZERO programming experience required for Penetration Testers Don’t get me wrong, pentester who knows how to program and code is invaluable, but some pentesters are such great manual testers that they will find a great employment no matter what. Despite the current state of pentesting in US where actually cool stuff is happening, you still have 95% of countries who’re a decade behind in terms of their cybersecurity posture, and in there all you need is to study OWASP Testing Guide to fill your pockets big time. Let’s consider a few scenarios and then jump to job specific recommendations. If you already have some security experience, then check out a few renowned books that are highly rated on Amazon with the title containing word “Pentesting” to build your foundation. Then go for an Offensive Security’s lab and certification – OSCP, which as of now is the most respected entry-level certification for penetration testers. Consume as much content as you can, but don’t allow yourself to get lost in the universe of theory. The best pentesters are those who put their knowledge into practice and get their hands dirty. If don’t have security experience but work in other IT fields, then the recommendation is for you to become an expert in a different field and then start applying security concepts to your field of specialization. That route worked for many great people working in the industry that I know. If you’re a Java programmer, study how you can test applications written in Java. If you’re an IT OPS engineer deploying services in the cloud(AWS/GCP/Azure) then learn about potential security issues and learn how to pentest those services. Learning will come much easier if you have the proper background. If you haven’t ever worked in IT, but want to work in security, well this one is tricky and hard because general security isn’t an entry-level role. Too many people want to get into security without prior experience with anything IT-related, which doesn’t make them very valuable professionals because lots of decision they make are myopic and don’t consider business context. You can get easily get excited reading pentesting and bug bounties blogs, but as long if you’re just pasting random payloads without deep understanding of a matter, then you’re not contributing much to your organization. Same way you won’t get a sixpack by reading about pushups, you won’t become a great penetration tester without going into the field and testing stuff.So go deep in anything you learn about, and enjoy ‘expert’ status in just a few years. And now let’s take a look at some of your options when you’re completely fresh to the field. Web/Mobile App Pentester – Learn how to code. It’s not necessary, but beneficial and that’s what usually differentiates expert wannabes and true experts. Learn how software stacks work to get a grasp of web programming languages such as Java, PHP and their respective frameworks. To break something and improve, then it’s the resiliency afterwards you should understand how it all works. It doesn’t mean you must be a guru software engineer, but you can’t go wrong knowing the basics.Once you’ve completed all the resources from OWASP you’ll know what to do next. Network/Desktop Apps Pentester – Create a local lab of a network with various components in it. Deploy some services such as LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and then google out how to secure each of those elements. While building, study what issues can arise during the configuration and further maintenance, so you know what issues to avoid and how to test them in the future in other environments where sysadmins hadn’t had time, the interest or knowledge to secure their instances the way you could. Navigate to PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) Technical Guidelines and see what are the ways penetration testers and hackers could potentially attack your network, then reverse engineer their attack methods and build defenses so they attacks no longer work. Specialized Pentester – Pick one technology and go as deep as you can. So instead of being a Web App Pentester, become Node.JS Security Expert. Become a specialist instead of being a generalist and cut the learning process in half or even more. Find something you’re curious about, learn more about it, and become passionate about the field, put in a few solid years of dedication, and you’ll get whatever you want to have. (Well, not precisely everything you want, but you get the point) Red Teamer – All of the above recommendations apply including social engineering and physical security attacks. You may not have the technical predispositions to be a great web pentester, but if you have been gifted with empathy and social skills then you can still achieve a lot! There are hundreds of blogs of people who documented their journey, and I recommend you to look into real world examples of people who’ve moved into a pentesting career. Learning from the successes and mistakes of others is very cost-effective. Also, I’ll recommend you a bulletproof method of finding a job as a pentester. An importance most people don’t realize: Find a few dozens of pentesting job offers in your areaExtract the most common requirements, both high level and detailed technical skillsKnow what to study and what employers really needDon’t waste time on learning everything. Learn the minimum possible to get the job and be a valuable team member. From there your career is highly malleable, you can adapt to what your organization needs you to do.So yeah, you can flourish in the infosec field without having more than one week of study in programming. The market is the ultimate judge. Some companies require programming skills as a must-have, and some don’t care. Find what suits you best and keep on rockin’! No, not at all. It will be definitely beneficial, but necessary? By no means. Demand for development skills in infosec is raising, but the demand for general infosec specialists is growing even higher. I know many fantastic security professionals, who just hate programming. They’ll code a bit to help themselves, to build some simple automation for their tasks, but they’d never write any serious application. The market for infosec professionals is so wild, that it’ll eat almost anyone with any interest in security and some technical acumen.

In today’s context where malware attacks and cyber threats are constantly growing, companies want a qualified cybersecurity professional to manage their security infrastructure and protect their assets. So, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is growing and does not look like it is going to go down anytime soon. Therefore, it is natural for many freshers to want to involve themselves in the cybersecurity field. However, it is important to note that making a name for yourself in the cybersecurity domain is not easy. There are many different cybersecurity certifications available from many different vendors worldwide. However, the best 4 cybersecurity certifications for freshers that I would recommend are:  1. CompTIA Security+ The CompTIA Security+ is one of the well-known cybersecurity certifications in the world. It is delivered by CompTIA, an organization that has a well-established reputation in the IT market. The certification covers many different topics of security and information assurance. These topics include network security, threats, and vulnerabilities, cryptography, data security, risk management, etc. It costs around US$ 311. You can get the jobs like network administrator, security administrator, security specialist, etc with the CompTIA Security+ certification. 2. GIAC Information Security Fundamentals (GISF) The GISF certification is designed mostly for the information security officers, security managers, and systems engineers who involve themselves in the field of cybersecurity. The certification gives you a good overview of the security principles and techniques, backup recovery, security policies, and other related topics. It is considered more difficult than the CompTIA Security+ but contains similar kinds of topics as that of the Security+ certification. 3. Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA): Security Fundamentals The Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Security Fundamentals is a cybersecurity certification that is especially geared towards cybersecurity freshers. It is an entry-level certification mostly designed for high-school and college students who want to start their careers in cybersecurity. The certification tests and validates your knowledge of the core principles of information security, network security, and operating system basics. The certification exam costs around US$ 127 and it is recommended that you have some hands-on knowledge of Windows Server, Windows-based networking firewalls, software, and other related products. 4. Certified Informations Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Ok, this one is not really a certification made for freshers. However, I could not sit this one out. It is because you cannot mention cybersecurity certifications without mentioning the CISSP certification. The Certified Informations Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is one of the most widely recognized, reputable, challenging, and beneficial cybersecurity certifications out there. Given by the vendor ISC2, the CISSP certification tests your overall knowledge on becoming a cybersecurity professional. Having a CISSP certification means that you are a highly qualified security professional and can handle the security mechanism of an organization perfectly. The reputation of CISSP certification a few years ago was such that by just showing that you have the certification, you would get a highly paid security job without any interview. The CISSP is one of the most challenging cybersecurity certification exams which is 6 hours long. And it also requires at least 5 years of proven experience as a security professional to sit in. But getting the certification is well worth it to improve your career in the cybersecurity field. These were the top 4 best certifications for cybersecurity freshers. Good luck! Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing domain in Information Technology. In today’s context where malware attacks and cyber threats are constantly growing, companies want a qualified cybersecurity professional to manage their security infrastructure and protect their assets. So, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is growing and does not look like it is going to go down anytime soon.

I am sure that the job can be routine at times; on the whole I would find it a fascinating field because it is constantly changing as new loopholes are discovered, new technologies deployed, and humans are endlessly inventive. My main problem with cyber security is the ethics of it. Basically you are protecting one entity against other entities. You must be very sure you are protecting the right entity, in the right way, from the right people. Sometimes it takes security professionals a while to discover that they are in fact protecting the wrong things from the wrong people, and if they do discover that, because security professionals are in a trusted position, the penalties for following your conscience usually are prison sentences or worse. Cyber security can be very political, and you must have an ability to deal with that.

That’s what makes a good security nerd; it isn’t all about book learning.Study for your certification exams, but don’t obsess. For example, the CISSP exam is generally no more than 5% cryptologic. So, think about your time invested there. It’s the domain that most people fret about. You can bomb on crypto and still pass the exam. No one expects you to know the math behind the algorithms (some of it is classified, anyway); know what’s good and bad about things like PKI, symmetric vs. asymmetric, etc. Obsessing generally means you’re missing the point (like that hot chick you sweated at school, but she was a total b*tch - not worth it).Don’t get fired up. security is a fairly cerebral discipline. When people get fired up about a security incident, the key phrase is “slow down.” Yes, you may need to take some assets offline pronto. That’s ok (and often prudent). You may have to rebuild servers (I hope you have good backups). Panic is rarely a good thing.Just a few thoughts from an older(ish) salt. I wish you luck.

This list is likely more helpful to laypeople who (like me just several months ago) know virtually nothing about cyber security. Thinking about Cybersecurity: From Cyber Crime to Cyber Warfare by Paul Rosenzweig (available in audio book format) An excellent lecture series that covers, among many topics: Concepts like what a DDOS attack is, what a zero-day exploit/vulnerability is, etc.Comparison of vandalism/crime, espionage, and warfare to their kinetic analogsContinue ReadingI’m offering a list of books that recently helped me build a basic foundation of knowledge on cyber security across a variety of topics. This list is likely more helpful to laypeople who (like me just several months ago) know virtually nothing about cyber security. Thinking about Cybersecurity: From Cyber Crime to Cyber Warfare by Paul Rosenzweig (available in audio book format) An excellent lecture series that covers, among many topics: Concepts like what a DDOS attack is, what a zero-day exploit/vulnerability is, etc.Comparison of vandalism/crime, espionage, and warfare to their kinetic analogs and showing how difficult it is to distinguish between them in the cyber-world.An even-handed account of the pros and cons of government regulation for the purpose of balancing security and privacy. Dr. Rosenzweig tends to just state the facts and allow you to draw your own conclusions.Tips for improving information security, like ideas on how to create stronger passwords. He mentions, for example, considering a line from a book or movie that you can remember, taking the first letter from each word, and having these letters form your password (with capitalization here and there while also throwing in some numbers and symbols).Industry of Anonymity: Inside the Business of Cybercrime by Jonathan Lusthaus An excellent summary, based on academic research, of what’s known about cybercrime and cybercriminals. It’s helpful to also read Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground by Kevin Poulsen and Spam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime — from Global Epidemic to Your Front Door by Brian Krebs because the events in these books are often referenced. One interesting topic was trends in the use of cybercriminals’ online handles. One mentioned trend was how younger, less experienced cybercriminals used longer, flashier-sounding handles while the older and more experienced ones often truncated and simplified theirs. Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking by Christopher Hadnagy This is a “how to” book covering psychological principles of influence and manipulation. It contains several colorful stories of how Hadnagy gained entrance to buildings, past security, as unauthorized personnel and tricked people into offering sensitive login details. During the course of this, he explains pretexting, impersonation, phishing, vishing, and SMiShing. Finally, Hadnagy also provides tips and recommendations for those who’re interested in establishing a career as a social engineer. He describes how to get started and offers suggestions on how to go about deciding what to charge for your services. The Fifth Domain: Defending Our Country, Our Companies, and Ourselves in the Age of Cyber Threats by Richard A. Clarke, Robert K Knake What I really appreciated about this book was the chapter which dispelled some myths about the cyber security workforce gap. Essentially, due to the manner in which the demand for cyber security workers is portrayed in the media, many think they can just study up, earn their credentials, and then enter the field. However, this book describes how the bulk of the demand is associated with mid-level, not entry-level, positions. The book also delves into the need to delineate a path and help guide people who’re looking to switch, mid-career, to a career in cyber security. Digital World War: Islamists, Extremists, and the Fight for Cyber Supremacy by Haroon Ullah This provides a good overview of how the Internet and rise of social media impacted the Middle East politically (e.g., Arab Spring) as well as how extremist groups use social media to recruit. It offers a lot of details on how social media-savvy recruiters have become in the use of various tools, knowing how to put on an approachable, human face, to the group, and engaging in profiling individuals for recruitment outreach. I’m open to receiving other recommendations from those with deeper knowledge in cyber security!",2021-03-06T09:57:27.139Z,"What is the best book to learn about computer security? ",Quora

In spite of the fact that advancement is in no way, shape or form another idea, after some time it's developed to incorporate something other than item and administration development. It is turned into another perspective, working, and living and an important way to quicken an association's advanced change venture, guaranteeing they stay focused on their commercial center. The consistently advancing danger scene, and expanding consistence necessities and security dangers are driving more noteworthy degrees of cyber security development. More organizations are looking to execute developing answers to support their digital flexibility. Legacy methods and tools require cyber security innovations Ready to accept that inheritance strategies and devices are still generally compelling at giving a strong establishment to enable associations to relieve the test of cyber security. Most assaults can be avoided with fundamental security controls(Ahram, et. al. 2017). Be that as it may, strategies change, and malevolent on-screen characters are continually growing new assault techniques. Business pioneers ought to guarantee that their fundamental controls stay viable, yet in addition grasp imaginative arrangements on the off chance that they give a solid match and convey genuine business esteem. Moreover, they should continue improving security capacities for the accompanying reasons: As advanced change quickens inside all enterprises, the expanding business worth is being made on the internet. Cyber security is crucial to winning your clients' trust, and guaranteeing that your association's notoriety is not harmed because of a security break. It's additionally essential to recall that inheritance techniques and instruments are just viable on the off chance that they're appropriately conveyed and worked (AlDairi, 2017). Difficulties related to sending and activities are heightening because of the expanded multifaceted nature and size of associations' IT surroundings, just as the lack of talented security specialists. Therefore, the developments in mechanized security tasks will turn out to be always basic. The evolutionary view of the trend in Cyber security innovations for the future With dangers winding up progressively unpredictable, moving from essential assaults against one gadget too convoluted assaults against each gadget on an association's system, customary security just isn't sufficient in the period of digitalization Thinking back 30 years, heads of IT had a similarly lucky assignment when it came to cyber security (Blowers, 2015) . In spite of the fact that the activity was in no way, shape or form a stroll in the recreation centre, at any rate, there was a sure straightforwardness given the moderately modest number of gadgets they expected to secure. With the sharp increment in its utilization propels in the work environment, driven by the requirement for associations to demonstrate progressively coordinated and adaptable, there has been a torrential slide in the quantity of endpoints and potential ways for cybercriminals. Access frameworks business. In this manner, the whole computerized combat area has progressed and demonstrated to be unquestionably shockingly dynamic. Current security gatherings must devise new methodologies to battle the hazards driven against their interconnected hazard frameworks (Chertoff & Simon, 2015). Before the fight against cybercriminals was viewed as a worry for the IT division, yet the generally recorded break at Sony in 2014 put cybercrime at the highest point of the business plan. Associations understood that a break, bargain or assault could majorly affect business execution, brand discernment and – in particular – the monetary main concern. Security has turned into a major issue that has required managing and checking the perils, a business need. Regardless, even after Sony's attack, security had not turned into the worry at the present board level (Chuen, 2015). Later assaults, for example, the devastating WannaCry and later NotPetya ransom ware episodes have featured that an assault should not be against a particular association to make disorder and cost millions. For WannaCry's situation, this assault influenced enormous associations, for example, the NHS, Telefonica and other huge global undertakings, overwhelming everything in the vicinity. On the off chance that board individuals were not considering the requirement for better cyber security resistances previously, they surely are present (Efthymiopoulos, 2016). Changes in guideline and consistence necessities – close by a superior comprehension of the potential reputational danger of a rupture – have featured why security must be top of the plan, for the board, however for each representative and provider. Considering this, there have been three key movements have occurred in the wake of late enormous scale digital assaults: Security has moved past IT No longer simply the worry of the IT nerd in the private cabin, security presently impacts everybody and has an extensive view. Its frame of reference is completely connected to business tasks – regardless of whether nearby, territorial or even worldwide – and each division it contacts (Evans, 2016). It has the ability to separate the storehouses that undertakings regularly work inside; expanding cooperation crosswise over offices, so resources that need ensuring are recognized, decreasing the effect of a future assault. Be that as it may, its arrive at stretches past the bounds of the centre of the business, out to the edge where information (held in the cloud, on cell phones and created by IoT) is in travel and possibly a moving digital objective. Versatile endeavours are utilizing computerized change and that affects how they additionally use security – connecting it back to business targets; empowering problematic plans of action, for example, portable banking, and fortifying their emphasis on digital dangers (Fitton, et. al. 2015). Security is at the core of advancement IT security is never again a hindrance to change, ruining the reception of new procedures and the selection of creative innovations. Truth be told, security is upfront in the new computerized world. It is quickening 'speed of administration'; inserted in programming characterized systems (SDN); empowering more extensive, consistent and secure access to information in the Internet of Things (IoT) and considerably more (Hielscher & Sovacool, 2018). Security is presently a pre-imperative, incorporated with new advances and gadgets from the beginning. Security is getting to be more intelligent, better, quicker more grounded Speed ​​and speed are in no way, shape or form the main assets that IT security needs to confront. Moreover, you should act even more splendidly and logically succeed, in spite of the reduction in spending plans (Hughes, et. al. 2017). The supervision of security in the electronic world incorporates the social inquiry, the association and the examination of standard security data. Nevertheless, the data is rarely more, in any case, what data can tell us. Those providers who can utilize the advantages of information and comprehension in a dream of the worldwide framework will be at the cutting edge of the period of security organizations, improving the penetrability of computerized risk and directing the threat. This will detach the wellbeing supplier's promoting on individuals who just gather data and those with the nearness and capacity to transmit clever information (Ismail & Zhang, 2018). The best next step It is difficult to foresee precisely where the business will turn straightaway, however realize that development and digitization will not stop at any point in the near future. They will keep on developing at an exponential pace and stay significant for business achievement. In light of this, organizations must grasp new advancements, characterize methodologies that convey (and surpass) on the client experience, and adopt a proactive security strategy to guarantee every one of these components can occur safely (Kaska, 2015). Verizon's 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report demonstrated that similar risk strategies are as yet compelling in penetrating information on the grounds that numerous associations are feeling the loss of a centre establishment of security apparatuses and forms. Given the danger from cybercrime is expanding; organizations can't stand to be receptive any longer. To prevail in security, they should look towards improving their cyber security frameworks, as there is a lot in question – nobody needs to turn into a casualty of the following WannaCry or NotPetya (Khan & Estay, 2015). From year to year, the advancement of innovation is one of amazing guarantee and opportunity – just as vulnerability. The future might be obscure, however computerized headway keeps on reshaping our reality in manners that urge individuals to frame new propensities, find better approaches to cooperate and turn out to be better people. Furthermore, much of the time, these progressions convert into a scope of chances and disturbances over each industry (Lee & Jin, 2016). Shocked by how well and rapidly a developing number of associations explore this misty way from asking by acknowledging new upper hands with rising innovation patterns. The pace of development and change is mind-numbingly quick, yet these savvy undertakings are carefully understanding computerized progressions and applying them with colossal certainty. In any case, do not be tricked: There are still a lot of chances to get up to speed and further develop. Deloitte's Tech Trends 2019 report predicts eight patterns that will transform 2019 into an all the more energizing time, a progressively fortunate time to leave your blemish on the organization, industry, and a whole universe of plausibility. Technology trends past, present, and future Advanced understanding, the cloud, investigation, blockchain, subjective innovations, computerized reality, centre modernization, and cybersecurity might be old news, yet that doesn't imply that they are never again an imperative piece of business change (Loukaka & Rahman, 2017). Deloitte recommends that ""through their impact and the development released, these powers will probably overwhelm venture IT, inward activities, and markets to a significantly more prominent degree than they have as individual advances."" v Computerized reasoning satisfies the maximum capacity of the endeavour Self-sufficient computerized reasoning (AI) is filling another period of individuals and machines cooperating with information driven bits of knowledge and profoundly key and result cantered procedures (Mccluskey, 2017). To understand completely the guarantee of the AI-powered association, Deloitte features three framework models right now in play: cloud-local, bundle aide, and open-calculation. By grasping AI, AI (ML), and other psychological apparatuses over the IT environment, the whole organization can invest less energy in repetitive and commonplace exercises that waste the estimation of each representative and invest additional time in educated basic leadership. v IT associations enter NoOps in a server less world With the developing dependence on cloud suppliers, IT associations are presently looking to make a ""NoOps"" (no tasks) scene that is so computerized and preoccupied that lone a little group is expected to deal with the basic foundation. For CIOs, this new reality opens up a transformative chance to reconsider innovation culture, jobs and obligations, enablement apparatuses, and forms – all while guaranteeing boundless versatility and high accessibility (Mourshed, et. al. 2015). v Propelled systems open the entryway to the eventual fate of availability For a long while, arranging progress has been in the shadow of uncommon advancement. Be that as it may, they can at long last have their moment in 2019 as new development spaces and strategies for eager activities. For instance: 5G offers more prominent speed and lower inactivity, which can be a noteworthy favoured position when immense amounts of sensors and keen gadgets are related. The edge count shapes the data in a ""little cloud"" close to the underlying gadget, or far superior, as introduced limit inside the gadget or endpoint. The programming of described associations (SDN) extends a typical degree of programming from the homestead to the WAN (wide zone association) to interconnect ranch ranches or other multi-territory applications (Perez, 2016). The virtualization of the framework's work gives adaptable virtualized programming to the traded off machines of the physical framework and, simultaneously, it trades the prerequisites of location, trade, encryption, firewall, increment in WAN speed and burden guideline. v Smart interfaces reconsider how individuals, machines, and information communicate Shrewd interfaces speak to what Deloitte calls the ""following incredible innovation change"" – empowering abilities from following clients' disconnected propensities and customizing new items and answers for upgrading operational effectiveness and individual efficiency. This mix of human-focused structure with close frictionless interfaces as of now use conversational innovations and, later on, will probably incorporate PC vision, motion control, inserted eye-following, bio-acoustic detecting, and feeling discovery (Prasad & Dixit, 2016). v Regard for brand experience goes past promoting As purchasers accentuate their craving for increasingly human and tweaked encounters, showcasing associations are arriving at a defining moment in their systems and practices – alluded to as ""past promoting."" This strategy requires head advertising officials (CMOs) and CIOs to together re-examine how their association oversees and utilizes information, robotizes choice help, and conveys customized content powerfully, which is outside their customary space. By working together and joining forces, they can adequately complete this new procedure while clinging to the organizations built up computerized plans (Radanliev, et. al.2018). v Digital hazard is raising, installed, and developing As worries over cyber security keep administrators up around evening time, security culture, practices, and devices are being implanted into each period of the DevOps pipeline. This methodology, known as DevSecOps, mechanizes sound cybersecurity rehearses all through application improvement cycles and framework tasks to guarantee that each discharge is tried, secure, and solid. By improving security and consistence development with each new discharge and usage, organizations can increment operational quality, support hierarchical efficiency, and psychologist time to showcase (Renaud & Flowerday, 2017). v The fate of business change is never again a riddle Outlining an advanced future is no little accomplishment – however it doesn't need to be a puzzle. Organizations that skill to make the association between innovation progression and result are the ones that go past tying down their computerized techniques to a particular innovation. They envision, convey, and run an advanced future dependent on extra factors, for example, network of developing biological systems to human-focused plan, macroeconomic powers, and continuous information insight. Cyber security is an interesting issue for associations and organizations of all sizes over each industry. Obviously, every organization has various needs and experiences, so the arrangements of cyber security patterns for 2019 and 2020 you'll see around the web fluctuate a lot contingent upon your source. In any case, huge numbers of the rundowns do in any event share some basic attributes (Reniers,2017). What's more, as cyber attacks keep on expanding in recurrence year over year, they all serve to underscore the significance and requirement for better cyber security protections. A portion of the present patterns in IT security identified with the kinds of assaults, techniques for counteractive action, and enterprises that are being focused on. Others are tied in with finding new strategies and innovations to Reduce cyber security vulnerabilities; better secure systems; Use computerization and different procedures to make take progressively proficient and savvy; Increase information protection and consistence, and Improve the gathering and examination of information (Shinde and Ardhapurkar, 2016). The top cyber security patterns of 2019 we have assembled a rundown to accept are the patterns in IT security that are ruling the business this year. The patterns that have recorded beneath are a mix of the two elements we accept sway both cyber security safeguards and cybercriminals the same. Multifaceted verification (MFA) has been a continuous pattern for a couple of years now. MFA, some of the time known as two-factor verification (2FA), requires a lot of variables to access limited information — something you know, (for example, a secret word or passphrase), something you have, (for example, a security token or some likeness thereof), and something you are (biometrics, for example, a retinal sweep or unique finger impression). Application of Legal Cyber security pattern #1: The phishing scene is changing- however email still positions as the greatest of those dangers it should not shock anyone that phishing would make our rundown of the top cyber security patterns. Phishing has been a staple of cyber security patterns records for some time, and it doesn't have all the earmarks of being going anyplace at any point in the near future (Spidalieri and McArdle, 2016). Verizon's 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) reports that 32% of affirmed information ruptures came down to phishing, and 78% of digital reconnaissance occurrences included phishing. Be that as it may, phishing these days is not just about messages alone — however, email is as yet a unimaginably prominent assault vector. Cybercriminals are likewise utilizing an assortment of assault vectors to reach and fool their proposed exploited people into playing out an activity —, for example, surrendering individual data, login qualifications, or in any event, sending cash. Progressively, phishing these days includes general SMS messaging assaults (""smishing"") everything from interchanges via web-based networking media stages, for example, LinkedIn to phishing destinations to try and telephone calls with a live individual (""vishing"") (Strasser, et al. 2017). You realize those phony IRS telephone calls, Social Security tricks, and individuals claiming to be Microsoft. No doubt, those are only a few instances of vishing. Cyber security pattern #2: Increasing utilization of portable as an assault vector -Considering that about everybody these days has a cell phone in their pocket, it truly does not shock anyone that versatile advanced close to the top on our rundown of cyber security patterns for 2019. Overall, being portable makes life increasingly helpful. You can utilize your cell phones for dealing with everything from individual and business correspondences to banking or in any event, booking a flight or inn. There are applications for actually every part of your life. Exhausted? Play a game application (Taylor & While, 2017). Need music? Turn on a music application. Need to get in shape? There's an application you can download for that, as well. Be that as it may, the majority of this accommodation doesn't come without hazard for end clients and organizations the same — especially as more individuals utilize their own and work gadgets conversely for individual and business purposes. This training explains worries for organizations. Research from the RSA's 2019 Current State of Cybercrime whitepaper demonstrates that ""70% of false exchanges started in the versatile direct in 2018."" Furthermore, ""extortion from portable applications has expanded 680 percent since 2015,"" making it a tremendous channel of chance for cybercrime. Cybersecurity pattern #3: Targeting of nearby governments and endeavors by means of ransomware assaults- So long as you haven't been living under a stone the previous couple of years, at that point it's conceivable you've seen that the paces of ransomware assaults against shoppers are as the year progressed. Be that as it may, the equivalent can't be said for endeavors. Ransomware are on the ascent for ventures with research from Malwarebytes revealing an expansion of 195% from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019, just as a year-over-year increment of 500% in ransom ware identifications by organizations in Q1 2018 to Q1 2019. Indeed, even governments aren't sheltered from ransom ware. Research from Recorded Future, a risk insight firm that has indexed almost 170 ransom ware assaults influencing state and nearby governments since 2013, demonstrates that ransom ware assaults against these administration branches are on the ascent (Teoh & Mahmood, 2017). Their information reports that there were 53 ransom ware assaults against state and neighbourhood governments in 2018 and that there were 21 revealed assaults inside the initial four months of 2019. Moreover, ""the numbers for 2018 and 2019 may go up, as not all ransom ware assaults against state and nearby governments are accounted for right away."" For instance, 20 urban areas in Texas were hit by composed ransom ware assaults. Three Florida urban areas were focused by ransom ware assaults, and in any event, two paid the requested payoffs to open their information. The city of Baltimore, Maryland continued two ransom ware assaults in 14 months (Tweneboah, 2017). The city of Atlanta, Georgia continued a significant ransom ware assault in March 2018, which left the city disabled and confronting upwards of $17 million in expenses identifying with the assault. Similar assailants, the open division ransom ware exploited people who paid the payments paid about 10 fold the amount of cash, by and large, similar to their private-part partners. This could be, partially, because of an absence of cyber security mindfulness. In any case, paying little respect to the reason, governments paying any payment represents a critical concern since it fortifies the thought that performing ransom ware assaults against governments is a beneficial endeavour and will just serve to urge them to lead more assaults. Cyber security pattern #4: Increasing accentuation on information security, sway, and consistence -Since the rollout of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, states, nations, and ventures the same around the globe have started taking harder takes a gander at their current information security related guidelines. The objective? To create, pass, and execute new guidelines that will guarantee higher information security and security measures to all the more likely ensure customers (or residents, contingent upon the particular model) and to rebuff the individuals who neglect to submit to them. Information sway and consistence, obviously, come in various structures (Villanueva, et. al. 2015). Contingent upon the particular enactment, it can include: Informing people about how their data will be utilized; Providing people with an approach to refuse their data from being shared; Developing and actualizing strategies and methods to end up agreeable; and Increasing the security of information and individual data using encryption and different systems. In any case, there are likewise proposed guidelines that approach the point of information protection from an alternate edge. Now and again, the accentuation is put on making encryption ""secondary passages"" to make it simpler for governments to access scrambled data for the sake of equity and impeding fear based oppressor exercises. Cyber security pattern #5: Increasing interests in cybersecurity mechanization — the last stop on our rundown of the top cyber security patterns for 2019: robotization. Mechanization is a significant favourable position in cyber security that has been increasing a solid footing in the business. An ongoing Ponemon Institute study of in excess of 1,400 IT and IT security professionals demonstrates that 79% of respondents either as of now use (29%) mechanization apparatuses and stages inside their association or plan to utilize them (half) inside the following a half year to three years (Weichert, 2017). Contingent upon the digital security robotization apparatuses and stages, they can enable you to perform numerous assignments, including Collecting information about segments of your data framework that can be accustomed to observing and investigation. Monitoring all product and equipment resources inside your association. Digital Security Trends 2020: What to Expect in the Coming Year Some of the digital security patterns we referenced for 2019 are probably going to persist into 2020. Be that as it may, here are a couple of things we see in 2020: Cyber security spending will keep on expanding Cyber security spending is on the ascent. Truth be told, information from IDC demonstrates that worldwide spending on digital security arrangements, for example, equipment, programming and administrations is foreseen to top $103 billion this year alone. That is an expected increment of 9.4% more than 2018 — and they anticipate that this pace of development should proceed for the following quite a long while as businesses and organizations progressively put resources into security arrangements (Wortmann & Flüchter, 2015). Prediction for future As to consider how to convey ahead of time of another time of digital dangers, here are the patterns and exercises well on the way to influence the association. By foreseeing the fundamental security and advanced assurance plans for the coming year, it is conceivable to find numerous sign on the events of the earlier year. Among the now regular ambush types, the advanced privateers of the fundamental structures and corporate destinations proceeded in 2018 and will definitely be a piece of the 2019 computerized security scene(Sharma & Sharma,2019). Some significant relationship around the globe has endured basic breakdowns this year. The biggest production of potential data, which affected the organization Exactis for publicizing and data aggregation, incorporated the presentation of a database containing right around 340 million individual information records(Chen, 2019). In the most rudimentary organization ambushes of the past, in 2018 there was a quickened hazard development in an alternate extent of goals and lamentable unfortunate casualties. In the space of individual to-individual correspondence, Facebook evaluated that the software engineers procured client information from around 30 million individuals. An assortment of creating nations has utilized computerized proof and attacks to accomplish anything from inside organization information to government units and touchy frameworks. On an individual level, a break in the registers of Under Four's My Fitness Pal health locator has caused the burglary of private data from around 150 million individuals. In any case, there is something not out of the ordinary on the advanced security front one year from now. Here is a piece of the models and activities intended to impact affiliations, governments and individuals in 2019 and before. Aggressors Will Exploit Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems and Use AI to Aid Assaults The hotly anticipated business assurance of the AI ​​has begun to show up as of late, with AI-controlled casings presently being utilized in various regions of business action. Actually, despite the fact that these systems persistently automate manual commissions and improve fundamental initiative and other human activities, they additionally create as promising attack draws near, a similar number of computerized reasoning structures facilitating colossal data measures(Choo, 2017). Moreover, experts have been progressively worried about the shortcoming of these systems for destructive data that can deteriorate their rationale and impact their assignments. The delicacy of a portion of the advancement of the AI ​​will become a worry for improvement in 2019. Somehow, the ascent of centre AI systems as ambush targets will mirror the understanding seen 20 years before web, which immediately grabbed the eye of computerized hoodlums. Furthermore, software engineers, especially after the blast of electronic internet business (Botta et al., 2016). Assailants won't simply target AI frameworks, they will enrol AI methods themselves to supercharge their own crimes. Mechanized frameworks controlled by AI could test systems and frameworks scanning for unfamiliar vulnerabilities that could be abused. Computer-based intelligence could likewise be utilized to make phishing and other social building assaults much progressively refined by making amazingly practical video and sound or well-created messages intended to trick focused on people. Artificial intelligence could likewise be utilized to dispatch reasonable disinformation crusades(Botta, et. al.2016). For instance, envision a phony AI-made, practical video of an organization CEO reporting a huge money related misfortune, a significant security rupture, or other significant news. Broad arrival of such a phony video could significantly affect the organization before the confirmed actualities are comprehended. Also, similarly as we see assault toolboxes accessible available to be purchased web-based, making it generally simple for aggressors to create new dangers, we're sure to in the end observe AI-controlled assault instruments that can enable even trivial offenders to dispatch refined focused on assaults (Jentzsch, 2015). With such devices mechanizing the production of profoundly customized assaults that have been work concentrated and exorbitant in the past–such AI-fuelled toolboxes could make the peripheral expense of creating each extra focused on assault be zero. Conclusion Indeed, even the biggest relationship with the most noteworthy limit and the incredible assets engaged with PC security have experienced significant exchanges on PC security. The most incredibly talented pros in data security employments would enable the nation to respond all the more unequivocally to the IT security issues it faces. Specifically that which is as ground-breaking and quick as PC security. Besides, there are a few factors that can impact future needs. PC security is a field that incorporates more than one kind of work and in excess of a calling or job. For instance, today there are an immense number of individuals inside the affiliations who have a commitment in regards to data security aptitudes, for example, forefront IT staff, for which there may not be satisfactory directions or requirements for accreditation.

The M.Tech in Cyber Security Systems and Networks offered at Amrita Center for cyber security systems and networks is a research oriented program and has good placement records. The advantage of this research oriented approach is that even though this is not a pure VAPT or SOC training program, if interested, students can easily grasp the working of various associated tools and framework because they will have an in-depth understanding of how these things might work. Apart from cybersecurity, emphasis is also given to improving the programming skill of the students. This ensures that even if a student gets in to secure application development, they can have an advantage. A lot of students have also got into research positions within academia and industry. It is a 2 year program with most students spending the whole 2nd year as interns. Students with good academic performance are also given an option to complete their 2nd year in a partner university with scholarship(VU and Laquila in 2017). This will give you a chance to get multiple degrees in one year(Ms + M.tech). The course work used to be rigorous during my time and very much practical oriented. I personally spent major portion of my day in the labs to complete the multiple assignments that were due. If you are able to keep up with the academic demands, Amritapuri is probably the best place to learn cybersecurity due to this being the home of team Bi0s. They are the best CTF team of India and have won multiple international competitions and are doing great research work in the field of security. But access to this team is available to people who genuinely shows interest in security. Being a masters program, students are expected to put a lot of effort in researching and learning by themselves and the faculty are mostly present to give directions and clear any difficult doubts. You have to be prepared to do this if joining this program. The expectation from the assignments and projects are high and their reviews are usually critical in nature. I have found this to be a good approach since this provides us to produce better results and ultimately be very happy about the final outcome, even though you dont feel good about the criticism. The course work starts of with introduction to system internal through operating systems, basic maths and algorithms (might have changed since 2016). In the second semester, they start of with cybersecurity topics such as advanced cryptography, network and systems security or web security and cyber forensics. Third semester gives you an option to choose the domain of your interest. We got options to choose from Malware analysis, web security and cloud security. These might have changed now and you should check out the official course work available here. Assignments are provided regularly (usually daily) and some courses will even have a paper requirement, so be ready to work hard. If you already are skilled before you join this course, and are able to demonstrate this in classes and assignments, you can discuss with the faculty and get some advanced assignments or go join Bi0s depending on your interest. Either way, a lot of time will be spent in labs during this program. A few of these assignments and subjects might not be of your liking, but you have to remember this is a masters program approved by AICTE and UGC and therefore not always advanced stuff( apparently they cannot include too many cutting edge research topic into an M.Tech program due to certain certification requirements). To make the best out of this course, a student has to be ready to put in a lot of effort and time by themselves. I personally enjoyed my time during M.Tech and was able to learn and understand the fundamentals of cybersecurity. My internship also allowed to play with the stuff I learned and understand the industry perspective of cybersecurity. The projects I did were challenging and very exciting. The campus is very close to the Amrita Ashram and has an overall spiritual atmosphere. This has also helped a lot in my personal life. Even the academic course has an elective subject which allows you to work on a social welfare service undertaken by the Ashram. The centre is situated in a remote coastal village with lot of greenery, beaches and backwaters. People who have slight interest in spirituality and nature can thrive here. But, the closest major town in almost 1.5 hours but I dont think it was a big issue since you can get most of your needs taken care easily enough.",2021-03-06T09:58:43.868Z,"Where can I get a course in cyber security in India?

This is actually a good thing for you in many ways as the root personality traits and skill sets are now so large there is BOUND to be something within one of these specialties that not only appeals to you but also is a good match for your natural talents. So now the tough question: What ARE your natural talents and which fields work well with those talents?? Are you good at reading people and talking them into doing things for you? Hey! Social Engineering might be for you. Do you like logic puzzles? Networking might be good for you as much of it feels very much like one. (or more like several all at once!) Are you a methodical process-oriented person? Risk Management needs you, or Disaster Recovery or Security Auditor.Are you good at pushing envelopes and looking for logical flaws in things? Hey, maybe try pen testing. Make no mistake, this is the hardest part. Figuring out what YOU are good at and matching it to a job that needs that. We, as a society, do a terrible job of giving people any REAL feedback about how we compare in various talents to others. We self select to a large degree towards people who are like us and compared to those people well, you’re kinda like everyone else with no real talent. Worse, perhaps in your circle of friends you are the smartest but compared to the world at large, maybe not so much as you had been led to believe. Now you have to take the talents you might not be aware you have and find a job whose requirements you don’t really know and choose THE PERFECT CAREER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. Well, that’s what it feels like. In truth though, if you chose a field and dive into it, only to discover that you hate it, you will probably have learned enough by then to have rubbed shoulders with people who have a career more like what you actually want and coming from another specialty will give you unique insights that will hopefully make you valuable. So to (finally) answer your question: It’s tough. These skills are not easy to learn and the field is rapidly changing and growing in unexpected directions but MAN it can be fun and it generally pays well, but the reason it pays well is not everyone can do it. Nothing is a dead end though… pick something and give it your all. Dive in and *really* understand it. Watch yourself and be honest with yourself and be willing to jump tracks to more interesting fields. I think if you do this, you’ll probably end up where you want to be! (Or at least have learned a lot about what you do and do not want to do as a career… trust me that’s a powerful thing to know!)",2021-03-06T10:00:15.376Z,"Is cyber security hard? ",Quora

If your main interest is in operational security (maintaining secure servers and networks) then an Information Technology or Information Systems degree could help. Identify the job you want then decide which degree best prepares you for it. The most important thing you should do is get a CISSP. It won't necessarily prepare you for work and most serious security folks chuckle at it but it is the single most important criteria for getting a job. HR at Federal agencies and contracting companies look for the CISSP as a threshold test to winnow out the applicants. If you don't have it the resume probably won't be seen by a human. Other certifications are useful but the CISSP is key. The second most important thing you can do is to get practical experience in information security. Find a vulnerability and publish it (after responsible disclosure). Get a job doing assessments or pen testing. Help secure a non-profit's network. Hunt out infosec opportunities and take advantage of them. Demonstrate you understand the field and are committed to staying current in it. Above all keep track of these efforts and put them on your resume. Your experience or lack thereof will show through in interviews so get experience to be prepared. Information security professionals I have worked with come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Once upon a time you could have any old degree and still be considered because the IT field was built by self starters.

The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories. Cybersecurity threats have become remarkably common and they continue to gain traction. Cybercriminals are continuously adopting newer technologies, enhancing their coordination, and becoming more sophisticated. Through cybercrimes, employees’ and customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) gets compromised and used in illegal schemes somewhere else. Through large-scale data breaches, legitimate data is vulnerable to identity thefts and frauds. Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware. Network security is any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of your network and data. It includes both hardware and software technologiesIt targets a variety of threatsIt stops them from entering or spreading on your networkEffective network security manages access to the networkI hope it helps!",2021-03-06T10:03:08.768Z,"What is the difference between Cyber Security and Network Security?

Chris Romeo provided great answer so I’m not going to waste your time reiterating on his words, and I’ll rather focus on how you can make sure you stay on top of your game and adjust to ever-changing market. Competition is high, and I’m 100% positive that if you allow yourself to stop developing your social and technical acumen, it’ll become increasingly harder to secure the satisfying job. Make no mistake, having a job doesn’t mean having a satisfying and joyful job, and those roles, you must earn by putting in the sweat equity. When someone asks me, how do I keep up with such dynamically changing industry I’m pretty much reiterating the following: They must raise their personal standards and replace 'can' with 'must' in their life dictionaries. That’s how I see it. I’m always telling people that want to get into the security field, that although any career in cyber is achievable, some take much more effort than others. Our field and the whole IT for that matter is changing so rapidly, that there is no other choice but to adapt and get used to the pace everything moves forward. The actual tactics vary a lot from person to person. Cybersecurity isn’t that much different than any other creative field and some people have bigger predispositions to that type of work than others. For some people, the change come very easy, and they’re eager to learn about new things. Some people hardly can get them into something new, because they don’t like the discomfort of change and feeling lost when learning something new. Nothing should really discourage you tho, because it’s all comprehensible. We’re all humans, and if there are other people capable of adapting to the ever changing industry, there are high chances that you can do the same. Learn from those people, learn from as many mentors as you can so you find something that works for you. Bear in mind that we have people who invent rockets taking us to Mars, we have people who invent lifesaving medical equipment and people working on solving tremendous challenges of 3rd world countries. When you look at world from this perspective, a lot of barriers shatter because you realize that those things that were holding you back technically do not exist. It's often that you yourself, environemnt or society had put limitations on your belief system. We're all humans and we are capable of tremendous things, out of which cyber isn't the toughest one. To me personally, it all boils down to gratitude, humility and patience. When you’re grateful for the opportunity, you realize that there are even bigger challenges that people go after and that it all takes time, life gets much more positive. And speaking of actual technical ways, then I’d recommend you going with paid books and courses where knowledge is nicely organised and structured, so you don’t waste that much time googling the answers to your questions. If you’re already an IT professional, learning next framework, programming language or any other technology shouldn’t take you much time if you have high quality source of practical knowledge. There are many platforms that teach cyber skills with subscription model, where each week there is new knowledge to absorb, so there is also that and I recommend you looking into those as well. But beyond technical resources, I recommend everyone to study and practice time management skills. Find what's right for you, what's in your life's book and work on creating a framework for yourself thanks to which you can be effective and productive. Because more often than not, it’s not that we don’t have enough time. We just waste too much time doing that’s that don’t matter. If you cut off all distractions, you'll be amazed with how many things you can keep up with. There are so many opportunities in the whole IT - let alone cybersecurity - that even with low job security, you can easily find another place to work. It doesn’t mean that’s a great narrative to follow, because if you do your best and you are competent professional, then you’ll have high job security in pretty much any job out there.

In the audits I have been a part of, I have seen misconfigured firewalls, open ports, lack of DLPs, server rooms open to unrestricted access, lack of antivirus in machines… the list goes on. It is no wonder that government websites and servers are so easily hacked. They do not have the in-house expertise to cater to information security requirements mandated by the law, regulators or best practices, and the engineers and science graduates they are hiring are not very tech-savvy. They join government jobs for comfort, not to work. And cyber security is by no means a comfortable career. However, the demand remains, and it is getting bigger by the day, with the employees not furnishing the required supply. Thus, when you enter governmental organizations(be it a PSU bank or an insurance company), you will see the entire information security function outsourced to private players. You will find that one or more Big Four firms have helped in creating and/or certifying their ISMS, drafted their policies and conducted information security reviews and audits according to best practices and legal/regulatory requirements. You will see that some IT company is handling their networks and firewalls and are running the SOC. So you want to work in the government, eh? Just join a Big Four firm or an IT company in their cyber security practice. You will get plenty of opportunities to work with the government. Be prepared to deal with lazy employees with a lackadaisical approach who are not willing to help you achieve the required goals. Be prepared to work in an environment with no proper seating and outdated infrastructure. However, if and when you do manage to achieve your goals, the satisfaction you gain is priceless, and you will have a governmental organization a little secure than before and employees friendlier and more aware about safe computing tactics. You will have made a difference. On a final note, a CEH certification is useless. Gain relevant work experience and go for better certifications depending on your area of interest. Good Luck!

Already Cyber Crimes are on the rise since ages. And with the growing dependence on advanced technologies and digitalization, the scenario is getting worse. Thus it has become increasingly mandatory to have some sort of surveillance or monitoring and control over these crimes and threats. And, to provide the necessary protection to all of the data, information, systems and networks out there in the Cyber Space, The field of Cyber security is at the forefront. Now, to understand the basic concepts of Cyber Security, you definitely need to understand what is Cyber Security all about. Cyber Security in simple words offers protection against use of data or networks and systems falling in the wrong hands or people with unauthorized access, in order to avoid any kind of malware, virus attacks or data thefts, information leakage, hacking, etc. You must have seen that these days, people prefer more online forms of payments and transactions being made. And this makes it all the more necessary to have a robust, stronger and safer security framework, to protect this confidential data. So, here we come to the basic concepts of Cyber Security, which are nothing but – Confidentiality Integrity Availability Let us learn about them in a little more detail. Confidentiality When we talk about the confidentiality concept, it all revolves around helping our data or information, networks and systems (let us call these our business assets) to be in safer hands only with authorized personnel. This becomes very much mandatory for companies dealing in financial transactions, crucial information, Govt. organizations, etc. Integrity This part basically deals with the trustworthiness of the people who are authorized to handle the data or network systems, etc. Apparently the organization has to be super careful about the integrity of people who have access to the information and do not tamper with it, or modify it, accidentally or intentionally. Availability Well, the people who have the access to the certain systems, or information, should get the information readily and should help the systems be up and running all of the time making them available all the while. Thus, in case you are pondering over learning more about the Cyber Security field, I would highly insist you to get a little more in detail beyond the basic concepts to understand the topic from the core. If you are seriously interesting in learning more about the field, I would highly recommend attending the free online demo session on Cyber Security by Digital Vidya Institute on their website.",2021-03-06T10:08:12.833Z,"What are the basic concepts of cyber security?

One cannot use a telephone or watch television these days without learning to manipulate a fairly complex user interface to a computerized device. Those devices all have embedded computers that are executing sequences of machine instructions. Those instructions were derived from special languages created for the purpose of composing those sequences of instructions, called ""programs."" (Always say, ""programming language,"" not, ""program language,"" if you want to fit in. No one ever says, ""program language."") You appear to understand this and want to know which language will serve you best to be qualified to work as a professional in the field of ""cyber security."" My guess is that becoming a highly skilled computer scientist is the most important aspect of that, which is most easily achieved by getting an advanced degree in the field from a good university. No matter how good a programmer you are, if you only have a bachelor's degree or less, it's unlikely that you will rise from the ranks of those doing ""grunt work"" to being involved with anything at all interesting or innovative in the field of  computer security. Let's face it. At least 90% of all programming work is commercial, and nearly all of that is ""grunt work."" Only a tiny fraction of programmers ever get a chance to do anything in the least bit innovative. These top echelon jobs are reserved for the educated elite. You have to become one of them to get out of a cubicle and get a real office.  The curriculum in your course of study will include course in programming. Avoid anything obsolete or long out of favor, like FORTRAN or COBOL. (The names of those languages are acronyms; that's how old they are.) Most commercially distributed software these days is still written in languages derived from or related to C, like C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript. Thus, learning C could be vital in learning another language later. C itself, however, seems to have diminished in importance so much that are very few jobs to be had writing it. The biggest demand is now for web and database programmers using a flurry of new languages for specialized kinds of work. There used to be a lot of demand for C and C++ programmers to do this work, but it seems to be shifting to JavaScript, C#, Ruby On Rails (whatever the hell that is),  and whatever they're asking for in the job listings this week. I think the best thing for you to do, in addition to getting a degree, is to ask knowledgeable people in the field what programming languages are used by the hotshots in cyber security, and learn those languages, all of them. Don't overlook the sophisticated, ""weird"" languages that are not used a lot now, but are growing in importance, like Haskell. You can't beat being the only guy in the house who knows something, even if your knowledge is perfunctory. Don't minimize the importance of database query languages. SQL is the ancestor, but there are lots of new ways to handle data that are implemented through code. This code is distributed in libraries that are accessible using several programming languages. My son, who followed me into the dark arts by becoming a programmer, used JSON to manipulate data in the web applications he was writing. There are others and more are popping up every day. Computer security is mostly concerned with data security. Implementing security protocols has also become a data-driven process. In addition to learning how to inspect and modify computerized databases, study database organization as a formal discipline at the university level. No one is going to hire you to keep their data safe unless you intimately understand data management theory and can implement what you know using database technology. In the end, there will need to be code written, but being a skilled database administrator may be more important than knowing how to write code. When you're the top guy, only the ""grunts"" who work for you will cut code anyway. To be the boss, you have to be the visionary who understands ""the big picture."" Get the degree, then learn as much as you can while you work your way up. Your question is not frivolous at all, despite what the non-programmer who answered it previously appears to have alluded.

We are using the internet and digital marketing in our day-to-day operations. So the importance of both has become higher. To protect businesses, the use of IT security solutions has become crucial for all kinds of companies. In the year 2017, a survey done by Cyber Security breaches survey said that more than 46% of UK businesses suffered a cyber-attack. These businesses did not have the very best security solutions. Many of the companies had suffered due to this. As a result, they went through a decreased number of customer trust and faced the theft of disclosed personal information too. Here i am listing some benefits of cybersecurity for business: Key Benefits of Cyber Security for Your Business: Protects Personal Information: Personal information is one of the most valuable commodities in the digital age. If a virus becomes able to obtain personal information regarding the employees or customers of a particular business, they become quite capable of selling that information too, or even they can use it to steal the money also. Provides Complete Protection: The most significant benefit is that the best in IT cybersecurity solutions can provide complete digital protection to your business. The security protection allows your employees to surf the internet freely, and ensure that they aren’t at risk from potential threats. Guarantees Work Safety to Employees: Without the best cyber security solutions for a business, an organization and its employees are constantly at risk from a potential cyber-attack. If the system, or even individual computers, got infected then that can really hamper their productivity and even force you to replace computers. Protects the work pace: Viruses can slow down personal computers to a crawl, and make working on them practically impossible. This can reduce the productivity as more time is needed for a particular work. This in turn wastes more time of employees, and can often bring your entire business to a standstill. Prevents Your Website from Going Down: In case of a business, the chances are high that you are working on your own website. Your website can become slower if your system gets infected and it can lead you to emergency shut down of the website. This means you will loose not only customer trust but also chance of loosing money is there from missed transaction. Certain viruses has the capability of doing long term damage too. Inhibits Adware: Adware is a form of computer virus that fills your computer with advertisements. It is a common type of virus. However, these advertisements can really have an impact on the productivity of your system and can often allow other viruses to enter the computer once you’ve accidentally clicked on them. Rejects Spyware: Spyware is a form of cyber infection that spies on your computer actions and sends that information back to the cyber-criminal. An excellent cybersecurity solution can prevent this spyware from taking effect and ensure that your employees’ activities remain private and confidential within your workplace. Combined Solution for Problems: IT security solutions for your business will provide a complete solution to protect against a diverse range of problems. Practically, your security needs to include a firewall, anti-virus, anti-spam, online content filtration and wireless network. Enhance Support to Your IT Expert: It might be offensive to hear, but most cyber-criminals will have much more expertise than your average employee when it comes to digital crime. The best IT security systems can give your team with the features and support that they need to fight against even the most firm criminal effectively. Build Trust in Your Customers: If you can prove that your business is sufficiently protected against all kinds of cyber threats, you can surely inspire trust in your customers and clients. The customers will then feel more confident when purchasing your products or using your services. Thus implementing cybersecurity will be highly beneficial for any business.",2021-03-06T10:08:57.929Z,"How do cybersecurity services help my business? ",Quora

So if you want to be ahead of the rat race, and make the systems and networks absolutely robust and stronger with more secured getaways, then you will certainly have to be updated with all the latest knowledge on the topic and even the currently trending technologies. Apart from that, here are a few best Cyber Security tips to keep you and your data, systems and networks safeguarded from the external Cyber threats. Tip 1: Make sure you have a double or 2 step verification for your systems. Tip 2: Never leave your devices, such as laptops, smartphones, PCs, tablets, etc. unattended. Or at least make sure they all have security codes to open. So locking your devices should be your first priority before leaving them (in case you have to). Tip 3: Make use of HTTPS:// and all the more recommended to make any online transactions through it. The “s” at the end determines a secure connection between you browser and the website. Tip 4: Make sure your passwords are protected and stronger with mixed characters. Tip 5: Avoid clicking on suspicious messages received via social media (whatsapp, etc.) and even emails for that matter. There is a higher chance of them consisting of links leading to downloading viruses and malware into your machine hacking your data. Tip 6: Protect your systems and devices with an Anti-virus or Firewall to protect them from downloading any suspicious virus or malware. Tip7: Make sure when you swipe your credits cards or debits cards, you receive an OTP authentication code to verify if this was the transaction done by you. Also having a 2 step verification will save you tons in this case. Tip 8: Be educated on the various latest Cyber Security concerns and updates that might affect your secured environment with the proliferation of new technologies and their introduction into your lives.

This is known as a supply chain attack and a major one was discovered recently. Depending on how much you worry about Spectre and other similar vulnerabilities that primarily affect Intel CPUs, buy either an AMD or Intel CPU. AMD will eventually have similar or worse bugs identified in their CPU. Generally speaking, I’ve preferred Intel CPUs for their speed and stability for years. So back when we had Intel Pentium 1 and 2, I preferred Intel. Then AMD came out and made CPUs a whole lot cheaper and produced fast and decent CPUs, so I generally preferred AMD because they were cheaper and still produced good products. However, over the years and today I prefer Intel if it’s Core i7 or better. If you’re getting a cheap Intel CPU, it’s almost not worth it at least to me. Anyway, there really isn’t much on the hardware side of things because those fingerprint scanners on laptops are a joke, don’t use them. As soon as you get your laptop, you should encrypt all of the disks inside it completely and choose a strong and unique password. Your logon password should also be strong and completely different from the password you use the unlock and decrypt the harddisks. Next, make sure you have a BIOS / UEFI password. When you walk away from your laptop, always lock your screen and make sure you have a decent password, especially if you’re in a hostile environment. Never use cafe, airport or hotel wifi unless you want to get hacked. (Read about the Dark Hotel APT.) Generally speaking, you can use Hotel WiFi but always assume it’s compromised, so don’t access any personal pages unless it’s over strongly encrypted HTTPS or similar and even then, be very careful because attackers can on some websites downgrade or remove the encryption without you noticing in most cases. (This depends on what type of attack they pull off and your level of knowledge in information security.) I use Hotel WiFi, but every time I use it, and if it’s unencrypted I’m not really keen on using it except for maybe watching youtube videos, preferably in incognito mode so I’m not logged in. Never check business or bank accounts over insecure wifi or wired connections. Wait until you get home. 3G and 4G are usually safer options in most countries. (This will likely change at some point.) If you must use hotel and cafe wifi a lot, then use a secure VPN solution. They’re not that expensive anymore and most are easy to set up. Now, VPN solutions also have their flaws but at least it’s less likely that you’ll get attacked by a hacker who is either at the same place as you, or have compromised the place you’re at either virtually (over the web through e.g. an exposed and insecure router) or physically (by planting a device). Always have your firewall enabled and block (preferably drop) all incoming connections. Don’t enable macros on documents and spreadsheets. Open the documents in Google Docs instead for example. Don’t trust those websites that says you’ve been hacked or whatever, or emails that send you an old or current password for one of your accounts. You didn’t get hacked directly, they just found an old password you used (through a db leak in most cases), and they are then using scare tactics to try and get you to pay. Don’t trust those “Microsoft” tech support whatever they call themselves either. I generally say, don’t worry too much about criminal hackers, or getting hacked. Have a backup plan and ensure it works. Be careful where it is possible, i.e. if you’re in a foreign country with lots of pickpockets, don’t let your wallet almost fall out from your back pocket, someone will most likely try to steal it. If you have data that can’t easily be replaced, then take backups, preferably online (often referred to as cloud backup) and offline (i.e. USB disk / key). So the conclusion is, there isn’t really one specific laptop. It’s what you do with the laptop after you buy it, and how you use it, that determines how secure you are. I could go on and on, on what you should and should not do, but if you follow the advice above, then you’re a lot safer than most people.

CSDS is increasingly formally recognized as a cybersecurity job specialty, for instance in the NIST NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. Some general aspects of CSDS as an emerging professional practice: CSDS is data focused, applies quantitative, algorithmic, and probabilistic methods, attempts to quantify risk, focuses on producing targeted and efficacious alerts, promotes inferential methods to categorize behavioral patterns, and ultimately seeks to optimize cybersecurity operations.CSDS represents a partial paradigm shift from traditional cybersecurity approaches, which are rule-and-signature-based and focus on boundary protection.CSDS seeks situational awareness and assumes persistent and prolific threats which may be human, automated, or ‘cyborg’ in origin.CDSD goals connect historically with cybersecurity continuous monitoring and forensics functions in particular.CSDS has emerged from two parent domains which themselves are undergoing rapid transformation. As such, the ‘body of theory’ surrounding CSDS is still evolving.CSDS has evidenced pragmatic successes using analytics and machine learning in focused use-cases such as spam filtering, phishing email detection, malware and virus detection, network monitoring, and endpoint protection.Applied CSDS involves addressing cybersecurity challenges with data science prescriptions and implies a gap analysis is conducted.Research on CSDS has revealed that practitioners perceive key challenges which must be addressed to advance the domain. Among the central challenges is the perception that the field must develop more rigorous scientific methods. Many CSDS practitioners work in high-pressure, time-driven environments, whereas advancement of the domain demands the development of best practices resulting from experimentation, testing, and core research. Other perceived challenges in the domain include difficulties related to data management: gathering, integrating, cleaning, transforming, and extrapolating key measures from the fragmented, voluminous, and fast-streaming sources that underlie modern cyber infrastructure. Finally, practitioners report that the sheer breadth of the cybersecurity and data science domains combined has become so broad and complex that even seasoned professionals can only hope to gain expertise in specific areas combined with a general understanding of others. This ultimately necessitates that institutions and organizations develop approaches to ensure cross-domain collaboration and process-driven teamwork across hybridized teams of CSDS professionals. A key point of advocacy related to CSDS is that it can be seen as a central mechanism for measuring cyber risk, which is a prerequisite to controlling and preventing exposure, improving alerting and triage, and generally optimizing cybersecurity detection and remediation operations. In terms of quantifying cyber risks, there are a broad range of attacks and attackers, everything from accidental incidents and company insiders; through to extortion and cyber-fraud; to corporate espionage and state sponsored cyber actors. To understand the risks of exposure, frequency, and impact from events, it is important to develop a contextual understanding of at-risk targets and their relative susceptibilities. From here, one can match an understanding of the permissible means of attack, opportunities for staging attacks and incursions, and the corresponding motivations of prospective attackers (e.g. competitive advantage, revenge, personal gain, ‘just a job’). Hubbard’s ‘How to measure Anything in Cybersecurity’ is a good overview to quantifying cyber risk: How To Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk, Hubbard, D Some attacks are more or less ‘pure’ cyber attacks (incidents intending to interrupt or destroy computer and communications infrastructure), whereas, beyond this, cyber is fast becoming a common mechanism and medium for perpetrating fraud and crime of many types. Common and growing examples of cyber-fraud include focused spear phishing (targeted compromise of people and/or systems through their identity and computer/systems access to perpetrate and facilitate financial fraud), ransomware (commandeering and ‘locking’ systems and data until a ransom is paid: Global Ransomware Damage Costs Predicted To Hit $11.5 Billion By 2019), and cryptojacking (surreptitiously commandeering computing resources to mine crypto currencies: Criminals’ Cryptocurrency Addiction Continues). In terms of tracking trends, the Ponemon Institute has a set of reports on data breaches. Tracking and trends depends upon specifying the particular type of attack and knowing the target. There are a broad range of online reports tracking trends for different types of cyber threats. In terms of the growing scope of the vulnerabilities, Bruce Schneier ‘Click Here to Kill Everybody: Security and Survival in a Hyper-connected World’ is sobering account of the risks we increasingly face. To overcome these growing risks, CSDS must evolve and mature as a professional practice. This will involve developing more rigorous approaches with a basis in science. In the longer term, it is expected CSDS will generate domain theory and standard practices based upon experimentation and field testing. Concerning CSDS academic research, much is currently focused on technical case studies and framing / testing advanced analytical and machine learning methods. For a practitioner new to the domain, more substantial guidance comes in book form. The following books have come out in the last two decades and can be considered to represent a key CSDS corpus: Cybersecurity Analytics (Verma & Marchette, 2020)Data Science in Cybersecurity and Cyberthreat Intelligence (Sikos & Choo (Eds.), 2020)Deep Learning Applications for Cyber Security (Alazab & Tang (Eds.), 2019)Machine Learning for Computer and Cyber Security (Gupta & Sheng (Eds.), 2019)Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity (Parisi, 2019)Machine Learning for Cybersecurity Cookbook (Tsukerman, 2019)Hands-On Machine Learning for Cybersecurity (Halder & Ozdemir, 2019)Mastering Machine Learning for Penetration Testing (Chebbi, 2018)Malware Data Science: Attack Detection and Attribution (Saxe & Sanders, 2018)AI in Cybersecurity (Sikos (Ed.), 2018)Guide to Vulnerability Analysis for Computer Networks and Systems (Parkinson et al.

Adversarial machine learning (seeking to compromise ML systems and data) is a growing area of research and there are reports that attackers are already examining and testing machine learning methods to speed and automate attacks, for instance to automate vulnerability scanning and command and control of malware. The manifest future likely will evolve towards the application of CSDS to create and manage AI / machine learning systems to both attack and defend, leading potentially to quite sophisticated semi-autonomous platforms engaging one another. ———————————————————————————————————- These points and more will be expanded upon by the author in a forthcoming book ‘Cybersecurity Data Science (CSDS)’. #CSDS2020 #SARK7 #LinkedIn/SMongeau SCTR7: Data Science and Analytics Scott Allen Mongeau Continue Reading",2021-03-06T10:12:58.218Z,"How is data science used in cyber security?

Math will help you doing your job but it’s not required to have advanced skills.  Generally speaking cyber security isn’t just like one track, it’s more like the combination of many tracks working together to create a “safe” environment. Application security, Network security, End-user education are some of many examples of cyber security tracks.So you can find many people working in the cyber security field but each posses a different set of skills with different tasks than the others.

Math is not the gateway to cyber security as some Universities will tell you. I am not a math person, but I fumbled my way through it enough to earn my degree. I never took Calculus, and avoided the Computer Science path because math and I are not good friends.

Students in these programs explore hacker software, network security, computer forensics, cryptography, ethical considerations, program testing, applied mathematics and information system maintenance.” This was the only part on the article that mentioned mathematics.  What I’m trying to say is that you don’t need crazy mathematics skills to work in the cyber security field unless your job is about cryptography. Learning advanced mathematics is a great thing for cyber security not just for people work in cryptography but also for the logical and analytical way of thinking you develop learning mathematics.

Having said that, many businesses are increasingly hiring specialists or Cyber Security Professionals and teams to help them protect their data, information, systems, Applications, and Networks, etc. from the continuous threat of Cyber Crimes like information hacking, data thefts, privacy invasion, systems and networks hacking, etc. And thus many expert professionals are required to combat this situation. But, along with this exponentially increasing demand, the skills gap is also widening. We do not have many Cyber Security professionals who can be termed as exerts so far. And this is the reason, the businesses are intent on paying up lucrative salaries to many Cyber Security professionals. According to the current market studies, a newbie in the Cyber Security industry can expect anywhere around 1.5 Lacs – 3.5 lacs per annum. However, this figure is just indicative of the overall condition of the job market. The actual figures might vary in accordance with one’s actual expertise, knowledge on the topic, skills, educational qualification and many such other influencing factors. So, you can also expect a good amount, which could be more than the above mentioned range provided you work towards it with extreme passion and show the utmost interest in making it big in this industry. But before we even talk about being an expert, you need to understand this very clearly that Cyber Security is a highly evolving field with respect to the changing technological scenario. So, as a newbie, you would have to be on your toes to understand what might go wrong, or at least be prepped up with the latest trends in technology and the overall Cyber industry. Having said that, it is extremely important that you prepare yourself with all the necessary details and topics to learn to be an expert in this arena. And this is the reason I would highly recommend you take up a great and reputed course on Cyber Security, which would help you understand the topic in a much better manner, and in the most professional and practical way, also offering you 100% placement assistance.

Complete Cyber Security Training Course Online A new generation of cybersecurity professionals realizes the need for cybersecurity professionals to attain a Cyber Security Management Certificate. This is becoming increasingly important due to the rising cost of cyber attacks, vulnerabilities in our infrastructure, and the ever-changing threats faced by companies both large and small. There is a growing need for people who can manage and control cyber-attacks. For this reason, a Cybersecurity Management Certificate has widely sought after. Those who complete this certification program will be able to secure top-level jobs in the cyber arena. The certificate program consists of five main components: understanding, assessing, identifying, implementing, and maintaining a secure network. The first component of cybersecurity online courses is studying the various ways in which an attack can occur. An attack can occur in one of three different ways. These include spear phishing, email spam, and malware. Each of these has varying degrees of success depending upon the attacker, the target, and its method. In this segment of the training course, students will learn about the various kinds of attacks. The second component is assessing the different types of threats that companies face today. Examples of these include data loss, data corruption, system downtime, employee theft, and malicious website penetration. Learning about the different types of threats is necessary for people who want to know how to best secure their systems. The third component is the identification and exploitation of cyber threats. Students will learn about a variety of different attacks and how to counter them. As part of the certification, the student will be expected to implement countermeasures against each identified attack. These types of classes are typically very detailed and will require plenty of study time. The fourth course required to complete in the cybersecurity courses is the certification of strategic management. This class involves learning about business intelligence and information management, which pertain to the monitoring and controlling networks and data. Courses in this category are usually very intensive, but some of the better colleges will offer this subject courses as part of the bachelor's degree. The final part of the training course involves the study and implementation of countermeasures. When it comes to this part, students will learn about several different techniques for securing networks. Some of the most common techniques include controlling access, monitoring access, controlling bandwidth, and controlling distribution. Learning about these critical topics will ensure that a person is well-equipped to defend his company's data. To complete this course, it is essential to follow the suggested pace for learning in cybersecurity courses. Suppose a person wishes to take up online courses in preparation for his or her career in network security. In that case, he or she should make sure to look for a Coursera site that offers solid educational material. A Coursera course is one of the best online learning methods because it allows students to learn at their own pace. Some students prefer to learn by themselves, while others find it easier to learn with a partner. Regardless of the style of learning that is chosen, it is essential to make sure that the online cybersecurity training course is offered by a reputable institution. A Coursera course can be taken in two ways. Some offer complete Cybersecurity specialization courses, while others allow students to choose between specific courses in the future of their career. To learn more about the Cybersecurity specialization, it would be helpful to look for a website that offers necessary information on the subject. Cybersecurity specialists will provide individuals with detailed information on all of the various skills needed to work in the industry.",2021-03-06T10:21:04.265Z,"What are some sites from where we can do cyber security courses?

Piyush Pandey: One of the key things which is a big topic right now is remote access. Over the next five to 10 years, people will want access to enterprise applications remotely. Your users or employees should be able to access critical business applications ubiquitously. To me, that is a critical trend. As that happens, you have to change how they were designed, how they are accessible to your employees. As you do that, you need to secure the data that’s being presented. Their security was not designed for ubiquitous access. When you think about people accessing remotely, you can open it up. But the threat vectors will change dramatically. We know some of these use cases, but we’ll identify a lot more over the next few years as things open up drastically. That’s a key trend in my view. You want your employees and users to be far more efficient in how they operate. As you do that, you have to continue investing in security tools from different aspects and not just one company. Even in data security, there are five ways to go about it. CIOs have to make their infrastructure according to the needs of the business which is making businesses more efficient. We provide more control in managing those business applications. That’s what we’re trying to do in terms of the trend of the market. One is efficiency, ubiquitous access, and investing in infrastructure to secure and control the data flow. Sramana Mitra: The remote work trend is going to be very big. It’s going to increase greatly. If you’re trying to find a new idea to work on for a new startup, I suggest you go through a number of these interviews with a close eye towards that open problem question.

Targeted phishing campaigns — Hackers will go out of their way to get to know their targets “personally” and successfully victimize them. So combating targeted phishing should become even more popular to avoid doomsday. IoT as a weak spot — Devices can be transported anywhere nowadays, making IT systems open to all sorts of vulnerabilities. How do you keep up? Definitely by putting more importance on IoT devices' whereabouts and remembering that every machine out there can be an entry point for attack. The zero-trust model — Many started to hear about it in the past years, and more companies will adopt this approach moving forward. It abides by the principle that there are no trustworthy entities and that every actor (humans, departments, companies, etc.) should be under scrutiny — notably by only being given access to programs and systems that are relevant to their needs. So What Can You Do to Stay on Top of Trends and Threats? Basically, you can employ these three methods simultaneously: Monitor your own vulnerabilities While security programs can scan for weaknesses in systems, threat experts can study what attackers might be up to, for example, by using threat intelligence platforms and threat hunting techniques so that possible dangers are spotted at the earliest. Sign up for relevant sources Valuable information can come from unexpected sources, so make sure you check them. These can be forums, threat alert sites like US-CERT, social media, and other resources that methodically allow you to sift important information. Also make sure you subscribe and receive regular updates from news channels to hear about the latest stories related to cybercrime. Do domain monitoring Newly registered malicious domains can bring new facts to security professionals. It is because, for one, perpetrators have the habit of acquiring new domains and use them for phishing purposes or disseminate malware. To monitor these, you need to have access to a WHOIS database to spot connections between domain activities and criminal patterns. What Can You Do to Proactively Tackle Emerging Threats? A critical step before you proceed with tackling the dangers of the digital world is to make sure you don’t drown in a sea of information and approaches. Focus on your arena of security concerns, document all likely threat scenarios and experiment around your vulnerabilities. This will help separate the wheat from the chaff when you review potential sources of cyber-security information. Now that you’re ready to combat the threats, here are some proactive approaches to make it through: Domain reputation scoring — check websites’ danger level through a domain reputation score based on multiple parameters gathered across intelligence feeds. Threat intelligence and threat hunting — monitor third-party and their systems for vulnerabilities, anticipate possible dangers, and prevent attacks at the earliest. Securing all devices and processes — consider situations where data breaches might occur and make sure all relevant safety practices are in place: strong password policy, two-factor authentication, and updated software, to name a few. Leveraging WHOIS information — examine existing and newly registered domain names to detect malicious websites and identify entities behind them.",2021-03-06T10:36:58.232Z,"How do you stay current on cyber security trends and threats?

Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.  What is cybersecurity all about? A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyber attacks. A unified threat management system can automate integrations across select Cisco Security products and accelerate key security operations functions: detection, investigation, and remediation. People Users must understand and comply with basic data security principles like choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments in email, and backing up data. Learn more about basic cybersecurity principles. Processes Organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyber attacks. One well-respected framework can guide you. It explains how you can identify attacks, protect systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from successful attacks. Watch a video explanation of the NIST cybersecurity framework (1:54) Technology Technology is essential to giving organizations and individuals the computer security tools needed to protect themselves from cyber attacks. Three main entities must be protected: endpoint devices like computers, smart devices, and routers; networks; and the cloud. Common technology used to protect these entities include next-generation firewalls, DNS filtering, malware protection, antivirus software, and email security solutions. Why is cybersecurity important? In today’s connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyberdefense programs. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft, to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning. Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat researchers at Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyber attack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities, educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open source tools. Their work makes the Internet safer for everyone. Types of cybersecurity threats Ransomware Ransomware is a type of malicious software. It is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored. Watch how an attack unfolds (4:01)  Malware Malware is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer. Learn more about malware protection  Social engineering Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats listed above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source. Learn more about social engineering tactics  Phishing Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. It’s the most common type of cyber attack.

Here, the Blue Team are the defenders and are responsible for the safety of the system. This involves developing FireWalls, having proper Authentication and Authorization, Encryption among others.

Many are surprised to learn that 1:3 had healthcare records compromised in 2015. When you consider just last year over 100M records compromised, clearly hospitals are vulnerable to attack. Healthcare records are an incredibly high value target worth 100x that of credit cards on the black market. The reason their value is so high is that healthcare records contain immutable data meaning it’s not easily changed: SSAN, addresses past and present, contact information, insurance data making it valuable for a long time in terms of identity theft or insurance fraud. The reason healthcare is vulnerable is even though they have high value records, as a group, they spends 3% or less of their IT budget on security compared to over 13% for other industries. This means they have limited resources, combined with a staff, that many times due to market conditions, don’t have the experience or training afforded to other industries. Combine this with the constant struggle between easy and fast access to clinical data by physicians, nurses, and patience pitted against the need for tighter and tighter security. Healthcare is also unique with respect to security risk in that they are a loose federation of systems with fine balance between usability and security. In addition, unlike other industries, healthcare has multiple attack surfaces: - Electronic Medical Record Systems (EMR) - 3rd party systems and interfaces (payers, transcription, etc.) - Medical devices – many of which they have no control over OS or security levels - Remote providers and contractors who themselves introduce risk - Online patient and mobile access This means, even though they pass HIPAA audits, they don’t have the security infrastructure to protect against attacks other industries do. With their lack of funding in security (both software and services), healthcare will continue to be a target of opportunity regardless of their adherence to compliance standards… The only way to fix this issue, healthcare has to focus more of their resources on protecting the vital data they are entrusted with. Something I don't have space to cover here but is another major risk to healthcare due to their time sensitive data is Ransomware. To find out more about Ransomware, as well as links to healthcare specific resourced, see my article ‘Ransomware and Health Care: There’s More at Risk Than Just Money.’ Hope you found this helpful!” Any information IBM provides is not legal advice.

Companies and institutions will rarely expend the resources necessary for the collective security needed to protect the sector, until the right economic incentives are found. No cybersecurity architecture can be foolproof.why? In case of a complex system, attackers will always have the edge over defenders. The number of potential bugs and vulnerable points in any system mean that the mathematical odds favour the attackers. No code can be perfect enough to compensate for human error. Example:A bank might have robust cybersecurity architecture, but it will still be vulnerable if the systems of other networks that carry pertinent information are not secure. In software industry, the more people use a particular software, the more valuable it becomes- has led to a “release first, patch later” approach Guideline on Burden of proof. What it is? In case of ATM frauds, in US, burden of proof lay with the banks, fared much better than Britain, Norway and the Netherlands, where burden of proof lay with the customer.

It's important that you can help your coworkers triage and respond when necessary on any system. You will also need to be an expert on one system or type of system as your value add to the team.People skills are a must. You will need to be able to get people to tell you what they did wrong, why they did it, and tell you the truth on whether they took the remediation steps. This will require a degree of charisma.There will be things you can't talk about. Some people are able to do this quite well, others have problems with it. Sometimes things will happen at work that you should not tell your spouse or friends. In all honesty you shouldn't tell anyone exactly what you do, just keep it to the basic ""I work in IT Security"" and you'll be fine.If you're still interested after reading this, then cyber security might be right for you. It is definitely not for those with a weak stomach, and a lack of moral hangups is definitely a virtue in this business.  Regarding your other questions, it depends on where you work on whether you'll have free time. If you work at Netflix, where they write all their own software, you might be pretty compromised for time, where I work we try to keep a pretty strict regular schedule. Lastly, the job can be very stressful. If the company is ""burning"" and there is a dire crisis, you will be under pressure at the highest levels of executive management.

They are as listed below: The institute has to be an old one with years of existence and experience, which would result in the institute forming many contacts and connections in the entire industry.They should have the best and eminent industry experts as their trainers to provide you with the much-needed deeper insights on the topic, which they would be experts at. Also as an insider from the industry itself, they would also offer you more their insider’s perspective on how the industry operates in a very practically oriented manner.Make sure they cover the entire portion or syllabus in their said curriculum covering all the important topics under the vast field of Cyber Security and help you get a comprehensive learning experience through their training methodologies.Also they should be able to provide you with a certification that has immense value not only today, but also in the future and even out of India.They should help you gain complete holistic knowledge on the field with their assistance to boost your confidence, so that you would be able to face any interviewer and get a good paying job in turn.They should also provide you with the much-needed live projects and various work assignments so that you can practice on them and get a better hang of the entire working of the industry in the most practical manner.They should ultimately offer you 100% placement assistance through their dedicated placement cell, which offers you their complete assistance and guidance on getting a job, or freelancing opportunities, etc. in this field.Having mentioned these pointers, I would strongly recommend the Cyber Security course by Digital Vidya Institute, which is currently much in demand, and conducted in an online instructor-led format.

You may be able to find local physical contests as well, but this might be more difficult. I know they run them because our Cyber Defense Club in college participated in several, I just don’t know if you’d be able to easily find them in any city. For some context, in Cyber Security, “Capture the Flag” is more or less exactly what it sounds like, though usually its more “Flags”. Basically, each player has a machine or a handful of machines, and on those machines are some set number of “Flags” which may be files, or database entries, or web pages or really anything. The goal is for players to penetrate other players machines and collect the values of as many flags as possible. It’s up to you to secure your instance and the files and database on it so that other players can’t get your flags. This little game has the benefit of teaching you both offense and defense, as well as being pretty fun. Some advice if you plan on running your own matches with friends, I’d recommend using either cloud hosted VMs on some shared VPC, or spare machines that aren’t for everyday use. You can use personal computers, but it’s always harder to use a computer when you’re worried about securing it, and the resources need to remain on through out the entire game, so a cloud environment (especially if you can use a free one) is probably the best bet. Keep in mind these machines don’t need to be particularly beefy, so you will probably be able to set this up on free tier with AWS, or even use a handful of Raspberry Pis connected to the internet, the only real condition is that everyone participating can access everyone else’s machines (at least to begin with, before hardening) For simplicity, the flags should fit some kind of pattern so that players know when they’ve found them, in my class back in college, every machine had the same three flags in the same place, just with different values. So once you found and secured your own flags, you knew where the other players’ flags were. Playing with friends is also nice because it adds a human element, which will let you practice using and defending against techniques that might not be possible in a simulation, like social engineering or physical attacks.

Too many candidates, for whatever reason, arrive at the business from dubious backgrounds.  Somehow, they thought that breaking things was required to understand the technology.  Maybe!  But how did they go about breaking things?  If you chose to do it illegally, that doesn't bode well to have people trust your ethics.  Yes, the police will hire ex-criminals for some tasks.  But those tasks are limited and are under constant watch. So, when the question, ""Do I need to know algorithms to get into cyber security?"" is answered by just about everyone saying, ""No,"" what do the beginners think they should be studying?  They decide that they should be breaking things.  And we get into the issues above.  But also, if you want to know how to break things, you really ought to know how it was built in the first place.  Why is it that way?  And it is that way because other people, top-notch developers/architects/businessmen built them that way.  If something is broken, it's most likely they skipped something in favor of expediency or didn't expect people to even want to do something.  (I can't tell you the number of times I've heard a dev respond, ""Well, just tell them not to do that!"") So, instead, you really ought to be learning algorithms, getting hired into security companies as a top-notch developer/coder/programmer.

But at least I know what I'm skipping when I choose to skip it.) You read about the hackers, tv re-enforces the stereotypes, but they are few and far between.  That's why they capture the headlines.  But security companies have hundreds of thousands of employees.  Many of them are really talented.  They know the architecture of the machines inside out.  They can code in their sleep.  They are first top-notch developers/coders/programmers.  And they now know security as well. You don't get there overnight.  And you don't get there without building a foundation.

In general, architects needs to have big picture perspective and be able to do many things, so here we go: On Security Architect’s job: A lot of new technologies have come in, our perception of perimeter has hugely changed, but the way we approach work and the mission of security architects remain the same. Let me explain what I mean by that. The role of a security architect has always been to identify issues, design better solutions, help others do their work more securely, and do all that focusing always on the big picture. We’re responsible for designing and building security systems, and we align our internal processes and business strategy with industry best practices, standards and compliances. Very often, a security architect is the person that will go beyond technology and learn more about the business to understand the criticality of assets. They have to be a person that can lead, excel at communication and are capable of putting their words into action. We must to be able to think big and always think ahead to ensure our initiatives aren’t successful only for this time being, but they will be also relevant in the future. Security architects can specialise and should specialise in their field, and we have different names for them such as: Solution Security Architect, Application Security Architect, Enterprise Security Architect and so many more. Specialisation comes from the fact that we’re getting so many new technologies and challenges everyday; at large organisations, one person just doesn’t scale anymore. Given the rise in many new technologies, we have more catching up than ever, and it’s a part of our job to predict future threats, which is not getting easier with so many components changing. We have new programming frameworks and libraries, and new tools meant to increase engineering productivity. We have a lot of tiny changes such as new javascript frameworks but also hugely impactful ones such as transitions to public clouds, leaving behind in-house datacenters and similar innovations. Companies continue to grow and users evolve, which means we must adapt and implement scalable and usable solutions that will work for many years to come. On how you get there: Become an entry level security professional first. Don’t sweat too much about becoming an expert just yet. Appreciate the journey and don’t underestimate the value of having a varied background. If you have zero experience in security whatsoever (not necessarily in the field of IT), then I recommend becoming an expert in a different field. Start applying security concepts to your field of specialization. This has worked for so many talented professionals I know. Too many people want to get into security without prior experience in anything IT related. This doesn’t make them very valuable professionals because they tend to make myopic decisions without considering business context. Security is merely an addition to business operations, designed to support its longevity. It doesn’t exist on its own. You can read pentesting and bug bounties blogs, but pasting random payloads without deep understanding will prevent you from contributing much to your organization. Dive deep into anything you learn, stay curious, and enjoy ‘expert’ status in a few years. Now let’s assume you’re a total newbie starting from ground zero, whose dream is becoming a cyber security hero. Here are a few viable career options: Web App Security Tester - Learn how to code. It’s not necessary, but it is beneficial and it’s usually what separates wannabe experts from true experts. Learn how software stacks work and get a handle on web programming languages like Java, PHP and their respective frameworks. To break something and improve its resiliency afterward, you should understand how it all works. Once you review all the OWASP resources, you’ll know what to do next Network Security - Create a local lab network consisting of various components. Deploy services like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and research how to secure each element. While building, study what issues can arise during configuration and maintenance so you know what to avoid and how to test them when sysadmins hadn’t the time, interest or knowledge to do so. Then, focus on PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) Technical Guidelines to discover ways in which penetration testers and hackers can attack your network. Reverse engineer their methods to build proper defenses against future attacks. Compliance and Auditing - Learn about underlying technology and business models. You want to understand how businesses operate so you can protect them and ensure new regulations don’t hinder company innovation. Grab some good business books and gain business exposure by learning from executives and managers with real-world experience. Study industry best practices, like those from the Center for Internet Security, as well as regulated standards like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, DISA STIG, ISO 27001, SOC2 to understand how to make your organization compliant without negatively impacting productivity. Cryptographer/Cryptoanalyst - If you want to become an expert in this field, I recommend attending a university with strong mathematical and cryptography programs. This is a fascinating field that requires prior and substantial mathematical knowledge. Security Consultant - This position will help you gain experience working in IT or IT security, so you can understand the business and broaden your horizons. If you decide that you want to stay in consulting, research what big companies are doing, technology they use, and regulations they’re subject to, then learn how to manage these for them. Vulnerability Researcher - This narrow specialization requires focus in at least one field. Become proficient in at least one programming language, framework, and operating system. Then focus on a narrow set of functions in a given product or service. Examples include studying assembly, C programming language, learning how video transcoding works, and identifying weak spots in a library such as FFmpeg. Software Security Expert - Software engineers often become security experts. Be proficient in at least one technology stack, then apply all relevant security knowledge to making products safer. Strengthen security across your organization, responding to the demands of your colleagues and customers. Want to speed up this process? Pick technology that truly interests you and learn as much as you can about it. So instead of being Web App pentester, become a Node.JS security expert. Be a specialist, not a generalist. Find something that sparks your curiosity and become passionate about it. A few years of this will earn you the position and expertise you want. Remember, there’s no precise timeline to becoming a security expert because learning capabilities and experience vary from person to person, but if you truly want to be in this field, do your research and don’t give up.",2021-03-06T10:52:36.823Z,"How do I become a great cyber security architect?

There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*. Other data structures: You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible. You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means. Mathematics: Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because we are surrounded by counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk – the more the better. Operating Systems: Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of ""modern"" concurrency constructs.

Here’s an example: In Thought Leaders in Cyber Security: Appsian CEO Piyush Pandey | Sramana Mitra, Piyush answers my question as follows: Sramana Mitra: What do you see as open problems? Piyush Pandey: One of the key things which is a big topic right now is remote access. Over the next five to 10 years, people will want access to enterprise applications remotely. Your users or employees should be able to access critical business applications ubiquitously. To me, that is a critical trend. As that happens, you have to change how they were designed, how they are accessible to your employees. As you do that, you need to secure the data that’s being presented. Their security was not designed for ubiquitous access. When you think about people accessing remotely, you can open it up. But the threat vectors will change dramatically. We know some of these use cases, but we’ll identify a lot more over the next few years as things open up drastically. That’s a key trend in my view. You want your employees and users to be far more efficient in how they operate. As you do that, you have to continue investing in security tools from different aspects and not just one company. Even in data security, there are five ways to go about it. CIOs have to make their infrastructure according to the needs of the business which is making businesses more efficient. We provide more control in managing those business applications. That’s what we’re trying to do in terms of the trend of the market. One is efficiency, ubiquitous access, and investing in infrastructure to secure and control the data flow. Sramana Mitra: The remote work trend is going to be very big. It’s going to increase greatly. If you’re trying to find a new idea to work on for a new startup, I suggest you go through a number of these interviews with a close eye towards that open problem question.

This makes your computer vulnerable to instances of security breach and leakage of confidential data. History has witnessed many information and security breaches at large scale one of them being the 2013 breach of 1 billion Yahoo users. The current scenario makes Cyber and Computer security is one of the biggest concerns of the modern digitalized world. Many threats arise if our computer and other systems are not protected efficiently. Securing your computer is a way to detect and protect against any kind of unauthorized use of your computer by hackers. It gives you the freedom to: Be notified of unauthorized access to your data and system,Prevent any such suspicious activity from happening to your computerSome common threats to your system: ● 	Increased online communications have led to easy access to the personal data of a lot of people and others linked to them. Hackers may gain control of your computer to snoop in on the data of other individuals which may result in the grave cases of identity theft in the worst-case scenario. ● 	Sometimes the sole purpose of the hackers or people with malicious intents is to use your system as camouflage and hide their own identity, these hackers are using your details while they try to target high profile computer systems housing data for financial and government system. ● 	Monitoring of your actions, gaining access to your data, and modification, and deletion of your files are some other risks your computer lies at if not protected. ● 	Mobile banking has certainly made our lives easier but without structured protection against any charry elements, it may also lead the public to financial damage at the hands of hackers. Safeguards offered by banks in the form of mobile applications surely provides a better wall against any such activity but some of the online transaction may not be encrypted and result in malware spread and theft. Computer and cybersecurity are very important in today's world, where so much of our information is available so widely and can be accessed by anyone. Information theft is one of the most common and costly forms of cyber threat. There are also instances where the hackers don’t just try to steal the identity or information but modify important data causing distrust within the organizations. Social engineering has proved to be one of the most common forms of cyber-attack done through activities like ransomware, phishing, and spyware. Without proper cyber and computer security too, the third and fourth-party vendors who are often not capable enough to provide good enough cybersecurity to their interfaces. Any kind of data breach may involve all your financial data from your bank details, credit card details, healthcare details, trade secrets, intellectual property, personal health information, and other details that may act as industrial espionage. All of the above-mentioned damage that may be caused by the careless use of the internet. This makes not only the adoption but also spreading awareness regarding proper computer security measures an intrinsic move by people. By adopting proper security measures for your system, you are not only protecting yourself against any kind of threat but also the people who are connected to you in any way. Securing your computer against threats is very easy. All you need to do is use all the required trusted software that protect your computer from potential harm along with using a secure password and avoiding any suspicious source on the internet. Some of the software that is intrinsic to your computers’ safety are: 1) Anti-Virus Software: They are the most common form of protection any kind of computer uses. It protects you against viruses that may tamper with your data and reduce the performance of your computer. This software must be updated routinely as there are constantly new kinds of viruses being developed. 2) Anti-Spyware Software: Spywares are the programs that may get installed on your computer and leak your private information to its servers. The important data may include passwords, credit card numbers, and SSN. This software too must be constantly updated for best protection against any kind of harm to your data. 3) Firewall: Good firewall software helps you access the internet and browse across various platforms without a shred of worry. The firewall blocks unauthorized traffic and doesn't let any other individuals access your computer.

Going to give the same advice I have given before when considering careers and markets. Ask a recruiter in that particular field what they are hearing from local clients. Don’t listen to people trying to sell you a dream career, don’t listen to your parents or people on Q2A boards but do your own real research. A career is a long time to work at something your not really interested in. With this case InfoSec requires more lab and practice time than any other field I know.

Plus the millions of dollars in fines you'll face for not protecting customers data. You may have heard about the ransom of Baltimore back in May. Hackers infiltrated Baltimore’s government through an innocent-looking email with ransomware called ""RobbinHood"". They held the city ransom... Demanding $70,000 after they broke into computer systems and shut down most of their servers. Services in the city came to a standstill and the damage clocked in at around $18.2 million. And when I spoke with their security staff in the weeks following the attack, they told me this: “Most companies are filled that don’t take security seriously.” “The risk of a cyber incident due to human error outweighs everything else.” That's a tough position to be in. And building a security culture is tough, believe me. But the peace of mind you’ll feel from building up a ""human firewall"" trumps any other method. You can reduce data breaches and cyber incidents with a strong security culture. And with preparation, you can cut the financial impact of a data breach to your business. That means making sure you have the most important elements of a strong security culture: 1. Security awareness training videos and quizzes so all your staff recognize threats. 2. Thorough cybersecurity checklists so you can cut organizational risk. 3. Phishing tools so you know who needs more help understanding cyber safety. 4. Cybersecurity planning so your business has a plan to survive when disasters strike. That's a lot to put together, especially for smaller organizations. That’s why I made a new training course to help everyone in your community understand cybersecurity easily. As celebration for hitting 450,000 students this year, and as my thanks for reading this far I want to offer a full month of access to the first 10,000 readers here.

A cyber analysis method is a threat-oriented approach for combating cyberattacks that shows a change from reactive security to proactive security.  Furthermore, the result of cybersecurity analysis will then give an organization the best practices on maximizing the protecting instruments with respect to availability, integrity, and confidentiality without having to turn back to usability and functionality conditions. What is threat analysis? A threat analysis could be a method employed by cybersecurity analysts to see the parts of a system that has to be protected and therefore the style of security threats to guard the element against. What is more, you'll be able to use the data to see the strategic locations in spec and style to fairly and effectively implement security. What is cyber threat modeling? Cyber threat modeling is a structured process that can determine potential security threats and weaknesses, decide how serious the threat and implement techniques for mitigating the attack and protecting IT resources. Furthermore, the most important thing about the threat model is that it is systematic and structured. This implies that threat modelers follow a series of steps in understanding the environment they are trying to secure while identifying weaknesses and potential attackers. Cyber Threat Analysis Process and Components According to software engineer Goran Aviani, a threat analysis’s goal is to answer four questions, namely: What are we working on?What are the things that can go wrong?How do we go about problems that occur?Did we do a good job?Components of the Cyber Threat Analysis Process This then implies that the modeling process needs to follow four broad steps that produce answers to the questions above. 1. Scope The first step in any cyber threat analysis should be to identify the assets you want to safeguard from cyberattacks and are critical to business processes. 2. Collection of Data In the assortment of information stage, data regarding associate actual cyber-attack or threat incidents is collected. during this stage, you need to distinguish between real potential attacks and threats that aren't real however still thought of as potential threats. The scope ought to facilitate separate out such threats to make sure that the main focus is on the threats that exist. 3. Vulnerability Analysis of Acceptable Risks In this phase, the analysts test the information gathered to determine the extent of current exposure. Existing security defense is then tested to decide whether or not it can neutralize information threats in terms of integrity, availability, and confidentiality. 4. Mitigation and Anticipation In the final step, an extremely qualified cyber threat analyst uses the data gathered from the previous sector to see preventive measures that have to be enforced. The analyst will categorize the threat knowledge into teams, assign every pattern to specific threat actors, and implement mitigation measures. At a similar time, the analyst can use knowledge concerning potential threats to anticipate future cyber attacks.

Web Application Penetration Testing - This kind of penetration testing is used to find flaws in a Website or a Web Application, where it can lead to lethal cyber attack on a firm. For Example : XSS (Cross - Site Script) flaw can lead to HTTP Parameter Contamination and Web Defacement, CSRF Flaw in a server can lead to make lethal cyber attack on a server, for example if a bank server is vulnerable to CSRF attack then it might lead to lose of administrative access & can cause robbery of money in the bank which is even lethal than a external bank robbery.Network Penetration Testing - This kind of penetration testing is used to find flaw in a network protocol. For example: If a FTP Protocol (Port No. 21) is open up, and the password security is very weak, an attacker is easy to guess the FTP password & can easily access the FTP, leading to breach of security. A Sample Shot of Network Penetration Testing is given below 3. Penetration Testing on Software tools: This kind of penetration testing is used to find flaws in a Software tools using some tools such as Immunity Debugger, Tripwire in Windows and Using objdump, gdb tools in Linux. Mainly you will find some bugs such as Buffer Overflow, heap overflow, Zero Day etc, where zero - day is the most lethal.

Catering to the justification of a leader’s triumph through one’s tireless efforts and skill, CIO Look presents you the journey of an avid leader, Mark Rees, the COO of Secucloud. Below are the highlights of the interview conducted between Mark and CIO Look: Give a brief overview of your background and your role in the company. I joined Secucloud´s management team in 2016 at the point where, Dennis Monner was transforming it from a start up to a mature company. As a team we have driven the change in organization, processes and culture so that we have become larger in terms of both staff and business, whilst maintaining our start up velocity. A 100% focus on our supply / value chain and efficiency of our work environment is the key to achieving this business growth. Our Mantra is “how can we do our tasks better and faster next time round?” i.e. continuous improvement. As we have attained the switch from a startup (the integrative phase in classic company development) within 18 months, my specific focus is now moving more and more to the external market environment (aka the associative phase) e.g. promoting the company globally, handling regulatory issues / certifications, stakeholder management and analyzing strategic market trends from a business development perspective. How do you diversify your tech solutions that appeal to your target audience? Our vision and therefore our mission is to democratize enterprise grade cyber-security for a wider economy and so offer total cyber security protection using network based protection and when relevant supplemented with endpoint protection. Our solution provides threat protection in any type of network (mobile/fix line), on any type of device (Smartphone, PCs, IoT), for any type of user group (consumer, SMEs, enterprise). What were the past experiences, achievements or lessons that shaped your journey? I think the most important experience that shaped me in my 20+ years in management is not being afraid of failing. It doesn´t actually hurt in terms of physical pain. Instead it presents one with new and unexpected opportunities to grow. Fear of failure holds people and organizations back, make them passive and inward looking, thus they end up being out of touch with external threats and opportunities. These two factors should be continually addressed from a strategic business perspective. In terms of achievements, I think that every objective I have approached as a challenge and with the attitude of making a difference, which resulted in a step forward, is an achievement.

We are looking at a time when the government has started taking conscious and even drastic measures to ensuring the country's motion towards digitisation. This has started with the financial sector - one of the most crucial lifelines of a country. With the rise in digitisation, the attacks on digital financial structures are inevitable - and an industry is steadily rising to provide the necessary services for securing these platforms. ""Necessity is the mother of invention"" - and this is the first time in India when we consciously need steps towards public cyber security. I believe the government is also following this line of thinking by their recent announcement of a FinCERT (Financial Computer Emergency Response Team). Hence, I think the future of cyber security is too bright and too speculative to really predict but we can definitely see many good signs. But I want to go beyond the scope of this answer. Yes, India is going to be competent in cyber security in the time to come, but is that where our duty as citizens ends? Cyber security is a field of precision and perseverance, and mostly ends up being a cat and mouse chase between the hacker and the security analyst. So if we are to take up the task of building national level secure digital infrastructure we must all actively participate and contribute. The above statements are much more applicable on students than professionals in my opinion. A recent NASSCOM report states that there is a huge shortage of skilled cyber security professionals and as much as 15 lakh jobs will be vacant in India alone by 2019. The field of cyber security is in many ways open ended where sky is the limit - and the opportunities it offers because of having both high demand and low availability of good professionals for jobs makes it an exciting (not to mention lucrative) offer for students to consider. The challenge however that often arises is - where to learn? Well, over the last decade many efforts have been made in our country to boost awareness - both technical and social - of cyber security among the youth of India but the majority of students are still ignorant to events and competitions related to cyber security which happen globally, or even in India. Because of the “hacking” stigma around cyber security there are not many resources for beginners to learn about this field. However in my suggestion if you are interested in learning you should check out the concept of CTFs and Wargames. These are basically online game-based platforms to teach participants many diverse concepts in cyber security. The only prerequisites is just any sort of experience with the Linux OS. CTFs are “Capture The Flag” contests lasting somewhere around 36 hours - they revolve around 5 basic fields in cyber security - Binary exploitation, Cryptography, Forensics, Reverse engineering, and Web exploitation. There are many internationally played CTFs and they are an excellent platform to build cyber security skills. Then there are Wargames which are much similar to CTFs but they don’t have a time limit and are more focused towards learning than competing with other individuals/teams (like in CTFs). If you are a school student and interested, I would urge you to check out InCTF Junior - an online CTF running specifically for school students to pique and promote their interest in cyber security. This year is its second edition and it is going to be more of a Wargame style this time. At the culmination of the CTF, there will be a 6-day workshop - which we call Cyber Gurukulam - conducted by professionals from Amrita University (whose student team: bi0s is the top CTF team in India) aimed at cyber security training of the participating students - of course there will be prizes too :). We would really want interested students to take part for an experience in practical cyber security skills, especially if you intend to make a career in this field. Please visit the website of InCTF Junior. Registrations will be opened in early March (on individual basis) - and in case you are wondering, the entire process is completely free - including registration for the CTF and stay at the Amrita University, Bangalore Campus for the selected students for Cyber Gurukulam. Also, if you are interested and are about to pass school, you can look into admissions to Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus. We have a really great culture for cyber security here (besides other things) and our CTF team: bi0s is currently the rank 1 team in India as on ctftime.org.

Being an expert in Cyber Security, would essentially mean that you get trained from an expert from this industry itself. But in my strong opinion and experience from this field, I would highly recommend you to take up some self-study that would give you a fair general idea as to what this field is all about, and prepare you beforehand to ask better questions to the training provider or expert. You self-study would essentially include reading a lot about the topic itself and practicing it if possible referring to the various popular free online resources. And further I would highly recommend attending the free online demo session on Cyber Security being conducted by the Digital Vidya Institute, to help you gain some more information about the field in detail. And also as a part of the course completion they would help you with 100% placement assistance to help you kick start your career from scratch.

Cons: The hours can be absolutely straining on you, your family, marriage as you will likely be on call 7/24/365 - particularly in small shops. Be prepared to answer calls on vacation, etc. Its part of what I have been doing for decades and I am fine with it but doesn’t mean keeping blinders on or ignoring this fact. Family unfriendly to the point where I meet few females in the industry because of the above time requirement. Studying and learning is its own part-time job and cottage industry unto itself. Most good to excellent security people I know have fully developed labs AT HOME. We spend a good percentage of our time, energy and hard earned cash on that lab playing with new software, taking things apart forensically and general hacking. I pay for much of my own coursework and certifications. My company does not pay for these things until you have been with the organization for a year and not cert renewals. Toss in about 500 dollars a year in renewals. The grind can definitely get to you. Most of the first and second generation practitioners I have known over my career now do almost anything but security. High burn-out. I am considered second generation to the field with over 20 years of full time practice. Those who came before me were far and few between or were working in physical security and moved into InfosSec later. Constantly explaining what it is InfoSec is and does gets incredibly boorish after the third or fourth time a day for the rest of your career. People who say ‘cybersecurity’ should be taken out back and shot Government types also use ‘cyber’ when they run out of bureaucratic nonsense to spout - see first group.

They all hit pretty spot on—I think the last gentleman, Mr. Colao, may be accurate when he claims they are fewer than before. However— You ARE hearing much more about them. This is large part due to the number of pretty egregious failures that have been brought to light recently. Experian. U.S. Government OPM data breach. Wells Fargo. These all picked up some pretty high level reporting, and all were handled less than expeditiously, and in some cases, were covered up, causing bad things to happen to people. The target set is ever expanding (more computers, more computing types, more software, more hardware). There are new exploits all the time due to new innovations always coming out. To be perfectly clear, though, most exploits are well known, due to poor operator practices, mixed with unpatched or overlooked systems. Active scanning for an exploitable system is occurring every second of every day. Don’t believe me? Hang a box with XP on your home router using a dedicated external IP. Watch how long it stays up and responsive. With that sort of environment, the slightest lapse in user care, the one week delay over holiday in patching your stuff, and your system could be toast. The ever expanding target set, the continuous threat environment, and the ubiquitous human being—all of these contribute to the increase in publicized exploits. One more key thing in this discussion—cybercrime takes a little bit of work and knowledge, but it has very little danger to the perpetrator for the benefit to be made. Want to suffer a broken leg and a broken jaw? Jack a drug dealer for $1500 and some coke or heroine. Want to go to prison for ten years? Rob a bank at gunpoint for a take of $2500 bucks that you only got to touch once before the nice popo click the cuffs on. Want to do six months jail time and three years parole and be rich? Hack a brokerage and take $2 million. Give $1 million and change back (claim the other part was spent) and live life large. I hope I was able to lend a bit of structure to your question about this.
