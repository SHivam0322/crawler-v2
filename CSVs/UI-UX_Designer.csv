Web Design  Image Source: Google Web designers today are usually modern era graphic designers trained in visual design to be experts in: Creative concepting Color theory Typography Icon development Diagrams Infographics Interactivity, i.e., rollovers, drop-down me nus, digital slideshows, call-to-action buttons and forms. A web designer may have basic knowledge of information architecture (IA), HTML and JavaScript coding, but most designers must partner with a web developer for writing code fit for production and an information architect for the IA. The web designer is also focused on the client's brand from both a visual and messaging perspective. UX Design  Image Source: Google UX is the acronym for ""User Experience."" UX design brings a decidedly left brain component to a digital experience and may encompass the design of apps or other software products as well as websites. While a good web designer is focused on the end user's experience, the UX designer takes it to the next level and applies a specific methodology around the user. A strong focus on UX may be a good fit for websites of some complexity due to: Multiple user types Multiple products or services catering to different audiences Size of the website Merger or acquisition UI Design  Image Source: Google UI stands for User Interface, which comes out of the software world in which the User Interface of a product IS the product. UI designers traditionally are experts in designing machine to human interfaces. The adage ""Form Follows Function"" is the operating principal in UI Design. With regard to websites, UI Design is more synonymous with front-end development, i.e., managing complex information, tasks and workflows and distilling it into screens and flows that are intutitive and make something complex appear simple. In essence, UI Design represents the intersection of programming and design. Different jobs, different salaries  Image Source: Google Now that you fully understand the difference between all three terms, let’s have a look at career prospects. You may be wondering how much a UX, UI or web designer earns and whether it will influence your decision. We’ll use PayScale for salary indications, but you can also use Glassdoor if you want a second opinion. Salary of UX designer: UK: £31,000 | US: $95,000 | Australia: AU$70,607 | India: Rs 609,379 Salary of UI designer: UK: £29,293 | US: $85,832 | Australia: AU$63,182 | India: Rs 405,211 Salary of web designer: UK: £22,860 | US: $48,495 | Australia: AU$52,595 | India: Rs 229,873 You can see that UX designers earn more than the two others. But don’t make it be your one and only reason why you choose this career path over the others. At the end of the day, you’ll want to be happy in your job and that’s why you need to pick the one that meets your wishes best.",2021-03-06T05:40:09.957Z,"What is the difference between a UX and UI designer and a web designer?

I dabble in all things but for all jobs I do there is a better more specialized tool out there. I'm not sure what combination of circumstance, genetics and experience truly made me equally passionate about ""all the things!"" but it feels like I came this way out of the box. I agree that its also about the platform and the tools. Here is an interface that despite my pixel perfect orange number bullets and its intent to be a mini design tool and being coded in swingx (JavaFX was too new at the time) is still very very java-esque.  JavaFX can help but still has less than ideal tooling. Here is a JavaFX example fulled from studio moto powered by motorola. One can make art with sticks and mud.  Artists want to become one with a tool and have a unified unfragmented experience where the same logic can be applied at all levels. Macromedia era Flash; more than any other developer tool provides that for the interactive designer. Seemless allowing designers to reuse and build up asset libraries that a coder would describe as DRY without ever making the designer learn OOP or right code but naturally flows out of a few simple features. Here is a pure vector flash UI I did circa 2002. All pure scalable vectors composed and designed in flash.  Oddly enough this had a Java middle tier and a C++ backend and some serious ActionScript for automated animations and to wire into the middle tier. One reason I am addicted to startups is that I get to apply not only my engineering and design chops but also other facets like sociology, psychology, business and finance. I recently joined tixie.com and we just started hiring our first specialists after I've been trying to keep the boat afloat for 3 months. So in conclusion its a supply side problem of rare unicorns combined with tools that act as barriers to the learning that comes from creative experimentation.",2021-03-06T05:41:48.439Z,"Why are Java developers bad UI and UX designers?

A lot of people will try to skip over this step, which leads to “The Dribbilization of Design” [1]that many people bemoan these days: Pretty solutions in search of an actual problem (or “Dear Lord, not another weather app design…”) Research involves a lot of time talking to users. Audio recorders, Pen and paper, video recorders, software such as Silverback (Mac) or Camtasia (Win), and a lot of checking your assumptions at the door. Research creates our personas, our user stories, and so much more. It should be used continuously to test prototypes and concepts. Sometimes this is done in a lab, sometimes it’s done in the field and sometimes it’s done in the field and filmed/edited into something that is more than just for the rest of the team (e.g. Kelly Goto’s gotomedia company’s work) You can use tools like fullstory.com to record interactions of actual users and see flow problems in production. Many people working in the research area also have Psychology and Human Computer Interaction backgrounds, which is more formal and can be very valuable in jumping past some of the unknowns. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE/STRATEGY IA is the traditional label to “wireframes” but it’s broader now. This is where the base flows begin, the content strategy happens, the product is defined, and the magic actually happens. What comes after is completely reliant on a good foundation here. And most of the work is analog. There are artifacts created in Visio or OmniGraffile or Illustrator or InDesign. Many times things stay on paper until they’re turned into a clickable prototype with Keynote, InVision, or another similar tool. Brand, voice, and other foundational concepts must be worked out here in order for a product to succeed. They can happen concurrently, and sometimes we go back and fix them, but if they aren’t ever handled, the product is not going to compete well. EXPERIENCE DESIGN This is where the rubber meets the road, the interfaces start to line up, and things go from concepts into clickable realities. Things that worked great in concept fail rapidly at this point. There’s as many tools as there are designers, but most of my day is spent with trace paper and pen, which then is converted into a Sketch file (I used to use Photoshop and Fireworks). There’s many designers who like working in Illustrator as well. Adobe recently released a beta of their new UX design tool (“XD”), which means everyone will now say “I do experience design!” because they opened the application once. INTERFACE/INTERACTION/MOTION DESIGN This overlaps with Experience Design. Many designers are doubling up working through experience flows and then also making decisions about the actual spit and polish of the application, especially in smaller teams. The larger the team, the more likely this is to be a specialized role. Some motion designers work straight in code. Some use frameworks built on top of developer tools (e.g. Apple’s Quartz Composer or Oragami Studio[2] from Facebook). Not all apps need this kind of interaction work, and sometimes it’s prototyped as straight up motion graphics video (After Effects, etc). So all that being said, how does that convert to me? MY DAILY RUN So I’m a team of one, doing all the design for a small startup. I’m pow-wowing with the CMO, CTO, and CEO on a regular basis to provide resources we need. I’m also handling marketing design. Most of the time I start on pen and paper (working from home, most of my wall space is bookshelves, and a whiteboard is difficult to hide). Pretty much use the majority of the Adobe suite, Sketch, TextMate/Atom, Tower (git client), and Office-esque tools. MY FREELANCE RUN When I’m doing freelance work I’m more of a hybrid Product Manager/UX designer/Front-end dev (no JS). Again I’m starting with pen and paper, moving rapidly into Sketch (where I’ve built a kit of parts for the brand as I’ve gone) and I’m posting mocks for review with developers and client alike in InVision. I’m delivering HTML/CSS into the git repository with TextMate or Atom, Terminal, and Tower (git GUI client) So, the answers are going to probably be as numerous as the designers who reply. The basics is finding out what you want to do, what you excel at and enjoy, and then tool up around the jobs you’re trying to do. I guaruntee that in 5 years, we’ll have new tools to talk about. The tasks will be (mostly) the same.

They need some assistance from experienced guys in our team. Following are the points which will give you more clarity to choose the courses & platform to update your knowledge. We all get tons of knowledge and information everyday over internet, its quiet easy for our mind to get stuck in dualities and lead in confusion. While searching for the information and going through various articles/blogs or forums we easily get distracted towards other links and content and loose our focus. (this has happened with me too).Ultimately once you have lost your focus there are rare chances to reach upto your desired target. Considering this user behavioural pattern, we must stay focused (at least when our goal is to top up our knowledge/skills) and choose a course which is fairly engaging and interactive.For me & many - videos works best. It will help you to stay focus and will increase your memory & attention span. Video simply works in a different dimensions and creates a trust. The best part is you do mind to watch it again and again till you understand it. (reading is a boring activity for most of the creative people)The content of the course is equally important and has to be well structured.I found Lynda as a perfect platform which helps you to choose your content, costs low, gives you better control/flexibility and helps you to stay focused. It also motivates you by offering certifications which you can attach with your Linkedin profile and cross checks your knowledge by (session wise) by taking quick exams immediately. If you are looking for something free then Youtube may help you for particular topic but let’s accept Youtube is not meant to be educational platform. Their goal is different, so at some point of time you will have to shift.Before going for any big courses I suggest all the beginners to take a small step and go for video based courses by investing small amount.Trust this will help you.
