One can’t yell “Fire!” in an occupied theater, if no fire is seen, nor even suspected to exist in the theater. AFAIK, this was taken up by the Supreme Court long ago.

Other than that you can post a detailed scenario in the form of an answer the way I am doing so that other quorans can help you out. ▪My post which had 4.2k views and 52 upvotes has been suddenly hidden by moderators on “Stay Motivated” space. No explanation no reason. ▪I was demoted from a contributor to follower. When I tried reaching out to admin/moderator and requested them to unhide the post, my comments were immediately deleted and I was demoted to a follower. I tried several times to comment in the pinned section in space but comments were deleted and now all comments are disabled. If you are in similar situation then there is no way out other than reporting. On top of everything what surprises me to the core is that, this space which is for motivational and inspirational purposes is being unfair to a dedicated contributor. The irony of bieng at the mercy of an admin. From contributor  . To follower  . The post has been hidden on space  . Views on my post  Why would a space moderator/admin hide a post after getting fair amount of views and upvotes? (If it violates any rules they should remove it immediately as soon as it is posted) When you ask clarification they throw you out of space, comments disabled and you have no way to reach out. If you have been through similar discouragement let me know how to deal with unfair admins and moderators for spaces here on quora? (whoever is reading this post). In the end, we must remember our graves will always be the same size. Summi There is no such thing as a Quora moderator. They don’t exist. They can’t exist. There simply aren’t the staff for it. When any question, answer or comment gets 2 or more reports of the same nature, it is automatically collapsed. It still exists but is not visible. Note, I said reports, not downvotes. Downvotes also collapse content but you can still view them by clicking on a link. The notifications that “Quora Moderation” is doing something are misleading. There is no such thing as Quora Moderation. It doesn’t exist. What it is is the action of an everyday Quora user, like you or me. It is not Quora Moderation. It doesn’t exist. For example, if two or more people reported this answer for any reason they like, no matter if true or not, and those reasons were the same, the answer would be automatically collapsed and I’d get a notification from “Quora Moderation”. Whether it breaks any rules is irrelevant. And your chances of appealing are zero, because, like I said, there is no Quora Moderation. Hopefully that is clear by now. There is no Quora Moderation. It doesn’t exist. It really depends on the context. In a debate a moderator will be the neutral party directing the debate. Making sure that all participants keep within the timelimits allowed and that the tone is kept at least semi decent. In the context of my work with user-generated content however, a moderator is a person trained to spot scams and frauds as well as detecting other users contributions that goes against the rules and policies of the site/app they are moderating. Good moderators are on top of current trends within the industry they are moderating for. They are also great at sharing and distributing information to the rest of the company. Moderators will often be the first to spot new user behaviors and they are the very first line of defense against scammers. The role of a moderator as such is to ensure that user-generated content posted on a site/app maintains a certain level of quality and to protect users from those that might abuse the trust the site/app has built with its user base. We often refer to our moderators as the super heroes of the Internet. :)",2021-03-06T14:37:45.974Z,"How do I become a Quora content moderator? ",Quora

During my journey, I’ve learnt several things. To become an established freelance writer, you need to- Write, write and writeIt may seem as a very lame suggestion and you may be like, duh I know. But believe me, to become an established freelance writer, the primary thing that you need, is to hone your writing skills. Practice writing as much as you can. 2. Read a lot Your writing skills will improve when you have a kack for reading a lot. It will not only increase your vocabulary but also will help you expand your horizon. 3. Learn new skills As much as quality content is preferred by clients, there are stuffs that you must keep in mind while writing for a them. When you become a freelance writer for a website, your client relies on you to write content that is good in quality and helps in ranking his website. Learn search engine optimization(SEO) basic html and wordpress. If you do not want to learn the languages, atleast learn SEO. After you’ve aquired your skills and have decided that now you CAN write for clients, here’s a list of things you need to do. Make a websiteA writer MUST have a website. If you do not, make one. You do not need to have advanced website making skills or learn a whole set of programming languages. All you need is just go to a free website maker like wix or wordpress and make one. 2. Write blogs Blog writing helps you hone your writing skills. And for your website visitors, this is the place where they’d be entertained and spend the most of their visiting time. This will also become an area where your prospective clients will examine your skills and consider you for their project. But before starting to write blogs, you need to choose a writing niche. 3. Choose a niche A writing niche is a just like genres. There are many writing niches. You may be familiar with few, like, fashion, lifestyle, IT, sports, business, health, entertainment etc. Do not be tempted to say that you can write on virtually any topic because believe me, nobody can. Juggle your options and choose the right one. After you’ve set up your website and have written few blogs, Start with writing internshipsClients will always want an experienced writer. They neither have time nor money to consider an unexperienced one. On the other hand, internships, though low paying, will consider you and give you projects to do. The end result would be an addition to your portfolio. There are many websites like internshala (many others are there, search them) where eminent companies register to offer internships. 2. Pitch on job boards Clients hang out on job boards to hire freelance writers. Here’s where you’ll meet prospective clients and get work. Before doing that, do not forget to add the links of your published works(from the internships)to your portfolio and provide a link to your portfolio and blog on your CV. 3. Register in freelance service providing website They are also a means to gain a clientele. Sites like fiverr, freelancer, truelancer etc provides opportunities for freelancers(not just writers) a platform to showcase their skills and get clients. On the other hand, there are websites like wittypen, iwriter, which are just for freelance writers. They will examine your skills before welcoming you onboard. 4. Make a professional twitter and linedin profile A professional twitter profile is very important. Twitter along with linkedin is a great place to expand your network. Do not just create a profile, add a profile picture and sit back. Follow people and in turn they will follow you back along with people who follow them. Tweet regularly (your can tweet about your work, your current project, about writing or promote your latest blog posts). I hope this answer was able to solve your query.

Improv comedy is great, but improvisation isn’t part of your business ethos. 3) “I’m trustworthy.” You don’t hold your cards too close to your chest. This doesn’t mean you smoke a peace pipe every weekend with your competitors and exchange marketing tips. It does mean: When it comes to your customers you have a relational mindset, not a transactional one. Sure, you want to make money, but you don’t have an obsessively bottom-line orientation.

You’re willing to put your ideas out there because they’re helpful (but not necessarily perfect).This is a conversation.

Content Moderation basically is the implementation Process based on few well defined policy guidelines and is done by Content Moderators. User generated content are the content which we published in social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram even in market place as well as E-commerce site or even in You tube that might be the comments or the you tube Video. Even what we publish in Quora is the user generated content. User’s like us don’t use this term. Term “user generated content” is used by the backened team who are moderators. For them what we publish is the user generated content. So basically every damn thing what we post in the online platform is the user generated content.

It’s also important to know, going no one with a strong opinion is at the forum to cheer the moderators, and everyone who gets a post modified or deleted will feel wronged. If you do your job right as a moderator, however, you can encourage members to express their positions in a way that advances discussion. No, you won’t see people change their minds, but you can see some lively debate with good points made from more than one perspective. If you are asked to be a moderator by the site owner, be sure to discuss where the boundaries are. Some forums allow profanity or NSFW images, for example, while others do not. You want posts to stay on-topic, and you absolutely want to look out and respond to threats or personal attacks. It’s also important to understand that you will make mistakes. Here on Quora I have seen valid posts deleted because a moderator chose to remove them. My point there, is that moderators are human and trying to do the best they can - a deletion of a good post does mean the moderator is unfair or a bad moderator. Anyway, most forums are free and moderators are unpaid, so while people get angry out of proportion. As a moderator, you will hear a lot of emotional reaction, sometimes bitter abuse from members, when you take an action, even when you are right to delete a post or warn a member. You need to stay calm and just move on to the next decision. In the end, if you work as a content moderator, you are doing it for the community, not for fame, power or any tangible benefit. But helping a forum stay clean and produce a wide range of valid experience and perspectives is a good service to the community, and can make a good forum into a great one.

6043983ced76476feda2fb22,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emotional-and-psychological-effects-of-content-moderation?-,"Quora is far from transparent on this, but my experience leads me to believe that there are two kinds of automatic answer collapses on Quora: collapses of short answers and collapses from user reports. Collapses for short answers is an abomination and worse than the disease (if there even is one). If you look at my Quora stats (or so people tell me), you will see around 16,000 answers, but if I look at them I see almost 20,000 answers. So far, every one of these disparities I’ve researched involves a short answer, one which in my UI does not appear to be collapsed, but collapsed for others and invisible to search engines. Sometimes a short answer is all that is needed, and pretty much all that can be given. For example, I answered a recent question that asked, “Isn’t Donald Trump an ‘anchor baby?’” with a simple answer that included the relevant facts. The answer is collapsed. I think my answer is better than the other two longer ones not collapsed. I am much more attuned to the length of my answers now, and I add irrelevant stuff to the end just to keep the useful stuff from being collapsed. In the case of collapses for user reports, I cannot say whether this is worse than nothing or not. I know that there is much abuse of user reports on controversial subjects. I get collapsed all the time for perfectly good answers, ones that are restored on appeal. On the other hand, there is a lot of bad content on Quora that deserves to be collapsed, and I report a lot of it. I don’t have enough data to say if the right balance is struck. This is a great question… and there’s an answer! Two types of moderation to consider: AI/software/algorithmicAn engineer will oversee the filter(s)’ performance and address as necessary if the moderation is too “harsh” or “lax” or if new phrases or images need to be fed into the program for future recognition.HumanA moderator. You read that correctly. A manager will oversee and moderate moderators’ work. This includes weekly catchups, spot checking, and even feeding “test” images and text etc. into the queue for human moderators to ensure people are on their toes. Best practice also dictates that teams’ performance is celebrated. This might include end-of-month awards for folks who got through their queues fastest but also with the fewest errors etc. WebPurify takes QA very seriously and implements all of the above to ensure our human moderators are the best in the biz. Successful Moderation follows the establishment of reliable systems and processes where the roles of school, teachers, and students are clearly defined. Prodecure for Moderation:_ The moderation process begins with the planning of teaching, learning and assessment.Moderation involves a group of teachers discussing evidence of studen,t learning.Assessments of the evidence are made using specific shared criteria.The criteria may be exemplified through annotated examples and other national resources (for example, the Running Record DVD/booklet, the Diagnostic Interview and Getting Started Numeracy Development Project Books and New Zealand Curriculum Exemplars).Moderation may involve teachers within a group, within a school or from different schools.Schools design their moderation processes to suit their situation and needs. They consider factors such as: the purpose, learning area and context of the moderationthe size of the schoolthe number of student samples to be includedhow the moderation will occur over timehow the school will document their moderation processes as part of their assessment procedure.To know More : http://assessment.tki.org.nz/Moderation/Moderation-processes",2021-03-06T14:57:00.713Z,"What are the emotional and psychological effects of content moderation?

Linkedin is one of the most helpful networks that can easily land you a job given that you do your part of the deal right. I got a job recently through Linkedin and it only took me a couple of weeks to search for the right job. So I have decided to share what I did that got me a perfect high paying job through Linkedin. 1. Your Profile is Your Weapon The first thing after you sign up on Linkedin is to set up your profile. Your profile is an equivalent to your resume and has much more value than a hard copy. Now I know filling up all the details for your profile is a tedious job but you got to invest time and do it right. Your profile must be rich with valuable information regarding your academics, extra-curricular and work experience. You must be thinking what could fields like academics and extra-curricular activities do to boost your chances of getting employed. Firstly, your academics is an important factor that you must mention. Secondly, extra-curricular activities bring out a huge amount of information about your personality. For the people without any work experience, this field is a gem so polish it well. 2. Add a Valuable Summary The Summary section of your profile is your first impression to anyone viewing your profile. The trick is to ""Keep it Short, Keep it Hot"". The content of this section adds at least 20% of your chances of getting selected for a job. DO NOT INTRODUCE YOURSELF!! Your name pretty much does that for you! You need to add a content that proves that you are dedicated towards your work and you have an ambitious personality to shed for your work. You can research and look at the content of other successful people on Linkedin to get an idea of what you need to add to your Summary. 3. Search For The Job You Want This is an important part and pay close attention. You definitely know how to search a job on Linkedin but there is a catch. When you search a company and apply to it, you must notice the number of applicants that have applied for the job before you. In my personal observation, when the number of applicants is above 100 then there is a high possibility that your resume might not be noticed at all. Nonetheless, you must apply for the job given that you have made your profile consider worthy. When you apply for a job that has less than 50 applicants then you have a high possibility of getting a call for an interview. You must also apply to companies on a daily basis or at least every alternate day. The more number of companies you apply to, the more chances of getting a job. This is an obvious fact but lets be truthful, not many people spend time applying for jobs. 4. Make Connections And Connect You need to follow/connect with people who are in the same post as you are looking for and also you need to connect with people who are in the recruiting department of companies. The more connection you have, the more profile views you will get and that will help you in getting a job. Making connections is just not enough! Few weeks back I connected with a Linkedin member in the same field of profession that I was in. She sent me a very humble message mentioning that she was on a lookout for a job and she would grateful if I could give her reference in the company I worked in. Unfortunately, I wasn't working in any company BUT I did refer her for a job interview which I couldn't join. Moral of the story, when you send a humble message to people asking for referrals then you might get some valuable ones. Here is a sample of the message that you can use: Hi Chandan, Hope all is well at your end. I am reaching out to you with regard to an opportunity that I am looking for in the Content writing space. I would like to explore any suitable openings in your current organization or your connections. Please let me know if you are aware of any relevant opportunities that I can explore. Even if you don't know any at the moment, its great to stay connected! Thanks **YOUR NAME This is a very valuable hack and do use it because it will surely generate positive results. 5. Get Endorsements And Recommendations Endorsements and recommendations add a great deal to your profile. You must ask your colleagues and friends to endorse you or write a recommendation. You must get endorsement for the RIGHT FIELDS! A harsh reality is that no one cares if you know Microsoft Word or any such equivalent skill that even a 10 year old has. When it comes to the skills section, add only and only skills that are relevant to your job and request for endorsements and recommendations for those. Don't be ashamed to ask for these things as its not a crime and at the end of the day, you are the one who is going to benefit from it. I hope these points help you to land a perfect job because they did land me my dream job as a Digital Content Manager. If this post was helpful to you then do connect with me and let me know what you think! Good Day! Everyone is biased and hence it is not possible to be unbiased. The question therefore is not how you can be unbiased but rather what biases you want in your moderation team. Generally speaking, most website owners want to have moderators whose values generally agree with their own, much like how most companies and government departments do things.

The question therefore is not how you can be unbiased but rather what biases you want in your moderation team. Generally speaking, most website owners want to have moderators whose values generally agree with their own, much like how most companies and government departments do things. They will tolerate views that differ a little bit but they need to adhere to their core values. In a company or government department you might see a code of conduct or vision statement but in social media they use such terms as community guidelines, which, in theory, can be modified by everyday users. Like codes of conduct and vision statements, community guidelines are not hard and fast rules but rather general ideas of what is and is not acceptable behaviour. They in no way replace applicable laws nor does every penalty have to be in line with them. Penalties are ultimately decided by the owner(s) and don’t need a reason. The key for a good moderator is being able to apply the wishes of the owner, not to be fair or unbiased. Some owners want biased moderators to reflect the owners wishes. Don’t assume that unbiased equals a bad moderator. Disloyal is bad. Biased, in the right direction, is good. It really depends on what kind of brand you’re monitoring. Whenever it’s a commercial brand, it can get pretty nasty if people are complaining. They want complaints to be super public because they think you’ll respond faster (they’re right).

They are generally tough to moderate because (for whatever reason) people think that the social media profile is the right place to ask about jobs, partnerships, and other c-suite level questions. I don’t think a lot of people stop and think whether or not a social media manager is the right person to ask. Then there are what I like to call drive by postings. This is where some kid, disgruntled customer, or random jerk decides that post something totally inappropriate or damaging. The social media networks are good about taking those down whenever other users flag it, but it’s still good to use social media moderation tools so you can control your brand image.

He never advocated for the killing of women, he never insulted them, he made a perhaps unfunny joke. And what was youtube’s response to this? Deleting his entire channel. Just in its entirety. Things like that, suppression of any content they don’t like is why a part of youtube’s community is so anti-SJW. In this game you kill literally HUNDREDS OF MEN, and no one complains.

 Not part of the question but youtube relates to it, there is a twitch streamer called Amouranth. For those that don’t know twitch is a website where people can broadcast themselves in real time doing various things. Most often times it’s used for video gaming. Amouranth is what we on the internet describe as a “thot”. The term typically stands for “That Hoe Over There”, which basically gives you all the context you need. Amouranth first off, started by pretending she was single for years with her following. It eventually came out that she was married which poses two questions. Why in god’s would you pretend to be single and lie to your, at that point thousands of followers?Why would anyone in their right mind stay with you if they became aware of what you were doing?Now I kind of led you on with both of those answers. Here’s why she did it: Because it convinces lonely losers online that if they just maybe give this girl some money, they’ll be able to get a girlfriend. Secondly her husband probably makes mad bank off letting his wife sell softcore porn. Also here’s a screenshot that you might find interesting:  Now this person was a little bit of a r/niceguy aka people that think if they give a person a lot of money they deserve some kind compensation. But I want you to remember that part she says that she’s taken because:  Wait wait wait, didn’t you say you had a husband though? Didn’t you say you’re taken? What’s this? It’s almost like… she knows there are lonely people out there who think they might have an opportunity to date her if they give her money. Also can we talk about the part in the screenshot posted before where she says “…people get turned off by that idea”? It’s almost like she’s entirely self-aware and understands acting like this can make her more money than some people make in a year. And this strategy worked because, well, as you can see:  The median wage for a US worker is 44,000 dollars. She made almost as much as that in one donation. What kind of world do we live in? She’s selling softcore porn at this point and acting like she’s not. She also became infamous when she recorded herself exercising in a gym… which would not inherently have been a problem if she had not recorded herself exercising in front of a giant mirror showing many of the fellow gym attendees faces. When she was asked to move she proceeded to say she was kicked out for being a woman.  She then acts extremely slow saying “I don’t understand, so if I’m in front of a wall…” like, IT’S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND IDIOT, YOU’RE SHOWING EVERYONE’S FACE IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, MOVE! Now thankfully Amouranth has been attacked quite a bit on youtube which somewhat caught me offguard. Youtube does have an anti-sjw section but usually criticism of people like Amouranth gets overlooked. Thankfully this time it didn’t and I hope eventually someone greedy like her will just get taken off the internet. The tribalist ideology.

But Facebook itself -- the framework that enables people to find and connect with their friends -- is actually its own content-rich interface. And every button you click, each new feature you experience, any setting you set...it all falls under the reign (and reins) of a dedicated team of content strategists.  Our mission? Make Facebook easy to use while at the same time helping the company meet key business goals, such as attracting new users, delighting existing users so they revisit the site more frequently, and building brand loyalty.Standardize the style and tone of all our content so you find the same familiar Facebook wherever you click, from the signup flow to offsite experiences like ""Like.""Identify problems that can't be fixed with words, then work with design, research, and engineering to create better solutions.Analyze feedback and traffic patterns, then circle back to make the content even more effective.Because Facebook is such a unique animal, the content strategy team also faces some unusual challenges, including: Unprecedented growth. Our approach needs to make sense to 500+ million incredibly different people, speaking 70+ different languages, accessing Facebook over all kinds of devices.Cheetah-fast development. At Facebook, projects can go from ""I have an idea"" to live on the site in a matter or days. And we need to formulate strategies and follow through with winning content just as quickly.A dizzying array of moving parts. News feed, profile, messages, groups, places...there are a lot of pieces to the Facebook experience. We bring the big-picture perspective that makes it all fit together.High-impact influence. One small shift in strategy can reshape the way millions and millions (and millions) of people feel about Facebook. With great power comes great responsibility.How do we do it all? To be a content strategist at Facebook, it takes a steady hand, a nimble mind, and fast reflexes. Also: an unbridled enthusiasm for the written word, the flexibility to think both globally and granularly, a whole lot of user empathy, and a deep reverence for a job done right. And coffee! So much coffee. Freedom of speech allows users to freely express their views on anything and everything. There is no fixed way to object to any content if it is bad or hurting the sentiments of individuals, religions, groups, etc. Besides, sometimes the content can be framed in a potentially objectionable way that can easily surpass the artificial screening systems. So, almost every company that wants to safeguard its brand’s values from foul content such as profanity, nudes, hate speech, violence, weapons, drugs, offensive gestures, blurriness, hidden faces, and many more requires content moderation services. The reasons to outsource content moderation services could be numerous and vary from business to business. Some of the probable reasons could be cost-optimization, operational excellence, assured accuracy, supreme-quality outcomes, faster turnaround time, world-class workflows, etc. If you are looking for a reliable partner to outsource content moderation services, Damco Solutions is your one-stop destination. After having spent a significant amount of time on research and going through client feedback, reviews and ratings, I found them as a trustworthy and client-friendly company. Having more than 2 decades of experience in providing IT services and solutions to a wide network of clients around the world, their forte lies in providing fail-proof content moderation services. Backed by a highly-competent pool of professionals and a time-tested blend of manual workflows, they assure excellence in every outcome. I suspect there will be some compromise. There’ll be a checkerboard of different world wide solutions to the over-reach of Google and Facebook. I expect the world wide web to partially disappear too, because of the malign digital forces that threaten governments, industries and utilities, among other entities, from outside the boundaries of individual countries. It doesn’t mean there’ll be no internet, it just means each country’s internet will be off limits or regulated seriously for outsiders. I should mention TOO that shutting down the gateways, won’t necessarily work that well, anyway. There are creeping new ‘institutions’ like Bitcoin, among other untraceable digital currencies, that are ‘prepared’ and already doing major damage across borders. The Federal Reserve and the US government are attempting to create limits to cryptocurrencies while planning, adapting them to regulation, and I suspect they will manage to do that on some level. Not sure perfection, however, is totally on the horizon! Remember this slogan: “One World, welcome to it!” Joseph Stiglitz published “Globalization and its Discontents” in 2002. He’s a philosopher, not an economist. His book was an enormous popular success and spread the ‘gospel’ in the US in the early aughts. The term globalization, however, was coined by an economist, Theodore Levitt, in 1983. “Levitt first used “globalization” in a 1983 Harvard Business Review article about the emergence of standardized, low-priced consumer products. He defined the term as the changes in social behaviors and technology that allowed companies to sell the same products around the world.” Levitt’s explanation expanded after the Stiglitz best seller, into ideas that evinced something that approached world wide government. In practice, Globalization began the outsourcing of production to other countries, whose employees, were paid far less that US workers made from the most expensive currency on earth, first the Gold Dollar, then the PetroDollar, the latter taking flight after an officer of a middle eastern country, possibly Saudi Arabia, left a briefcase behind with $1 million in cash inside, after a visit with Richard Nixon at the White House. Somewhat afterward, the petrodollar was invented when Oil Producers in the middle east and elsewhere, insisted on being paid in stable, expensive dollars, a form that easily took the place of the Gold Dollar in the US. There is no record of that briefcase and its contents being returned. John Maynard Keynes had written the economic playbook that made both England and the US the major manufacturing countries, both countries initially were. When Nixon opened diplomatic negotiations with Red China, the Chinese were game but their analysis of the American economy revealed that having the most expensive currency was not a good idea. The Chinese may have been manipulating their currency’s value, vis other currencies, even before the Nixon visit and afterwards. Not certain. But in the years since, China has made itself a world economic success to rival the US. Manipulating their currency to keep labor expenses to outside clients like Apple and other industries, low enough to become THE major manufacturing nation. Meanwhile, Republican politics in the US have been SUCCESSFUL. Wall Street, the Banks, major corporations, have profited from a political/economic system that finances Congressional and Presidential elections for both parties, since the Clintons dipped into the GOP election sources in 1996. That system has been financing both parties’ DC politicians since, select state political financing too. The US Economy and its politics, are mostly upside down now, compared to the US Manufacturing/Political behemoth we once were. GOP politicos tell former factory employees the ‘present system’ has resulted in US consumer goods, not including houses and cars, so cheap, one can throw away underwear and clothing, along with products that don’t work, without bothering to return them. But the working class has fallen far behind the Rich who are constantly celebrated in US Journalism and on television. The Chinese have been trying too, to pick up on American know how, a difficult quality to capture. They’ve sent agents and normal Chinese citizens to the US to find out. American know how and ingenuity, however, cannot not be engineered by mere copycatting of SOME facets of this economy. What the Chinese can’t and won’t allow at home, is the freedom of citizens to make most of their decisions, economic or otherwise, THEMSELVES.",2021-03-06T15:08:56.068Z,"Why do Facebook and Google outsource their content moderator roles to overseas agencies?

In contrast, a representative voted into office in a democracy has the responsibility to represent everyone in their district, including supporters, detractors, those who didn’t vote, and those prohibited from voting. Voters in the U.S. concerned about Facebook’s undue influence in elections should not be expecting Facebook to do anything about it. (Demanding? Yes. But expecting? No.) Instead, the civil recourse is to take action legislatively. Laws could be written to require businesses to act in a civically responsible manner, and sanction those who fail. Such legislation might be viewed by those on the Right as excessive legislation. Of course, this won’t happen under conditions of regulatory capture as the U. S. is currently experiencing. If, hypothetically, we presume a Facebook which cares about not alienating large swaths of their user base, we are discussing a hypothetical Facebook which no longer places profit ahead of civic duty. If this were to occur, many on the Right would see it as evidence that Facebook had been taken-over by the government. This is certain to alienate Facebook’s user base. This is apparently a Catch-22. Instead, I see this problem as stemming from the flawed concept that businesses can be expected to perform civic duties in an acceptable fashion. Expecting Facebook to be civically responsible is a mistake. Not a chance. I don’t have up to date figures, but the sheer volume of stuff being posted on Facebook every minute makes pro-active moderation near impossible. Facebook would need tens or hundreds of thousands of people, across multiple time zones and languages - not at all practical given that it’s free to the user. Marking fake news by user is near impossible too, as it is trivial to create multiple accounts, company pages and more.

I don’t have up to date figures, but the sheer volume of stuff being posted on Facebook every minute makes pro-active moderation near impossible. Facebook would need tens or hundreds of thousands of people, across multiple time zones and languages - not at all practical given that it’s free to the user. Marking fake news by user is near impossible too, as it is trivial to create multiple accounts, company pages and more. Some of hte fake news may be spread by real, genuine accounts taken in by stories posted off-site. It’s also hard to define ‘fake news’. Is it what President Trump says is fake? Not in a lot of instances. Is it what Putin says is fake? Probably not all the time. The most effective ‘fake news’ mixes a bit of real information with some fake stuff to create a blend that appears superficially accurate, but is based on deliberate misrepresentation of the facts. Have a look at the majority of popular press health and science reporting, or almost anything using statistics without clear sources for good examples. Combining the high volume and tricky identification creates a problem that is too expensive to police using humans and too complex to police using simple filters or even current AI. In practice this means that Facebook can probably only focus on the false stories or messages that are spreading the most, or that have come from a source known to have created false information in the past. They can probably slow it a bit, but not stop it… yet. If you suspect it is fake news story add a comment showing the true story, preferably with links to genuine, well-regarded sites, and use the ‘report’ option on the post.

Such videos can do far more damage when they wrongly purport to show famous/political people saying and doing things that are against what those people would normally do/say. It can cause riots, destroy elections, cause unnecessary wars and generally cause the deaths of millions of people, in the worst case scenario.

Linkedin is one of the most helpful networks that can easily land you a job given that you do your part of the deal right. I got a job recently through Linkedin and it only took me a couple of weeks to search for the right job. So I have decided to share what I did that got me a perfect high paying job through Linkedin. 1. Your Profile is Your Weapon The first thing after you sign up on Linkedin is to set up your profile. Your profile is an equivalent to your resume and has much more value than a hard copy. Now I know filling up all the details for your profile is a tedious job but you got to invest time and do it right. Your profile must be rich with valuable information regarding your academics, extra-curricular and work experience. You must be thinking what could fields like academics and extra-curricular activities do to boost your chances of getting employed. Firstly, your academics is an important factor that you must mention. Secondly, extra-curricular activities bring out a huge amount of information about your personality. For the people without any work experience, this field is a gem so polish it well. 2. Add a Valuable Summary The Summary section of your profile is your first impression to anyone viewing your profile. The trick is to ""Keep it Short, Keep it Hot"". The content of this section adds at least 20% of your chances of getting selected for a job. DO NOT INTRODUCE YOURSELF!! Your name pretty much does that for you! You need to add a content that proves that you are dedicated towards your work and you have an ambitious personality to shed for your work. You can research and look at the content of other successful people on Linkedin to get an idea of what you need to add to your Summary. 3. Search For The Job You Want This is an important part and pay close attention. You definitely know how to search a job on Linkedin but there is a catch. When you search a company and apply to it, you must notice the number of applicants that have applied for the job before you. In my personal observation, when the number of applicants is above 100 then there is a high possibility that your resume might not be noticed at all. Nonetheless, you must apply for the job given that you have made your profile consider worthy. When you apply for a job that has less than 50 applicants then you have a high possibility of getting a call for an interview. You must also apply to companies on a daily basis or at least every alternate day. The more number of companies you apply to, the more chances of getting a job. This is an obvious fact but lets be truthful, not many people spend time applying for jobs. 4. Make Connections And Connect You need to follow/connect with people who are in the same post as you are looking for and also you need to connect with people who are in the recruiting department of companies. The more connection you have, the more profile views you will get and that will help you in getting a job. Making connections is just not enough! Few weeks back I connected with a Linkedin member in the same field of profession that I was in. She sent me a very humble message mentioning that she was on a lookout for a job and she would grateful if I could give her reference in the company I worked in. Unfortunately, I wasn't working in any company BUT I did refer her for a job interview which I couldn't join. Moral of the story, when you send a humble message to people asking for referrals then you might get some valuable ones. Here is a sample of the message that you can use: Hi Chandan, Hope all is well at your end. I am reaching out to you with regard to an opportunity that I am looking for in the Content writing space. I would like to explore any suitable openings in your current organization or your connections. Please let me know if you are aware of any relevant opportunities that I can explore. Even if you don't know any at the moment, its great to stay connected! Thanks **YOUR NAME This is a very valuable hack and do use it because it will surely generate positive results. 5. Get Endorsements And Recommendations Endorsements and recommendations add a great deal to your profile. You must ask your colleagues and friends to endorse you or write a recommendation. You must get endorsement for the RIGHT FIELDS! A harsh reality is that no one cares if you know Microsoft Word or any such equivalent skill that even a 10 year old has. When it comes to the skills section, add only and only skills that are relevant to your job and request for endorsements and recommendations for those. Don't be ashamed to ask for these things as its not a crime and at the end of the day, you are the one who is going to benefit from it. I hope these points help you to land a perfect job because they did land me my dream job as a Digital Content Manager.

I worked across the street from the first of the twin towers to be hit on 9/11. I lived four blocks from the twin towers until just two weeks before the attack; this neighborhood was my home. The building in which I had lived was cordoned off by the army for weeks, the beautiful park and playgrounds just outside my old apartment and my place of work were covered in the dust of the towers and the ashes of their occupants. I was reminded every day for the next year of the incidents as my boss, myself and our employees all worked to recover and recreate the the computers and data of the business and to support 3,000 people who were spread out in many locations having lost their offices in our building (which was hit when the tower across the street went down).  After tens of thousands of us evacuated the skyscrapers, we milled around trying to find our friends and coworkers and trying to get a handle on the disaster. Once we realized we couldn't find or account for them, one of two things happened. The vast majority of us became transfixed, staring at the towers and at the people jumping -- not in a rubber-necking fashion, more like a trance. A very small minority of us were quickly able to react rationally and make a plan to get out of the area of the attack and out of the city (remember, no one knew whether there were more attacks coming that day). I was one of the ones to react rationally and formulate plans to minimize the chance that I would die. My boss, a highly intelligent, ex-military, steady fellow, was transfixed after a initial spurt of self preservation. I led him away from ground zero like a child, gently but firmly urging him on when he turned toward the towers and stopped. All the while my mind was processing survival thoughts: ""We've got to get out of here before these people realize they're in danger and stampede, especially if there's another plane, bomb, or chem/bio attack."" ""I don't want to go near any famous landmarks like Grand Central or into the NYC subway, they are exactly where I'd attack if I was a terrorist."" ""I remember a small Jersey Transit station in the Village; few other than locals know that one."" ""Jersey Transit means we're going to be in a tunnel under the Hudson, that would be a good target."" ""What can I do to make it more likely we'll survive in the even we're trapped under the Hudson? Water, I'll stop at a bodega and fill my messenger bag with bottled water.""  We made it to Jersey City on the second to last train out of the city before the Jersey City station was evacuated due to a bomb threat and the system was shut down.  In the following week, I was very upset about my reaction. I had previously used an executive coach who was a psychologist and I called her to talk about how to deal with my traumatized employees. When that discussion was over, I asked if there was something wrong with me that I wasn't so affected as to be paralyzed by the sight of the towers and the jumpers. Did I have less empathy, less humanity? She assured me those were not the reasons. The reason was that I had been traumatized when I was a child and developed PTSD. Hypervigilance is a helpful response in a disaster and unlike the average American, it was not the first time I'd faced the possibility that someone would kill me in a place I felt safe. She said that my boss, who had handled himself well in stressful military situations overseas, was more like a typical American. He could handle danger on a battleground, but his brain couldn't fathom an attack on his homeland. That's a lot of questions. Ok. On a normal day, I feel bored, happy, frustrated, amused, humored.

No, because of the biases of the AI based on the actions of the programmers and human methods already known to get around them. There is an AI being developed to moderate comments online.

There is an AI being developed to moderate comments online. What’s the problem? It is biased from the beginning based on the data set, the comments section of the New York Times and Huffington Post, very liberal papers. Anything moderate along with everything conservative is flagged as inappropriate, so the AI by the very selection of the initial data set is biased against anything but far left political opinions. You know that bias will be baked in by programmers who think those are neutral data sets and further manually train it through their testing and adjustment of the algorithms. Now for the human methods around it. Google per its biased definition of “do no evil” bans ads and discriminates against legal content it doesn’t like. Whether selling diet drugs, male sexual enhancement or payday loans, they don’t take your ads and push your content to the second page where it is almost invisible. The solution is a language game. Your diet drugs are “health supplements, healthy living programs”. Gun sellers now focus on self defense products, ads for paper spray and rape defense classes while still selling guns. Payday loans become financial solutions. And between the number of people playing these games and reason to do so, that will outwit an AI. Another issue is the problem with censoring people. Look at Twitter’s stalled user base and falling revenue after purging conservatives and libertarians, some of its most interesting people. Why follow Twitter if most of the content is a rehash of what you get elsewhere? Sites that rely on these liberally biased AI to moderate content and comments will see users go elsewhere. That’s why YouTube’s decision to censor content it doesn’t like to varying degrees (downranking in search results, turning off social media sharing or putting up warnings and threats to put up re-education videos before your video shows) is leading many to start moving to other platforms. When the biggest or most devotedly followed content creators move to Minds or Vimeo, you haven’t silenced them but led the loudest to fuel new channels. It is also silencing the moderates who aren’t liberal enough for the censors but cannot afford to move; they either go silent or sullenly go along with YouTube’s standards while complaining about the site’s hypocrisy about freedom of speech while putting up various levels of hurdles. And that grumbling spreads and undermines the Google’s reputation even more, hence the discussions about breaking them up under anti-trust rules or regulating them like a TV or radio station under FCC rules requiring relative neutrality. TLDR: Just because they use an AI to “moderate” or censor doesn’t mean it is neutral, and it can readily and deliberately altered to censor things as Facebook trending news already did. Implementing this automated “moderation” on a wide scale will drive traffic to other platforms while fueling the calls to break up Big Tech businesses who are so big their censorship rules impact our ability to speak freely.

There are a lot of comments here telling you that English will get you a bigger audience. However, you should take note that while there is a bigger English speaking audience, there are also more Youtubers already servicing this audience. Often, especially with less common languages, there is a real shortage of content. While speaking English would theoretically give you access to more viewers, if those viewers are already distracted from your content by having so many other choices, you would be better choosing a language which has less viewers, because the viewers that there are will be more Continue ReadingThere are a lot of comments here telling you that English will get you a bigger audience. However, you should take note that while there is a bigger English speaking audience, there are also more Youtubers already servicing this audience. Often, especially with less common languages, there is a real shortage of content. While speaking English would theoretically give you access to more viewers, if those viewers are already distracted from your content by having so many other choices, you would be better choosing a language which has less viewers, because the viewers that there are will be more likely to watch your content. Put simply, per capita there is less content in languages other than English, so the content that is there is viewed on average more. Its simple supply and demand. There is a surplus of English language content, a lack of supply of non-English content, and a massive demand for non-English content, as most of the world’s population does not speak English, at least not as their best language. In short, yes! It is always a good idea to have your work edited, regardless of your status as a native or non-native English speaker/writer, by someone who is proficient in this area. The term ""proficient"" here should be noted, as not all native English speakers are knowledgeable on how to edit a document effectively. If there are no staff members within the content marketer's internal team that holds a high level of editing proficiency, then a professional editing company, such as Scribendi, could be used.

The CDA was Congress’s first big attempt at trying to modernize law for the new age of the internet. The CDA, as the name indicates, is focused on concerns about indecent material on the internet - in other words, pornography. In the pre-internet age, US law tended to divide bodies into publisher or distributers. What this means was that a publisher was responsible for the content they produce and therefore can be liable for that content (they can be sued), but a distributor can’t reasonably be expected to be aware of all of the content that they help distribute. In simpler terms, in 1959, in Smith v. California, the Supreme Court overturned a California law that was used to prosecute the owner of a book store in which “obscene” content was found. The Court said that it wasn’t reasonable to assume that the owner of a book store knew what was in every book that passed through their store. Unless the state could prove the store owner was knowingly selling obscene material, they couldn’t punish said owner. That’s a strong disincentive for internet service providers to keep track of the content they house. If they pretend to be just like the phone company or a book store - a simple distributor of other people’s content, then they protect their liability. Congress wanted the internet service providers and platform owners to help them filter out indecent material. So, a separate piece of legislation called the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act got sucked into the CDA and provides what we now call Section 230. Now here is the part where there is a lot of misinformation. There are people going around, today, proclaiming that Section 230 requires platform owners to be politically neutral. IT DOES NOT. The authors of the law are on the record saying that that was never a consideration. Section 230 exists for one simple reason - to provide some level of immunity to platform owners if they choose to take on the responsibility of content monitoring and filtering. Section 230 paragraph C is the key part of the text. It reads: “(c) Protection for “Good Samaritan” blocking and screening of offensive material (1)Treatment of publisher or speaker No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. (2)Civil liability No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of— (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or (B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).” In essence, Section 230 C says that this law will protect internet computer services against liability for the content on their service if they choose to pay attention to that content and take actions to remove content that is objectionable. It’s a small piece of text, but is absolutely essential for the internet to exist. Quora could not exist in the form it does if Section 230 C disappeared. Imagine if that legal protection disappeared. Quora would then have to make a choice - do they turn away and not look at the content on their own site to maintain the defense of ignorance should illegal content appear? or do they invest heavily into monitoring every single piece of content to filter out anything that could get them sued? Section 230 does not declare that a platform owner is either a publisher or distributor. It does not restrict the behavior of internet platform owners. It does not prohibit a platform owner from editing, composing, deleting, or moderating content. That nonsense is being spread by political entities upset that platforms are using their right to remove content that they “consider to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable” to remove or somehow flag content that those political entities find beneficial. Internet platform owners have the First Amendment right to post or remove any content they please, as long as they don’t discriminate against a protected class. I not only think they will lose it, I think they already have. (Exception: I don’t think they will lose section 230 protection for those actions the law was originally intended to protect: Good Samaritan moderating of illegal and harmful content such as child porn and calls for violence.) But they’ve lost the part that counts - the ability to censor users based on their political viewpoint and still enjoy immunity. (For the text of the act itself see 47 U.S. Code § 230 - Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material) For this we can thank President Trump. In what (in my opinion) will turn out to be one of the most significant acts of his presidency, on May 28, 2020 President Trump issued the following Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship (emphasis mine.) By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. Free speech is the bedrock of American democracy. Our Founding Fathers protected this sacred right with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The freedom to express and debate ideas is the foundation for all of our rights as a free people. In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators. The growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms. As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see. As President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. It is essential to sustaining our democracy. Online platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms “flagging” content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse. Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician’s tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called ‘Site Integrity’ has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets. At the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans’ speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China. One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for “human rights,” hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance. It also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military. Other companies have accepted advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about China’s mass imprisonment of religious minorities, thereby enabling these abuses of human rights. They have also amplified China’s propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. As a Nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in today’s digital communications environment where all Americans can and should have a voice. We must seek transparency and accountability from online platforms, and encourage standards and tools to protect and preserve the integrity and openness of American discourse and freedom of expression. Sec. 2. Protections Against Online Censorship. (a) It is the policy of the United States to foster clear ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet. Prominent among the ground rules governing that debate is the immunity from liability created by section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act (section 230(c)). 47 U.S.C. 230(c). It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified: the immunity should not extend beyond its text and purpose to provide protection for those who purport to provide users a forum for free and open speech, but in reality use their power over a vital means of communication to engage in deceptive or pretextual actions stifling free and open debate by censoring certain viewpoints. Section 230(c) was designed to address early court decisions holding that, if an online platform restricted access to some content posted by others, it would thereby become a “publisher” of all the content posted on its site for purposes of torts such as defamation. As the title of section 230(c) makes clear, the provision provides limited liability “protection” to a provider of an interactive computer service (such as an online platform) that engages in “‘Good Samaritan’ blocking” of harmful content. In particular, the Congress sought to provide protections for online platforms that attempted to protect minors from harmful content and intended to ensure that such providers would not be discouraged from taking down harmful material. The provision was also intended to further the express vision of the Congress that the internet is a “forum for a true diversity of political discourse.” 47 U.S.C. 230(a)(3). The limited protections provided by the statute should be construed with these purposes in mind. In particular, subparagraph (c)(2) expressly addresses protections from “civil liability” and specifies that an interactive computer service provider may not be made liable “on account of” its decision in “good faith” to restrict access to content that it considers to be “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.” It is the policy of the United States to ensure that, to the maximum extent permissible under the law, this provision is not distorted to provide liability protection for online platforms that — far from acting in “good faith” to remove objectionable content — instead engage in deceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service) to stifle viewpoints with which they disagree. Section 230 was not intended to allow a handful of companies to grow into titans controlling vital avenues for our national discourse under the guise of promoting open forums for debate, and then to provide those behemoths blanket immunity when they use their power to censor content and silence viewpoints that they dislike. When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and its actions do not meet the criteria of subparagraph (c)(2)(A), it is engaged in editorial conduct. It is the policy of the United States that such a provider should properly lose the limited liability shield of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) and be exposed to liability like any traditional editor and publisher that is not an online provider. (b) To advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section, all executive departments and agencies should ensure that their application of section 230(c) properly reflects the narrow purpose of the section and take all appropriate actions in this regard. In addition, within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the Attorney General, and acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), shall file a petition for rulemaking with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting that the FCC expeditiously propose regulations to clarify: (i) the interaction between subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of section 230, in particular to clarify and determine the circumstances under which a provider of an interactive computer service that restricts access to content in a manner not specifically protected by subparagraph (c)(2)(A) may also not be able to claim protection under subparagraph (c)(1), which merely states that a provider shall not be treated as a publisher or speaker for making third-party content available and does not address the provider’s responsibility for its own editorial decisions; (ii) the conditions under which an action restricting access to or availability of material is not “taken in good faith” within the meaning of subparagraph (c)(2)(A) of section 230, particularly whether actions can be “taken in good faith” if they are: (A) deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with a provider’s terms of service; or (B) taken after failing to provide adequate notice, reasoned explanation, or a meaningful opportunity to be heard; and (iii) any other proposed regulations that the NTIA concludes may be appropriate to advance the policy described in subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 3. Protecting Federal Taxpayer Dollars from Financing Online Platforms That Restrict Free Speech. (a) The head of each executive department and agency (agency) shall review its agency’s Federal spending on advertising and marketing paid to online platforms. Such review shall include the amount of money spent, the online platforms that receive Federal dollars, and the statutory authorities available to restrict their receipt of advertising dollars. (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall report its findings to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. (c) The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices. Sec. 4. Federal Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices. (a) It is the policy of the United States that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech. The Supreme Court has noted that social media sites, as the modern public square, “can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.” Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017). Communication through these channels has become important for meaningful participation in American democracy, including to petition elected leaders. These sites are providing an important forum to the public for others to engage in free expression and debate. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 85-89 (1980). (b) In May of 2019, the White House launched a Tech Bias Reporting tool to allow Americans to report incidents of online censorship. In just weeks, the White House received over 16,000 complaints of online platforms censoring or otherwise taking action against users based on their political viewpoints. The White House will submit such complaints received to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). (c) The FTC shall consider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, pursuant to section 45 of title 15, United States Code. Such unfair or deceptive acts or practice may include practices by entities covered by section 230 that restrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities’ public representations about those practices. (d) For large online platforms that are vast arenas for public debate, including the social media platform Twitter, the FTC shall also, consistent with its legal authority, consider whether complaints allege violations of law that implicate the policies set forth in section 4(a) of this order. The FTC shall consider developing a report describing such complaints and making the report publicly available, consistent with applicable law. Sec. 5. State Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Anti-Discrimination Laws. (a) The Attorney General shall establish a working group regarding the potential enforcement of State statutes that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The working group shall also develop model legislation for consideration by legislatures in States where existing statutes do not protect Americans from such unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The working group shall invite State Attorneys General for discussion and consultation, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law. (b) Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following: (i) increased scrutiny of users based on the other users they choose to follow, or their interactions with other users; (ii) algorithms to suppress content or users based on indications of political alignment or viewpoint; (iii) differential policies allowing for otherwise impermissible behavior, when committed by accounts associated with the Chinese Communist Party or other anti-democratic associations or governments; (iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, media organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content; and (v) acts that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated. Sec. 6. Legislation. The Attorney General shall develop a proposal for Federal legislation that would be useful to promote the policy objectives of this order. Sec. 7. Definition. For purposes of this order, the term “online platform” means any website or application that allows users to create and share content or engage in social networking, or any general search engine. Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship | The White House To be clear: This Executive Order doesn’t prevent companies from moderating users or from holding and exercising a political viewpoint via moderation. Users sign terms of service agreeing their content can be moderated. And the social media companies are private enterprises which can do as they please. But, from now on, if social media platforms represent themselves as content neutral and then proceed to moderate content in a biased manner, they will no longer be immune from lawsuits and other sanctions (as they previously were.) For example, previously a social media platform could allow ‘Bob’ (whose politics it approved of) to call ‘Alice’ (whose views it didn’t care for) various and sundry insults and names, while removing any responses by ‘Alice’ (whether she called Bob names or demonstrated that Bob is wrong by presenting sources that contradicted his claims) with impunity. Previously, while ‘Alice’ could sue ‘Bob’ for libel for falsely calling her names which damaged her reputation, the social media platform was exempt from being sued by ‘Alice’ under section 230 even though it had actively favored ‘Bob’ over ‘Alice’ (by allowing ‘Bob’ to call ‘Alice’ names while deleting ‘Alice’s replies) because it would claim that it was merely a platform with no responsibility for what ‘Bob’ had posted. This executive order removes that immunity. And rightly so, because when the company moderated ‘Alice’s’ content but not ‘Bob’s’ as described it was exercising an editorial function rather than serving as a content neutral platform. Likewise, previously a social media platform could present itself as content neutral while surreptitiously (or not so surreptitiously in some cases) censoring viewpoints on one side of the political spectrum and still be immune from lawsuits because it was protected from them by Section 230. However, because this conduct (if proven) would constitute engaging in deceptive practices and suppression of content based on a political viewpoint, a company which does this after the FCC implements new regulations as prescribed in the order would lose its immunity under Section 230. The easiest tool by far is Hootsuit. People might differ. But I feel for a single brand, Hootsuite is amazing as it also has 3 free profiles management. Following are the few reasons I like Hootsuite for social media posting and moderation: All in one social media scheduling and moderation.You can even manage Youtube profiles and WordPress.com: Create a Free Website or Blog blogs too.Has a great User interface which is quite easy to understand and get friendly with once you start using it.The ads integration as well is cool.I don’t like the analytics or reporting features of Hootsuite. I use social bakers for that reason. I feel there is no comparison for Social Bakers in reporting. However, I am yet to try the builder for Social Bakers. If that goes well i will use Social bakers for everything. Not to make you confuse, there is no best, or one tool can’t beat all. Not at all. You need to choose platforms depending on your requirements. I used Sysmos for listneing purpose which is not available in Social Bakers or Hoot suite. But sysmos does not suit my or my clients pocket, can’t have it for everything. So, look at what is your budget. If you want a free solution for your personal profile, start with Hoot Suite. If my answer makes any sense, upvote please.

As per my opinion there must be a censorship on OTT content as well in India but different from regular movie censorship as in OTT scenario is very much different from regular Cinema. Here we can have requirement of censorship on some parameters such as nudity, violence, anti-religious and anti-national content. Below are those points: Nudity on OTT platforms : If you are aware about current OTT platform which are doing business in India then there are few platforms which are producing semi-porn in the name of entertainment and it is accessible to people of all age groups which should not be permitted.  if we notice then there is a OTT platform named as ULLU which is producing only adult content and if you will check that then there wont be any sensible story lineup even in their webseries. unfortunate part is that we can see many popular faces from TV and web can be seen in their content. It is their bad choices or lust for money, only they knows it.  but it feels very bad when popular OTT platforms like AltBalaji produces web series like XXX, Bekaboo and Gandi Baat and what the worst part is ? These are the most popular web series on AltBalaji even Gandi Baat have 3 seasons on its name.  On other hand although Netflix and Amazon kind of not producing such content directly but nudity is also visible in their series such as Four more shots please, Made in Heaven etc. So overall as there is no censorship on OTT that's why OTT owners just put a tag of 18+ in description and through their garbage to entire India.  Anti-religious Content : We have noticed many web series on Netflix specially such as Ghoul, Leila and Sacred Games which mock Hindu religion in such a bad way. They have crossed their limits in Ghoul and Leila where they have shown that in future Upper cast Hindus will rule in India and they will destroy the legacy of our father of nation Mahatma Gandhi and there are several many thing which have been shown in these two web series I am not gonna discuss those but overall these thing will widen the differences between people on the basis of religion.  Anti-National Content: Here we can take example of latest release The Family Man starring Manoj Bajpai and Nayantara. here it is shown that Army is destroying Kashmir and people from Kashmir are living in fear. If you will show such content in current situation when article 370 has been removed from J&K then what will be the massage to the world ? So here guidelines for social responsibility must be in place for OTT platforms.  So that's it Guys It was my own opinion, there could be differences in your opinion and mine but one some points you must agree with me. if yes then hit UpVote and share it.

Moderation edits out noise: emotional statements, personal attacks, random nonsense, and other commentary that is unnecessary, irrelevant, distracting, and otherwise destructive to the conversationCensorship edits out content: statements that are intended to make a point or advance the intellectual aspects of the conversationA conversation is a lot like a collective garden: there may be competition between tomatoes and cucumbers over which is the more fruitful crop, but everybody has to pull the weeds or there won’t be any crops at all. Unfortunately, we have fallen into the bad habit of allowing people to treat every random thought they have as though it were a fruitful crop in its own right, without recognizing that emotional language is a virulent weed that will take over and drive out everything else. And of course, it is the people most prone to emotional language who refuse to make the distinction between moderation and censorship. If we weeded out their screams and cries and insults, they wouldn’t have anything left to contribute, and they would be unable to drown out reasoned arguments they disagree with; they find that very frustrating, because it requires them to learn an entirely new set of reasoning skills in order to participate.

But for the sites with large visitors generally IP addresses are also blocked, and then VPN is needed. Still I don't know any VPN site or service ever banned. So if you have VPN, you would not have any problems. Steam can be an issue, itself. Games are cheaper in Turkey, and some games have regional restrictions because of that.  So if you buy a game in Turkey in Turkish Liras, later you may face problems in playing the game outside of Turkey. You may need to explain your situation then to Steam.

If you are a Quoran, it's expected that you take some ownership of the quality of the community here, the content, and lead by example so that others may pick up on all of that and have great experiences. We are all given basic moderation tools. Some of those tools are for us to manage our own experience. Blocking and muting are examples of these tools. Some tools are intended for use when we need to escalate something, and that could be reporting a user, or some content. Non compliance with the Be Nice, Be Respectful policy, spamming and trolling are all valid reasons to submit a report. You act as a first level moderator by submitting the report, and Quora handles the disposition of the report to complete the moderation activity. Within answers we author, we can remove comments. This is a direct moderation tool, distributed among the Quora content contributors. In my view, this option removes much of the incentive to contribute toxic comments as the author can simply remove them. Finally, we can gently moderate. Say you are in an exchange with someone and it gets heated! If it goes out of bounds, it's not a bad idea to put it out there. ""Hey, let's take a breather while you edit that away..."" Think of it like that gentle hand on your shoulder, there to gently walk you back from some trouble or other. It's a nice thing to do, particularly when you see it really did just get heated and isn't nefarious. The other gentle moderation is to model the best experiences. Treat others right. This kind of thing is catchy and it rubs off and it often makes you feel good. All of this combined makes Quora the high value, safe, fun, enlightening place it is. Yes I have the same question.

I mean if I do post a link to my content I let it be know and it is always relevant. But still my posts one with over 4k and up votes are still being deleted. Something doesn’t seem right but I am getting a little sick of what seems to be a swing towards letting brands have more of a say than the average joe. This in my opinion is just like any other site, YouTube for example. Only brands get the best treatment because that’s where the money is and Quora are no different. There new policy favours the brands who seem to be able to blatantly break the policies and yet still their content is left for all to see. Quora is literally filled with thousands of links in posts linking back to their own content. I could copy and paste a hundred here now easy. So why are my posts being deleted? Just saying. Because I don’t know if anyone else has had this but they do not answer your questions neither much like the big boss Google never answer your questions if you have grievances. Just to add, I don’t understand the moderation at all. I mean bots explain a lot. But for example, there was a list of e-book download sites I liked and up voted. So I added as a comment another really good site to download free ebooks. Then it was deleted as spam and I was warned of being banned. I mean that is NOT spam. This site is covered with spam, self promotion and affiliate links that never get taken down. Then they delete perfectly good posts. Since they let the advertisers in this site is getting worse and worse.

Quora Moderation will never change, we think to ourselves. Do they even care? For the longest time, that answer had been a hard, definitive no. With all the unpopular things they have done, from removing question details to unfairly banning lots of people to throwing out BNBRs willy-nilly, it seemed like a wild fantasy to think that Quora Moderation would ever be anything else. All that changed a few days ago… If you didn’t hear, one of Quora’s most prominent users, Ethan James, recently got banned. He had just been edit-blocked, but he really wanted to write, so his friend offered to let him write answers on his account. Quora found out about this, and because account sharing is sockpuppeting and in violation of the Quora TOS, Ethan was banned for what he did. When I first heard about this, I was thinking “that’s the end. Unfortunate, but there’s no coming back.” When you break Quora TOS and there is proof, there will be no return for you. I thought it quite a shame that a very prominent representative of the teen community would go out like this, but alas, Quora is quite unyielding. Teens make mistakes, but on Quora, it’s one strike and you’re out. I talked to Ethan. Clearly, there was no intent to break the rules, it was just an honest mistake. There were a lot of people gearing up for petitions and protests and boycotts and what have you, but I wasn’t buying any of it. If you were around on Quora in 2017, you might know that Quora’s teenagers tried this in response to some unfair bans back in the day, but it didn’t work. From my recollections, we only managed to get one user unbanned. Even in that case, it was an unfair, bot-executed ban without evidence. Even in those days, we never dreamed that we could appeal any legitimate bans where people actually violated the TOS. Ethan sent an appeal letter to Quora. It said things like this: Nowhere in this appeal will I be attempting to justify my actions. The truth is, I messed up, and I messed up hard. No, this appeal is an appeal to humanity. Hopefully it can do something to help one understand the reasons I've done the things I've done, why I'm regretful for them and why I am begging (in a literal sense) for another chance. I was pessimistic about the chances. Frankly, I didn’t expect anything to be done. Imagine my shock when Ethan was unbanned the next day.  Quora celebrated, Ethan celebrated more, and I was forced to reconsider my perspective on Quora Moderation. Moderation has certainly changed something if they want to read someone’s heartfelt appeal letter and give them a chance, even after a legitimate transgression. Allow me to stress the significance of the precedent set here: this is the first time that anyone has ever been unbanned after a severe and verified TOS violation. Ever. It got me thinking. Maybe we don’t have to accept the status quo. We come to expect that one strike gets you out, but maybe if you just made an honest mistake and have no intentions of going around flaunting the rules, you should get another chance. Maybe, just maybe, Quora is starting to see its users as human beings, rather than expendable attractions for advertisers. You could say that Ethan got off because he’s popular. That might be true, but Quora hasn’t made exceptions for popularity either; users with tens of thousands of followers and millions of views get banned all the time. Ethan’s incident is certainly a small outlier in a sea of unfair decisions, but I am optimistic that this event will mark a shift in how Quora Moderation enforces its Terms of Service. What’s the lesson here? Don’t listen to people like me, who will tell you to lose your hope because it’s not worth having. Perhaps it is. Never appeal.

I used no offensive language, I did not insult the other commenter -- I asked my question and said no more. She reported my comment, and Quora deleted it. When I attempted to appeal the decision, it went nowhere: I filled out all the forms as instructed, including a ridiculous, but thoroughly and respectfully written, explanation of all the ways in which my simple question was neither un-nice nor disrespectful. I received an email from Quora days later, requesting that I provide further explanation. I had to type out my entire defense of my comment, again. I received an email from Quora days later, requesting that I provide further explanation. I was exhausted with it all. I wrote only a few sentences in response. I received an email from Quora days later, requesting that I provide further explanation. My comment remains deleted, and I have been warned that further violations of Quora’s policies may lead to my being banned from the site. I have been actively engaged in the Quora community for years, but apparently my fate here depends entirely on whether I ever have another false complaint weaponized against me. I didn't write all this up just because I felt like venting. I'm hoping against hope that someone at Quora will actually read this. I have to be blunt here. Automatic deletion of any comment that receives a complaint is not an acceptable moderation policy. It's purely a mechanism by which users’ legitimate contributions to a conversation can be easily disposed of by users aware of Quora’s delete-first, ask-the-same-question-over-and-over-later approach to knee-jerk censorship. Your automated system for filing appeals is just plain broken. I very much do not want to be banned from Quora, and I think I have been a significant asset here. But I am now at risk of being banned as a repeat offender of the rules because I had no choice but to give up on the appeal that I spent so much time preparing. If an actual person at Quora had read my allegedly offensive comment at any point during this process, it would have been obvious that there was nothing to justify taking action against me. I know you don't want to have to hire anyone to read contested material -- but I had to thoroughly explain, in writing, four times, why “Do you consider it abusive to take away a child's Xbox as punishment for his use of racial hate speech” was a legitimate question and not in violation of any rules, and I still ended up with nothing but a black mark on my record. If you can't get your appeals system to work properly, then you need to have humans making the determinations from the moment a complaint is made. Making the accused person explain, over and over, the ways in which nothing that they did was wrong, until they ultimately give up, is not acceptable, and I can't believe that I even just had to write that sentence. Apologies for the lengthy post. Not for the frustrated tone, however. I've earned it. (If you would like me to explain why expressing frustration about past unjust treatment is not in violation of any of your stated rules, well, you have my email address. Tell you what, I'll write a full half-dozen essays for you this time, just to show there are no hard feelings.) Edit, February 6th 2009: Here we go again. But this time, I don't even get to know what policy I'm alleged to have violated!  Edit, a few hours later: My answer was deleted despite my appeal, and there's no way to challenge the decision.

Or because you typed a certain word… allegedly we’re all adults here, and yes, using “bad words” as adjectives is a bad habit… but allegedly, we’re all adults here. It’s just abused. I think the automation part is why almost always, anyone who has gotten a BNBR is given no notice as to what the violation actually was. This is because somebody reported it, and automatically you get one. Nobody reviews it unless you appeal, and sometimes, well, you said the word didn’t you? This might be akin to the cops arresting everybody that anybody doesn’t like, and the judge MIGHT reverse it. Not a good system. Quora moderation is almost always a computer! It is practically impossible for humans to do most of the moderating! There is simply way too much content here on Quora. They would have to hire like 50k+ people for something like this. Impossible! So, it’s clearly computer algorithms that do by far most of the moderating. And moderation is triggered most often by someone “reporting” something. This is where often the bad guy wins, unfortunately. Good question. I've had a few posts that might be considered politically or socially incorrect disappear I to thin air. They were actually based in scientific debate but the same subject disappeared like 3 times in a span of 48 hours. Hard to believe a moderator bot could have done it.

The market is heavily dependent on it's producers, while the producers on consumers. Left to itself producers succumb to the demands of consumers & we see populist stuff everywhere. A good moderation can stop that, and that's what Quora did with it's policy on 'joke answers' and opposing trolls. The key for sustenance of Quora's mission of being thoughtful place for knowledge is to keep providing writers sufficient incentives to produce such stuff and not forcing them to think ""Is	it	worth	investing	so	much time	and	thought	for writing?	Or	should I	also	succumb	to writing	populist	stuff,	painting	memes	and	walking	away	with	upvotes?"" Memes (a product in the competitive market) demand much shorter attention spans and it's easy for well-worded answers to lose out in competition.

Currently I'm largely demotivated as a writer when my answers don't reach 10% of my followers- let alone get upvoted. The 5x inflation in promotion prices made things worse. So it's the nadir of incentives for a writer.

It’s kind of like if you called up Spectrum (or Charter, or whoever your ISP is in the US) and said, “Hey, starting next month I’m only going to pay you $5/month for service.” They’re going to say, “I don’t think so” and continue billing you at the rate you agreed to when you signed up because those were the terms of the deal. Your option is taking the deal they offer or finding another way to connect. Apple and Google set up the app stores. They made the investment. They own them. They operate them as a business to make money, and they set terms that they think will make the most money for them. That’s their prerogative. Parler can abide by the terms of service or find another way to do business. So no, they can’t force Parler to do anything. They can say “these are the rules you agreed to, and if you don’t follow them we’re not going to do business any longer.” Legal right? Absolutely. They have the right to control their property.

I heavily disgree with what the “conservatives” (it's in quote Mark's because the people going there describe themselves as conservatives, but they are often a far cry from real conservatives who are far more rational and based on, well, conservatism) are likely to be saying there, particularly the parts that are divorced from reality. Still, I don't think Google and Apple should be policing it. On the other hand, I've warned time and again about the dangers of entrusting all this power to companies and corporations, and the right has sneered at me and told me that I was stupid because you can always just go to a different company or set up your own rival one. Well, it's the bed that they made, so I'm very tempted to say that they should lie in it and find out first hand why they should have listened.

Unfortunately last Wednesday, a bunch of said people went and did something that was very clearly a federal crime (18 USC 2384, Seditious Conspiracy) and at that point, their planning on Parler and elsewhere became part of that crime. So… Parler could be in big trouble for its role in facilitating the planning of that federal crime - unless it can show that it had in place terms and conditions prohibiting it, and mechanisms for reporting it and moderating it. Trouble way bigger than being kicked off app stores. Apple does not want to be in trouble for distributing apps that are being used for illegal purposes, which is why the terms and conditions for submitting apps would almost certainly mention that.

The last seen in truecaller indicates the time at which the true caller app was last activated. It could be when the user last picked up any incoming call or made a call. Of course it is to say that Truecaller can be activated only when the users have an internet connection. So whenever there is an incoming call and internet is on, the app gets activated and thus last seen gets updated. It does not give any indication whether the call was picked up or not. The last seen is also activated when the user opens the app without any purpose of calling. At such time the last seen is updated as 'available' just as 'online' on whatsapp. And as soon as the app is closed the last seen gets updated to the time when it was closed. Hope it is helpful and hope this is right. The answer is only based on what I have observed while doing some hit and trials. The Green Dot depicts Availability ! Truecaller's Availability feature makes it possible for you to know if the person you're about to call is busy or not. For example, if you see a red dot next to that number it means that the person is busy, either on a call, in a meeting or has the phone on silent mode. A green dot indicates that the person is free to talk. You can also see the last time a user was active in the app through the Last seen status. You can always turn the feature off or on in the settings section in Truecaller. To be able to see someones availability they must have the app installed and have the feature on. Availability is activated by default and can be disabled. To know more - http://agileurbia.com/D8k9 Hope this helps! I guess we can’t see the ‘last seen’ in true caller, logically the purpose of blocking the number is to hide all details, then how can we able to see their last seen if in blocked list ? I’m not using ‘True caller’ and still I don’t know for what purpose it is used, i always hear the name but not used even single time. I guess it’s used for (find the details of a number like country, to block a number, caller info etc ) avoid unwanted calls before attending.

Usually, however, there’s never one person who is in charge of “content moderation” and “content quality”, but this becomes the joint effort of several people from writers to editors, up to the chief content officer for example.

Write or rewrite the Title, description and meta description of the content that is to be marketed in order to increase the traffic. The code optimization is also listed as one of the tasks of the SEO executive. The salary for an SEO executive starts from around Rs. 1,20,000. A 4 years experience a person gets an average salary of 4,50,000 to Rs. 6,00,000. 8 years+ experience a person gets on an average 9,50,000 to Rs. 15,00,000.SEO AnalystSEO StrategistSEO SpecialistSEO ConsultantSEO TechnicianSEO Account ManagerSEO ManagerSEO TrainerSEO DirectorNow moving on to Digital Marketing, let us first understand what is digital marketing - With online media skyrocketing, digital marketing has almost become mandatory for every company in any industry. Digital marketing has become quite vital to the global economy and has been the fastest growing industry till date. It is one of the most lucrative industries in the modern world. To gain hands with Digital Marketing, one should start SEO career with an entry-level job as an SEO executive. With experience, one either move on to higher job profiles or study further in relevant subjects. This segment will emerge as a search engine optimizer could graduate to head of digital marketing as, during his journey, he acquires basic knowledge of other areas in Digital marketing. Notably, the Digital Marketing Career proved to generate the highest marketing salaries followed by content marketing and SEO and are up a whopping 40 per cent salary of the marketers surveyed. Finally the content reviewer in regional language - Translating and developing contents in multiple languages. Therefore language proficiency is an important prerequisite for the job. You don't need to be an internet expert as full training will be provided, but you must enjoy working with online content and its available tools. Anyhow, their salary is not reasoning but depends on which country you’re working for. Take way notes: - For an ‘n’ years of experience in a company, your salary will vary in the next company you join as per the company profile. If you go to a startup (let’s assume n to be 3 here) your salary will be 20- 25k, if you go to a company which is some 10 years old you will be offered 30-35k, whereas if you make your way an MNC you can mark a salary of 45-50k for yourself. But, if you are more experienced candidate, it may go up to 30 Lakh p.a. Hey there, There are three ways that you could practice moderation on a social media platform.

I’ll go through all three quickly so you can get the gist of it. If you need more details, I can add more :) Group moderation There are so many groups on Facebook that are run by regular people. With that being said, regular people can sometimes say unproductive, offensive things. That isn’t really what you’re looking for when you want to keep discussions going/keep up a lively atmosphere. From what I could tell, group moderators were usually people who were very active in the group, contributed, and were able to recognize inappropriate behavior. They were also very helpful, reviewed your membership application, and they could give you a response to your issue pretty quickly. If you want to become a moderator for a FB group, you need to be able to reinforce the rules of the group, respond to others and their complaints. Employment as a moderator This one is more difficult. From what I’ve gathered, you don’t always directly work with social media platforms. Instead, you work for a company that Facebook might have a contract with to manage all their content. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are particularly susceptible to malicious content being uploaded. From what I’ve read, you need to be trained to do this right and can’t really have a weak stomach. They have to be trained to recognize when content is breaching community guidelines. The thing is, the guidelines are really specific, and things you personally might think are offensive might not be taken down (people with mental disabilities are not protected by certain guidelines, for example). If you’re pretty resilient, you could try to find a job in the field through Glassdoor or similar sites. Business/Brand moderation Finally, this is something that can be quite positive! Many brands have social media pages, and they can connect with their customers/fans/followers/subscribers through the platform. Instagram and Facebook are particularly great for this. If you’re working for a brand, you can respond to customer comments, complaints, and questions. Customers will generally appreciate it when you directly answer them. Lost shipment? Tell them how you’ll resolve it.Questions about the product? Answer with details and precision.Thanking you for the good customer service? Thank them for sharing their experience and for choosing your brand. However, it isn’t so easy to do. This is more of a technical issue than an emotional one. Specifically, it’s harder to moderate directly on Facebook for a few different reasons. That’s why businesses turn to external tools, for the sake of organization and efficiency. I currently work with one that allows you to moderate Facebook with their app, for example. Hope you have a better idea of how you can become a social media moderator now :)",2021-03-06T16:41:03.710Z,"What does it take to be a good content quality moderator? ",Quora

If a question looks like a trolling question, I usually don’t answer it. I’ve reported several obnoxious questions for intolerable racism, because I fight for my United Nations family. I never had a response from Quora either about my rap over the knuckles, or about the offensive questions. I certainly have noticed the ‘Let’s you and him fight’ questions, but I think speculation about where they come from is pointless. After 20 years on the internet and seeing this all happen before in the original newsgroups, and the first email lists (that didn’t operate on difficult commands, precursors to Yahoo groups) where someone always invited a troublemaker aboard, I know there are people around who see tensions between two groups and set out to provoke and exacerbate them purely for the fun of it and the fun of upsetting people and causing them to leave. Those who were open about doing it called it ‘a game’ and ‘only pixels on the screen.’ (This is different from what were then called the professional flamers.) But they destroyed several good groups, now defunct, and the ability to communicate with just about anyone in the world about anything, whether well-known or experts, that went into a long hiatus after people fled to closed email groups until Facebook opened up that world again. So I don’t get involved, except right here and now (re Quora’s reactions). If Quora stamps on me after a spurious report, I’ll appeal but not post about it. And I’ll continue to ignore those ‘Let’s you and him fight’ posts, because no one ever wins except the troublemakers. I do urge that people who feel like leaving, stay. The only other choices are to flee to closed FB groups or Yahoo groups, or to drop out entirely, and that leaves us all the poorer. It’s ‘What if they gave a war and nobody came?’ Yes I have. And many of the questions asked are specifically aimed at codependents and empaths in an effort to invalidate their experience. At times Quora writers who write on the subject of abuse have been specially called out and named in answers to questions. We have been called names such as Flying Harpies. We are told we are stuck in the victim martyr role. We are told we are diagnosing and the person we were involved with was probably just and asshole. Fake profiles are created just to diminish us. There is a lot of effort to silence those of us who write on the subject. Not that Ive noticed and I tend to be very blunt and overly opinionated on a good day. Some of my darker posts have been insulting and I have apologised after the fact. To be honest, moderating the NPD section of Quora would be a fucking nightmare. Unless you've had personal experience of the abuse, its remarkably difficult to understand, and 9 times out of 10 the victims here look like the aggressors.",2021-03-06T16:42:39.605Z,"Have any other victims of narcissistic abuse had Quora Moderation used as a means to have their content removed?

I changed one word in your question, and that made the Qbot happy - it is usually not too hard to please it.

What QCR is dealing with, and the net you are caught up in, is known on Quora as ‘topic spamming’, the tactic of adding as many topics as possible to a question hoping to increase its exposure, pushing the question to as many eyes as possible, as opposed to getting the question in front of the best audience to answer it.

From time to time, those tiny details do pop up - the way words are arranged, or minor pronunciation deviations that clearly belong to an English speaker.

It’s not to perpetuate an agenda on either end of the political spectrum, and not to fire off statements-as-questions in an attempt to slander one or the other side. The purpose of asking questions is to obtain legitimate answers. A problem we often see on Quora is that people tend to ask questions as a means of slandering their political opposition - and these are often leading, such as “Why are Democrats so corrupt?”, which isn’t actually asking a question, but rather asserting a position that you hope someone will back up for you. You’re not therefore asking to obtain an answer, and certainly not to obtain answers that are accurate or objective, but rather just hoping that people will jump on the anti-Democratic bandwagon that you’re currently sat on. Even this question is indicative of such - you’re suggesting (without evidence) that Quora has a liberal bias. You didn’t ask “Does Quora have a liberal bias?”, which is a perfectly reasonable question. You asserted that it already does (quite inaccurately), and suggested that actions taken by Quora Moderation only happen in pursuit of that agenda. I trust you see the problem with that? It’s not dissimilar to the “Are you still beating your wife?” question: any answer you give suggests that you are (or have) engaged in domestic violence towards your wife. It’s misleading, intellectually-lazy and intended to be offensive towards the person it’s aimed at. Quora doesn’t exist for that: it exists to provide reasonable answers to reasonable questions. Yes, some will be more opinion-based than objective, but that’s perfectly reasonable: qualitative questions have at least as much effective function in research as quantitative ones. They also serve to provide context. If you’re finding your questions and comments deleted, then chances are it is because they’re in violation of Quora policies. Perhaps you’ve been rude, perhaps you’re simply creating leading questions that aren’t actually looking for genuine answers. Do bear in mind, though: there are a lot of well-respected and coherent conservative writers on Quora, and their questions, answers and comments seem to remain without being removed. So ask yourself: why do theirs remain, when yours get taken down? Methinks it might have something to do with what you say, and the way you say it, rather than because of your political alignment. Think about that, would you? I shall first direct you to this: Your Question Is Naughty! I found it applies to many such situations. I also would refer to various other answers to this question that allude to factual correctness, trolling, and the like. There is this dandy feature on Quora where you can look at a person’s profile, and you can see who they follow and who follows them. It’s really quite easy, and sometimes you can randomly click on a follower, click randomly on one of their followers, click randomly on one of their followers, and sometimes get to 20 persons before you see someone who has answered or asked a que Continue ReadingI shall first direct you to this: Your Question Is Naughty!

Quora tends to be biased towards real people, and, persons who don’t hide behind pseudonyms and anonymity.

Whomever you are, come out from behind all your identities, use your real name, and stand up for something.

In the case of the most recent issue, my answer was about Joe Biden. I had mentioned his open drunkenness, mishandling women (physically), and lack of demonstrated ability. The reason given for collapsing my answer was that it violated the “be nice” policy. I appealed. I pointed out that everything I had said was true, backed up by publicly available recordings. After review, Quora uncollapsed my answer. There is a lot of use of “violation of the be nice policy” by liberals who hate to hear the truth. If the conservative who is being censored doesn’t bother to appeal, two things happen: Quora “learns” that it isn’t acceptable to speak truth, and is more likely to censor more conservative ideas and more truths.The bullies who misuse the “be nice” policy win.So it’s a necessity to exercise the Appeals process, and it works. Quora is not, yet, inherently anti-Conservative. We can “teach” it to be by failing to appeal incorrect uses of their policies, while those who misuse the policies can “teach” the system to become biased. Don’t lose hope, but don’t slack off. Only diligence and effort will put forth the truth. And don’t misuse the policies, whether you are liberal, conservative, or Martian.

Whenever possible, incorporate those keywords into your posts to reach more people. Most often, people and current events will be trending. This is a blow to anyone posting ahead of time. It doesn’t mean you can’t schedule posts but it does mean you should devote time in your social media strategy for posting around relevant trending topics. Give them something to talk about. Facebook will now measure how many people are engaging with your post and give display preference to posts drumming up a lot of comments. For example, if you’ve just put up a controversial post and people are interacting with it, Facebook will assume other people want to interact with it immediately, too.

Facebook is using the information it’s gathered from inauthentic pages, like those that frequently share fake news, and using that data to filter out other pages using the same tactics.

If you are using it for commentary, criticism, parody, news reporting, research, teaching, or scholarship you can use some as determined by 4, fair use factors. Really Long Answer: In most instances you can't use any part of someone else's video without the copyright creators permission. However, there are some exceptions or limitations to this. These are called 'fair use'. Fair Use permits limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders.  The Wikipedia Fair use article states: Examples of fair use include commentary, search engines, criticism, parody, news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving and scholarship. It provides for the legal, unlicensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor balancing test."" The YouTube page, Fair use - YouTube, has a nice short description of these four factors.  1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposesCourts typically focus on whether the use is “transformative.” That is, whether it adds new expression or meaning to the original, or whether it merely copies from the original. Commercial uses are less likely to be considered fair, though it’s possible to monetize a video and still take advantage of the fair use defense. Basically are you trying to make something new, or are you trying to profit off another's work?  2. The nature of the copyrighted workUsing material from primarily factual works is more likely to be fair than using purely fictional works. 3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a wholeBorrowing small bits of material from an original work is more likely to be considered fair use than borrowing large portions. However, even a small taking may weigh against fair use in some situations if it constitutes the “heart” of the work. So how much are you using? Is it the whole idea or just a part?  4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted workUses that harm the copyright owner’s ability to profit from his or her original work are less likely to be fair uses. Courts have sometimes made an exception under this factor in cases involving parodies. Courts will also look to see if your creation is a direct substitute for what sourced yours from.  So for example, if you put up a video of yourself silently making facial expressions to Blank Space by Taylor Swift, you could fail fair use, since someone could listen to your video as a replacement for Taylor Swift video or song.  YouTube also lists and busts a few Fair Use Myths.  Myth #1: If I give credit to the copyright owner, my use is automatically fair use.Phrases such as “all rights go to the author” and “I do not own” do not automatically mean you are making fair use of that material -- nor do they mean you have the copyright owner’s permission.Myth #2: If I post a disclaimer on my video, my use is fair use.Nope. There are no magic words that will do this for you. Posting the four factors of fair use in your video or including the phrase “no infringement intended” won't automatically protect you from a claim of copyright infringement.Myth #3: “Entertainment” or “non-profit” uses are automatically fair use.Courts will look carefully at the purpose of your use in evaluating whether it is fair, but the three remaining factors also need to be considered. Declaring your upload to be “for entertainment purposes only,” won't work. Similarly, “non-profit” uses are favored in the fair use analysis, but it’s not an automatic defense by itself.Myth #4: If I add any original material I created to someone else’s copyrighted work, my use is fair use.Even if you’ve added a little something of your own to someone else’s content, you might not be able to take advantage of the fair use defense -- particularly if your creation fails to add new expression, meaning, or message to the original. So what does this mean for you as a YouTuber?Fair use is a defense. Not a license to do what you want. You can get sued, and win using fair use, but you have to pay the legal fees. Unfortunately this means that many content creators try to avoid using anything, when they would be covered under fair use, since the court fees, and legal battles are way harder than just getting permission in the first place.  Another thing that makes this harder, is as a YouTube creator, you have ContentID to deal with. Even if your video is completely legal from a fair use standpoint, you can still have matches filed against you, which you will then have to accept or appeal which can be a headache.  One simple tip is to upload any videos you are worried about fair use on, to a secondary account to ensure that you don't get hit with a ContentID match.  If you think you are perfectly using something as fair use, this does not mean that the owner of the copyrighted content cannot sue you.  They may still report you as violating copyright law and try to get your video taken down.  If you are %100 sure that you are in the right under fair use then you can counter appeal their take down notice and try to explain your side and work things out with them to keep your video online. There are many situations that you as a YouTuber might run into. This is a good article that covers a few, I will summarie here. - The Complete Guide To Fair Use & YouTube Background Music. You are shooting an event and background music is playing. You did not add that music.  The incidental capture of copyrighted music in the background is considered fair use.  However, the context and amount of use will be taken into consideration. A video of an event with just the music, and minimal other noise may fail since your recording could be a substitute for the original and harm their profits.  Including movies scenes you reference.You are making a video about movie sets in Hawaii. Showing brief clips for reference would be covered. But how much and how used will be considered. If you show the entire Pirates of the Caribbean with your on location shots in the corner, would probably fail.  ParodiesIt needs to be a true parody. Just writing different lyrics probably wouldn't count. Try to use as little original material as you can.  Video Gameplay and TutorialsThis is super huge on YouTube and Twitch, and while a grey area, you will probably be fine. As everyone does this, and no one cares. These types of videos probably help sales and so are not pursed by game creators.  Cover Songs of Copyrighted Music. This deserves its own article. Depends copyright owner. Legal Zoom has an article about this. Posting Cover Songs on YouTube? What You Need to Know. YouTube also gives copyright holders a way to monetize covers so they just do that sometimes. You will probably be fine.  MashupsA hard problem. Definitely transformative. Lots of questions here. Lately, more copyright owners are leaving this type of content up because it is free promotion for the original and YouTube has given them ways to monetize this content. So remember, fair use is a legal defense. Only a court of law can determine what was fair use. Fair use does not prevent you from being sued, it helps you win that lawsuit.  I cover this topic on my blog, as well as some tips and steps you can take to help avoid these types of issues. If this answer helped you go here for more - How much of someone else’s video can I use in my YouTube videos? If you receive any notification like this it means that you have violated the community guidelines set by Youtube but sometimes Youtube can also be wrong. So, i would suggest that at first take time and read the full community guidelines agreement of Youtube completely and then watch your videos atleast upto 5 times and check whether you have violated any rules or not. If not, apply for an appeal and describe your issue and if you spot something that is violating Youtubes Policies then delete the video otherwise you may even recieve a community guideline strike and if you get 3 community guideline strikes your Youtube Channel can also be terminated. What if for some reason Google decides to suspend your account (or someone else gains access to it)? Or what if they decide to remove the possibility to download the files? Or perhaps (unlikely but possible) go out of business? There's a number of risks involved with trusting your data to a third party you do not really know well (nor do you pay for their service). These risks are different from the risk of losing the files yourself so keeping a copy yourself as well, should be considered as simple risk spreading (and thus lowering the total risk) of data loss.  I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if YouTube re-compresses original movies. This means that files you redownload are of somehwat lower quality than the original uploads.",2021-03-06T17:20:57.484Z,"Is all the content on YouTube reviewed by YouTube moderators before they get uploaded?

Moderation seems to have gone downhill considerably from a few years ago. I used to never question or appeal the occasional hit I got because every time I looked back at it, I was clearly wrong. Nowadays any given report seems to be a coin toss. I’ve had people say things like “you’re an idiot” and those reported posts when unmoderated but then my own much much tamer reply gets a BNBR hit for basically not being polite even though I didn’t make a direct personal attack on them. One time I decided to hit the appeal button and wrote how ridiculous it was that my response was getting moderated but the attack that was made against me was ignored. Their response was that if I have a problem with someone else’s posts, I should report it. Well no fucking shit, Sherlock. I did report it and nothing happened.  Another issue is the large reliance on bots to police the posts. Answers that are accurate and succinct often get collapsed for being too short, causing more experienced Quorans to write a few extra lines of text for no purpose other than not getting hit by the Quora bot.  It also seems that every post is assessed in a vacuum. There are a lot of trolls on here that are careful not to cross the line too often in a single post, yet when you look at the totality of their posting history, it’s blatantly obvious that all they do is repeatedly troll other members of the site. I wouldn’t blame the mods if there was no way for them to know. After all, I’m sure they are pretty busy and can’t take the time to go through the posting history of the user every time they are looking at a report. However, if the report specifically notifies them of this behavior, well then there’s just no excuse.  They don’t even enforce their own policies, particularly the real name policy. Mind you, it’s a dumb and largely unenforceable policy that I’ve written in favor of eliminating numerous times. However, until it is eliminated they should at least pretend to give a shit about it. There are countless profiles of fictional characters on here. It’s also really easy to get around it. I saw one poster get reported for violating the policy and his account was locked. He changed to something really stupid and obviously fake. Then he changed it right back to the original (and still obviously fake) name. Quora just saw that he changed his name so some idiot mod unlocked his account.  I think most of us by now are familiar with the issues of anonymous posting. This isn’t purely a moderation issues but it crosses into this territory because Quora’s anonymous posting system has made it effectively impossible to stop the trolls. There are even regulars that keep showing back up here. But you don’t even need an account to post anonymously so there’s nothing that can be done. They can’t effectively be banned. They don’t need an account. Even if Quora use IP bans (and it doesn’t appear that they do), those are stupidly easy to overcome. Until Quora fixes its anonymous policy, this will remain an ongoing problem. The solution is really easy. Eliminate the real name policy (which is pretty much unenforced at this point anyway). Set up a way to prevent social media friends from seeing your account (to protect those using a different name). Then eliminate anonymous posting. On top of that, require accounts to either be linked to an account that has some sort of identity verification like Gmail or Facebook. That makes it a lot easier to perma-block trolls. Granted, there are ways around it but it’s a lot more effort than your average internet troll cares to bother with.   The appeals system is also problematic, specifically when it comes to comments. Comments get deleted. So when appealing, I might not even know exactly what it said and I can’t provide a link to the material as the appeal form requests. Also, when an answer gets collapsed and you edit it, there’s a button that says “make improvements” and an optional box to comment on your improvements. It’s natural to think that it enough to get the answer uncollapsed. But it’s not. If you don’t appeal after making improvements, nothing happens. It’s not a very well thought-out system. If you’re going to have a “make improvements” button, that button should automatically send the appeal.  The image policy is another one that gets really bad enforcement. Answers will be collapsed for using humorous images even if the image directly supports the content of the answer. Also, if you have multiple images, you are only told that your answer was collapsed for violating the image policy. You aren’t told which image (or images) was in violation and why, which leaves it up to you to fumble through it and hope for the best. I have a number of answers that I’ve left collapsed rather than deal with editing them and getting them approved by the powers that be. Moderation is all relative. Quora moderates hard because other sites with similar objectives moderate soft. Quora also doesn’t moderates as tightly as a site like Stack Exchange (website) or has as formal of rules like Wikipedia. It all ties back to the objective of the site which comes back to their mission statement.

Quora's mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge To achieve the mission, you need a moderation strategy that compliments that mission. Reddit’s objective is best achieved with subreddit moderation that adjusts its moderation for its subcommunities. Stack Exchange is optimized to protecting the expert community from “unsmart” questions. Wikipedia is focused on the creation of education content. Quora’s moderation is designed for knowledge sharing. The community features of Quora are secondary to the primary objective of knowledge sharing. Thus, violations like an overuse of memes or joke answers are punished on Quora and not on reddit since they have different objectives. Conversely the role of BNBR on Quora is chiefly for the purpose of enabling users to share knowledge but not at the extent of limiting the knowledge that could be shared.",2021-03-06T17:23:21.091Z,"Why is does Quora censor and moderate content on the Quora website?

You can go Anonymous for a question you are worried a particular person might find out about (eg relationship advice) but Quora administration still knows who the real poster is. (It’s just anonymous to the readers) I for one, would not trust someone if I found out they were using a fake name to hide their true identity. I don’t mean someone called David calling themselves Dave, or someone continuing to use their maiden name after they have changed it in marriage. I mean when people deliberately hide their true identity. For what reason would people do this? Who are you hiding from? That in itself rings alarm bells for me. Lying about your identity? What else are you lying about? My name really is Wendy Moncur. It always has been. That really is my picture, warts and all. (not that I have actual warts - it’s just an expression) I expect Quorans to take me seriously. That integrity begins with me. If I am honest about myself, and people see that honesty, then it engenders trust and respect. I am not sure I could trust a liar. For whatever reason they think their “lie” is justified, it is still a lie. It is still dishonest, and still disrespectful. I have nothing to hide. What are you hiding? If you do have something seriously secret you don’t want someone to know, should you be online at all? With today’s technology, it is harder to hide than you think. eg really clever psychologists can search for character traits like phrases or word patterns unique to one person. ….. patterns you aren’t even aware you have. As smart as you are trying to hide, there are smarter people who can find you. You are more easily found online than you are in real life.

I think it is still relevant in 2017 with decent set of specs, latest iOS. It breezed through all the tasks I threw at it. The only problem I started facing over the last couple of months was battery backup. I had to go looking for a charger twice in a day! Other than that I had no complaints with it. Which phone should I replace it with? Next came the research stage. First obvious choice for me was an iPhone. And I was very much craving for the big one iPhone 7 Plus. But I found it to be too good for its price (it was retailing in the range of₹65000 - ₹72000 for the 128Gb version). If one thinks the OnePlus 5 is overpriced, then what would do we say about Apple pricing? Search for a budget alternative begins. I was looking for my 5th smartphone (order being Samsung S3, Sony Xperia Z Ultra, iPhone 5s). I have never purchased one without thorough research. My resources (in order of precedence - from highest to lowest) have always been : mobile phone reviews, news, specifications and more...YouTube reviews from Android Authority and other tech channelsChecking out the phone in a storeConsidering my budget I zeroed in on OnePlus 5. The specs are top notch. The camera takes great outdoor shots. Could have been better for indoor photography. But I feel it has the hardware, a future software update can hopefully improve things. As for the phone itself : it has a clean UI. The hardware ensures the experience is great and buttery smooth. The display is crisp. There are no lags, no ANRs (Application not responding error messages) observed so far. Android has come a long way. I just can't keep my hands off it. Overall I am very happy with my OnePlus experience. Closing Comments : I know OnePlus has raised the price of it's flagship year on year, but that's the case with every other smartphone manufacturer. The point is no other manufacturer is able to provide a complete smartphone at this price point - and that makes me side with OnePlus.

You see, the principal reason for the complete ban on Huawei is to destroy this company so that it will be unable to dominate the global 5G network. Initially, the Americans held the belief that their global allies would support them by shutting out Huawei from their respective countries. Apart from Australia, New Zealand, Japan and a handful of smaller countries, the other US allies have largely snubbed the American call. Out of frustration, the US has now enacted their Plan B - to destroy Huawei by denying the company the vital components and software that they exclusively rely on to incorporate into their products. This is a very evil thing to do - this is “hitting below the belt”. The Americans are going all out to prevent China from claiming the high ground in 5G and other technological advancements such as AI. As some experts have suggested that the country that gained control of 5G technology will most likely secure a future for the next technological revolution. Huawei is being targeted and not OnePlus because the latter has no crucial technology like 5G. I back my claim that the USA is planning to destroy China’s technological and economic ambitions with the following evidence [the trade war is just an excuse or cover-up for a devious hidden agenda]: Bloomberg article extract dated May 22, 2019: US President Donald Trump has vowed that China will not become the world’s top superpower under his watch. In an interview with Fox News Trump said he was “very happy” with the trade war. “We’re taking in billions of dollars,” he said, when asked about the endgame in the trade conflict. “China is obviously not doing well like us.” Trump’s comments signal he is in no rush to get back to negotiating with Beijing after talks to end the trade conflict fell apart earlier this month. He has since raised tariffs on Chinese goods and moved to restrict Huawei Technologies’ access to the US market. SCMP article extract dated May 22, 2019: Driving Huawei out of the United States and Europe is “10 times more important” than a trade deal with China, according to former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. He also said he would dedicate all his time to shutting Chinese companies out of US capital markets. The remark by Bannon, a strong advocate of an “all-encompassing war” against China, came days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning Huawei from the US market and cutting off its vital components supply. “It is a massive national security issue to the West,” Bannon said, in a phone interview on Saturday with the South China Morning Post. “The executive order is 10 times more important than walking away from the trade deal. It [Huawei] is a major national security threat, not just to the US but to the rest of the world. We are going to shut it down”.

And I say that because every time I’ve tried to improve a question, Quora moderation showed up (sometimes mere seconds later) to revert me. Even when the question had unclear meaning, incorrect spelling/grammar/etc, or lacked specificity. Take this question for example. It asked about the genetic origins of “European Jews”, which clearly can only mean Ashkenazi or Sephardi Jews. So I changed “European Jews” to “Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews”. Sounds reasonable, right? Quora’s moderators didn’t seem to think so. They reverted me twice on the grounds that I was “altering the meaning of the question”. Huh? How is that altering the meaning of the question? How does that make any sense?  I’d understand it if they at least tried to explain how my edits were altering the question’s meaning, but they didn’t even do that. They’ve even reverted my edits to my OWN questions. I don’t think I need to explain how frustrating and absurd that is. Your question has been merged. Best of luck sorting out this tangle. Depending on how much you change a question the bots will think that you have changed it to much. If the changes are extensive add a new question. If the meaning of the question remains intact then revert and report. Sometimes it best to just add a new question. Before you do this make sure that something similar does not exist. The new question will just be a target for a merge. The moment you submit a question it’s not your question anymore, it becomes community property. When you change the intention of the question, specially if it’s already answered, the change will be reverted. If this is the case you can best write a new question with the right intention.",2021-03-06T17:37:40.507Z,"How do you stop Quora Content Review from constantly reverting question edits? ",Quora

Linkedin is one of the most helpful networks that can easily land you a job given that you do your part of the deal right. I got a job recently through Linkedin and it only took me a couple of weeks to search for the right job. So I have decided to share what I did that got me a perfect high paying job through Linkedin. 1. Your Profile is Your Weapon The first thing after you sign up on Linkedin is to set up your profile. Your profile is an equivalent to your resume and has much more value than a hard copy. Now I know filling up all the details for your profile is a tedious job but you got to invest time and do it right. Your profile must be rich with valuable information regarding your academics, extra-curricular and work experience. You must be thinking what could fields like academics and extra-curricular activities do to boost your chances of getting employed. Firstly, your academics is an important factor that you must mention. Secondly, extra-curricular activities bring out a huge amount of information about your personality. For the people without any work experience, this field is a gem so polish it well. 2. Add a Valuable Summary The Summary section of your profile is your first impression to anyone viewing your profile. The trick is to ""Keep it Short, Keep it Hot"". The content of this section adds at least 20% of your chances of getting selected for a job. DO NOT INTRODUCE YOURSELF!! Your name pretty much does that for you! You need to add a content that proves that you are dedicated towards your work and you have an ambitious personality to shed for your work. You can research and look at the content of other successful people on Linkedin to get an idea of what you need to add to your Summary. 3. Search For The Job You Want This is an important part and pay close attention. You definitely know how to search a job on Linkedin but there is a catch. When you search a company and apply to it, you must notice the number of applicants that have applied for the job before you. In my personal observation, when the number of applicants is above 100 then there is a high possibility that your resume might not be noticed at all. Nonetheless, you must apply for the job given that you have made your profile consider worthy. When you apply for a job that has less than 50 applicants then you have a high possibility of getting a call for an interview. You must also apply to companies on a daily basis or at least every alternate day. The more number of companies you apply to, the more chances of getting a job. This is an obvious fact but lets be truthful, not many people spend time applying for jobs. 4. Make Connections And Connect You need to follow/connect with people who are in the same post as you are looking for and also you need to connect with people who are in the recruiting department of companies. The more connection you have, the more profile views you will get and that will help you in getting a job. Making connections is just not enough! Few weeks back I connected with a Linkedin member in the same field of profession that I was in. She sent me a very humble message mentioning that she was on a lookout for a job and she would grateful if I could give her reference in the company I worked in. Unfortunately, I wasn't working in any company BUT I did refer her for a job interview which I couldn't join. Moral of the story, when you send a humble message to people asking for referrals then you might get some valuable ones. Here is a sample of the message that you can use: Hi Chandan, Hope all is well at your end. I am reaching out to you with regard to an opportunity that I am looking for in the Content writing space. I would like to explore any suitable openings in your current organization or your connections. Please let me know if you are aware of any relevant opportunities that I can explore. Even if you don't know any at the moment, its great to stay connected! Thanks **YOUR NAME This is a very valuable hack and do use it because it will surely generate positive results. 5. Get Endorsements And Recommendations Endorsements and recommendations add a great deal to your profile. You must ask your colleagues and friends to endorse you or write a recommendation. You must get endorsement for the RIGHT FIELDS! A harsh reality is that no one cares if you know Microsoft Word or any such equivalent skill that even a 10 year old has. When it comes to the skills section, add only and only skills that are relevant to your job and request for endorsements and recommendations for those. Don't be ashamed to ask for these things as its not a crime and at the end of the day, you are the one who is going to benefit from it. I hope these points help you to land a perfect job because they did land me my dream job as a Digital Content Manager.

I’ll go through all three quickly so you can get the gist of it. If you need more details, I can add more :) Group moderation There are so many groups on Facebook that are run by regular people. With that being said, regular people can sometimes say unproductive, offensive things. That isn’t really what you’re looking for when you want to keep discussions going/keep up a lively atmosphere. From what I could tell, group moderators were usually people who were very active in the group, contributed, and were able to recognize inappropriate behavior. They were also very helpful, reviewed your membership application, and they could give you a response to your issue pretty quickly. If you want to become a moderator for a FB group, you need to be able to reinforce the rules of the group, respond to others and their complaints. Employment as a moderator This one is more difficult. From what I’ve gathered, you don’t always directly work with social media platforms. Instead, you work for a company that Facebook might have a contract with to manage all their content. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are particularly susceptible to malicious content being uploaded. From what I’ve read, you need to be trained to do this right and can’t really have a weak stomach. They have to be trained to recognize when content is breaching community guidelines. The thing is, the guidelines are really specific, and things you personally might think are offensive might not be taken down (people with mental disabilities are not protected by certain guidelines, for example). If you’re pretty resilient, you could try to find a job in the field through Glassdoor or similar sites. Business/Brand moderation Finally, this is something that can be quite positive! Many brands have social media pages, and they can connect with their customers/fans/followers/subscribers through the platform. Instagram and Facebook are particularly great for this. If you’re working for a brand, you can respond to customer comments, complaints, and questions. Customers will generally appreciate it when you directly answer them. Lost shipment? Tell them how you’ll resolve it.Questions about the product? Answer with details and precision.Thanking you for the good customer service? Thank them for sharing their experience and for choosing your brand. However, it isn’t so easy to do. This is more of a technical issue than an emotional one. Specifically, it’s harder to moderate directly on Facebook for a few different reasons. That’s why businesses turn to external tools, for the sake of organization and efficiency. I currently work with one that allows you to moderate Facebook with their app, for example. Hope you have a better idea of how you can become a social media moderator now :) Everyone is biased and hence it is not possible to be unbiased. The question therefore is not how you can be unbiased but rather what biases you want in your moderation team. Generally speaking, most website owners want to have moderators whose values generally agree with their own, much like how most companies and government departments do things. They will tolerate views that differ a little bit but they need to adhere to their core values. In a company or government department you might see a code of conduct or vision statement but in social media they use such terms as community guidelines,  Continue ReadingEveryone is biased and hence it is not possible to be unbiased.

They will tolerate views that differ a little bit but they need to adhere to their core values. In a company or government department you might see a code of conduct or vision statement but in social media they use such terms as community guidelines, which, in theory, can be modified by everyday users. Like codes of conduct and vision statements, community guidelines are not hard and fast rules but rather general ideas of what is and is not acceptable behaviour. They in no way replace applicable laws nor does every penalty have to be in line with them. Penalties are ultimately decided by the owner(s) and don’t need a reason. The key for a good moderator is being able to apply the wishes of the owner, not to be fair or unbiased. Some owners want biased moderators to reflect the owners wishes. Don’t assume that unbiased equals a bad moderator. Disloyal is bad. Biased, in the right direction, is good.",2021-03-06T17:42:23.141Z,"How often do you report online content to moderators? ",Quora

In an age where likes and views are everything, it would appear to be the case that the number of people who actually care about the lives of others is decreasing with alarming rapidity. A trend which I find to be rather disturbing is the amount of time people spend with their faces glued to a screen. Statistically, your average 4-5 year old in Australia will spend more than 2 hours per weekday and more than 3 hours per weekend day. These numbers increase by around an hour for children between the ages of 12 and 13. The below image gives an overview of the average amount of time adults spend looking at screens, whether it be television, mobile phones or computers.  When it comes to social media and the internet in general, teenagers appear to be the biggest consumers on both counts. On average, around 18 hours each week is spent browsing the internet, and social media in particular. However, it would seem that these numbers have increased since this survey was last conducted. A number of studies have been released, demonstrating an inverse relation between the amount of hours spent on the internet and social media, and how happy the subjects were. In addition to this, it has also been shown that the psychological well being of the subjects was greater when they spent less time performing on screen activities. I would posit that the reason for this lies in the fact that as people are becoming more and more connected to their screens, they find it harder and harder to make real, warm connections with others that can only be described as authentic human relationships. These relationships are necessary for mental well being, accounting for, in my opinion, a majority of the plethora of mental conditions including depression and suicidal tendencies. This brings us back to the title of the article. The great paradox of the 21st century is that the more people appear to have a multitude of connections online, the less they are able to connect with people offline. The more connected we seem, the less connected we really are. The Solution The above figures and facts will doubtless seem daunting and even disheartening to some. So many people (myself included) will no doubt be wondering if there are ways to avoid falling into the trap of spending inordinate amounts of time on social media and the internet. Fortunately, this is a subject on which there is no lack of helpful material. An article I read recently, described a mindset which should prove to be very helpful when approaching the topic of phone use. The trick was to treat your phone as a toothbrush, using it only when necessary. Granted, it’s a great tool, but like your toothbrush, it’s not something you need to be using every minute of the day. One suggestion I would make, is to disable notifications for non-essential things, such as likes, comments and you-tube videos. This way, when you want to just sit down and relax without your phone, you aren’t constantly reminded of the world of social media. A second tip which I think is useful is to make use of a timer which can tell you how much time you have spent on social media on that particular day. For example, the Facebook app has an in built timer or alarm which is set off whenever you reach a certain amount of time that you set. From my experience, it seems that many people, myself included, browse social media due to boredom. So a third and final tip could be to find some other useful activity which you enjoy. This could mean taking up bush-walking, drawing, learning to play an instrument, or anything else from a list of literally thousands of activities. In the end, the power to change social media and unhealthy screen-time habits, ultimately lies in your hands. The benefits of more offline time and the risks of the inverse have been clearly demonstrated. It’s up to you to choose an activity which leads to poorer mental health and an inability to socialise easily with others outside of the online environment. I, for one, know which option I’m going to choose.

But as with most things, the best method lies somewhere in between — a mixture of all five techniques. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of your different options. Pre-moderate all content Pro: You can be fairly certain that nothing inappropriate will end up in your community; you know you have human eyes on all content.Con: Time and resource-consuming; subject to human error; does not happen in real time, and can be frustrating for users who expect to see their posts immediately.Post-moderate all content Pro: Users can post and experience content in real-time.Con: Once risky content is posted, the damage is done; puts the burden on the community as it usually involves a lot of crowdsourcing and user reports.Crowdsourcing/user reports Pro: Gives your community a sense of ownership; people are good at finding subtle language.Con: Similar to pre-moderating all content, once threatening content is posted, it’s already had its desired effect, regardless of whether it’s removed; forces the community to police itself.100% computer-automated Pro: Computers are great at identifying the worst and best content; automation frees up your moderation team to engage with the community.Con: Computers aren’t great at identifying gray areas and making tough decisions.100% human review Pro: Humans are good at making tough decisions about nuanced topics; moderators become highly attuned to community sentiment.Con: Humans burn out easily; not a scalable solution; reviewing disturbing content can have an adverse effect on moderator’s health and wellness.So, if all five options have valid pros and cons, what’s the solution? In our experience, the most effective technique uses a blend of both pre- and post-moderation, human review, and user reports, in tandem with some level of automation. The first step is to nail down your community guidelines. Social products that don’t clearly define their standards from the very beginning have a hard time enforcing them as they scale up. Twitter is a cautionary tale for all of us, as we witness their current struggles with moderation. They launched the platform without the tools to enforce their (admittedly fuzzy) guidelines, and the company is facing a very public backlash because of it. Consider your stance on the following: Bullying: How do you define bullying? What behavior constitutes bullying in your community?Profanity: Do you block all swear words or only the worst obscenities? Do you allow acronyms like WTF?Hate speech: How do you define hate speech? Do you allow racial epithets if they’re used in a historical context? Do you allow discussions about religion or politics?Suicide/Self-harm: Do you filter language related to suicide or self-harm, or do you allow it? Is there a difference between a user saying “I want to kill myself,” “You should kill yourself,” and “Please don’t kill yourself”?PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Do you encourage users to use their real names, or does your community prefer anonymity? Can users share email addresses, phone numbers, and links to their profiles on other social networks? If your community is under-13 and in the US, you may be subject to COPPA.Different factors will determine your guidelines, but the most important things to consider are: The nature of your product. Is it a battle game? A forum to share family recipes? A messaging app?Your target demographic. Are users over or under 13? Are portions of the experience age-gated? Is it marketed towards adults-only?Once you’ve decided on community guidelines, you can start to build your moderation workflow. First, you’ll need to find the right software. There are plenty of content filters and moderation tools on the market, but in our experience, Community Sift is the best. A high-risk content detection system designed specifically for social products, Community Sift works alongside moderation teams to automatically identify threatening UGC in real time. It’s built to detect and block the worst of the worst (as defined by your community guidelines), so your users and moderators don’t ever have to see it. There’s no need to force your moderation team to review disturbing content that a computer algorithm can be trained to recognize in a fraction of a second. Community Sift also allows you to move content into queues for human review, and automate actions (like player bans) based on triggers. Once you’ve tuned the system to meet your community’s unique needs, you can create your workflows. You may want to pre-moderate some content, even with a content filter running in the background. If your product is targeted at under-13 users, as an added layer of human protection, you might pre-moderate anything that the filter doesn’t classify as high-risk. Or maybe you route all content flagged as high-risk (extreme bullying, hate speech, rape threats, etc) into queues for moderators to review. For older communities, you may not require any pre-moderation, and instead depend on user reports for any post-moderation work. With an automated content detection system in place, you give your moderators their time back to do the tough, human stuff, like dealing with calls for help and reviewing user reports. Another piece of the moderation puzzle is addressing negative user behavior. We recommend using automation, with the severity increasing with each offense. Techniques include warning users when they’ve posted high-risk content, and muting or banning their accounts for a short period. Users who persist can eventually lose their accounts. Again, the process and severity here will vary based on your product and demographic. The key is to have a consistent, well-thought-out process from the very beginning. You will also want to ensure that you have a straightforward and accessible process for users to report offensive behavior. Don’t bury the report option, and make sure that you provide a variety of report tags to select from, like bullying, hate speech, sharing PII, etc. This will make it much easier for your moderation team to prioritize which reports they review first. Ok, so moderation is a lot of work. It requires patience and dedication and a strong passion for community-building. But it doesn’t have to be hard, if you leverage the right tools and the right techniques. And it’s highly rewarding, in the end. After all, what’s better than shaping a positive, healthy, creative, and engaged community in your social product? It’s the ultimate goal, and ultimately, it’s an attainable one — when you do it right.",2021-03-06T18:06:53.518Z,"Is It truly possible to moderate all the inappropriate contents on social media?

It allows gamers to enjoy their games while others watch. Along with that, gamers can talks with the viewers while playing the game. They can share info, tips, and hacks to improve each stream. For a beginner who wants to start streaming on Twitch, here are some useful tips for you. BASICS TIPS Set up a Twitch Account You need to set up an account in order to start streaming. After that, follow others and make friend everyone you know. Step 1- To create a Twitch account, navigate over to the official Twitch website. Step 2 - In the top right corner of the screen, click the purple Sign Up button. Step 3 - Fill out all of the required information in the pop-up window. This will be a username, a strong password, and your email address. Step 4 - Click Sign Up once all information has been entered. You could also choose to create an account using your Facebook ID by clicking on the Connect with Facebook button at the bottom of the window. Streaming Software Now that your Twitch account has set up, selecting the streaming software is the next step to stream on Twitch. The top three that most gamers focused on during streaming sessions are OBS, Xsplit, or Streamlabs OBS. Streamlabs reports an average income increase of 30 percent when using their devices, so something to bear in mind for cash-in-looking streamers. ADVANCED TIPS Overlays An overlay is a border around your webcam. It's basically a graphic that normally a transparent PNG file that sits above your game capture window, and your webcam. The point of an overlay is to give the viewers more detail to grab on, so if the stream gets dull, they don't get bored and leave. Emotes Twitch emotes are essentially special emoticons or emoji and are used to communicate support for a streamer or to convey a message or emotion associated with its image. For example, you can put emotes of the people who you playing with next to your video so people can have an idea of who are the voices on the stream.  Avatar It’s called Avatar or profile picture where it is a prominent image for viewers to recognize you. Give them some good visual so they can sink their teeth in. People might come across your stream, check out your details and follow you if they find out that your profile picture is unique and interesting. It’s how fans and potential fans would be able to identify you if you are using a fun and appealing Avatar. You can design Avatar by yourself or just grab it somewhere. But if you wish to get custom design that suits your taste and identity, head over to this professional team that can design Avatar custom only for you. As a result, it helps in building your identity as well as attract more followers and viewers to your stream.  Hope this answer is helpful!

They give shoutouts, help each other with tech issues. Mixer streamers are also friendly. But what was surprising for me, is the creator community is really active - you can network with them, get advice from them. Mixer audience is younger so if you want to share content older streamers would appreciate, Twitch is the platform you want to choose. The back-end technology Mixer is “younger” than Twitch and both have done a great job and Mixer is keeping up. Twitch has some issues but it’s more stable than Mixer. Ingesting Ingesting is how your stream gets from your PC (the source) to the service - Mixer, Twitch. Mixer offers FTL - a service that allows pretty much instantaneous communication between the streamer and their audience. Now, you can broadcast FTL streams to Mixer via Restream which means you have more chances to have better communication and stream to multiple platforms. Twith is not there yet and their affiliate program makes it difficult for streamers to grow their audiences in other platforms though multistreaming. When it comes to comparing Mixer and Twitch, you should know that Mixer has some restrictions for PS4 but native Xbox integration is a huge benefit. These platforms have similarities and differences. If you are a starter, you can use a multistreaming service like Restream and stream your video to both Twitch and Mixer, see which one performs better for you.

Facebook would first try to lure the reviewers back by increasing pay and psychological support. Actually, they would try to get ahead of the problem that way. So let's assume this approach failed. So Facebook would have to invest in AI approaches even more than it already is. They can already identify existing “known bad” images and video. Algorithms for that are well known. They could probably figure out how to classify clearly objectionable content, like “F you”. Google's Perspective API already does pretty well at this. Where they would have trouble is statements about controversial topics where context and nuance are important. For example, consider the following statements, including punctuation: Nazis are good.“Nazis are good” - false.He said, “Nazis are good”.Are Nazis good? [In a thread where someone is accused of having neo-Nazi views.]Are Nazis good? [In a post by a neo-Nazi.]Are Nazis ever good?Nazis are good. [Accompanied by a photo of Nazi atrocities, indicating that the statement is sarcastic.]Nazis are good. [In a historical image of Nazi propaganda]Computers have a lot of difficulty understanding which of these statements are pro-Nazi, anti-Nazi or neither. I think Facebook would have to outright ban discussion of certain topics by default. The scope would have to be quite wide, including important topics like LGBT issues. The alternative is that they could give up on moderation and change the rules so that anything goes. For a platform that already struggles to maintain civility, this would be a step in the wrong direction. They don't want to lose all the people who use Facebook for baby pictures because someone's second cousin is a Nazi. So I think they would not go this route. For graphic video, they would have to rely on social voting, letting users downvote objectionable content. This would result in more people seeing images of violence and porn. It would also result in many controversial but not improper images being suppressed through malicious downvoting. Overall, it would be bad. I worked at FB as a contractor from 2010-2012.

Trump made massive news about killing it, then backed down and said what he really wanted. (This is taking a tough stand on China and also forcing assets owned by Chinese investors to be transferred to American investors at a below-market rate) China has now basically forced Trump to either play his bluff and shut it down which will lose him a lot of votes in the younger demographic or back down/fail to shut it down which will also lose him a lot of votes in the older demographic. Politically it is playing hardball which isn’t something China normally does. We are in a new phase of Chinese diplomacy which has been obvious for a while now. This is just one more example. I’m not saying this is a good or bad thing, it is just a change from the previous status quo. Now as for the story here is the background to get you up to speed: (Rumours) Here’s What China Says About TikTok Being Sold To Microsoft, Potential Ban(Specific Information) New China Export Rule Could Jeopardize TikTok U.S. SaleA few things to note: Limiting the export of certain technology without approval isn’t exactly new. The most famous example is probably: Export of cryptography from the United States which limited SSL from working for a while.This may just be a normal China “equivalent retaliation” for this: Bill introduced in US Congress to stop predatory acquisitions by China. America stopped Chinese companies from acquiring American companies so China is doing the same…Foreign acquisitions are blocked regularly. Here is one in Germany: Germany Blocks Two Chinese Investors' Transactions. America has a whole government department dedicated to blocking and approving foreign acquisitions: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)So summary: It isn’t a ban yet. It has stated that it has to apply for approval which could be denied.Limiting exports of technology isn’t new.Blocking foreign acquisitions isn’t new. (America has blocked ALL Chinese acquisitions indefinitely at the moment…)China blocking foreign acquisitions is a new policy but it could just be equivalent retaliation.(Grabbing popcorn to see what Trump’s response will be…) On the heels of Pompeo's statement, TikTok announced that it would pull out of Hong Kong, which is facing an unprecedented wave of control from the Beijing government after the promulgation of the national security law. Tik Tok owned by the Chinese is manipulating, indoctrinating and programming.. First, last week, India banned TikTok, along with 58 other Chinese apps. ... Officially, India said it banned the app because of security concerns. Specifically, it said the app was a “threat to [India's] sovereignty and integrity.” Mike Pompeo also alluded to security concerns being the impetus for banning TikTok. TikTok is Spyware,' Warns Reddit CEO. 'We Don't Care,' Say Users. Millennial social app TikTok is “fundamentally parasitic,” according to Steve Huffman, Reddit's co-founder. Speaking at a VC event this week, he thoroughly trashed the lipsyncing-and-memes service, accusing the Chinese app of spying on its users.Feb TikTok, known for its quirky 15-second videos, has been illegally and secretly harvesting vast amounts of personally identifiable user data and sending it to China, according to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court last week. The founder of ByteDance Zhang Yiming is a firm US value supporter. He truely believes that the US government is a small government which doesn’t interfere with free market. He built Tik Tok in the US following the US laws, which means the NSA has full control of what’s going on. The servers of Tik Tok US is within the US, which means the US government has the authority to inspect and monitor them. The management team of Tik Tok US is mostly Americans, which means they also support US value and laws. And what the US government is about to do has nothing to do with banning. It simply wants American capital to replace Chinese shares of Tik Tok US, with a unthinkable low price. Later the demand was expanded into the 5 eyes alliance. Imagine Chinese government doing the same thing.  The point of doing this is not about user info nor national security. It’s still about the presidential campaign. Trump is trying to show the middle to lower white people, his potential supporters, that he can gain much with bare hands.",2021-03-06T18:24:40.075Z,"Is TikTok stopping China-based moderators to monitor overseas content?

He is pro at all the kamasutra techniques and in tantric yoga. I love him. And, I too do not know whether it's love or we both are just good at it. He always bugs me whenever I tease him.

Sometimes, even I got confused whether he is my partner or avtar of Mr. Sins. We also try “Menage a tois” at regular basis. 5. Feminazis answers. Put false rape allegations over any other guy you spot. Also, wish we could eliminate all the men and could send them to mars permanently. But, we know they will definitely rape alien women too.

Will start by writing disclaimer and not gonna leave any stone unturned in showing their jingoism rather than patriotism. If someone comments, and if their opinions is slight different from them.

Yes, but they’re not who/what most people seem to think they are. 90% of the questions about Quora moderation seem to miss this point, and seem unable to conceive of how technology is taking over many previously “low-rent, human jobs”… Read these : Debbie Scott's answer to Do you find Quora’s moderation less intelligent than it used to be? Debbie Scott's answer to Have collapsed answers become classified info? Why are the collapsed answers sometimes open for viewing and sometimes all that's available is the heading and count of collapsed answers? Debbie Scott's answer to How much Quora ""moderation"" BS can a rational human being endure before ultimately concluding it ain't worth the time and energy to respond to imbecilic questions? Debbie Scott's answer to Why does Quora require review of the simplest question edits to correct spelling and punctuation, but allows wholesale vandalism in other cases? Once you grasp that “no human” is bringing their agendas, biases, contexts, overviews, consideration, or even sense of humour to Moderation, but instead are simply following Quora’s Rules and Policies, as they are written… which are available for all to read, here: https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us and this explains a lot : https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004211543-What-are-the-main-policies-and-guidelines-for-writing-answers-on-Quora- …it would cut down on a LOT of pointless questions about how Quora operates. No bias, no censorship, no liberal vs conservative moderation choices, no need for anger or upset, no job offers, no “fake” reporting…Just the Rules and Policies that EVERYONE agreed to abide by when they signed up, but then never took the time to read… Chill, people, it’s the 21st Century, and a LOT has changed, and is still changing - exponentially fast… Catch up!  (from : How do we deal w/ an exponential pace of change (vs. a normal linear curve/steady pace)? ) Do Quora content moderators get paid? Erm….I guess that depends what you mean by “paid”? Are “guide dogs” paid? Are zoo animals paid? And more pertinently, does Quora “pay” its pre-programmed automated algorithms? I’m sure they pay their “human” employees, but most of the Content Review, if not all of it, is done by bots. Perhaps Quora gives them a double dose of bits and bytes on special holidays, or has an automated Thanking bot set up to show their appreciation to the MULTIPLE bots they have working at the front end interface between Quorans and their keyboards, and the Quora site? But, money? I VERY much doubt it… Are Quora moderators always online? Yes. Because Quora is a global website, operating 365 days, 24/7, Quora’s founders set the site up to have automated algorithmic content moderators (aka “bots”), running all the time, as their first line of defence against unwelcome content. This also negates the need to have to employ human moderators, for whom the costs would be prohibitive, and would mean that Quora would need to start charging for use of the site.

Part of the responsibility of being moderators was that we were expected to be above and beyond model citizens who set the bar that we expected everyone to follow. As a result, there was a lot of internal review. There were also a lot of retrospective reviews and self-audits. If I felt that users were upset at me or that a particular moderation activity didn’t play out as I expected, I would generally request for an internal review of my actions to make sure that I didn’t overstep my bounds or abused my status as an admin. While a common criticism against moderation was that punitive action felt like moderators were teaming up against users, the team based effect is a byproduct of admins willing to consult a 3rd party to conduct a review of a heated situation rather than operating as lone wolves which would have other consequences. Admins certainly have strong disagreements. However, one of the great joys of being an admin was that the admin team consisted of very strong passionate debaters who were exceptionally nice and respectful. When admins defend the ability for honest conversations within the limits of BNBR, we talk from experience since every day, the admin chat would be populated with lengthy difficult discussions that were well within BNBR. We know that tough conversations can be both conducted nicely and respectfully. An important byproduct of that environment was that we were able to trust each other to provide constructive feedback on our activities. We would regularly point out examples of what we saw as violations to each other since it should only be fair that we apply our standards on each other. Fortunately, these discussions go fairly smoothly since admins were largely selected based on evaluations of moral character based on their activities as reviewers. Welcome to, how the Left Argues.

I'm on Quora a lot, so I calculate each time whether or not it's worth it. If I were managing Quora Content Review, I would instruct them to err on the side of the users. Iow, make a change when you know beyond a reasonable doubt the user is wrong or that your change is an improvement.

A lot of my questions are very thoughtful, and it's taken years of life experience and education to come to my perspective, and I would put it upon people like Mark who go to elite schools to even have a chance at getting where I'm coming from most of the time.

Ask questions like: What’s your business statement?What are the main pain points your customers face?In five sentences or less, describe your company’s selling points.Let’s face it: content questionnaires are a no-brainer. Ask QuestionsIt might sound like a no-brainer and it might even make you want to smack yourself on the head and exclaim in a Homer-esque way, “Doh!” but asking your clients the right questions will help you create the best content for them. Remember, it’s OK that you’re not the expert, but it’s also your job to meet with the experts (the clients) to get the right information. Simply explain to them, “Because you’re the expert, can you interject some of your expertise into this blog post?” More often than not, they will gladly oblige. Google Like a King We’ve all been faced with an interaction with a coworker that ensues as the following: Person A: “I don’t know what X means?” Person B: “Did you Google it?” Person A: “…” Because 90% of the time we aren’t familiar with the industry we are writing about, conduct your research and Google like a king. It’s safe to say that for every new client you write about, at least an hour of industry research (Google search) should be done. Once you can sound like an expert, your content will instantly resonate. Stand on the Shoulders of GiantsThe clients you write for didn't always have the knowledge they bestow, and believe it or not, they still don't possess all of the industry knowledge. That's why it's important to stand on the shoulders of giants (this isn't a short joke); rely on those who are the thought leaders in the industry you're writing about. After all, they are the experts. By reading articles and e-books they've written, you can gain first-hand insight into things even the business owners you're writing for may not be familiar with. This will not only give your content a better edge but will also make you a more informed writer.

If the topic is unknown to me then obviously I'd need some background details, but if I've heard of the topic and it leads to some creative writing as a response, then I'd be more inclined to use poetry to get my ideas across. Unique content is just waiting to be shared and we can create our own ideas in stories of our own. We don't have to become experts just to complete the exercise. We can simply write something that tells the readers we hardly know anything at all but that the topic is quite interesting and we'd like to learn more about it. So we could write about going to Google or going to College or going to see a friend about it. Wherever the journey leads to is where we take the readers as well. :If writing about computers, for example, we could start off by sharing info on someone who couldn't type for toffee. Then describe the way he learnt how to type very quickly but then realised there were so many function keys on the QWERTY keyboard that he decided to type mostly using his left hand. Then we could explain that he preferred the white keyboard or grey keyboard rather than the black keyboard. We could then see that he explored his computer and learnt the basics of what did what. Then how he got books from the library and checked Google for tricks and tips. Eventually that man was able to help others as well as himself. We could explore a great deal further into the story or the poem.:The general principle is to get the readers interested so a newbie learns a little and a few more advanced learners get something as well. We can't all present ourselves as gurus on a new topic but if challenged we usually can present something useful. I would introduce QUORA as a way to ask questions and get answers. Offer links to relevant details and share Google results for web pages, videos and images. If there were courses available free, then I'd pass on the details. If there were discounted courses I'd offer those as examples to the readers. We can do with upbeat info now and then, yet a story or a poem can be just as helpful. Nowadays, we include all sorts of videos, animated gifs, cartoons and photos and diagrams. So we don't always rely on words, words, words. :What we present would be guided by what we were asked to write for and if we got paid or not. Why write a book if nobody pays for it? Well, some writers are willing to write for nothing in regard to books or articles. When their work is completed, they produce ebooks and website tutorials and so on. So each writer can either write something casual and not at all complicated or really go nuts and become an expert as quickly as possible. I don't intend spending too much time learning stuff. But really interesting stuff is completely different. There's a greater desire to learn more and more. That doesn't mean that writers become enthusiastic about every trick they learn or every tip they get to learn later. Writers can be quite professional at explaining the instructions without adding jokes every now and then or personal anecdotes. It's just the way that suits the topic as the guide to how to present the text and any extras, too. I merely suggested the learning computers topic as we're all doing that each and every day...: By first researching them. Nobody likes a writer that isn’t credible. You won’t be able to write about a lot of topics if you don’t truly know about a lot of topics. Once you research topics you like, write on them. Keeping a library of articles written on different topics makes it easier when you’re submitting them to various magazines or blogs. It’s best to keep them filed and categorized in some type of file systems you can create to keep track of them.",2021-03-06T18:46:12.508Z,"How long does it take you to write compelling content in a field your moderately familiar with?

Look in the edit history of the question; available in the Edits link on the bottom right of the desktop version of Quora. Find the QCR (or other edit) reverting your change. Read the reason. If you believe the QCR bot is in error and you are in a loop trying to correct the wording of a question, I recommend you report the QCR edit as vandalism. That should at least bring the question text to the attention of real people, not just automated routines. Why does Quora reverse my edit on my question? They told you why. Comment: The edits have changed the meaning of the original question. The question was reverted back to its original state. See: Quora Content Review of Question Edits and Topics. Also you may have written the question but it’s Quora’s site and becomes Quora’s question. I recommend you leave that alone and write a separate question. Problem solved. This should not be the norm. Generally speaking, questions may be edited by anyone in the community (provided there has been no suspension of their privileges).

6043cfcced76476feda353a0,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Quora-keep-moderating-my-posts-when-I-add-a-link-to-the-content?-,"What is wrong with Quora moderation? Mostly that it’s horribly inconsistent. Moderation seems to have gone downhill considerably from a few years ago. I used to never question or appeal the occasional hit I got because every time I looked back at it, I was clearly wrong. Nowadays any given report seems to be a coin toss. I’ve had people say things like “you’re an idiot” and those reported posts when unmoderated but then my own much much tamer reply gets a BNBR hit for basically not being polite even though I didn’t make a direct personal attack on them. One time I decided to hit the appeal button and wrote how ridiculous it was that my response was getting moderated but the attack that was made against me was ignored. Their response was that if I have a problem with someone else’s posts, I should report it. Well no fucking shit, Sherlock. I did report it and nothing happened.  Another issue is the large reliance on bots to police the posts. Answers that are accurate and succinct often get collapsed for being too short, causing more experienced Quorans to write a few extra lines of text for no purpose other than not getting hit by the Quora bot.  It also seems that every post is assessed in a vacuum. There are a lot of trolls on here that are careful not to cross the line too often in a single post, yet when you look at the totality of their posting history, it’s blatantly obvious that all they do is repeatedly troll other members of the site. I wouldn’t blame the mods if there was no way for them to know. After all, I’m sure they are pretty busy and can’t take the time to go through the posting history of the user every time they are looking at a report. However, if the report specifically notifies them of this behavior, well then there’s just no excuse.  They don’t even enforce their own policies, particularly the real name policy. Mind you, it’s a dumb and largely unenforceable policy that I’ve written in favor of eliminating numerous times. However, until it is eliminated they should at least pretend to give a shit about it. There are countless profiles of fictional characters on here. It’s also really easy to get around it. I saw one poster get reported for violating the policy and his account was locked. He changed to something really stupid and obviously fake. Then he changed it right back to the original (and still obviously fake) name. Quora just saw that he changed his name so some idiot mod unlocked his account.  I think most of us by now are familiar with the issues of anonymous posting. This isn’t purely a moderation issues but it crosses into this territory because Quora’s anonymous posting system has made it effectively impossible to stop the trolls. There are even regulars that keep showing back up here. But you don’t even need an account to post anonymously so there’s nothing that can be done. They can’t effectively be banned. They don’t need an account. Even if Quora use IP bans (and it doesn’t appear that they do), those are stupidly easy to overcome. Until Quora fixes its anonymous policy, this will remain an ongoing problem. The solution is really easy. Eliminate the real name policy (which is pretty much unenforced at this point anyway). Set up a way to prevent social media friends from seeing your account (to protect those using a different name). Then eliminate anonymous posting. On top of that, require accounts to either be linked to an account that has some sort of identity verification like Gmail or Facebook. That makes it a lot easier to perma-block trolls. Granted, there are ways around it but it’s a lot more effort than your average internet troll cares to bother with.   The appeals system is also problematic, specifically when it comes to comments. Comments get deleted. So when appealing, I might not even know exactly what it said and I can’t provide a link to the material as the appeal form requests. Also, when an answer gets collapsed and you edit it, there’s a button that says “make improvements” and an optional box to comment on your improvements. It’s natural to think that it enough to get the answer uncollapsed. But it’s not. If you don’t appeal after making improvements, nothing happens. It’s not a very well thought-out system. If you’re going to have a “make improvements” button, that button should automatically send the appeal.  The image policy is another one that gets really bad enforcement. Answers will be collapsed for using humorous images even if the image directly supports the content of the answer. Also, if you have multiple images, you are only told that your answer was collapsed for violating the image policy. You aren’t told which image (or images) was in violation and why, which leaves it up to you to fumble through it and hope for the best. I have a number of answers that I’ve left collapsed rather than deal with editing them and getting them approved by the powers that be. Quora's moderation apparently works as a dictatorship in which their moderators threaten to ban anyone who makes a statement they don't personally agree with. Only one time in my history of using this platform have I ever had a problem with anyone, and the one time it did happen someone left disparaging and insulting remarks on one of my comments within a post. I responded with ""Better yet, where did you learn how to read?"" And quora's response was to threaten to ban me over that? The thing is, In order to stop an argument before it ensued, I actually deleted the comment 2 seconds after it was made, deleted the other persons disparaging comments, and blocked them, as I felt it was a better choice. Then Quora's North Korean dictators came and started threatening me.  It seems we have no right to defend ourselves if others attack us, and apparently Quora's fascist dictators for moderators don't know how to mind their own business. This is supposed to be a Q&A site, and of course people aren't always going to see eye to eye, they're going to stress their arguments, of course they're going to disagree on things, but apparently Quora feels we have no right to our own personal opinions.  This platform violates every principal of freedom of speech and freedom of expression. If this platform plans to last they need to get rid of these mentally deranged moderators who're hell bent on treating people like crap. Quora's ""Be Nice, Be Respectful"" policy is BS, as it doesn't appear these rules apply to them.Whatever you do, if one of the moderators personal friends makes insulting statements to you as what happened to me, don't respond, otherwise the fascists will come after you. As far as I am aware, there is no policy about the number of links or references that may be used in an answer. The most relevant policy that I was able to find is here: What is Quora's policy on plagiarism and attribution?and some additional pertinent answers are here: Should answers on Quora require or encourage citations (when appropriate)?Should I add links to references and source material in Quora answers? How should I do so?Particularly the latter indicates: The norm right now is to paste the URL link(s) where you found material that supports your answer. Quora will shrink the URL so that it doesn't crowd the space. It is unclear whether those are intended to be in-line links or footnotes. There is a reference to the Wikipedia style manual that I will discuss later, but in general I would conclude that I am unable to find any specific policy written out on Quora as to the use of links, aside from a general recommendation that they be included when appropriate and that quoted material should be properly offset.  To address the second part of the question from the details: Is there justification in reporting content based on using “too many” Wikipedia references? I would say yes. The issue here was not that the answer was reported, but rather that Quora moderation did not reach a proper conclusion as to whether or not the answer was plagiarized. Christopher VanLang gives an explanation here of why an answer that includes many internal links to Wikipedia may be reported, and why he may even have been the one to report this. The logic behind the initial report is sound in the same way that the logic of a doctor is sound when they receive a patient who is complaining of fever and extreme sore throat and consequently order a strep test. It is pattern matching, not extensive investigation. When viewed this way, we see that the report is based on pattern matching, but I would think that we would all agree that it is the role of moderation to actually perform the investigation and come to a correct conclusion. One thing we would hope is that they have access to better tools than the average Joe in order to come to a sound conclusion on whether or not plagiarism has actually occurred. It seems obvious to me that — for whatever reason — the failure mode here occurred with moderation, who first deemed the answer plagiarized and then declined it on appeal.  I am also going to chime in on the subject of footnotes vs. inline cite vs. wikipedia-style linkout. First let me start by noting that People who write for newspapers follow the style guide of the newspaper, but they get paid for their work.People who write for academic journals follow the style guide of the journal, but they get ‘paid’ in academic credential that later (hopefully) translates into salary and opportunity.People who write for Quora are recommended to follow the style guide of Quora, such as it is, but we write for free.It is worth noting that in What are good guidelines for formatting (spacing, punctuation, grammar, spelling, bullets, etc.) answers and posts on Quora?, the use of Wikipedia’s style manual as a baseline is recommended. Here is an excerpt from the relevant policy on links from Wikipedia: Wikilinks … Make links only where they are relevant and helpful in the context: Excessive use of hyperlinks can be distracting and may slow the reader down. Redundant links (like the one in the tallest people on Earth) clutter the page and make future maintenance harder. High-value links that are worth pursuing should stand out clearly. … External links …External links should not normally be used in the body of an article. Instead, articles can include an External links section at the end, pointing to further information outside Wikipedia as distinct from citing sources. From the perspective of this style, in-line links to Quora sources would be the equivalent of internal links, and links to Wikipedia sources such as Daniel Bamberger included in his contentious answer would be considered external links. Thus, there is a technical argument to be made that in-line references to Wikipedia such as Daniel used here would fall outside the style recommended by Quora. However, humans are almost as good pattern imitators as they are pattern matchers. When my daughter was not reading fourth grade material in the fourth grade, the concern was not about her reading ability, but that her failure to be exposed to higher-level written material would affect her writing ability. While individuals may have different opinions on whether in-line links or footnotes are more appropriate, I would say that the common style of many newspapers, blogs, and other online material leans heavily towards in-line citation styles, and therefore many users may unconsciously copy that style. For myself, I almost always use in-line citation because I prefer it when reading; I tend to link-out as I go if I wish to follow up and therefore a list of citations at the end of a long article is a pain, forcing me to continually scroll to the end and then later find and return to where I left off. For authors such as Daniel, they have become accustomed to writing in a particular style in another environment, and it is comfortable and easy for them to write in that style. As I noted above, none of us who write here are paid for our work. Given that, I think it may be a bit much to expect a significant effort to adjust to Quora’s specific style recommendations if they are not natural or comfortable for the individual writer and the answer is otherwise generally readable and well structured. I would also note that answers that are intrinsically difficult to read will tend to be sorted downward by Quora’s answer ranking algorithms, so an author who repeatedly writes poorly organized and styled answers will find that they do not receive very much attention. Ultimately, Quora must decide which it prizes more: our answers, or our adherence to the style guide that many are not even aware of.",2021-03-06T18:54:04.976Z,"Why does Quora keep moderating my posts when I add a link to the content?

Like Julia Doherty I’ve taken the trouble to read many collapsed answers, and a great many of them are correct in what they say, and would appear to have only been downvoted because the opinion they expressed was unpopular among certain groups of Quora users. In certain topics, in particular religion and politics, there’s what appears to be a systematic campaign of downvoting along the lines of - “I don’t agree with you so I’m going to downvote your answer to collapse it”. This is wrong and surely it’s contrary to the spirit of Quora. If all answers are visible, and there’s a clear indication of both up and down votes, at least other Quora users would be able to decide for themselves whether a preponderance of downvotes on any particular answer was justified or not.

If I'm re-posting offensive stuff from elsewhere, it's my Quora user account on the line. Simply copying/pasting offensive content into the question title or details? Don't. You're propagating it and offending innocent people who happen on your content. Anonymity only spares you named embarrassment. All the other appropriate measures against you can and probably will be taken. Providing a link to said content, with appropriate warnings and proper attribution? Sure, with the caveat that this requires skillful handling. Use as much empathy as you can muster to imagine how someone from the targeted group might receive this, if they woke up to this content. (Or worse, A2A'd.) A question, answer, or comment should have value. What is the value of what you're adding? Is your talking about [offensiveness] going to result in a net plus in lessening misunderstanding, discrimination, and oppression? Or are you merely piling on?  I think there is a subquestion about moderation in theory and in practice, K. Stated policies are one thing. Individual applications of policies are something else. Actions taken by moderation can be and are challenged by community members. As Shefaly points out, ""blunt instruments of moderation"" are a challenge, and as the community grows in diversity, so must the mod. team. Difficult content and their handling is the test of any user-generated content site. To the extent Quora the company has tried to meet the challenge, I'm (cautiously) optimistic.

But as with most things, the best method lies somewhere in between — a mixture of all five techniques. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of your different options. Pre-moderate all content Pro: You can be fairly certain that nothing inappropriate will end up in your community; you know you have human eyes on all content.Con: Time and resource-consuming; subject to human error; does not happen in real time, and can be frustrating for users who expect to see their posts immediately.Post-moderate all content Pro: Users can post and experience content in real-time.Con: Once risky content is posted, the damage is done; puts the burden on the community as it usually involves a lot of crowdsourcing and user reports.Crowdsourcing/user reports Pro: Gives your community a sense of ownership; people are good at finding subtle language.Con: Similar to pre-moderating all content, once threatening content is posted, it’s already had its desired effect, regardless of whether it’s removed; forces the community to police itself.100% computer-automated Pro: Computers are great at identifying the worst and best content; automation frees up your moderation team to engage with the community.Con: Computers aren’t great at identifying gray areas and making tough decisions.100% human review Pro: Humans are good at making tough decisions about nuanced topics; moderators become highly attuned to community sentiment.Con: Humans burn out easily; not a scalable solution; reviewing disturbing content can have an adverse effect on moderator’s health and wellness.So, if all five options have valid pros and cons, what’s the solution? In our experience, the most effective technique uses a blend of both pre- and post-moderation, human review, and user reports, in tandem with some level of automation. The first step is to nail down your community guidelines. Social products that don’t clearly define their standards from the very beginning have a hard time enforcing them as they scale up. Twitter is a cautionary tale for all of us, as we witness their current struggles with moderation. They launched the platform without the tools to enforce their (admittedly fuzzy) guidelines, and the company is facing a very public backlash because of it. Consider your stance on the following: Bullying: How do you define bullying? What behavior constitutes bullying in your community?Profanity: Do you block all swear words or only the worst obscenities? Do you allow acronyms like WTF?Hate speech: How do you define hate speech? Do you allow racial epithets if they’re used in a historical context? Do you allow discussions about religion or politics?Suicide/Self-harm: Do you filter language related to suicide or self-harm, or do you allow it? Is there a difference between a user saying “I want to kill myself,” “You should kill yourself,” and “Please don’t kill yourself”?PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Do you encourage users to use their real names, or does your community prefer anonymity? Can users share email addresses, phone numbers, and links to their profiles on other social networks? If your community is under-13 and in the US, you may be subject to COPPA.Different factors will determine your guidelines, but the most important things to consider are: The nature of your product. Is it a battle game? A forum to share family recipes? A messaging app?Your target demographic. Are users over or under 13? Are portions of the experience age-gated? Is it marketed towards adults-only?Once you’ve decided on community guidelines, you can start to build your moderation workflow. First, you’ll need to find the right software. There are plenty of content filters and moderation tools on the market, but in our experience, Community Sift is the best. A high-risk content detection system designed specifically for social products, Community Sift works alongside moderation teams to automatically identify threatening UGC in real time. It’s built to detect and block the worst of the worst (as defined by your community guidelines), so your users and moderators don’t ever have to see it. There’s no need to force your moderation team to review disturbing content that a computer algorithm can be trained to recognize in a fraction of a second. Community Sift also allows you to move content into queues for human review, and automate actions (like player bans) based on triggers. Once you’ve tuned the system to meet your community’s unique needs, you can create your workflows. You may want to pre-moderate some content, even with a content filter running in the background. If your product is targeted at under-13 users, as an added layer of human protection, you might pre-moderate anything that the filter doesn’t classify as high-risk. Or maybe you route all content flagged as high-risk (extreme bullying, hate speech, rape threats, etc) into queues for moderators to review. For older communities, you may not require any pre-moderation, and instead depend on user reports for any post-moderation work. With an automated content detection system in place, you give your moderators their time back to do the tough, human stuff, like dealing with calls for help and reviewing user reports. Another piece of the moderation puzzle is addressing negative user behavior. We recommend using automation, with the severity increasing with each offense. Techniques include warning users when they’ve posted high-risk content, and muting or banning their accounts for a short period. Users who persist can eventually lose their accounts. Again, the process and severity here will vary based on your product and demographic. The key is to have a consistent, well-thought-out process from the very beginning. You will also want to ensure that you have a straightforward and accessible process for users to report offensive behavior. Don’t bury the report option, and make sure that you provide a variety of report tags to select from, like bullying, hate speech, sharing PII, etc. This will make it much easier for your moderation team to prioritize which reports they review first. Ok, so moderation is a lot of work. It requires patience and dedication and a strong passion for community-building. But it doesn’t have to be hard, if you leverage the right tools and the right techniques. And it’s highly rewarding, in the end. After all, what’s better than shaping a positive, healthy, creative, and engaged community in your social product? It’s the ultimate goal, and ultimately, it’s an attainable one — when you do it right.",2021-03-06T19:14:54.618Z,"Does Quora unfairly moderate towards creating content that remains soft like a dough?

It explains that someone believes and goes some way to explaining why they don’t feel the need to have facts and proper arguments but it isn’t itself a good argument. The inevitable outcome of laying bare what I understand as “The Intellectual Bankruptcy of Religion” is for Quora to appear to be promoting atheism and hence biased against theists. It’s really just a level playing field in an argument the theists ought to have realised they can’t win. If they can’t play the religious faith card they’re done.

Some Christians think that atheists have no morals or just do “whatever they want”, or have no purpose in life or whatever. Also if you discuss questions that religion occupies itself with, you might be trying to discuss something in terms of science or reason and then a religious person will say that their religion tells us x or y and may even quote scripture at you. Which is usually entirely beside the point, because then we’re not really discussing the thing itself, but only someone’s religion and what it says about the thing, according to them — but we generally know that already.

It’s also important to know, going no one with a strong opinion is at the forum to cheer the moderators, and everyone who gets a post modified or deleted will feel wronged. If you do your job right as a moderator, however, you can encourage members to express their positions in a way that advances discussion. No, you won’t see people change their minds, but you can see some lively debate with good points made from more than one perspective. If you are asked to be a moderator by the site owner, be sure to discuss where the boundaries are. Some forums allow profanity or NSFW images, for example, while others do not. You want posts to stay on-topic, and you absolutely want to look out and respond to threats or personal attacks. It’s also important to understand that you will make mistakes. Here on Quora I have seen valid posts deleted because a moderator chose to remove them. My point there, is that moderators are human and trying to do the best they can - a deletion of a good post does mean the moderator is unfair or a bad moderator. Anyway, most forums are free and moderators are unpaid, so while people get angry out of proportion. As a moderator, you will hear a lot of emotional reaction, sometimes bitter abuse from members, when you take an action, even when you are right to delete a post or warn a member. You need to stay calm and just move on to the next decision. In the end, if you work as a content moderator, you are doing it for the community, not for fame, power or any tangible benefit. But helping a forum stay clean and produce a wide range of valid experience and perspectives is a good service to the community, and can make a good forum into a great one. I just get a job as content moderator for facebook and instagram, so I am still in training. Basically they told you that your job is to decide what kind of action should be taken for user report. Based on facebook and instagram policy, you have to choose whether to delete, ignore, mark as sensitive, escalate, etc, the reports for posts, photos, videos.",2021-03-06T19:39:51.069Z,"How do you become a content moderator?

6043db94ed76476feda36592,https://www.quora.com/Do-crossfit-box-owners-charge-their-trainers-to-wod?-,"I have founded two successful affiliates of over 200 members, one I sold for a 3x profit in just one years time. Prior to opening my first affiliate I built and sold a $3,000,000/year business where I learned all of the proper systems of good business,  which I turned around and applied to my first affiliate. I've also been a member of the Barbell Business Mastermind, which is a mastermind group of the top CF affiliate owner who get together and share best practices. My first box was a 5,000 square foot facility in Orange County, California called Bear Flag CrossFit  its still open and I believe it has about 200 members still. Me and my co-founder opened this box for about $34,000 with off-brand, no name equipment in 2012. At the time you could still grow your box on word of mouth alone so we only reinvested $500/mo in to marketing, mostly google ads. We grossed about $25,000/month in total revenue with about $12,000 in total costs after about a years time. My second box, CrossFit Black Storm in Phoenix, Arizona  is a 9,000 square foot premium facility we opened in 2014. To date we have spent almost $100,000 on this facility. It's completely filled with Rogue Fitness gear and competition level Weightlifting equipment, two rooms with two rigs and a lot of fun stuff. Times have changed, as the US market, Phoenix included has reached saturation for CrossFit gyms and other group training facilities. You have to be a savvy marketer, the same as any other business and it will also cost you more than in the good ol' days of 2010-2012. We are also seeing a higher turnover of new members as people have many more options than even in 2012.  Last month our total revenue was around $24,000 with total costs of around $15,000 as we are spending more on marketing and paying our staff much better than our previous facility. Now, the easy math sounds like I'm making $9k, but about 1/3 of that is going to paying off some of my original debt from bootstrapping the start-up phase with 0% credit.  What you also don't see is the 1.5-2 years of working 60+ hours a week being in the red, getting up at 5am to coach and being there to 8pm to coach all the classes and spending a lot of time in between refining our marketing campaigns. Only recently, after this past New Year ""bump"" did we break through in to profitable territory. Our goal is to reach 300 members, we are currently over 200 but still have a lot of our original members who pay less than half of our current membership rate which affects our revenue per member ratio. The economics of today's larger, successful facilities are much different than that of the tiny, grassroots boxes of a few years ago. I believe either extreme is the way to go, what I don't recommend is building something in the middle. Either go all out or go small. Right now we are actually seeing the market for new Crossfit gyms in the USA stabilize, and even some attrition.  Three boxes have closed up around us, all of them ""mid-sized"" boxes, where do all the members go? To either the smaller boxes or the larger premium boxes like mine. The middle will always get the squeeze, don't put yourself there. CrossFit isn't going anywhere, but it's reached mainstream and is probably on a long, steady decades long decline until the next generation decides what kind of training is their favorite.  I liken it to the growth of MMA gyms in the late 90's through early 2000's. When UFC was gaining traction at this time there were MMA gym's popping up on every corner, after about 5-7 years many were closing and what was left were either the top 10% of gyms and the bottom 10% of gym.  What I tell aspiring box owners now is that you shouldn't open a box for any other reason than it being your utmost passion as it's no longer ""easy money"", the getting is not as good as 2010/2011 when CrossFit (and other group fitness models) was scaling rapidly and the demand was higher than the supply of gyms. It's since leveled up and you're going to work as hard as you will starting any other type of business and the risk is just as great.  Most of the press you are seeing about the continued growth in the number of CrossFit facilities is actually due to international growth, they are about 2-3 years behind internationally and are now seeing the same growth curve that we had in the states from 2009-2012 and we will soon see more international boxes than in the USA but here in the states I believe we have reached saturation in most every major market aside from maybe third-tier cities. Though a bigger athlete may struggle with a speed event, body weight, or even a run, they can still do it. Whereas a smaller athlete may just be unable to complete a lift. It's an attempt at a balance of events but not all things are scaled equally.  CrossFit is about the fittest in the world but now it is about the fittest for your sex and age (they've introduced age dvisions). A good comparison would be martial arts where it was about who was the absolute best. Then they discovered they needed age and weight divisions. The compromise was then they allowed for an open division for all the divison winners to face off. Is the fittest in the world ideologically any different from the idea of best fighter in the world? And initially there were no weight divisons and the argument was the same. Small person could compensate for lack of size and strength with speed and agility. Then freaks came in who were big, strong, fast, agile, and technical. Then only people above a certain weight began to win and everyone began to bulk to be competitive.  Having known many CrossFit athletes and having done CF, I've heard people say they need to put on some more size to be competitive or say they are too small to compete. So people are already accounting for weight. CrossFit has actually always had a link with martial arts. In it's original location many of the participants were from Ralph Gracie BJJ and the videos were made by On The Mat. It's link was based on need of functional strength and variable demands of fighting. Many of the fight camp documentaries shows fighters at CrossFit. Many of the first CrossFit article writers came from BJJ. You can't search on Google for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu without CrossFit coming up.  And even the Jiu Jitsu purists had to accept weight divisons.  Yes basketball doesn't have weight divisons, but it's a team sport and it's about height more than size. So you rarely see players under 6'1. Or in football rarely people under 200lbs. If it's going to be a sport for giants like most major sports, then that's cool. But CrossFit was supposed to be about the fitness junkie not the bigger than life pro-athlete. Most major sports accepts that it's not for everyone and it's about specialized attributes. Which is how CrossFit tried to be different. A note about lifting and CrossFit. Yes CrossFit has lifting but also other events. But a competitor of Olympic style weightlifting will still be good at burpees, sprints, sled pulls, etc. That's why Crossfit uses it, it has a high transfer rate to other activities. So a big weightlifter will have an advantage in lifts but they won't suck at everything else either. They are still elite and multifunctional. Which is why weightlifting has weight divisions and so should CrossFit. This may sound counterproductive, but, no. A personal trainer can often be a head start to someone new to training. In these instances, the trainer should be educating the trainee to train themselves. As a trainer, I want clients to take an active role in their own fitness and work me out of the picture for the most part. Sometimes, an athlete needs help with a specific area and an objective set of eyes is a good idea. I see a trainer a few times a year just to have someone make sure I am not developing any bad habits with my form. Also, other trainers may have encountered things I have not. It is good to compare notes. Some people have a trainer because they are too busy for or uninterested in the research it takes to get the most out of exercise. I have a few clients who own businesses. They don’t want to research and write exercise programs. They just want to follow a script. It can be comforting, for some, to have an expert guiding you. Like I mentioned earlier, I do this myself sometimes. Some people have a trainer because it helps to motivate them. Accountability is motivating to some people. I want people to be fit, healthy and safe. I will take a different role depending on their goals and needs to get them there. That makes me helpful but not crucial.",2021-03-06T19:44:20.308Z,"Do crossfit box owners charge their trainers to wod? ",Quora

You have a seemingly balanced routine, and one could assume you are relatively fit. That is a good base. However I would suggest seriously working with some barbel movements and and building solid strength before attempting more complex cross-fit routines. Most (cross fit workouts) are based off of simple and complex body weight movements (think: squats, box jumps, pull ups), Kettlebell movements, olympic and power lifts (Power cleans, deadlifts, snatch, squats etc), battle rope exercises, and running. Modification comes in the complexity of the attempted movement, and the weights used. You can find many of these workouts online, by searching ‘WOD’ and ‘crossfit workouts’. Many cross fit communities are supportive of one another, and to a degree, exercises are able to be modified. Cross fit is, for many, a lifestyle; a lot of community is built within groups. I would guess that because they’ve opened a specific center, there will be at least a couple of a) highly devout enthusiasts (hunt down your local paleos’ -joke, but surprisingly common), ORb) instructors that you just haven’t met. Don’t be afraid to ask people for help. Jumping onto someones fitness lifestyle, many people will be happy to teach you the ways of what they love. (I wouldn’t love more than if someone came to me wanting to get stronger and lose weight rather than “tone up”- same goal; but entirely different approach, because of the mentality behind it.) If you cannot access a cross-fit specific coach, I recommend hitting up an experienced Personal Trainer, who can at least teach you proper form with the exercises, so as to avoid injury. THIS EXCLUDES OLYMPIC LIFTS: FIND SOMEONE SPECIFICALLY QUALIFIED/ EXPERIENCED IN THESE MOVEMENTS. Over all, cross-fit is a great way of getting high intensity, a** kicking workouts- in a fun and exciting training mode. It’s mentally and physically challenging, and trains majority of your athletic needs (strength, stamina, agility, coordination, power, speed). I recommend: but know what you’re getting into, and make sure you like it before you do! It depends on your meaning of “trainers”.

So the first thing to do if you want abs is get your nutrition on point to where you get your body fat levels to about 10% or less. You can check some of my other answers I've written how did do that many times. As far as actual training - most traditional ab exercises like crunches and sit-ups and whatnot are pretty much a waste of time. I think the best way to get a strong core is by doing heavy free weight multi joint compound barbell exercises without a belt. Like squats deadlifts power cleans overhead standing military press stuff like that. That places a much greater load on your core and forces much more muscle activation then any number of crunches ever could. Aside from that, the ab roller wheel is very effective. Be careful with that thing though start slow like two sets of 5 reps max. If you overdo it on one of those you'll feel like you tore something in your stomach .. and it will hurt for a week to laugh. The only drawback to the ab roller wheel is it can be hard on the elbows after a while so I'd recommend doing it no more than twice a week. you might eventually build up to where you're doing two to three sets of 10 to 12 reps but that would take some time. And lastly I like plank variations like side planks with one arm and one leg up in the air. In my opinion nothing will build a six-pack as well as your core better than planks. Simply get into the up position of a push-up and keeping your back flat, hold for as long as you can .. do this 5 or 10 times a day and in a short amount of time you will start to see a developed midsection. It is also worth noting that your six pack will not fully show unless your body fat is under 10%. To achieve this I recommend a low-carb diet.

Since you can't spot reduce or apply fatty tissue, we run into a problem. Most of the answers involve leg hypertrophy, but when I think of the ""perfect bum"" I hardly think lean, and muscular, with striations. In fact, if you really look at the bodies of those that devote their training to leg hypertrophy, like bodybuilders, they typically don't have the soft squishy cheeks you'd think of as bikini ready buns. Most bodybuilders have lean buns of steel, and a v shaped booty. Now, that isn't to say all the answers prescribing squats were wrong. They just left out a key detail. Diet. If you are already lean enough to have a flat booty, just doing leg work till you cannot walk will do little to make your butt more full. If anything it might make it flatter. You need to bulk. You need to be at a decent caloric surplus, so you can build up those muscles without losing any extra squish you Have, and perhaps even put on some. Genetics will play a big role too. People carry fat different places. Women with great butts carry what little body fat they have in their buns and thighs. Some people carry it all in their middle. Sucks for them. My point is, you have to add mass to change your natural shape. But adding that mass might cause weight gain in other areas. Your going to have to take time, cutting and bulking, to get where you want, and you will have to accept that you do have a ""shape"" that is influenced by your biology. You can morph it, but it takes work. Also, from a BB perspective; remember the general aesthetic lines people tend to desire. V shape torso. Full thighs and butt. It's important to remember the other muscles when building your physique. Quads, hamstrings, core, etc. So much of the time you can influence the look of any one area by bringing out the best of the surrounding areas. Good luck.

However, there are many different kinds of salt out there which don't have Sodium. One popular substitute is Potassium Cloride (KCl). It is atomically close to table salt which is actually Sodium Chloride (NaCl). You can actually find Potassium Chloride at supermarkets branded as ""No Salt"". You'll notice the taste is a little different but is an adequate substitute. ""It's absolutely not possible for you to completely cut out salt from your diet and still be alive"". This is because of the vital roles salt plays in your body. However, if you are looking to entirely go off of salts (Sodium chloride) in your diet probably because of high blood pressure, weight loss, Meniere's diseases, osteoporosis, stomach ulcer, or probably because you bloat at certain times of your menstrual cycle, I think you should first take a look into some of the benefits of salt to your health and then think twice before you take the decision.

Some importance of Salt to your health · It ensures the normal functioning of the heart · Help muscle contraction · Provides the body with a strong natural antihistamine · Helps absorption of nutrients through the intestinal tract and also in and out of the cell · Enhances communication and information processing in nerve cells · Helps to regulate sleep · Stops excess saliva production · Helps maintain libido.. and much more. So you can now see that it is not wise to completely remove salts from your diet; that is if it's possible anyway because almost all foods contain some portion of Sodium chloride in them. So even if you stop taking the normal table salt, Sodium Chloride is entering into your body through various other means. However, the most common and cheapest source of Sodium chloride is through our normal table salt while some sea foods are also rich in natural salts. How much should you consume? The recommended amount of salt you are required to take should not be more than 5gm per day (maximum) and 1.5gm at the minimum. At a biological/cellular level sodium is essential. Lack of salt causes more harm than excess salt (see chart below). If you don’t want to consume added salt, you need to consume food that is naturally high in salt. The only source I can think of is seafood (specifically from the ocean — not fresh water). Some native tribes would drink animal blood to get their salt intake up, when alternatives were not available. We are all alarmed about salt intake because of hypertension.

Perhaps the most important benefits during and after the active treatment stage can be seen in management of symptoms. Fatigue is the most common, and some patients will experience fatigue for years after treatment with radiation or chemotherapy. Exercise is a unique and proven way to combat cancer fatigue. Other symptoms are strongly associated with these treatments, such as digestive upset and insomnia, and still other symptoms can spring directly from the diagnosis, including emotional disturbance related to the stress of getting the bad news. Patients who exercise more have been shown to weather the stress and physical tribulations of diagnosis and treatment better than those living a sedentary lifestyle. These benefits, couple with better treatment efficacy and increased survivor ship, have led researchers to suggest every patient participate in some level of fitness program. Responsible Use of Exercise: The options for exercise are too numerous to catalog here, yet people often imagine a gym with treadmills, cycles, and weight benches. Unfortunately, cancer patients are generally at higher risk of infections and should avoid public gyms. Specific forms of cancer and treatment will have their own restrictions, such as: Those receiving radiation therapy often have increased skin sensitivity to chlorine and should avoid chlorinated pools.Bone cancer patients may need to avoid high-impact exercises to reduce the risk of fracture, yet they will still need some weight-bearing exercises to prevent further bone loss.Elderly patients will need to consult with all their doctors to choose exercises in light of other health conditions.Post-op patients will need to follow specific exercise routines designed to enhance recovery from surgery.As a general rule, starting a program off safely means starting slowly. Over-exertion is the leading cause of exercise injuries, and it can slow recovery. The basics of safely exercising include other precautions too, such as eating well and staying hydrated, and a fitness expert or personal trainer can help in learning these. Establishing and Maintaining a Regular Program: One thing that makes it difficult for researchers to study the effects of exercise on aspects of cancer treatment is patient drop-outs. The combination of fatigue and nausea cause many to stop exercising before the effects in symptom reduction can be seen. There are several tactics to avoid an early demise of fitness efforts. The most important of these is to make the exercise enjoyable. It should consist of several aerobic and weight-bearing activities alternated throughout the week. The activities should be things the patient enjoys doing. Activities that can be shared with friends or family will also increase motivation. A patient undergoing mesothelioma treatment may strive toward taking short walks with family members, while someone with prostate cancer may strive toward jogging with close friends. Regardless of the routine chosen, the benefits of exercise are available for every cancer patient. Yes, it does. We all know the importance of exercise for the overall growth our body.

The industrialized world has loaded the environment with potent cancer triggers. If the genetic disposition of your immune system makes it susceptible, you could get a cancer in a part of the world (or town) where a particular trigger is present at a critical level. But if you are removed from that area before that happens OR you are living in a less polluted part of the world (or town) to begin with, you will never need to know that your body is actually not as able to defend itself against a particular cancer as someone else’s. Much is made of a gene in women linked to breast cancer. Women that find this gene in their DNA profile sometimes pre-emptively remove both breasts! A better idea would be to move to China! For all its environmental issues, Breast Cancer in particular is still virtually unknown in China (and other places). Deliberate hyperbole to make a point. Exercise can help avoid cancer because exercise can help a person lose weight. Excess fat on a body stores calories but also toxins. These toxins are what can cause cancer in the susceptible. The less excess fat you hold onto, the less the amount of these toxins in close dwell to your fast dividing stem cells. So absolutely, exercise and follow what is known to be a healthy lifestyle. However, if close family relations are all getting a particular cancer, MOVE! That is what you are being told. Move, and become an assiduous follower of excellent health practices.

I wasn’t all that active before joining my box. They told me I wouldn’t be lifting anything heavy for 3–4 months, and instead I’d be learning the proper techniques on each movement. That paid off a lot and helped me avoid getting injured. You don’t want to get hurt and take time off, putting aside all of your momentum.You will not lose weight for the first 6–8 weeks. When I first started going 3x a week, I was ready for the pounds to fall off. Not so fast. From what I’ve read, you are adding muscle and bone density early on, as your body reacts to this new intense activity. I lost nothing in those first 6 weeks and nearly gave up thinking it wouldn’t work. It was shortly after that point that the weight started to come off for me.Don’t be discouraged. Other people in the class are going to run circles around you in the beginning. You will be the last place finisher every class. People much smaller than you will be lifting a lot more weight than you. It’s OK. Don’t give up. Just keep moving, and eventually you’ll see yourself improve in all of those areas.Nutrition matters. 80% of your success is what you eat. I’m trying to lose a lot of weight, and it took me a while to find the right amount and right kinds of food that allow me to lose weight, and still allow me to have enough calories and nutrition to get through the workouts.

Also, tons and tons of videos (to be fair not all of them are actually crossfit) that look like this:  If you’re asking why people who have tried it don’t do it, then I can tell you it all depends on their personal experiences. I initially tried CrossFit during a summer where I was just doing every sport/fitness-related groupon within a ten mile radius. While I did get results in the two months my groupon provided, I wouldn’t go back there ever again, and can tell you that a huge factor as to why is how the gym is run.  Here are some reasons my friends and I decided not to continue after the groupon expired: The people around us were 90% assholes, like a big clique. They were unwelcoming and unwilling to help us when we asked questions.The place itself was filthy. We started calling the burpees “herpes” instead, if we had to touch the ground our hands would come back black and covered in filth, and even tiny bits of glass and sand.The coaches were incredibly lackluster and cocky. Except for the owner, the coaches weren’t particularly impressive in their form, ability, or hygiene; yet they strutted around like peacocks.My friends and I were all new to any kind of weight training (and had informed them of this) and they were still pushing us to do complicated lifts at more weight than we were comfortable with. “Don’t do bitch weight” if I attempted to scale a snatch (which I had done basically never) to a few pounds less than what was on the board.The programming was a randomized mess, subject to the coaches’ whims.So, all-in-all, it was a shitty experience I will remember for the rest of my life. I don’t want to be unfair to crossfit as a whole, because I know they attempt to do quality control and do disallow gyms from using their name if warranted. Also, before anyone bites my head off, I did end up trying other crossfit gyms and I actually liked all of them. I would even recommend them to people for general fitness. The most important thing I took away from the experience was: make certain to check reviews extensively and/or got recommendations from people I trust before buying groupons.

I was/am a specialist, so that right there struck Crossfit off the list as they explicitly stated “we aren’t specialists.” But I kept an open mind as the claim by Dave Castro was: ""They're all going to have 300-lb. snatches, they're all going to have 600-lb. deadlifts, they're all going to run sub-5 (minute) miles, they're all going to have sub-2:15 Frans."" (Dave Castro, on the future of CrossFit Games athletes). 2. I looked at a breakdown of Greg Amundson doing “Fran” (workout comprising 21-15-9 of thrusters and pullups). I thought this article was actually really good in that Crossfit was using a very objective approach to measure performance. The stumbling block was that the numbers shown were 253-338 ft-lbs/sec, translating to .46-.61 horsepower, which was about 343-455 watts over a duration of under 4 minutes, some under 3 minutes. While this is impressive and I take nothing away from Greg as an athlete, I was producing wattages of 450+ for 5-6 minutes as a cyclist (NOTE: I’m entirely willing to entertain flaws in my methodology for comparing a whole body exercise to lower leg only exercise). 3. Point #2 was doubled down when I read a Crossfit article addressing rhabdomyolysis. Greg Glassman states, “Elite CrossFitters are performing 18,000 foot-pounds of work per minute for three or four minutes (that’s nearly half of one horsepower!). This is what our top tier athletes are doing in workouts like “Fran.” Without deliberately training for maximum expression of effective work against a wide-ranging time domain, it is virtually impossible to deliver power output as high as our athletes do.” a. 18,000 ft-lbs/min=300 ft-lbs/sec-> mid range of numbers from #2 4. Then there was Crossfit Endurance which I was really interested in because maybe this had the specialist twist that I was seeking. However, I couldn’t get a clear answer on how as a cyclist I would be programmed for 3 CFE workouts in a week, but a triathlete would be programmed for 6 CFE workouts in a week. The forums were no help in clarifying the discrepancy since as near as I could humbly figure, a workout is a workout so that meant I was going to get ½ the stimulus that a triathlete would…(NOTE: again, I’m all ears for sound methodology and reasoning that explains where/how I went wrong in my conclusions). I will concede the mass appeal that Crossfit has had and the ability to get people motivated and exercising regularly, kudos to that! Just doesn't appear to currently be the right blend for me.",2021-03-06T19:57:28.218Z,"Why don’t people Crossfit? ",Quora

These people would be some of the top Crossfit competitors at each of their respective gyms.  (And yes, those women are competitors, too, they aren't just up there with their boyfriends.)  Being a top competitor at a Crossfit gym is pretty impressive, and only happens for people who push themselves pretty hard, and who usually do Crossfit at least 5-6 times a week.  To me they look pretty fit and toned, but not bulky:     Most regular Crossfitters look very fit, but they don't look bulky like bodybuilders.  That's because all-around fitness doesn't require bulk, and neither does strength. This is Rich Froning, the top male Crossfitter in the world, in his top form competing at the Games.  He earned the title of ""Fittest Man on Earth"" at the Crossfit Games for 3 consecutive years, including 2014.  You might call him somewhat bulky, but keep in mind that he does up to three intense workouts per day to get to that point, and (hundreds of?) thousands of men around the world worked their butts off all year hoping to beat him, but couldn't.     This is Camille Leblanc-Bazinet, the top female Crossfitter in the world, who won the title ""Fittest Woman on Earth"" at the 2014 Crossfit Games.  This is what she looks like in a casual setting:     This is what she looked like in her peak form at the 2014 Crossfit Games:    She recently also qualified to compete at the Olympics in weightlifting.  (In the above photo, she isn't lifting heavy, she's doing some kind of repetitive lift as part of a multiple-movement workout.  That was probably the 60 clean and jerks at 95lb (for women) they had to do at the end, just before she was announced the winner.  They do about 3 of these usually-varied-move workouts per day for a week in the Crossfit Games.)  These are some of the other top female Crossfitters in the world, in their top form at the Crossfit Games:      Note that if any of them gained 5 lb of body fat, they would still look slim but significantly less muscular.  You have to have pretty low body fat for muscles to show up like that.  I know a female Crossfit coach who is very strong and can squat 300 lb, but because she is just a bit overweight, you can't even see her muscles and would never guess by looking at her how strong she is. If you're female, your chances of getting bulky are pretty slim.  Female bodybuilders get a little bit bulky, but that's their entire goal - to get as bulky as possible.  That's what body building is all about - getting as bulky and as defined as possible.  It's no accident for them.  And as far as I'm aware, steroids are pretty common and accepted in body-building, so there's a good chance their bulk comes mostly from the steroids.  *However*, there may be many who manage it without steroids, I don't mean that as a blanket accusation for those who don't. But Crossfitters in general look more toned and muscular than bulky, and it certainly won't happen by accident.  Thanks for the A2A, Kelvin!

Define Your Target AudienceFor any influencer campaign to be successful you first need to know who you are trying to influence. It helps to be specific. The tighter you can define your target audience, the easier it is to find influencers who are relevant.  The worst kind of answer is to try and target everybody. Even producers of everyday commodity products, such as bread and toilet paper, try to differentiate their marketing. That is why they create ranges, focusing on different niches, e.g. a range targeting people who favor quality, versus a range for the budget conscious. Set ObjectivesBefore you can create an influencer marketing strategy you first need to determine what you are trying to achieve. Your aim may be something small like gaining a set number of extra visitors to your website, with them signing up for a newsletter. Alternatively, you might choose to engage in influencer marketing with the aim of increasing sales of a particular product by a certain percentage.  It is impossible for you to measure whether a campaign is successful or not if you haven’t set any objectives. The measurement of your ROI at the end of the campaign depends on how you have performed in relation to your initial objective. Discover the Most Appropriate InfluencersThe whole reason that businesses undertake influencer marketing is to widen the reach of content relating to their product or service. For years businesses created advertisements promoting their products. But the problem is that people can now see right through ads. Ads are self-serving. By definition, an ad simply tells the consumer why a business thinks they should buy a product. An advertisement for a dysfunctional product is likely to still promote it as being good for the consumer.  Consumers instead rely on influencers for their recommendations. We have covered this extensively on the Influencer Marketing Hub, for example in Why Influencer Marketing is the New Content King. The influencers provide the trust and authenticity that are necessary for consumers to believe in a product enough to take a risk on buying it.  To help you do this you should answer the following questions about your niche: Where do the online conversations about your niche take place? How social are the key participants in the niche?What motivates people in your niche to promote relevant contentIs activity concentrated in a particular place, e.g. on Facebook or on a respected blog, or is the niche more fragmented?Who are the people that most often write or create other content about your topic?What is the background of these people?The more you know about your niche and target audience, the easier the task you will have finding the best possible influencers.

I don't think anybody hates Crossfit, I and a lot of others just think it is not optimal in a number of ways. It is funny to haze them a bit, of that I am guilty! But in the end doing a workout which is kind of a mash up is better than doing nothing I guess. But let's see some actual critisism: Too each their own. Every sport will award you by making you better in some aspects. If you want to train for military like stuff than Crossfitt is superb. If you want to build a great looking body and be fit though, there are other better and faster ways to achieve this. Also a lot safer.Safety. A lot of those lifts aren't ment to be done for high reps. Nice example, front squats. They shouldn't be done for more than 10reps. Why? Because your rhomboids aren't an endurance muscle, which means they will give out before your legs do. Which in turn will cause the chest to drop compromising the thoracic portion of the spine.When you try to do multiple things at once, you end up compromising each aspect. There is an optimal workout duration. The optimal duration is actually an ongoing debate but most agree it is somewhere between 45min and 1 hour something. It is not smart to do both, aerobic and anaerobic work in one workout. First, it is better to have anaerobic and aerobic training sessions separate. This way, you can do one hour of weights, and after 8 hours or at the days you don't lift you can do a 45 min cardio session. This way, the cardio session actually helps you recuperate faster from your weight (or bodyweight) exercises. The crossfit way, you either go overboard and do more than an hour, or you compromise both workouts by nit working each the maximal time possible. Cardio before, after and during is detrimental to building muscle and strength! And functionality my a**, if you can deadlift 2x your bodyweight and more and are not among those who think Cardio is a spanish guy, you are going to be functional as f**k.Speaking of deadlifts, which by the way are also not meant to be high rep exercises. When you do deadlifts and then the next exercise is sprinting … What do you think is upholding your spine ? The errector spinae muscles! Which are toast because you exhausted them doing deadlifts…. The P.T guys are rubbing their hands just seeing stuff like this.Questionable technique. You can work in any random box, most are employing rubbish technique and nobody bats an eye. Squats with knees coming in, rounded backs at almost everything and don't get me started on that cheap excuse of a pullup….. I don't care if there is a time limit, just stop cheating with your legs.The rep ranges are wrong to build muscle. If endurance sports would yield us muscle, marathon runners would be all walking around with Tom Platz caliber legs. They look the opposite of that and there is a good reason for that. You need to lift above 70% of your 1RM, which in english means you need to lift less than 12 reps to build muscle or strength. If you din't care about either, then again you would be better of with another aport than crossfit, something like hiking, long distance running or triathlons etcThe cult like mentality. I am not sure if I am more annoyed by Vegans or Crossfitters. With both it is similar. It is the fact that a person is trying to teach/ preach you things which you know they aren't doing optimally. When they don't try to preach I have 0 problems.The obvious steroid abuse. It is not fair. Everybody looks at a bodybuilder, strongman and powerlifter and screams steroids. But when the crossfit champions look like they just robbed a bulgarian pharmacy suddenly nobody cares. Of course dude so and so is so big, he runs! Omfg…Those are possible reasons that come to mind why people might prefer other sports. Plus, functionality is pretty much a myth. You can train with a more classical approach and achieve better results in everything, looks, strength, mobility and endurance. But I can understand the appeal of the do a little of everything in a short amount of time thing. As well as the team aspect of it. People are social animals, it is easier doing something in a group. All in all, I guess it depends on the owner of the box. I know an ex-weightlifter who does actually a pretty solid job with his trainees, so , if I know one, there are surely more good trainers out there, but the bad ones outnumber them by a lot!!! But this bad trainer phenomenom is I guess a pest in all sports which involve heavy metal. So, to conclude. If you care about being functional in order to excel in some sport , olympic weightlifting is your go to. If you want to be just strong af, powerlifting and strongman are your solution. If you want to look great naked, bodybuilding and or calisthenics is the solution with 2 times 4–5 weeks of strength training mixed over for the duration of a year. Others like olympic style gymnast and ring training will also do . Wrestling to some extend . If you want to be freakishly big and people wonder wtf? Then there is a solution for that, but is not worth it, so I am not going to mention it. ( Hint, it is the one which causes hair fall and erectile dysfuntions together with shrinking balls…) If you want to be a great soldier, well, crossfit would help, but my money is on the triathlon guys and the marathon runner / soccer types. So, for each goal there is an optimal path. I am not sure if BB trainers care how anyone else training.

Crossfit is a combination of few sporting and gaming activities, combined into a new sport entertainment phenomenon called CrossFit. Crossfit is not in the Olympics. Bodybuilding is one third of iron games, the other 2 are the Sport of Powerlifting and the sport of Olympic weightlifting. The last one is a staple in Olympic competition. Bodybuilding has been around in USA, starting back in the 70s as i remember. Back then it was the new sporting phenomenon and it was natural not yet infested with drug use. Crossfitters are not immune to drug use either but generally speaking there are random drug tests in the crossfit sport. There is no accountability with BB. Professional Bodybuilding is mostly about drug therapy. Most people do notice the signature physique of advanced crossfitters. The crossfitter physique is nothing like a bodybuilder. You can tell immediately the difference. Bodybuilding vs crossfit.  As an older weightlifting trainer, over the years, i have noticed the rise of natural bodybuilding leading to professional BB and then professional female BB. Recently we are all noticing the fall of female professional Bodybuilding . My guess is next is gradual fall of professional bodybuilding for the men. The truth is a large crowds of new “ fitness trainers “ are not interested in BB anymore. The” look “is no longer appealing as the health related and long term effects are not very popular with more educated young athletes joing the fitness fever. The “ Arnold effect “ is fading away.  In my state there are now more CrossFit boxes ever. Every one of them attracting younger folks that do pursue crossfit.   Popularity of BB is slipping. With that goes money and business and that is not going to make BB thrive. I don't think the individual bodybuilder hate crossfitters, that is silly, but the 2 are on path for collision at some point. I know CF trainers that mix with some BB routines and i know few natural ( mostly) BB trainers that play the CrossFit games occasionally. Powerlifter trainers are just standing around and still thinking about it. Lol. The olympic weightlifting trainers are super happy with the rise of Crossfit because CrossFit is promoting olympic lifts!. Awesone. For now CrossFit is getting plenty of attention. I am personally all for it simply because CrossFit puts olympic weightlifting [ my sport) on the spotlight in USA and around the globe. As a Crossfitter, if you can't snatch and clean and Jerk, you should learn it. There is no way around this. You must master powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting movements before i take you crossfitters serious. By the way, big bulky bloated professional Bodybuilder will not make it in the sport of CrossFit. i don't mean to be mean… They are too big and posses not the optimal physical mobility that CrossFit demands. I don't mean to be rude. Professional BB may be strong, but lacks explosive power and agility. Light heavyweight powerlifting trainers with lean body mass are the best candidates to train crossfit. There are very strong bodybuilders out there, no questions on that, but theses trainers only train for mass not for true athleticism. i don't mean to be rude. The idea of explosive movements is diametrically opposite of bodybuilding slow methodically pumping bodyparts and isolation exercises. 2 different worlds. Anyhow, Kudos to CrossFit and Kudos to Natural Bodybuilding and powerlifting. CrossFit - Wikipedia Criticizing or disliking something doesn't mean hating.

But what differs them all is the end result in competition, bodybuilders try to look certain way, weightlifters/Powerlifters try to lift certain weight etc. Crossfit competitions need their participants to be good in many variations of functional/loaded movements that can include basic weightlifting, powerlifting, gymnastic movements etc. That's why crossfitters need to practice and master many movements as well as improve endurance like running, rowing, cycling etc. Bad form - not all crossfitters have bad form and not all bodybuiders have best form. It's just mindset. I can criticize bodybuilding competitions for using tanning to make body look leaner and muscular but it's mandatory in bodybuilding competitions. Even body builders are not healthy when competing. They are highly dehydrated and starved for several days just to look certain way on stage. In the end Who wins bodybuilding competition- who has most balanced muscular physique or who lifts heaviest weight with good form ? Similar in crossfit, the focus is on performing best in your criteria, if bad form is allowed then it's ok in their competition. Otherwise same crossfitters try to learn and practice best technique in their training, their form breaks down mainly in competition while trying their best and winning anyhow. So it's just perspective, nobody hating no one only for practicing what they like and not hurting others in process.",2021-03-06T20:07:31.781Z,"What is crossfitting and why do bodybuilders hate crossfitters?

The majority of our time was spent learning good form while performing each task. We chose our own limits and also when and how to surpass them. The furious ass-kicking portion of each class was exhausting, embarrassing and extremely satisfying. I truly loved to dread going and hating the beginning of each Crossfit class 110%. I proved to myself that anxiety didn't always have me by the throat but even when it did, my love for hating Crossfit got me over the hump and out of the house. The learning part of class kept me in the moment and out of the muddy, mental trench that I wallowed in alllll day at home. My complete inability to perform some of the tasks showed me and everyone else that I'm not all that and a bag of chips and it stoked that burning hate that I loved to feel for the whole process. The millions of squats, burpees, push ups, sit ups, rows, clearing (or whatever they called the barbell stuff) running and jump roping we did got easier and I felt noticeably stronger and healthier than I'd felt in years. The class ended and I was so relieved. I promised myself I'd never pay for that torture again. I loved my stronger self. The ease of climbing the apartment stairs was the best part. It wasn't just the physical ease. Climbing the stairs without dying and gasping for air showed my brain that maybe the outside world is less exhausting and more inviting than I was telling myself previously. ☺ The entire process, from paying a ton of money to join to laying on my bed, exhausted and sore after the last class, made me realize that class was the best stupid decision I had ever been happy and proud to have made. I felt alive for those 6 weeks. CrossFit has many benefits. Some may argue that it is not a sport per se or that it has no value or any negative argument.

Most personal trainers are doing CrossFit like training (boot-camp or whatever they name that). After a few months of CrossFit, you’ll be globally better at everything without really noticing. Combined with a good diet, you’ll get a lot of fat out of your body. The real problem is to find a decent box in your area. I’ve tried several boxes and not all of them are good. It depends on the trainers and the atmosphere of the box. Some workout can be dangerous for you if not done properly or if you have injuries/aches (back, shoulder, …). A good trainer will take that in account. I saw trainers ignoring the fact that one person had a back surgery a few months ago (in a group of 5 persons) and force that same person to do exercise that could really hurt or damage his back again. Another example, a complete beginner cannot do a dead lift properly (correct posture or adequate weight) and some trainers ignore that fact (it’s just one workout, it could have been dumbbell snatch or kettle bell swing). First & foremost, regardless of the exercise program you follow, nutrition will have a greater effect on your health than exercise. It is true that together they are most impactful, but pursuing exercise without adapting nutrition will not yield the best results.

Basically, making sure the product works and is innovated as time goes on.Now, consider that in an early stage startup, the only thing that matters is gaining traction. The product will have a major role to play in this, with revenue streams supporting it. It won’t be enough if you have one without the other. For most early stage startups, the CEO will fill the role of Chief Revenue Officer, and probably also Chief Product Officer. As the company grows, however, it’ll become more difficult for the CEO to keep their focus on both, and they will have to start delegating. Depending on their strengths, it then makes sense for the CEO to rely on a: CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) to take responsibility for the overall marketing strategy and aCPO (Chief Product Officer) to carry the product forward.Even then, a Chief Revenue Officer is unlikely to be a necessity. It’s usually enough if the CMO implements a revenue marketing strategy. If this is done well, there’s no need for a CRO in the company. Revenue marketing aligns sales and marketing around a common goal—revenue generation. As the company scales up further, it may reach a point where someone needs to take on the responsibility of overseeing all revenue-related activity from a high-level point of view. There are two key signs[3]that a startup should consider hiring a CRO: Implementing revenue marketing with the Head of Sales and Head of Marketing has failed and you need to shake up the status quo.You need a solutions-oriented leader to spearhead the creation of new revenue streams.Footnotes[1] Chief revenue officer - Wikipedia[2] Chief product officer - Wikipedia[3] Chief Revenue Officer: What does a CRO do? - Outfunnel",2021-03-06T20:10:18.835Z,"Are Chief Revenue Officer and Developer Evangelist redundant positions?

6043e279ed76476feda37060,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-best-game-developer-evangelists-for-new-or-existing-game-platforms?-,"For an individual--that is, a developer working for a game company--it's not lucrative. The median salary is in the $50-60K range, which is lower than the median for software developers in general (around $80-90K). For a game company, the profits/losses vary wildly across companies and across time. But in general, game companies follow a power law curve distribution: that is, the vast majority of profits go to a small number of companies. If you're an owner of a company that's currently on top, it is wildly lucrative (just ask Mark Pincus). Everyone else struggles and usually folds or sells out. Why is that? Video games (like many other kinds of media) have two interesting properties:  They have the potential (but not the certainty) of mass-appeal, meaning that some games are enjoyable by very large populations (e.g., Angry Birds or even Call of Duty).Their marginal cost of production is nearly zero. That means that once you develop the game, producing an extra unit costs almost nothing (just the cost to stamp a disk or the server bandwidth to deliver it).These two properties easily explain the power law distribution. Only a few games have mass-appeal, but those that do earn substantial profits because the marginal cost is so low. This also explains why so many companies enter the market even though they know most companies fail. The fact is nobody can accurately predict that a game will have mass appeal. Just as hundreds of people land at LAX every week thinking they can be a star, hundreds of companies start up thinking they can be just like Zynga or Rovio. The Apple app store is filled with them. Given all this, what's the best strategy for developing a lucrative game? The potential revenue from a game is proportional to two values: the size of the community that likes the game, and the length of time the average person plays the game (over their lifetime). You can categorize games by where they fall on those two axes:  Casual games have giant communities but they burn out quickly. Once you've played Angry Birds for a month you're probably done for the rest of your life.Hardcore games (like Call of Duty) have smaller (but still large) communities but tend to last a while (usually until the sequel).Evergreen games (like World of Warcraft or EVE Online) have small (or even niche) communities but long-playing customers (willing to pay a monthly subscription).[1]Each of these categories has a viable strategy for success: CASUALFor casual games, the key is mass appeal. But since you can't predict which games will have mass appeal, you just have to create lots of games and double-down on the ones that succeed. I think this strategy works for large companies (like Zynga and Rovio) who can afford to produce lots of (relatively cheap) games. But for an indie studio, you would need enough funding to survive for three or four games. Most indies don't have the money for this. HARDCOREFor hardcore games, you need to appeal to lots of people with cutting-edge graphics but still have enough depth and complexity that keeps people interested. These games are generally expensive to make, which means there is a lot of reliance on sequels. Indie studios can compete here but to a lesser degree: their production values will never be as good (which decreases the size of the community) but they can still draw people in with deep and interesting gameplay (the resurgent roguelikes genre is an example). EVERGREENFor evergreen games the community is at least as important as the game itself. People continue in World of Warcraft because they like the people they're playing with. These kinds of games are tricky to develop because you're constantly creating new content (to keep people interested). In some cases you are also hosting server infrastructure, which increases marginal costs. But the advantage of evergreen games is that your revenue is more predictable and less subject to the boom-bust cycle of hit games. Indie studios can definitely play a role here (This is roughly where I'm heading). In a way, you can think of each of these categories as different points on the risk-reward spectrum. Casual games are hugely risky--most casual games fail. But they are cheap to create and can have massive rewards. Hardcore games are expensive to create, but they can be less risky. The next installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise is sure to make money. Evergreen games take a lot of time and effort to build the community, but once you've got the community, it is easier to keep it engaged. Profits will not be astronomical, but they'll be consistent.[2] -------------[1] Daniel Cook describes evergreen games on his blog (and this is where I first heard it): A single game as a lifelong hobby [2] There is one other strategy that works: selling development tools and services to game studios. Just as arms merchants can profit from war, you can always sell dev frameworks and other tools to game studios--even to (or especially to) the ones that will ultimately fold. Let me start off by saying I hate Git. I dislike having to resort to command line anytime something gets even moderately complex. If I have to take my tools to the command line then there is something seriously wrong with the toolset. So lets dig in to the whys. First Git historically had issues with large binary files - as known as art assets. Games have 10s to 100s of gigs of these so optimizing for that is important. This is less of a thing now but still a thing. History and blame tool is a bigger issue - its harder to see how the contents of a file has changed from the first checkin to the last - say 5 years and 1000 checkins. Perforce just lets you scrub the timeline and walk the file in GUI format with all the revision changes per line number shown. That is a tool that I use weekly and frequently daily when I’m doing a refactor or trying to understand the changing flow control of a project. For me, the biggest issue is work style. My desired work style is to have 40–50 CLs on my machine where I’m actively running all these little (to not so little) changes while able to check in some CL. For instance, I might be baking a long term AI improvement set, 3–4 texture compression changes, 10 different CLs for various UI screens but I’m actively working on something in the build system. Git people would say you need to create a new branch for each of these and they each play in their own sandbox. And that is great for somethings but not as great when you are trying to soak longer term stuff. Its a style tradeoff and not everyone works that way. One of the Git pitfalls (again, its not a tech issue but how people use the tech) is that you end up with 100s of branches and a very inconsistent discussion of done. Especially when you’ve got build tools building off anything that isn’t origin/master. I frequently run into issues where the combination of branches I need for a certain feature don’t work together because of the fragmented ownership style encouraged by Git. I find Git clunky and old. For the easiest cases, perforce requires far less effort to get things done. Git really shines in the ugly cases but if you are running into the ugly cases where command line fu is needed then you are already doing it wrong. As Jeff already said forums (I personally would use GameJolt Forums which have collaboration, business and jobs sections, so you can use them). There are also web sites like Teamups and Teamstarter. It’s good to use them in combinations with forums, so try making a teamup on Teamups or project on Teamstarter and then make post on several forums (more is better than less here) with link to Teamups/Teamstarter page. Describe: which games would you like to make (platformers, MMORPG, small games, complex games…)what would you do in game development process (programming, level design, art, music…)how good are you (years of experience, your projects, your education degree…)who are you looking for (musicians, artists, game adviser, level designer, programmer…) andwhat will they get (part of games income, credits in games, sausages…)It’s good idea to show describe first game you would want to make because they can see how good/bad your game ideas are (if you have no idea or if you are looking for idea guy you shouldn’t make this part) It’s also good idea to write will you make 2D or 3D games or it’s irrelevant. I can’t guarantee that you will find good game developers, but you will find someone!",2021-03-06T20:13:45.638Z,"Who are the best game developer evangelists for new or existing game platforms?

Developers don't keep normal hours, nor should youDeveloper relations is not a 9-5 job, you need to monitor email, Facebook, Stack Overflow, Quora, Twitter etc constantly to stay on top of issues/requests/discussions. Travel and time commitmentsThis is best and the worst part of a developer relations job, travel. On the upside you are paid to go to places that you might not be able to (San Francisco and  India are two standout trips for me). However layovers, 'table for one' etc soon lose their charm.You do learn tips and tricks for getting through security as quickly as possible! Developers have jobs which means that any events tend to take place during evenings or weekends. Again being paid to go to events to learn and talk technology is a great problem to have but it can take a toll on your social life. Time managementDull but important, you need to be pretty good at planing and scheduling for meetings and events, you only get one first impression. CommunicationThis is the big one, you need to be able to impart your enthusiasm, ideas and product to an audience. Speaking on stage can be scary (oddly enough I find it scarier to speak to 10 people than 600, go figure!), and practice is the only way to get better (tip if you have to read your presentation on stage you're doing it wrong).   Remember your target audience! If you're speaking to a non technical CEO don't waste time talking about the technology, find out what their problems are and talk about how your product can help them. Conversely if you're talking to a room of developers don't use PowerPoint or talk about ARPU (average revenue per user)! Sometimes you may only have 30 seconds to get your point across. Try practicing an elevator pitch of 30 seconds, 1 minute and 5 minutes to see how they feel and then do them again and again and again. Friends and family are the best guinea pigs, especially if they are not technical. If you can get your granddad to understand what your product is then you're well on your way to success. If you still struggle on stage don't worry, try and find a local acting or public speaking class, or failing that ask someone you've seen talk and pick their brains on how they handle presenting. PatienceYou will meet with developer with all different levels of skills, both social and technical, be patient with them. Surprise peopleThe best evangelist for your product is not you, its your developer. A happy developer will actively talk about your product and how its helped them. Make sure that you help as much as you can, visit them on site if possible to fix something or create something fun that developers can play with. Mobile workingIf you are used to working in an office, then you're in for a surprise! Your bag is your office now, make sure it has everything you need, here's my list:  Decent messenger bag or backpack that is waterproof (or at least water resistant) -  I recommend Crumpler, you can't risk your laptop getting wet.Pens & paper - quick notes or for sketching out hack ideas (YMMV)Laptop with a decent battery (two if you are heading to a big event)Charging cables for major phones - you will be using your phone a hell of a lot, so have these hand, having other cables is useful if someone you are demoing to is running low on charge.Screen wipes - no one wants to view a demo on a greasy screenTravel sized toothbrush, toothpaste - a godsend at overnight hacksEye mask - sleep where and when you can, I grabbed two of these from an overnight flight and never leave home without themBusiness cards - I use Moo as they take up less spaceSwag - stickers, badges etcNetworkingAh the great Satan of geekdom, networking! It just feels so *marketing* but its something you need to get comfortable with. Often you will be on your own at an event, which means you need to get comfortable walking up to someone and starting a conversation. Have no fear, as everyone is in the same boat and they won't bite your head off! Get stuck in! LearningDon't stop. Having been on the other end of Dev Evangelists, here is what I like:  A clear description and demonstration of the value add for their product. It's often hard with open API products to understand exactly what the product is supposed to do. I want a very clear, easy to understand from both a technology point of view and business point of view document. I need technology for me, and business so I can justify any spend associated with my use of the product.Demonstration programs online that I can show without having to explain too much. Again: I have to justify a spend, I need to be able to show something off without spending any time to make something myself.Clear documentation that covers both technology and use-cases. The best documentation I've seen for API centric startups not only explain the API, but also show use cases that would be associated with use of the API. Development Evangelists should collect user stories from the community, and make these use case demonstrations conform to the ones that they think would result in the most return on investment should the owner of the user story hop on board. Hey Zeno, this is a tough question but I do have an answer for you! I recently spoke at DevXCon about this very subject - as the DevRel space is new there are a lot of people seeking to understand what success looks like there. In a nutshell, you want to be measuring increased usage of your products as well as engagement. Specifically, engagement would be unique visitors on your developer portal (as well as returning visitors!), social engagement (Facebook likes/posts, LinkedIn article views, etc.), and event attendance. On product usage, you would want to see increasing API usage, new sign-ups, referrals, etc. For even more than the metrics above, you can watch the presentation from DevXCon (video here and slides here) and my in-person interview here. Hope you choose to engage with us at the above links - we love to help out developer relations folks get up and running and make them rock stars!

As Donald Whitney has said, Only the sheer rapture of being lost in the worship of God is as exhilarating and intoxicating as telling someone about Jesus Christ. But how can we do this? It takes three things! You need to know the Gospel message intellectually.You must develop the interpersonal skills to share the Gospel.And you must know the basics of how to defend the Gospel message.Let’s go over each of these. Step 1: Know the Gospel The Gospel message has four parts to it: Original Good News: God created us to know, love, and glorify Him.Bad news: We rebelled against God. Since God is Life, and we separated ourselves from Him, we separated ourselves from Life itself. It’s like a baby yanking out its own umbilical cord — when we cut ourselves off from Life, we die.Good News (Gospel): Jesus died for our sins to overcome death! By removing the cause of our separation (sin), he removes the effect (death).Response: trust in Jesus, and you shall be saved.Step 2: Share the Gospel Now you know the Gospel. But to be an evangelist, you need to share it. Who can you share it with? Share with family. Make a list of five friends or family members. Pray over them each day. Contact one of them today, asking them to go to lunch or coffee. Once there, ask them what they think about God, religion, their past upbringing in church, etc. Have a conversation!Share with friends. Think though the people you know. Maybe there is someone at work who you could spend some time with. Again, plan a day, and prepare beforehand to bring up the Gospel. Be friends with them.Share with strangers. This is a bolder option, so you might not be comfortable right now. But consider doing this: grab a few tracts, go outdoors, find an area with people, and walk up to someone who doesn’t look busy. Try something like this: “Hey, do you have a few minutes? My name is ____. Has anyone ever explained Christianity to you in a way that makes sense?”Step 3: Defend the Gospel Now that you’re sharing the Gospel, you need to be ready for people’s questions that will come up. And basically, all the questions boil down to this: why should we trust Jesus and the Bible? And the answer to both of those questions is this: Because Jesus rose from the dead. Imagine someone said he could fix your car. Would you trust him? If he had never fixed a car, then probably not. But if he has a long reputation of fixing cars, then you would have good reason to trust him. What about Jesus? Do we have reason to trust Him? Yes! He claims to be able to solve our death problem. Has he ever proven Himself? Yes: He has already conquered death. Christianity is the only religion based on a public miracle. Conclusion: How to Become Good at Evangelism Faster The best way to learn anything is to be guided through it. I personally didn’t learn how to share my faith until a few older Christians took me to a public park in Minneapolis and modeled it for me. Sadly, there aren’t very many good role models in this area. A lot are angry and abrasive. Others are good at sharing their faith, but they don’t have time to teach others.

Virality, the success vehicle for many companies these days, doesn’t rely on luck –it is an engineered growth hack. You can always look at what your competition is doing right, and implement the same thing. But how would you know it will turn out to be successful? Success comes from running hundreds, even thousands, of unsuccessful experiments. It all boils down to running tests until you find the recipe for success. It’s necessary to focus on the resources you have while capitalizing on the success of your competitors. Everything starts with building an experimentation culture, and here are six steps on how to introduce it to your organization. a) Welcome Failure In a highly innovative and competitive digital arena, being comfortable with failure is a survival instinct for any startup. Embracing failure should be part of the company culture –otherwise, it would be impossible to encourage experimentation. Cosmopolitan launched a yogurt brand back in 1999. I bet you didn’t hear about it? Facebook Home, which was launched in 2013, did not succeed either. Despite these failures, Cosmopolitan remains to be a popular magazine, Facebook is one of the most successful social media platforms today. Everything starts in which direction you steer the company –encouraging employees to pitch out-of-the-box ideas, and rewarding people with the most innovative suggestions goes a long way. b) Aim for high return, but incrementally An all-or-nothing business strategy is risky in a highly ambiguous market. Given how volatile the market is, you should be prepared to launch incremental changes but you should always aim for high returns. Hitting the jackpot on your first try rarely happens, and you want to sustain growth not just rely on pure luck. You need to make bite-sized adjustments to your business model while staying committed to your current business activities is less likely to cause unrest within the organization. Step-by-step improvements add up to help you achieve your targets. The end result may be a different organization from what you originally created but what matters is your startup survives. c) Analyze What campaigns are you doing right now?Are they working?If yes, why?If not, what can you do to improve it?These are some questions you need to answer at this stage. You need to document the results of your current campaigns, assess its impact, and interpret the results. All these information could help you plan future experiments and tests. d) Ideate When you want the highest returns but your time is limited, run experiments using your current resources. You need to run through a lot of ideas before stumbling into something that works. Unless you have a large pool of ideas, it would be impossible to conduct A/B testing. Yes, most ideas would have neutral or a negative impact but when you hit gold, every failure will be worth it. In ideation, you need to make all the tests count –even the ones that failed. If your sales decreased in the past month, you need to test a hypothesis.If you think the problem lies with your sales emails, you need to test the hypothesis and see if it is to blame for lower conversion rates.If your distribution channels are not working, which one would?To know for certain if the sales emails are to blame, you need to test your hypothesis.Analyze your data over the past six months, and create an email to compare the new conversion rates with data from the past months. If your hypothesis is right, you’ll know what the problem could be. If not, you can test another hypothesis and do another test. e) Prioritize Just because you have a high volume of ideas doesn’t mean you have to use all of them –it would be too costly and time-consuming. You need to prioritize ideas with a higher chance of success. In this process, consider the following: Is the probability of success high, medium or low?How much time will it require?Will it need the participation of the marketing, design or engineering team?Will it be a collaborative effort?Is it a one-hit wonder or will it have a sustainable effect?f) Test Now, it’s down to the final step testing. Remember, you are looking for scalable experiments. You want to start with a hypothesis and set an objective. It’s also necessary to have a timeframe for your tests, which is ideally from 30 to 90 days. Using an experimentation document would also make it easier to keep records of this process, and compare data. Building a Culture of Experimentation The process doesn’t stop with the sixth step. If you are building an experimentation culture, you need to repeat the process. After finding out a successful experiment, you are back to square one. Building a culture of experimentation takes time for you and your team but the effort will all be worth all the resources spent for running tests once you stumble on a golden nugget.

To start with the fundamentals - a growth hacker should be a T-shaped marketer first. If you don’t what that is, here is an image.  This means mastering the basic knowledge and marketing foundation in order to become an expert in 1 or 2 channels MAXIMUM. Why is this important? Because if you’re a master of everything, you’re not a master at all - you’re just average. By mastering in 1 or 2 channels, you have deeper understanding of them than 99% of the market while you have a general knowledge about many other channels which in fact makes you a unique asset. Second of all, a growth hacker is able to cover User Psychology, Create Marketing, Data+Testing and Coding+Automation as shown on this picture.  These skills will be crucial for you to run the High Tempo Testing organization that has one goal and one goal only - improve the One Metric that Matters (for example free trial signups, contact forms filled, newsletter sign-ups etc.) In order to run an organization like this, a specific framework must be installed.

I stand at a point where I believe that your individuality makes you a great growth hacker.  The more inventive you are in your own kind of authentic way, the more good of growth hacker you are. Even though there are very different points of views of how to become a growth hacker, they all have one thing in common- the creativity. Creativity does not always mean you can write poems and draw paintings. In this sphere, your ability to invent ways symbolizes your creativity. So, as we all know, you cannot force creativity. Either you have it or you don't. It is that simple. Therefore, being a great growth hacker means your creativity should be different than the others. Every single person you meet invent ways on daily basis. It can either be how to avoid depression, how to make their own cup of coffee and so on. What will make you great at growth hacking is being different than the others by any means - look where nobody is looking, invent solutions for problems that are yet to arise, achieve goals nobody thought are possible to achieve. You will soon come to realize that what you need is to think like a growth hacker. Develop your own kind of growth hacking mindset. Your individuality and authenticity are a necessity. If you are unsure you have those then they should be your starting point in becoming a great growth hacker.

You can do this framing questions with “how might we…?” or “what if…?” type questions. We are ultimately in pursuit of the ability to make fresh and new connections about our business that likely would not have surfaced otherwise. Example questions: “How might we use our channel partners’ to mitigate our business challenges? “How might we tap into our customers’ intrinsic motivation to share our content or service?” “What if our product was engineered as a growth machine?” Everything is a test Now that we have cleared the way for something new to show up it’s now time to relieve ourselves of the responsibility of being right. Let me repeat. We’re going to relieve you of the responsibility of always having to be right! How so? Simply, treat everything as a test. Everything business decision can be seen through an a/b testing lens. We can go way beyond just testing CTA button colors and headlines. Don’t know if investors want more or less information? Test it. Want to improve your all-hands meeting? Test it. Having trouble hiring? Test it. My hope is that you instill this experimenting mindset into your company culture, so that instead of people arguing over this or that someone yells “test it!” In doing so, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that you spend less time making decisions. Moreover, by exploring the outer boundaries of a given problem, domain, or metric, you can free your experiments from misleading “local maximas” that can create artificial ceilings in your results. Take a look at the Javelin Validation and Experiment boards for testing tools and methodologies. Challenge norms Think like a rebel and be vigilant! In order to be an effective growth hacker, you have to wade into the unknown. The world is moving fast and technologies are changing faster than ever before. As one platform is rising in popularity, like Snapchat, another is dying, say Craigslist. We live in a constantly changing world of innovation with new digital channels constantly sprouting. Double-downing on new channels that contain your audience can be a gold-mine for those who invest the time and capital in understanding the new channel’s dynamics. And don’t forget about offline and analog channels! These days almost everyone jumps to scalable, digital channels (there are many good reasons why), but I also see many entrepreneurs missing unique and valuable possibilities in traditional and offline marketing. Find new ways to merge offline and online activities to create new value exchanges not yet considered! For a good outside-the-box example, check out the rise in “appreciation marketing,’ by reading this article by Joshua Fechter as an example of how to hack social media, your contact book, and so much more. Other examples: Uber: In the early days, it is purported that Uber faked supply by showing cars on the map that didn’t exist as a way to instill trust in those requesting a ride. Airbnb: With a need to optimize their local reach, Airbnb created a Craigslist auto-posting bot that programmatically duplicated all Airbnb house posting on Craigslist. This was and still is against Craigslist TOS, but it worked. Speed is your competitive advantage In the startup world speed is everything. Speed is your competitive advantage against incumbents and bigger players. This is the one thing true across all startups, you are smaller, and therefore you should be able to move faster. I think the lean startup methodology does a great job of demonstrating and defining how to build and iterate a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), but even still I think those concepts can be applied more broadly… like speed and going FAST! It wasn’t until Blueberry matriculated through the now legendary NFX Guild accelerator in early 2016 that I realized that speed was MISSION CRITICAL. In order to move fast, we have to change our baseline for how fast things should go, we call this our “speed bar.” Ask yourself, ask your team, how fast are we going? Where can we go faster? Of course, fast does not mean careless. We work focused and deliberately, but we also celebrate mistakes and tests when they go wrong! Increase your learning cycles and you’ll get a leg up on the competition. Finally, you should be systematically benchmarking your data to identify where you can move the needle the most. And then stay laser-focused on these core KPIs. I also highly recommend using Zapier integrations to streamline and automate workflows, saving you an incredible amount of time and energy.

One hypothesis could be that the signup button is getting lost in all the content. What happens if you moved the button? Or made it bigger, or changed it's color? Each of these could be different tests and measured to see which of these variables are having a statistically significant effect on signups.  Another question could be: which of our traffic channels convert better? By knowing this, one could focus the team's limited resources into more of what works.  This requires the growth hacker work with the development team to introduce these tests. A very analytical team would have an A/B testing system set up to easily introduce these types of tests to answer these questions. A good growth hacker could be somewhat technical and be able to code up and push these tests to a subset of users (to not negatively impact your stats if your hypothesis is way off).  The growth hacker needs to come up with tests, keep track of all these tests, and relay and communicate the results of these tests with the rest of the team so that features aren't being made that could conflict or negate the effect of these tests.  A good growth hacker looks to examples in the past and see what other successful products have done to grow their product. She may research what other sites / products do by playing with them and analyzing what makes those products grow and adapting what they've done to her own product.  Important Considerations of a Growth HackerA good growth hacker isn't purely a theoretically guys who sits there and comes up with hypotheses for others to do the heavy lifting. They get their hands dirty coming up with the designs or wireframes or the functionality needed to grow.  A good growth hacker will be technical enough to understand what hypotheses are expensive to test and which ones are quick and easy to test and deliver best bang for the buck.  A good growth hacker also understands the mindset and motivations of the user. You can't just stick a contact form importer out of the blue. Why would a user want to share their contacts with your site at this moment?  Candy Crush Saga for example implements one particular growth hack pretty well. When you die, you can do one of 3 things:  you can wait until your timer resets and you can play againyou can pay to play via in-app purchaseor you can invite your friends to ""help"" youI suspect the cheap person who lacks impulse control opts for option #3 some of the time, thus playing into Candy Crush Saga's ingenious growth hack.

A home page with a direct link to the credit card trial will convert better than one that goes through a pricing page. Reaching out directly to new trial customers personally will increase trial conversions. Company B has a similar target audience. If we leverage their audience by trading guest posts we'll get additional conversions.  More customers will publish a landing page if we change the presentation of the theme choice page. This will show an improvement in the first five minutes of the user experience.  Blog posts about Landing Page design will get more readers if they use real world examples.

Test / Measure  Implement these tests and ensure you are measuring the results.  I cringe when I've had marketing team members tell me that ""you can't judge our success by results...."" Of course you can.    We leverage Kissmetrics for just about all of these tests because we can slice our conversion funnels by test or campaign in order to measure success. Check out this post on how we even leverage the to test the success of our customers first five minutes:  A Simple Guide to Increasing Customer Lifetime Value: Focus on the First 5 Minutes Which is probably more important than just your sales funnel. 3. Record & Refine Depending on the scale/nature of the test we let them run for a week or a month and measure the results.  We have to ask:  Did the test result in a noticeable difference to our core metrics (Upgrade conversions, the first five minutes of UX success, etc. )? If not then we stick with the baseline and move on to a differnent test idea.If it did then we look to see if we could go further, or more extreme, down that path.

Sure, some examples (Who are some notable growth hackers (a marketer with technical understanding/abilities)?) have been held up, but I don't believe anyone has yet created a specific description for the Role.  It would probably be a mistake to nail it down too specifically, I think.  To be a Growth Hacker is to achieve an effect, and anyone who's done it more than once will tell you it's never the exact combination of things in any two companies. Maybe it was brilliant Open Graph exploitation in Company A. Maybe it was inspired SEO in Company B. Maybe it was hyper-efficient paid acquisition in Company C. Maybe Company D was all of the above. You get the picture. Ergo, the best possible interview question for a Growth Hacker is ""Tell me about some of your growth hacks in the past."" Unfortunately, it will be difficult for a prospective or ""first-time"" Growth Hacker to give an answer there. So, you will have to try to discover if they have the combination of aptitudes that are likely to make a good Growth Hacker.  To my thinking, those aptitudes include: 1) Being a good Strategist -- a Growth Hacker has to be able to recognize opportunity and then formulate an approach for taking advantage of it. 2) Having great Product instincts -- a Growth Hacker can think like a user, and can put himself inside the head of any user. If you tell him what you're trying to get people to do you in your app, he should have insightful commentary ready for you in just a few minutes. Growth Hackers can't help but see problems in the acquisition flow and in parts of the product that stand in the way of the desired user behaviors. 3) Knows how to turn Data into Answers -- a Growth Hacker is like a sleuth. It's not just about being able to write SQL queries. It's about being able to see the whole Data Picture, and to know what stories the data can tell.  But, well before you start bringing people in to interview, I would spend some time thinking about what you feel a Growth Hacker can do for your company.  Are you a startup? Or is your product simply not growing?  You also have to think about how this person is going to fit into the existing organization. How much authority will the person have to dictate product decions? Do you have a budget, or is the growth all to come from free hacks? Growth hackers don't just pore over data. They need resources and power. Now that the term ""Growth Hacker"" has been popularized, we're going to see more companies looking for them and more people calling themselves one. I think it's wise to remember that Growth Hacking, as it's being popularized, is a startup phenomenon, a very early-stage startup phenomenon. In the most well-known examples, the Growth Hacker was a very early stage employee, and the organization was very agile. As larger, more mature organizations start thinking about hiring Growth Hackers, they should understand that in order for the Growth Hacker to be successful he's got to have the ability to effect change, and quickly.  Given all the above, I think it's doubtful that a Growth Hacker can be reduced to a list of specific skills for which he or she can be quizzed. So much depends on how far along the company is and the skills that are already on the team.

The key to customer loyalty is not just by providing a quality service or product, but how you service and support it. Meeting customer expectations in a first sale may not be enough. First-time buyers want to know you care. For loyalty to endure, it must be noticed and acknowledged.   Creative marketing   Creating marketing messages that will be heard, remembered, and, most important, talked about, is very difficult in a world where customers have precious little time to listen.    Achieving creativity in your marketing messages delivery is essential to winning your customers’ choices, and then their loyalty.      Adaptation and innovation    The digital and network revolutions have unleashed rapid and significant marketplace changes that impact your ability to engage customers, and the rate and amount of change is accelerating. Businesses must interpret and understand the implications of these changes and rapidly respond with creative ideas and innovations to maintain their competitive edge.   Do you frequently observe what your key competitors are doing in the market space? Have they spotted a key trend that you have missed? What changes are they making to their merchandising and their value proposition?

Build a growth culture in your company Another one is when a marketer joins an immature team that thinks that growth hacking is some magic that can skyrocket the company from day 1.  They think we’re Gandalf and that we can drive growth overnight without taking any resources from product, design and engineering. I’ve seen a lot of times great marketers leave their jobs because founders read somewhere about growth hacking and don’t know how growth really works in practice. Unfortunately, growth marketing is a bit more chaotic than driving growth through traditional sales. In such cases, when the growth hacker asks for changes on the product (e.g. onboarding, virality, etc.) they either get ignored or his/her experiments get super low priority. To address this, you either need to make sure that the top management/founders know what they’re talking about or be so good at selling growth internally, before doing anything else. As Andrew Chen puts it: Growth is not a bunch of small, tactical growth hacks—make a button this colour, etc.) It is a full model and system with linked parts and loops that align with your business. Some actions that can be helpful: put growth on your team members’ title (even if they do product or other stuff)As Gustaf Alströmer from Airbnb says, explain them that very few features touch non-users— working on adding features in the product won’t help you acquire more customers.Show case studies that growth takes time and train them that failure is a big part of the game.Try to get some quick wins as soon as possible, mainly to keep the team’s psychology at a good level.James Currier talks about some of the above in this great video: Video: Unlocking the Secrets of Growth in 20 Minutes At Ladder we’ve worked with close to 70 early stage startups to help them grow.

By successfully reaching out to a new market, companies can position themselves as the leading provider and acquire most of the benefits from opening the market resources. To learn more about this, discover How Growth Hacking Became A Successful Marketing Strategy. Why Many Startups Struggle There are many reasons why startups struggle – and, unfortunately, as many as 90% of them ultimately fail to meet their goals. Sometimes new entrepreneurs lack experience, and can’t quite get their ducks in a row when their business needs it to survive. Even experienced entrepreneurs can struggle to handle every aspect of a new business, and simply trying to multitask isn’t enough to get the job done. That’s why we offer best growth hacks, a worry-free service to let you focus on your products and services while we focus on helping you grow your business. Effective Growth: An iterative and Data–Driven Process A major part of Growth Hacking is the scientific process of designing and validating – through multiple iterations – a growth strategy that best suits your business’ needs. It’s a lot like comparing formulas in a laboratory to see which one offers the best balance of cost and results. The validation of the marketing strategy happens on a cyclical process based on testing, tracking, and progressively optimizing the results. In this way, it’s possible for a growth hacking consultant to create specific plans, define realistic goals, and ultimately make the growth process more effective. There’s no mystery or guesswork here – just data-driven facts. We perform Growth Hacking on three different levels MEASURING With measuring, we acquire quantitative measurements of user behavior that help us to understand who they are, what matters the most to them, and what refinements will make products and marketing more effective for them. ANALYSIS Once we have those measurements, we start working on constant analysis to help better understand the real-world impact of the strategy. Constant analysis is critical to successful growth hacking - in fact, many companies forget to reassess their marketing strategies, and that's often why they fail. OPTIMIZATION Finally, we work to implement the strategies generated by measuring and analyzing the company base. Much like analysis, optimization is an ongoing process, and it always has more growth for your company as the goal.

At that time, You could have tried climbing out of the window, you could have said you were going to a private birthday party (which you weren’t) or would have said you were sleeping over at a friend’s place (which was true up to a certain degree). The point is, your goal (metric) was to go to the party, but the methods of achieving that goal were different. Some more successful than others. This is what growth hacking is. You set a goal (going to the party) of something bigger and better, even almost impossible and you try to get there in the fastest way, with the least amount of resources. Some tests will fail (like climbing out of the window) but if you test enough you’ll find a better approach (staying at a friends place) to reach your goal. In order to better understand Growth hacking, there is 3 things that you need to remember: First of all, Growth Hacking is not about hacks or tools. Just like in any sports, Growth Hacking is about processes & experimentation. If you don't train yourself to work out every single week, you won't see results. If you don't try anything new, you'll always fall behind. Use this guide to set up the growth process within your company: Growth Hacking playbook part 1/20: Process before tactics Secondly, Growth Hacking is not a process that was made only for Marketers, it can be applied to new product innovation and to the continuous improvement of products as well as to growing and existing customer base. The reason is simple. Most of the time you need at least 3 different skill sets to implement some of the best growth strategies: A Designer (to make everything beautiful)A Coder (to make everything work)A Marketeer (to make sure people get to see whatever you want to test)More experienced people can be a blend of 2 or 3 of these types. They are worth gold. Alright, you got your process and team in place, it’s time to unleash the tactics, right? Not really. Thirdly, the best growth ‘hacks’ are not because of a guy drawing an idea on a napkin. It was based on data. The key to growth is finding who your best customers are, solve their struggles and find out where you can get more of those people. Pretty simple, but therefore not easy. You might be thinking, how do I find my best customers? One simple word: Analytics. Most of the time, your product won’t be fully ready. In fact, I don’t think any product is every ready. Yet, there are always a couple of people that are going to (almost) complete your full funnel nevertheless. These are the people you want to pull out of your analytics and meet face-to-face to understand their motives. Now is the time you can start sketching your persona’s for marketing purposes and unleashing the tactics that fit their profile. Use this complete guide on setting up your analytics to track the full customer journey and pull those people out of your database. Growth Hacking playbook part 2/20: You don't know what you don't track How it’s implemented: Set up the growth process within your company. Generate and test ideas accordingly to test assumptions you might have.Create a cross-functional team with a mentality that is willing to fail.Use qualitative research and quantitative data analysis to gain deep insights into your user behaviour and preferences.Happy Growing! The best way to understand growth hacking and what growth hackers do is to first understand what is meant by the term hacker. A hacker is someone who is more concerned with achieving an objective than following a prescribed process. In other words, hackers care more about what needs to get done than how it should get done. As a result, hackers often come up with innovative ways to get things done. For example, a hacker may be trying to get unauthorized access to a computer system.

A hacker is someone who is more concerned with achieving an objective than following a prescribed process. In other words, hackers care more about what needs to get done than how it should get done. As a result, hackers often come up with innovative ways to get things done. For example, a hacker may be trying to get unauthorized access to a computer system. It doesn’t really matter how he does it (and there often isn’t one specifically prescribed method) so long as whatever he’s doing gets him access. Because hackers are more concerned with what needs to get done than how it should get done, they tend to be pretty anti-authoritarian and also not do so well at bigger companies where they are expected to do things a certain way. A growth hacker is a hacker whose objective is to grow the number of users for a specific product. While lots of people consider user growth to be a marketing function, this assumes that there’s only one way to get users (namely, marketing). But this isn’t true. In fact, more and more over the last few years we’ve seen new products grow from zero to millions of users with little to no marketing at all. There are lots of non-marketing decisions that affect user growth. Building viral product features is the most obvious, but there are many others (I’ll cover these in a future post). As a result, it doesn’t make sense to place growth hacking within a particular department like marketing or engineering. Instead, it ends up being a cross-functional role.  The idea is that for every decision a company makes, a growth hacker should ask: ”What will be the impact on growth?” For example, when Facebook was still in its early stages they built a cross-functional growth team led by a growth hacker that touched many other departments, including Marketing, BizDev, Product, Finance and even HR. Among many other projects, the team was responsible for making Facebook available in every language through crowdsourcing, implementing a robust system for importing email contacts, and even building out a “Facebook Lite” which was eventually shut down Over the last few years, truly innovative growth hackers have developed various frameworks and best-practices. Guys like Noah Kagan (AppSumo, Mint, Facebook), Mike Greenfield (Circle of Moms, LinkedIn), Dave McClure (500 Startups, PayPal) and many others have pioneered techniques focused on virality, email, search engine optimization & marketing. I also wrote a post recently in which I put forward the claim that growth hacking = lean marketing (http://www.growhack.com/2012/09/05/is-growth-hacking-lean-marketing/).",2021-03-06T20:29:00.898Z,"What is growth hacking?

So, companies hire a growth hacker who can acquire users for any product, and retain them purely based on excellent marketing.Growth hacker marketing is not understanding different traction channels in their basic form - Facebook ads, Google AdWords. A growth hacker’s job is simply to create enough data points so you can hire a growth analyst to measure them. Or, if they’re a skilled growth hacker, they may have data analyst skills to provide you the ability to build a better product.Building a better product is not growth hacking. Growth hacking is finding creative ways to create a know, like, and trust rapport with prospects to turn them into customers. If the product sucks, the growth hacker uses creative ways to establish more know, like, and trust rapport to ensure customers forgot about the product while the growth analyst figures out product problems to be solved (i.e. Is this particular feature decreasing retention?). For example, Kissmetrics is a software with a price point too high to parallel the benefit. I don’t suggest people use the software. However, customers stay with the Kissmetrics because they have excellent content that distracts customers from the product.

Growth hackers are marketers, engineers and product managers that specifically focus on building and engaging the user base of a business.” Now most people, myself included who have worked in this sphere for some time will be scratching their heads and thinking, “This is exactly what I have been doing for the last x years”. So in my opinion “Growth Hacking” is nothing more than a buzz word for full stack digital marketing. Full stack digital marketers are well versed in most modern marketing tactics, ie SMM, PPC, SEO, PR, CRO, EMM, etc, this is essentially what a “growth hacker” or growth hacking is. Further more “growth hackers” are able to utilize and manipulate data which has been extrapolated from various tools such as Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, SEMrush, Ahrefs, Unbounce etc. “Growth Hacking” is extremely potent for startups as it’s impossible to ascertain what type of marketing will be a good fit without experimenting with a wide variety of marketing techniques/tactics.

So if it cost $100 to build 1 battery, it costs $156 to build 2 batteries ($78 each unit).

The basic premise is that if you double the production of an item, the cost of production of each unit reduces by 22%. So if it cost $100 to build 1 battery, it costs $156 to build 2 batteries ($78 each unit). That’s scale. Doing things that don’t scale is really just doing something that you have to do over and over again, for the same gain each time. Now you're asking: Ok, but what that has to do with growth hacking? Here's the thing... You will rarely figure out a great growth hacking by just thinking about it or looking for other examples. Most growth hacking ideas will emerge from doing things that don't scale first. Why? Because the things that don't scale are usually the tatics that will get you closer to your customers and will provide you the insights that will let you later hack your growth. Want one example? Let's have a look at Tinder: Tinder have a great example of a marketing action that doesn’t scale, but which was almost integral in the success of the app. When Tinder was being launched, the founders ran a series of exclusive parties across colleges in the US, with the only prerequisite being that you had downloaded the app. This activity didn’t scale because each party only initiated the same number of required downloads. Does that make sense? You invite 200 people to each party. They each download the app. That’s 200 downloads for each party. And the parties all cost the same. That’s something that doesn’t scale, but that put Tinder in a path to be the successful app that it's today: More than 40,000,000 downloads. Now, the parties weren’t the only form of marketing Tinder employed, but they were effective for a couple of reasons: They hit the ideal demographic for the app;They demonstrated exactly the purpose for the app;They fed into the mystic of Tinder.What Doesn’t Scale So what are some ideas of marketing exercises that fit the bill, that don’t scale up, but might nonetheless fit your business if you’re willing to work hard enough. Cold calling, it’s a grind, and its inefficient, but everyone does it because it works;Smash out some regular press releases;Organise launch and publicity parties;Form Street Teams who will push your product among their area of influence, often for no more recompense than free access to it;Talk to people who use your competition;Arrange user testing with real people, and listen to what they say.",2021-03-06T20:31:55.757Z,"What is the difference between Growth Hacker and Online Marketer?

Both of these are great for targeting with whatever great and relevant value you have to offer them. To get a list of your competitor’s Twitter friends, go to fo https://friendorfollow.com/ You can just login with your Twitter account and start pulling lists of Twitter following, fans (these that follow you without following them back, friends, unfollowers and followers. We’re going for Friends here. I pulled up Salesflare’s list as an example.  You want this stuff in a nice sheet. Hit Export as CSV as show in the screenshot. Now, this software would have no reason to still exist if there wasn’t some kind of monetization to it. You guessed, .CSV export is a Pro-function. It’s about $10 a month. No worries, you get a 7 day ‘FREE’ trial. You do have to register a credit card. Be sure to not forget to cancel your subscription if you don’t wish to pay for this (It doesn’t do much more than this). Now you have big fat .CSV with Twitter handles of your competitor’s Twitter friends. One of the coolest things you’ll be able to do later on is making Lookalike Audiences from your competitor’s friends/customers. For it to be as accurate as possible, you’ll need more data than the friends from just one competitor. Just get all of them while you’re at it. Your sheet will something like the screenshot below. It features the Twitter Friends of Pipedrive (we’re like Pipedrive, but without all the typing).  2. Match Gmail addresses with FindThatLead You need email addresses to make Facebook Audiences. Not just email addresses: personal email addresses. People don’t connect their work emails to Facebook. It’s unlikely you will find emails for all your competitor’s Twitter handles. But we can get close, using two methods. The first one? Guessing. Making educated guesses and verifying those guesses. For quite some people the part that comes before ‘@’ in their emails is identical to their Twitter handle. A lot of people also use Gmail, Outlook, iCloud (maybe even Hotmail still?) for their personal emails. Form email addresses twitterhandle@gmail.com, twitterhandle@outlook.com,... using CONCATENATE in a new column in your sheet and save the column as a .CSV. This is where FindThatLead comes in. Make an account and select .CSV upload from your Dashboard. Then click ‘Verify Emails’ Upload your .CSV with suspected personal email addresses.    You can repeat this process with other common personal emails domains. A free FindThatLead account will get you about 10 credits per day, so you’ll need to upgrade to paid plan. However, you won’t find anything cheaper . FindThatLead is one of the reasons I’m writing this guide now and not before. Its fair pricing makes it worth your while. 3. Match the remaining Twitter handles to LinkedIn Profiles with FullContact You’ll need FullContact to get email addresses for the Twitter handles you weren’t able to match with FindThatLead. To get to the emails, we’ll first be matching the Twitter handles to LinkedIn profiles. #1. Make an account over at FullContact #2. Download the Person Enrichment Template (Excel Macro File) #3. Login as developer to get your API Key   #4. Open up your Person Enrichment Template and fill out your API key  #5. Now you’re ready to enrich contacts. Select Twitter handles as source #6. Go to InputSheet and paste the Twitter handles in #7. Go back to Begin and hit Populate Contacts You should have something like this   You now have (almost) all of these users’ LinkedIn profiles. By now you’ll also have filtered out most company Twitter profiles being friends with your competitors. They won’t have Gmail emails nor LinkedIn profiles. 4. Bring the Dux in on the action  Ah, my favourite tool: Dux-Soup. For those who’ve been missing out on something truly great: Dux-Soup is a robot you can use to auto-visit LinkedIn profiles with. I usually use it to auto-visit targeted profiles in LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Say from SaaS entrepreneurs located in Berlin (textbook Salesflare customers). These prospects will all see that I visited their profiles and possibly check me out too. The best part is that Dux-Soup also saves their data into a .CSV, including first name, last name and, most importantly here, company domain. For more LinkedIn tricks, check my Playbook. ☝️ We’ll be using Dux-Soup differently now. We already have LinkedIn profiles. We just don’t have company domains. We can get these by having Dux-Soup visit all of these LinkedIn profiles. Here’s how you do this: #1. Download a Dux-Soup .CSV Export  #2. Empty the ‘ID’ and ‘visit time’, leave the rest as it is.#3. Paste the Linked URLs in the ‘Profile’ column The other columns will still contain previously scraped data (first name, last name, company, industry etc.). It’s supposed to be like that. The functionality you’ll be using is called ‘Revisit Data’. You’re basically tricking Dux-Soup in thinking it already visited these profiles before. It will update the rest of the data once it ‘revisited’ the LinkedIn URLs in the ‘Profile column’. #4. Go to ‘Revisit Data’  #5. Upload the .CSV with the LinkedIn profiles #6. Hit ‘Visit Profiles’ from the Dux-Soup Chrome Extension.  Now comes the other reason why I’m only writing this guide now.  Before, I’d combine company domains with first names and/or last names to get the email addresses from the LinkedIn Profiles. However, these were often not personal email addresses I could use in a Facebook Audience. Things have changed since Dux-Soup launched their very own email retriever. As soon as you hit that ‘Visit Profiles’ button, Dux-Soup will ask if you want them to retrieve email addresses too.  Dux-Soup has a point system where 1 point is good for 1 email address return. You can either buy these or trade in the email addresses from your LinkedIn connections. This is how they source all of these emails, I found the return rate to be around 90% (!) .  Here’s the awesome part: a lot of the email addresses Dux-Soup will return are in fact Gmail - addresses. In combination with the twitterhandle@gmail.com hack ft. FindThatLead, you’ll now have about every personal email address there is to find for the group of competitor customers and friends. If you’re keen on finding remaining email addresses too, you can run firstname@domain, firstname.lastname@domain, firstletterfirstnamelastname@domain and other conventional email address formats through FindThatLead again. 5. Possibilities I had trouble choosing a title for this guide because there’s a lot  Facebook Audiences and Cold Email are probably the most prominent ones. Let’s go over it, you can: follow them on Twitter, all at once using ManageFlittersend them funny (and not spammy) tweetsLike/Retweet/Add to Lists on Twitter(You already visited their LinkedIn profiles - they’ll see this)send them InMails on LinkedInconnect with them on LinkedInsend them cold emails with a tool like Mixmax (the best absolute best tool for cold emailing)put them in a Facebook Audience and show relevant + valuable ads.

Not only it is the first piece of the clue telling your potential users what your app is, but it also gets your app in the search results. According to research by MobileDevHQ (now renamed Tune), using keywords in your title can result in up to a 10.3% increase in rankings.  Image courtesy of MobileDevHQ via John Rampton on Forbes Both Google and Apple’s search algorithms scan the app name for keywords when a user performs a keyword search in the app markets. It is a good idea to include a few keywords in your app name as an App Store Optimization practice. It is because both platforms give quite high priorities to apps with app names that contain the search input. But don’t stuff every keyword into your title or your app will look spammy. You need to find a good balance between keywords and branding. But how? Read on! [Back] App Name Format Keep the actual brand name short and sweet. You can then append this short brand name with a few keywords, typically preceded by a dash or a semicolon. App Store Optimization Tips: App Name FormatUse the format “Brand Name – Keywords” or “Brand Name: Keywords” to include relevant keywords in your name. Here are some real examples: Google Maps – Navigation & Transit Amazon App: shop, scan, compare, and read reviews eBay: Buy, Sell, Save! Electronics, Fashion & More Pandora – Free Music & Radio The Weather Channel: Alerts, Forecast & Radar It’s also important to use only URL-friendly characters in your title, particularly in the App Store. It is because Apple uses the app name to create your app URL. Also, avoid any special characters in your app name, like the trademark or copyright symbol. They will cause iTunes to refer to your app’s numeric ID to scan for relevant keywords instead of your app name. Did you know?In less than 30 seconds, you can get an App Store Optimization Report of your app here. Just enter your app name, and the report will tell you how to increase your app downloads using app store optimization. And it’s free. [Back] App Name Length Apple limits the app name to a maximum of 50 characters since September 2016. So you have to make good use of every character in your app name. Brand Name: Use 23 characters or less for optimal presentation on every device. Total Length: To make the most of the 50 character limit, use more than 40 characters to cover more relevant app store keywords. [Back] App Description & Keywords Apple App Store: Apple App Store does not search for keywords in the app description, but that does not mean iOS developers can be lazy with it. Read the sections below for more tips about App Description. Google Play Store: you need to be careful with the app description. It is because Google pulls keywords from your description to be your app’s keywords. Incorporate your app store keywords in the description in natural and sensible sentences. Note that keywords in the above-the-fold section (the first few lines) carries more weight than the rest of the description copy in Google’s ranking algorithm, so remember to put your main keywords in this section. And this leads us to the next tip below… [Back] App Description – The First Few Sentences According to StoreMaven, only an average of 5% users will click the “read more” button below the short description on Google Play. This number is further down to only 2% on Apple’s App Store. So every character in the short description counts! On mobile, you only have 252 characters for this short description.  You don’t want to waste any space here. Make it concise and attention-grabbing. Avoid blank lines and interrupted sentences. Tell users what makes your app unique and why they will love it. Focus on your app’s values, instead of features. And don’t forget to include a call-to-action text to get the users excited! [Back] App Description – The Expanded Description Highlight the features of your app here. Use spacing and bulleted lists to make it easy to read. If possible, also list out all the social proofs, awards, and honorable mentions your app has received. Don’t forget to include your app’s social media links too. Also, Google Play Store allows rich formatting and emoji in your app description. Make good use of these to make your description organized and stand out from the crowd. Communicate in the tone of your brand. Use terminology your target audience will appreciate and understand. [Back] App Description Length We analyzed the description length of the top 100 apps in Nov 2016. Here are some findings: 90% of top 100 apps use more than 589 characters90% of top 100 apps use less than 3385 characters.Though app description length doesn’t have a very big impact compared to other factors, it is still a good idea to keep your length within this range. App Store Optimization Tips: Benchmark with the Top 100 AppsDo you want to know the latest statistics of description length? Just use this App Store Optimzation tool. The tool benchmarks your app with the top 100 apps and tells you how to improve. [Back] App Icon A better icon can increase your downloads up to 560%! To design a good icon, keep your design simple and eye-catchy. Do not cram the small space with many items or words. You want people to remember the icon after the first impression. Also, make sure your icon will still look good when it is scaled down to the smallest size required by App Store / Google Play. It should also look good against light and dark background. To get more design inspirations, browse the top-rated apps in your category and Apple/Google’s top picks. Also, make sure your icon is different from your competitor’s to avoid brand confusion. Contrasting colors, different shapes or adding a frame can also help. App Store Optimization Tips: Branded vs Functional IconIf your app has a brand, use the logo to make your brand and your future products recognizable. If your app is a functional app, use one object to describe your app.  Branded App Icon – facebook  Functional App Icon – Whatsapp Messager [Back] App Store Keywords – Getting Keyword Ideas To begin with, try and come up with at least 50 keywords. Here are some great tools that help you with the app store keyword ideas. All you need to do is to provide a keyword. These tools will then give you many keyword ideas to consider. And they are all free! ÜbersuggestOneLook Reverse DictionaryGoogle Keyword PlannerApple Search Ads > Recommended Keywords (only for iOS app developers) You can also use Google Trends to check how popular a keyword is in different countries. This is very useful if you want to launch your app in specific countries. Remember that your keywords must be relevant to your app. Don’t be tempted to use a keyword just because it is popular, but not relevant to your app. You want your app to be found by users who will really download and enjoy your app. App Store Optimization Tips: Time-sensitive KeywordsLet’s illustrate the idea by an example: using “Rio” and its related keywords during the Olympics 2016 would greatly help the exposure of your sports apps. Your app would also have a better chance to get into the app store’s feature lists too. Review KeywordsDid you know the words in your app user reviews are indexed by the app store search engine? That is why review mining is a very good way for getting app store keyword ideas. Your app reviews speak your users’ mind. And the words are highly related to how they would search for your app. Just by looking at your review keywords, you will be surprised to find out the keyword ideas that you have never thought of before. There are some review analysis tools in the market. And this one uses Artificial Intelligence on your user reviews to find out what your users like and don’t like about your app. [Back] App Store Keywords – Selecting Your Keywords With your initial set of app store keywords, you have to pick a strategy on how to optimize the right keywords. There are some keyword research tools that help you with this app store keyword optimization process. They provide the difficulties (or chances) and traffic of your keywords. In any case, choose about 25 keywords carefully for the next release of your app. App Store Optimization Tips: App Store Keyword Optimization Strategy For a new app, choose keywords with low difficulty and reasonable traffic. They help your app gain the initial momentum. After gaining the initial momentum, start using keywords with higher traffic and reasonable difficulty. They help your app stack up more downloads. Work your way up gradually as your app gets more popular. Long-tail App Store KeywordsUse longer keyword phrases (aka long-tail keywords) to outrank the competition. For example, it is hard to outrank Zynga Poker by the competitive keyword “Poker” (high difficulty). But you have a better chance to outrank it by the keyword phrase “Poker Casino”. It is because “Poker Casino” is less competitive (lower difficulty). Retiring Poor App Store KeywordsIf you have already released your app with your target keywords, check your current app ranking of these keywords. Keep those keywords that your app ranks within top 10, and replace the rest with new keywords in your next release. [Back] App Store Keyword Optimization Now that you have chosen the keywords, you are ready to use them for your app.  For iOS developers: Fill in the keyword metadata with your selected app store keywords. This metadata decides how your app gets discovered. Follow the rules below and make every character counts! Use all 100 charactersSeparate every keyword by a commaAvoid space, articles and prepositionsUse singular OR plural, the easier one to rank forDon’t repeat keywordUse numbers instead of spelled out wordsNo need to include the words in your company name, app name and app category names.App Store Optimization Tips: App Store Keyword OptimizerYou can use the App Store SEO Grader to optimize your app keyword metadata. The tool applies the above rules to your app keywords and tells you how to improve. How To 5X Your iOS App Store KeywordsDo you want more keyword space for your iOS app? You can get up to 500 characters for your iOS app store keywords using this optimization tip. That is FIVE TIMES more! For Android developers: Google Play doesn’t have the keyword metadata. Instead, Google pulls keywords from your description to be your app store keywords. Incorporate your keywords in the description in natural and sensible sentences. Note that keywords in the above-the-fold section (the first few lines) carries more weight than the rest of the description copy in Google’s ranking algorithm, so remember to put your main app store keywords in this section. [Back] App Screenshots According to StoreMaven, 60% of users won’t swipe past your first two screenshot images. A better version of your first two screenshots can increase your conversions by 25%! To make great screenshots, make sure each screenshot is telling a single message about your app. Show your strongest messages in the first two screenshots. The best apps use all five screenshot slots to impress their users, and you should do the same. Adding short caption texts on your screenshots can help, but make sure they are on a clean background. And try to create a positive impression in the viewers’ mind at all times. Avoid login, registrations, purchase forms, ads and even “Welcome” screen in your screenshots. Make the best use of the screenshots to tell your users why they should love your app. App Store Optimization Tips: Vertical ScreenshotsKeep the screenshots vertical. The users can see more screenshots on the narrow screens when the screenshots are vertical.   Vertical screenshots of Clash of Clans   Vertical screenshots of Uber Optimize Your App ScreenshotsTo optimize your app screenshots, use this App Store SEO Grader. The tool checks your screenshots’ dimensions, count, orientations, and their compatibility with various iOS devices, and tells you how to improve. [Back] App Preview Video Making a video may be difficult but it can increase install rates by more than 23% according to StoreMaven. Don’t forget to use a good poster frame (iOS) / feature graphic (Google Play). This graphic has a big impact to whether your visitors would watch your video. App Store Optimization Tips: App Marketing Video Here are some of the essential elements of an effective app marketing video. They are recommended by Apptamin, a company well-known for its app videos and trailers: Use the first 5 seconds to grab the viewer’s attentionFocus on the best features, instead of all featuresYour video should make sense even with the sound turned offInclude a call-to-actionRemember, 80% of users don’t watch past first 12 seconds of the video. Do make sure you keep it short and to the point. Avoid any fade-in and “welcome” type of message at the beginning of your video. [Back] App Store Ratings – The Impact Ratings and reviews have a great impact on your app downloads. You need an average rating of 4-stars or above. Or else only less than 50% users are willing to download your app. Check out this infographic for more details:  App Store Optimization Tips: User Review SentimentUse this tool to get a user sentiment analysis of your app. It applies Artificial Intelligence on your user reviews to find out what your users like and don’t like about your app. [Back] App Store Ratings – Getting Five-Star Ratings How can you get more five-star ratings for your app? Delay asking for a rating until there’s a likely moment of constructive feedback. For instance, ask when the user completed a reservation, finished a mission in a game, etc. When the time comes, ask nicely, and don’t beg. What does that mean? Circa News app is a perfect example. It got 90% five-star ratings for every major version. Here is a flowchart of how it asks users if they would like to provide feedback:  Image courtesy of Circa News The key is to encourage satisfied users to leave positive reviews and deflect negative reviews by using a “send feedback” option. To do this, you can either develop your own version of rating and feedback flow or simply use the tools like Apptentive’s Ratings Prompts. App Store Optimization Tips: The Right Paths To A ReviewDirect only positive reviews to App Store, and negative reviews to support. But what if I already have many bad reviews? Redditor amirrajan shared some awesome tips about how to sweep bad reviews under the rug. He also tells you how to give a positive first impression about your app by making good use of the five-star reviews. [Back] App Store Ratings – Reply To Reviews Remember to reply the app reviews and feedback! Only the ones who care about your app will spend the time to leave a comment. Show them you care about them as well! This is a great way to let the visitors know that the developer is active too. For Google Play, there is a “Reply to a review” option in Developer Console for you to do just that.  For Apple App Store, you can also do this since iOS 10.3 release in March 2017. On iTunes Connect, go to ‘My Apps > Choose your app > Activity > Ratings and Reviews’. There you can see the “Reply” option in each of the reviews.  App Store Optimization Tips: How to Reply to Reviews Try to reply to all feedback immediately following a major release of your app. If you can’t respond to every review, try prioritizing reviews with the lowest star ratings or those mentioning technical issues with the most current version of your app. When you release an app update that fixes issues users mentioned in older reviews, consider replying to the relevant reviews to let them know that your update addressed their concerns. Once a user indicates that your response answered their question or fixed their technical issue, consider asking them to update their rating and review. You can also foster deeper engagement by asking users for feedback on future app updates as part of your reply. [Back] App Store Ratings – One-Star Reviews One-star reviews are your friends. Read them all. Try to understand why the users complained your app, and think about what you need to do to turn them into five-star reviews. This thought process helps you improve your app from the user perspective. Also, fix all serious bugs, crashes and performance issues.  In the end getting more and better app reviews comes down to creating a great app users love. Listen, improve your apps and repeat until you are topping the app store ratings. [Back] App Localization Strategy App localization gives you a larger audience to download your mobile app. But localizing the whole app to many languages can be a daunting task. Before doing a full localization of your whole app, consider localizing your app listing first. It means translating your app name, keywords, screenshots, etc. David Janner of MAKE APP Magazine conducted a localization experiment. In his experiment, he only localized the app name, the keywords, and sometimes the top line in the app description. After this simple localization, his app received a massive 767% increase in downloads. Before localization, the downloads were mainly from within the US. After localization, his downloads looked like this:  Image courtesy of MAKE APP Magazine According to OneSky, only 31% of the world’s total app revenue came from the U.S., while 41% came from Asia, and 23% came from Europe. In particular, China has already surpassed the U.S. by both iOS app download and revenue. If your app only has an English version for the U.S. market, you are leaving a lot of money on the table. App Store Optimization Tips: App Localization StrategyLocalize your app listing first to see how well your app performs in different countries. You can then decide if you should perform full localization of the whole app for the best performing countries. Icon and Screenshot LocalizationDifferent countries have distinct preference of icon colors, screenshot layouts and annotations. Check out these posts about icon colors and screenshot localization for more insights. [Back] App Localization – Best Countries For Your App Now you know the strategy, but which countries should you start first? If your app is already available in more than one country, you can use app analytics to find out the top countries by your app downloads. Check the official languages of the top five countries, and localize your app listing if you haven’t done so. Depending on your priority, you can also do the same using top countries by revenue, ARPU, conversion rate, active devices or retention. App Store Optimization Tips: Predict Your Next Successful MarketsThis app analytics tool predicts where your next successful markets are based on LTV (Lifetime User Value), ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), Conversion Rates, and more. With this information, you can proactively localize your app to grasp the market opportunities. [Back] App Localization – Top Countries By Revenue Another approach is to localize your app listing for the top countries by downloads and/or revenue. According to App Annie, here are the top countries in Q3 2016.  Again, check the official languages of the top countries, and localize your app listing if you haven’t done so. [Back] App Conversion Rates – The Impact First, what is conversion rates (CR)? Let’s use the analytics from Apple App Store to illustrate the concept. In Apple iTunes Connect’s App Analytics, you can find the followings: Impressions (the number of times your app showed up in the App Store)App Page Views (the number of visits on your app’s page in the App Store)and App Units (the number of downloads)With these data, you can easily calculate two CRs: Page View CR = App Page Views / Impressions x 100%Download CR = App Units / App Page Views x 100%To put things into perspective, The page view CR is the percentage of people who see your app from search results, rank lists, or featured app lists, and then tap the icon to check out your app.The download CR is the percentage of people who visits your app page and then downloads your app.These two CRs can be presented along with impressions, app page views, and app units in a diagram called Conversion Funnel in app marketing.  Why is conversion rate such a big deal? There are mainly three reasons. 1. CR is a strong quantitative indicator of App Store Optimization effectiveness Keyword ranking and number of downloads are not the best metrics to measure the performance of App Store Optimization. There are many external factors that can influence those two metrics. For example, a big competing publisher may publish a hugely popular app and shift the apps in the keyword ranking by a margin (e.g. The impact of Pokemon Go and related apps on the keyword “Pokemon” and “Go”). Or you run App Store Optimization and an advertisement campaign at the same time and the number of the downloads become not purely organic. On the other hand, CRs are independent of market competition nor the source of traffic. They give you the true picture of App Store Optimization effectiveness. 2. CR reflects the likelihood of getting ranked CR is a natural ranking signal in app store search. If lots of people search certain keywords, click on the same search result, and download the same app, Google Play and the App Store should receive a strong message: “Users want to see this app!” and place the app in a dominant spot (i.e. rank or featured list). 3. CR saves you money! It’s just simple math: if you double your CR, you cut your advertising cost by half for the same amount of downloads. For the same reason, if you haven’t optimized your CR, don’t spend big bucks on advertising campaigns! You would be wasting your money. Just a side story: some ranking manipulation farms even go far and take advantage of this. They offer keyword-rank-manipulation service. They boost the ranking of an app by “searching” the app by specific keywords, tapping the app in the search results and download the app — the exact flow of conversion funnel. [Back] App Conversion Rates – Page View CR Now you know the importance of conversion rate, let’s see how we can improve them. Let’s do a recap: Page View CR = App Page Views / Impressions x 100% If Page View CR is less than 3%, you should try to improve it. 3%? Really? Yes, 3% sounds very low, but you won’t believe many apps have less than 1% we have seen! To improve Page View CR, focus on optimizing these metadata: App nameApp iconFirst 2 lines of app descriptionFirst 2 screenshots (or app preview video)App ratingsIt is because the app search result only shows these pieces of information. That means they are your baits to bring users to your app page. So make good use of them! [Back] App Conversion Rates – Download CR Now, let’s look at Download CR: Download CR = App Units / App Page Views x 100% Folks from SplitMetrics have done a wonderful job on this topic. They gathered the download conversion rates from hundreds of experiments with over 10,000,000 users. Here are the best conversion rates in each app category in their study:  Based on this graph, you should set your download CR target to at least 60% for most categories. For Health & Fitness and Education categories, you may set your target a bit lower to around 40% and 50% respectively. If your download CR is lower than the target benchmark, you should follow all tips in this article to improve this metric. App Store Optimization Tips: Benchmark Your Conversion RateUse this App Store Optimization tool to benchmark your app’s conversion rate (CR). It compares your download CR with your app category’s median and best CR, and tells you what you should do. [Back] App Size Try to make your app smaller than 100 MB. It is because users cannot download apps that are more than 100 MB using cellular service.  So for example, if a user on a bus or a train can’t download “now”, it is unlikely the user will write down the name and try again X hours later when they’re home. Need some proof? This post from appfigures shows that ~98% of the top 100 free and ~62% of paid iOS and Android games can be downloaded are under 100 MB. Do you think 100 MB is not enough for your app? Take a look at Clash of Clans. Its iOS version is just 85.3 MB. App Store Optimization Tips: Make Your App SmallerTo reduce the app size, consider compressing some of the graphical assets or make some of the contents downloadable after install. Compare with the Top 100 AppsDo you want to know how your app size compares to that of the top 100 apps? Use this App Store Optimization tool. It tells you whether your app size falls in the reasonable app size range of the top 100 apps. [Back] App Pricing – Free with In-App Purchases Making your app free can remove the friction for users to download your app. After all, what price is better than free? If you want to make money from your free app, consider In-App Purchase (IAP) pricing model if that makes sense to your app design. IAP account for 79% of app store revenue.  App Store Optimization Tips: New to In-App Purchase (IAP)?Check out this Do’s and Don’ts IAP Checklist. It can jump start your IAP design. Need In-App Purchase (IAP) Ideas?Here is a wonderful list of 40 IAP ideas for you to consider. [Back] App Pricing – Free with Ads If you choose to make in-app advertising revenue, try to use native ads. They are created to fit the exact context of the app they appear on. This way, they serve as extra content for the app itself rather than a piece of promotional materials. Check out this post to see more reasons why native ads are better than traditional banner ads. [Back] App Pricing – Paid Apps Use a reasonable price by comparing your app price with your competing apps. Also, take reference of the price range of the top apps in your app categories. A good starting price point to test the market is $0.99 or $1.99. Anything above $2.99 won’t make you a lot of money. The exception is Minecraft Pocket Edition, which is priced at $6.99. [Back] App Compatibility – iMessage For iOS apps, supporting iMessage App helps your app grow viral through the user’s phone contacts. You can also gain extra exposure in the App Store for iMessage.  Need ideas of how to use iMessage for your app? Check out how these 10 apps make use of iMessage integration for more ideas. [Back] App Compatibility – Apple Watch For iOS apps, supporting Apple Watch improves your app’s customer experience and user loyalty. But don’t just copy your original app features directly to your Apple Watch app. Make good use of the Apple Watch characteristics to improve your user experience. Need inspirations? Check out these 50 best Apple Watch apps. [Back] App Compatibility – Family Sharing For iOS apps, Apple offers the Family Sharing opt-in for app developers. Family Sharing allows up to six family members to share app purchases on the same credit card across devices and parents to supervise their children purchases. Supporting Family Sharing means you can reach more family members and improves user loyalty. Apple also clarifies that in-app purchases are not transferable through Family Sharing. Family members just the apps themselves. It means Family Sharing gives higher revenue potential for apps with in-app purchases. [Back] App Compatibility – Game Center Though Game Center app is removed since iOS 10, the Game Center service is still available. If you have an iOS game, you can make use of these Game Center features: LeaderboardAchievementsChallengesSaving GamesMatchmaking for multiplayer gamesThese features improve your game’s virality and user retention in many ways. [Back] App Updates Statistics show that there is a high correlation between high ratings and app update frequency. In fact, releasing regular updates has many benefits. It improves user loyalty and keeps an app top of mind because your app will show up in the updates list in the app stores. Apple and Google also like to see app updates because they show you’re committed to the app and that it’s still being maintained. How often should you update your app? Check out this chart first:  For these 25 top iOS apps, the average was about 30 days between updates. I’d recommend at least an update a month, and up to once a week. Don’t forget to use push notifications to alert users to new app updates. They have a big impact on your update downloads. Ideally, you should only send notifications to the users who haven’t downloaded your latest version. In case you can’t distinguish who have and who haven’t, you should word your message carefully to avoid the confusion. For examples, Hey! Have you checked for updates in the App Store recently?Updates! Are all your apps up to date? Check the Updates button in the App Store. Of course, you shouldn’t do an update just for the sake of doing an update. Your updates should always improve your app in some ways, either by bug fixings or enhancements. [Back] Apple App Store vs. Google Play If you wonder what are the differences between Apple App Store and Google Play on App Store Optimization, here is a great summary:  [Back] Putting It All Together Here is a cool infographic produced by Y Media Labs. It sums up the most important points about App Store Optimization.  After you have published the changes, keep an eye on the keyword rankings. The rankings change right after you published the new version. Target to make your app rank within top 10 of all keywords. If your new keywords are too hard to rank, you might have to replace them with your old keywords. Review your app store optimization every three weeks or four because that is when big trends change. Don’t give up if the results of first few optimizations are not turning out well. App marketing takes time and App Store Optimization needs many observations to master. Congratulations! You’ve read to the end of this mega post (~6,000 words). Give yourself a BIG hand! And I wish you good luck in your journey.  PS. If you are too busy to try out all these tips, just use this app store optimization tool. In less than 30 seconds, it automatically checks your app using app store optimization best practices and tells you how to improve. And it’s free :-)",2021-03-06T20:32:50.336Z,"How much does a good growth hacker charge? ",Quora

If you're up for reading can't recommend Brian Clifton’s Advanced Web Metrics with Google Analytics enough. For a short list of things that will clean up your (likely) mistakes in GA fast, check out Sean Murphy's blog post ""3 Ways You're Ruining Your Google Analytics Data, And How to Stop: A Data Scientist's Perspective."" I'll give you an unorthodox answer that may help you to understand how most of those growth hacking examples mentioned in other answers were born. Do Things That Don’t Scale!  First, let me give you a bit of context to help you understand what ""things that don't scale"" exactly means: A simple economic principle of scale is demonstrated by Elon Musk and the construction of the Gigafactory. The basic premise is that if you double the production of an item, the cost of production of each unit reduces by 22%. So if it cost $100 to build 1 battery, it costs $156 to build 2 batteries ($78 each unit).

First, let me give you a bit of context to help you understand what ""things that don't scale"" exactly means: A simple economic principle of scale is demonstrated by Elon Musk and the construction of the Gigafactory. The basic premise is that if you double the production of an item, the cost of production of each unit reduces by 22%. So if it cost $100 to build 1 battery, it costs $156 to build 2 batteries ($78 each unit). That’s scale. Doing things that don’t scale is really just doing something that you have to do over and over again, for the same gain each time. Now you're asking: Ok, but what that has to do with growth hacking? Here's the thing... You will rarely figure out a great growth hacking by just thinking about it or looking for other examples. Most growth hacking ideas will emerge from doing things that don't scale first. Why? Because the things that don't scale are usually the tatics that will get you closer to your customers and will provide you the insights that will let you later hack your growth. Want one example? Let's have a look at Tinder: Tinder have a great example of a marketing action that doesn’t scale, but which was almost integral in the success of the app. When Tinder was being launched, the founders ran a series of exclusive parties across colleges in the US, with the only prerequisite being that you had downloaded the app. This activity didn’t scale because each party only initiated the same number of required downloads. Does that make sense? You invite 200 people to each party. They each download the app. That’s 200 downloads for each party. And the parties all cost the same. That’s something that doesn’t scale, but that put Tinder in a path to be the successful app that it's today: More than 40,000,000 downloads. Now, the parties weren’t the only form of marketing Tinder employed, but they were effective for a couple of reasons: They hit the ideal demographic for the app;They demonstrated exactly the purpose for the app;They fed into the mystic of Tinder.What Doesn’t Scale So what are some ideas of marketing exercises that fit the bill, that don’t scale up, but might nonetheless fit your business if you’re willing to work hard enough. Cold calling, it’s a grind, and its inefficient, but everyone does it because it works;Smash out some regular press releases;Organise launch and publicity parties;Form Street Teams who will push your product among their area of influence, often for no more recompense than free access to it;Talk to people who use your competition;Arrange user testing with real people, and listen to what they say.

Since communication plays a vital role in conversions, make sure that you reach out to your potential customers at least a week prior to your launch. Make New Brand PartnershipsAny small-medium company can develop an effective collaboration if it finds the right partner to bring value to its brand and vice versa. Partnerships even work for businesses that operate in very different industries. A great example is a partnership between Flipboard (a news app) and Airbnb ( a room sharing app) that allows users of one brand to leverage the strengths of the other partner. Build a Social Media Community Around Your Brand/ProductSocial media is an essential part of the marketing mix for businesses. You can leverage social media communities to promote yourself, receive market feedback and interact with industry influencers. It takes time to develop content and build an audience. For this, you must strive to align social media activities with the overall direction of your growth. Understanding growth hacking requires a paradigm shift away from traditional marketing. It’s a raw focus on growth numbers, best for startups getting off the ground. Growth hacking is what made Airbnb and Facebook the giants they are today. Growth hacking pros know how to leverage technical skills with almost a single-minded ability to focus. Your startup needs customers to survive. This brings us to our final and the most important point. Getting customers as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Growth hacking is reducing cost of customer acquisition through data-driven processes, some of which may be unconventional, and reducing customer churn.

You’d know how to look for and examine a hire for the position of developer, salesperson, plummer, baker… Interviews, questions, previous experience, references, looking at their previous work. But those are professions that have been around for decades. Growth hacking is a term that a guy coined to describe doing guerilla marketing with no ad budget a few years ago. It’s not even established as a real profession yet. The same metrics and measurements can’t be applied successfully. Go ahead and look at the previous projects and experience, but I think you should look for signs of creativity and adaptability more.

You want your growth hacker to truly know how to think outside of the box, or to rip the box apart, or to stick a QR code on the box, or to assemble the box out of business cards which people can rip off if they want.

Reasonable people will look at what a ""growth hacker"" does and recognize it as an intersection of Product Marketing (top of funnel SEO/SEM) and Product Management (viral and engaging features). There's no magical job description that will fix those problems for you, they just need to be learned by those teams and applied everywhere. Companies may forever hire people experienced in growth, but those people will live within two established disciplines.

A growth hack is useful if the company is targeting a new market segment.

Growth hacking refers to all the direct and indirect methods that we use to expand our business exponentially. Data drive growth hacking, and there is room for experiment, as every start-up faces different challenges. Growth hacking includes traditional marketing methods, introducing a new feature to attract clients, automation using tools like Optimizer and facilitating the clients with tools like Calendr. Growth hacking allows for out of the box, unique and bold steps to achieve growth. This is the reason that it is very diverse, and updates daily with new developments. It requires creativity to find unique and unprecedented solutions to a common problem. Examples The Uber started as a ride-sharing service. It allowed referrals from the persons you knew and offered extensive discounts to people who invited their friends to Uber. This is a classic growth hack, but it required creativity for use in a cab service start-up. Sometimes sales run low in different businesses. For example, suppose you are involved with garments or textile. In that case, some seasons are generally off due to fewer vacations or the season. Businesses go around to tackle such stagnancy by introducing new trends now and then. The trendy dresses or costumes draw in enough money or revenue to sustain the unit or industry in the off-season. The Growth Hack for Conversion The dilemma of arranging meetings can explain the best example of a growth hack. We know how it feels. We have been there too. After putting in months of hard work and sleepless night, when you launch your website or business, you receive many leads. The problem which arises is that these leads do not always convert. The ones that convert will lose track in the emailing for setting a meeting as it takes longer. The best way to lure them in is to Install Calendr, a meeting scheduler that helps book slots for sessions or calls. The use of Calendr worked wonders for us. Our team was able to convert more leads, generate more sales, and improve reputation by the intimacy provided by Calendr. There are many ways to growth hack. You have to be vigilant and attentive to apply your mind in the best possible way. It might sound funny in the end, though because the solution is always in front of us. Email Campaigns Cold emails or email campaigns can also be growth hacks if used wisely. Usually, businesses launch and then realize that they lack the necessary marketing and hacks. Our team suggests that you scrape data using software for email campaigns before you launch. We also recommend that you already make the email copies and landing pages. This will give you a head start as you have the opportunity to engage more leads from the very inception. Conclusion Growth hacks do not work unless you do. It is your creativity and leadership that pays dividends in the end. Growth hacking is exciting as you can learn with work. The room for the experiment should make you comfortable. Do not give up; you will always find a solution. Hi everyone,  I Hacked Medium. Yes I did it. And here is how:  It has actually started 2 months ago.

I was working in a startup and searching for things to read. I heard Medium before and also had written a story in here but did not focus on it so much. When I re-visited the site, I loved the things that I read. That makes me comfortable like finding my soul-mate. And then I had started to search for the popular ones and found the listings that Medium prepared. There are listings for every months’ top stories but I could not understand what “top” means there. I searched for a filter that I can find the most recommended ones. And I could not find it. That was the AHA MOMENT for me. Yes, I found the most popular term in startup ecosystem— Aha Moment. As I am not a developer and do not know Medium’s API are open or not, I started to write articles that I find in every month’s top stories till December. I had written them with their writer, estimated read time, publications and tags. It took 20 days to complete and when I finished the listing, there were 1102 stories on my excel sheet. I also put the ones which were popular in December by checking Medium Daily Digest emails. And the adventure began… I prepared excel sheets and listed them separately through their writers, tags, publications and estimated times to give the whole list as a Holiday Gift to you. This had taken my 2 days and the listing was finished on the 27 December. As I want to know the medium writers more, I want to get your emails and give an ebook to you related to the most popular ones. I opened up a website named bestarticles.xyz with the assistance of my friend and we pushed the start button for the growth. At the end (29 December), we had a website and a folder which includes .pdf files that include stories which have more the 500 recommendations. Also, we had a Google Document link. Growth Strategy I know that in the content marketing if writing a content takes your 20 minutes, sharing should take 80 minutes above 100. Everyone should aim to spread their content. If you do not want much more people to read your story, I can ask you to learn the purpose of your writing. So, I know 2016 will be the year of CX and as I am a customer focused guy I read so many things related to this topic. I also read the book Delivering Happiness twice and know the effect of WOWing people.(Thanks, Zappos) I am a Random Act of Wower(#raow) and wanted to give people personalized messages before their holidays. I have a whiteboard in my room and with the advice of my friend, I had written “Happy Holidays X” messages. I and my mother(Thanks, MOM!) wrote 300 names to this board in 7 hours. Here are the some results: My two articles (the shortest and the longest one) had 467 recommendations and 11k view.My shortest story was published by Life Learning with the assistance ofChad Grills and this led to increasing my recommendations also.I send close to 3000 tweets, I have got 250 new Twitter followers and my tweets had over 100k impressions. That means I have 250 new friends.My Medium followers increased to 464. Close to 300 new followers.My story was uploaded to HackerNews also and it had 35 upvotes.Close to 500 emails were subscribed to our email list and close to 1.000 people see my Google Document.I got three job offers. :)If you want to read the full post, you can read it from here also with pictures.

This doesn't really embody what someone working in growth would need to do every day. And even that depends on whether the position is about building product or running marketing experiments, which are different areas of focus within growth. How are you identifying candidates? Referrals generally represent the best source of candidates, and the trick is making it scale. You don't know much of anything about the people in such a contest. Compare this to open engineering challenges, the kind many top companies have put online. The difference is that answering the engineering challenge is inherently qualifying the lead and selling the company at the same time. That hits on another issue in hiring: managing your time to get results. At Dropbox (product), the overhead of reading poor quality entries to the engineering challenge outweighed the hiring benefit from that channel. Your time is better spent elsewhere. Finally, you want to find people that might be able to grow into a role. This means people that are in marketing or engineering that want to focus on growth. You need to consider advancement in careers, not just looking at people that are currently focused on growth. This means your search area is broader than you think. All together, the best tools are the same as those for hiring for any role. Identify your need, tap your network to find qualified candidates, and manage your time to reach your goals.

Here is how to tell you are ready to hire a growth hacker. 1. You have achieved product/market fit Don’t go looking for a growth hacker if you haven’t built a great product or service that customers want. You’ll be wasting money on bringing leads that either won’t convert or churn. Instead, your product must resonate with a target audience and demonstrate strong organic adoption. 2. You have a scalable business The investment in hiring a growth hacker is justified if your business is scalable. What does that really mean? There are two attributes that make a business scalable: operating leverage, in other words the potential to grow revenue with minimal incremental cost, and large addressable market. 3. You have infrastructure and processes in place You need to make sure you are in a strong position as an organization to handle growth. If you begin to grow without a healthy technical foundation and structure and documentation around operational processes, you will find your resources stretched thin, impacting your customer service levels and reputation. 4. You know how to scale your team As you move into the next growth phase, you will need additional resources. Have you identified the key operational areas that you will need to build up? Do you know where to go to get the talent you need? If you start thinking about these questions after you see strong growth, it will be too late and you will be time-pressured into making bad hires. 5. You know how to fund your growth You need to understand your path to profitability, how much financial runway you have, and your options for getting additional funding. Forecast what your revenues and costs may look like in a fast growth scenario, so you understand the size of the potential financing gap before you invest in hiring a growth hacker. 6. You have adopted a growth mindset The mindset of small bets, quick iteration, and creative thinking is a hallmark of growth hackers. To work with them effectively, you need to be comfortable with their approach. Accept their methodology of testing potential growth drivers and be prepared that it will take time and some failures before they can identify scalable and profitable customer acquisition channels for your business. 7. You understand growth yourself As for any other role, you should not hire a growth hacker without first sitting down and making a conscious effort to educate yourself on the basics. Without understanding the fundamentals of growth hacking, you won’t know how to evaluate and manage a growth hacker, resulting in a bad hire and damage to your bottom line.",2021-03-06T20:42:39.462Z,"What are the best practices in managing growth hackers?

6043e967ed76476feda37bdf,https://www.quora.com/What-NGOs-have-the-best-growth-hackers?-,"If you want to find our whether the growth hacker you are looking to hire is legit, run him through a thorough interview process and a trial. 1. Evaluate experience and skills in an interview Track record. Having outstanding results differentiates real growth hackers from impostors. Your growth hacker should prove her worth by providing examples of how he crushed it. Probe deeply and ask follow-up questions to gain further insights into the candidate’s competence, behavior, and thought process: How did you come up with the idea?How did you execute it?What made it successful?What you could have done differently?Don’t settle for factual information. Get to the ‘why’ behind the candidate’s answers. Strong candidates will give you a detailed answer with specific metrics, a step-by-step process, and the reasoning they followed. Foundational knowledge. Explore the level of the candidate’s foundational marketing knowledge, as well as the expertise in specific channels relevant to your situation. What do you do to understand behavior of your target customers?How do you prioritize your experiments?Take me in detail through your most compelling PPC campaignCreativity. To test creativity, throw new situations at the candidate because previous experiences can easily be embellished. Put your company’s or a hypothetical funnel on a whiteboard and ask what they would do to improve it. How would you acquire more users?How would you increase engagement?Look for those candidates who are able to keep coming up with new, actionable, and relevant tactics to exploit, rather than those who are pulling from the list from a blog article in the back of their head. Analytical skills. To test analytical skills, show them a report of an ad campaign you are running. What should we do? How can we optimize it?Listen for an ability to explain data clearly and draw insights to move forward, rather than focusing on the ‘right’ answer. 2. Try out the candidate in a work situation In his book Work Rules!, Laszlo Bock, former SVP of People Operations at Google, says that the best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work sample. This makes sense since the actual work the candidate will be doing doesn’t consist of answering questions in a one-on-one setting. By getting them to do some real work, you are making sure the growth hacker you are hiring can produce the required level of output and has the skills needed for the role. Take-home assignment. If it’s not practical to do an onsite trial, ask the growth hacker to do a home assignment. Here are a few possibilities: Ask them to give you a short write-up on what they would do in the first 90 days after they come into the role.Write up an assignment with a real-life situation that they would be working on once they join, say, optimizing performance in one of the channels, and include relevant data. Then ask for their thoughts and analysis.One day/half-day onsite trial. If your interview process is sufficiently rigorous, you may not need more than a day (or even a half-day) of working together to see if a potential hire has the skills, work ethic, and personality to be a good fit. Having the candidate work in your office and around your team helps you gauge many things that you won’t get a feel for in a take-home assignment, such as how well the candidate collaborates with others, deals with uncertainty, and “hacks” his way forward. Your growth hacker candidate most likely has a full-time job, so ask her to take a day off. Prepare a specific problem to work on, ideally a challenge currently faced by your business, and work together. For example, at Canva, if the candidate passes the interview, he is first given a home assignment, consisting of growth hacking-related questions. Should the candidate do well on the home assignment, he is invited for a half-day onsite challenge. One-week trial. Most startups think they don’t have the luxury of doing a one-week onsite trial with candidates, but if you consider what’s at stake, it may be something worth looking into. A week can give you an even better appreciation of the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses and screen out those candidates that can’t walk the talk. Freelance/contract trial. You can take an even slower approach to hiring a growth hacker by having him work on a project a small number of hours each week on the side of his current full-time job, usually at night or over the weekend. The trial period in this case can last a few weeks. While the trial can’t guarantee that the growth hacker you will bring onboard will work out, when combined with other data points in your evaluation process, it increases your chances of making the right hire.

Since both smartphone and mobile web usage continue to grow, the Internet has now become a truly “mobile-first” experience. Actually, mobile devices already account for more than half of the worldwide web traffic nowadays, while their users represent almost half of the population. Given these numbers, having at least a responsive design of your website should be your priority - otherwise, you might be easily missing out on mobile conversions.Take advantage of popups/push notifications. You have to use them wisely, though - otherwise, they are likely to annoy your site visitors. It might help to identify where your users drop off first, and then tailor all your messages and incentives to the desired user flow. Keep the number of such messages reasonable, though - bombarding your visitors can definitely do more harm than good. Leverage chatbots. The ability to chat live with your reps can help you build trust among your website visitors, especially since many buyers might need help with completing a transaction. You can also use it to start the conversation yourself and encourage your visitors to take the desired action. Try Chatbotize to create your first chatbot in just a few clicks.Display any kind of social proof on your website. Given that positive online reviews are likely to influence buying decisions, featuring them on your website can easily increase trust and help you sell more. It’s mostly because your customers’ recommendations usually mean much more to other buyers than that pretty much anything you say about your business yourself. If you want to engage and convert your visitors with social proof, try crowdy.ai.There are plenty of minor changes you can make on your website. In some cases, though, small CRO tweaks might no longer be working. If you struggle with increasing your sales - don’t waste more time and turn to specialists. Growcode is a great example, thanks to its unique approach that targets 3 forms of revenue with guaranteed results. Jeremy Liew in Lightspeed Partners is certainly one of them. There's a recent post on their blog which contains some of this thinking on the subject (amongst other topics): http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/2011-consumer-internet-predictions/ SimilarWeb.com - Competitive Intelligence Tool",2021-03-06T20:43:39.790Z,"Who are the leading growth hackers in e-commerce?

In my humble opinion “Growth Hacking” is truly a new spin on an old idea… What do I mean? Compare what growth hacking actually is, it’s methods and overall ethos and you will see that it is almost identical to Guerilla Marketing first conceptualized in the early 1980’s by Jay Conrad Levinson. There are some subtle differences but not enough IMHO to say they are completely different ideas. Sometimes referred to as growth marketing or even growth hacking marketing, it is the relative newest buzzword describing a type of DIY / shoestring budget marketing, advertising, influencer outreach or even unconventional publicity seeking that focuses on leveraging the internet to create a loyal audience / or customer base that help create viral marketing through word of mouth for the hyper-growth of a business, a cause or other such event… In business, It’s focus is on pure growth of the said business with quantifiable conversion numbers and ROI. It’s NOT, I repeat, it’s NOT just brand awareness absent of any hard conversion measurement or trackable ROI. This alone is why ALL CEO’s need to be Growth Hackers and why a good Growth Hacker would make a good CEO. if we look at Google Trends for the search term “Growth Hacking” you can plainly see there was a sudden surge and spike in the worldwide search volume right around 2012 where it shot up at a steep angle… Before this time there was almost NO search volume for it at all… Why?  The rumor is that a guy named Sean Ellis coined the term “Growth Hacker” in 2010, but it seems that it took about a year or so before the term “Growth Hacking” really caught on and embedded itself into our lexicon of new marketing styles and methodologies. When Sean Ellis coined the term he also wrote this great article entitled “Find a Growth Hacker for Your Startup“. I encourage everyone revisit Guerrilla Marketing and compare it to what is called Growth Hacking today. The only major difference between Growth Hacking and Guerilla Marketing in my mind is the type of technology used and how it is used. Growth Hacking tends to be a bit more cutting edge on the use of internet technology, viral marketing automation, conversion rate tracking and optimization and use of social media overall. But I only think it seems this way because Guerilla Marketing has been around since the mid 80’s and so was not born of the instant info on demand and very accurate and granular conversion rate tracking that Growth Hacking was born into. Overall the principles are the same as well as the overall all ethos. Another more subtle difference between growth hacking and guerilla marketing is that Growth Hackers tend to focus on not only marketing their products and services but making their products and services addictive and / or habit forming so there is a high rate of continued use, repeat sales and word of mouth referrals from currently hooked customers. So essentially, with Growth Hackers, virality is built right into the product and / or service itself and not just in the marketing of the said product or service. This is how it should be. If a product or service has a viral nature to it within itself it just means is is a by-product of maximum value delivered. It’s part “new shiny object” aka “new buzz word” part “extreme efficiency in the use of limited resources” part “cult of personality” part “same thing – new name” part “leveraging The amazing new social media tech” part “gray hat marketing” part “controversial soundbite tactics” part “the exploitation of and capitalizing on current events” part “annoying internet memes” part “being outrageous” and part “smarmy, snarky, attitude” all rolled into one giant mass that equals GENIUS AND RELENTLESS BUSINESS GROWTH… I hope this helps paint a clear picture, from one man’s perspective, of what growth hacking truly is… Thanks for Reading -Keith Gill Growth, like sales and marketing, is one of those odd professions where you can charge whatever you like, as long as you generate more than that for the client.

The Interview The goal of the interview is to get to know the candidate to the extent that you can assess whether or not to invite him/her for the trial day. Focus on these four dimensions: Skillset — do we think he/she has the necessary skills for the role?Growth Hacker DNA — does she/he think like a growth hacker?Mindset — growth mindset, entrepreneurial, curious, ambitious, hungry, work ethic etc.Personality — do we expect he/she will fit well within the team?Next up is a list of questions that trigger insight in one or more of these dimensions. This list has been growing ever since the first day I started interviewing candidates and will continue to be expanded. I will update this answers regularly. For every question, I’ll define a high-level range of answers you ideally want the candidate’s answer to fall within. Note that this is just an indication. There is no right or wrong and the profile I’m eyeing for a growth role might differ from yours. The order of questions as listed here, is random. What are the latest apps you’ve installed on your phone? What are some apps you use a lot? This is to gauge how much of an early-adopter, how technology-curious our candidate is.What are your favourite marketing tools? Same idea, but more job-specific.What book are you reading right now? To dig in hunger for learning, growth mindset. They should be reading something right now or at least say they are. A good growth hacker is a little bit subversive, he or she is willing to portray reality as it suits them as long as the negative side-effects are minimal. Saying you’re reading something right now while you’ve actually already finished the book is an example of such subversiveness.What does your ideal vacation look like? We’re looking for adventurers that travel regularly and far rather than beach tanners who always go to the same places.What are your strong points as growth marketer? To find out where they situate within the T-shaped profile. Are they landing page builders, PPC-experts, what’s their experience with Adwords, Facebook Ads, copywriting, virality etc. More interesting that the actual skills is to get a feel of how they think of themselves and how they talk about themselves. They should have a fair degree of self-confidence, but at the same time a degree of humbleness that is required to learn from interacting with reality.What are you not good at? Self-awareness is key. You want people that are humble, aware of their flaws and determined to turn flaws into strengths.What have been the biggest setbacks in your life and how did you handle them? To understand what your candidate’s priorities are and how much resilience they have to bounce back.We want to sell more growth hacking workshops to big companies in retail. How would you approach this challenge? They don’t have to come up with a waterproof strategy, but you’ll want to gain insight in how they perform under pressure and unforeseen challenges as well as inform ourselves on how they think and how they move from high-level idea to possible actions.Tell us about your previous job. Why are you not there anymore? To understand the candidate’s motivations and personal journey so far. How does your company fit into their life’s path? This question is meant to be a conversation starter. Ask lots of why’s.Acquisition, activation, retention, referral, revenue. What would you optimize first and why? Calls them out if they have no idea what the pirate funnel is (this happened already), then provides in how much they understand it as a driver for growth. There is no right or wrong answer, this can be different in multiple contexts, make them feel they shouldn’t be afraid to be wrong. Your goal is to have a conversation about the different stages and how they influence one another. That being said, it’s rarely a good idea to focus on acquisition first, except in very early stages of startups where they need to acquire traffic to gain data about landing pages and product. To make it more tangible, you can present a particular company, business model or even a full-fledged case.What does ‘growth’ mean for this company? An abstract question to get them to lay out the funnel of the company and the metrics that indicate various stages - as well as areas to focus on and what improvements in one stage of the funnel mean for the rest of it.What’s your definition of growth hacking? This understanding is key. Start a conversation on the topic of growth, experiment design in a broader context, how it’s different from digital marketing, the relevance of it to startups and corporates. They need to get it’s about rapid experimentation to validate ideas, while at the same time maintaining focus on the bigger strategical picture (i.e. not losing oneself in needless experimentation), as well as resources vs. possible impact.Do you have any experience in giving workshops and/or public speaking? Immediately relevant if you’re an agency because of workshops that have to be conducted with clients.How do you see your role here? To understand the extent to which the candidate is aligned with what will be expected of him or her. Steer the resulting conversation onto their strengths and weaknesses and how both would influence their role within the company.What are some of the coolest things you’ve done in marketing and/or growth? This question can tell us a lot: what they’ve actually done, what they find important, how impressed they are with themselves.What’s the last experiment you’ve run in your personal life? Measures the learning-by-doing mindset as well as attention to detail and habit-building.What’s your favourite growth hacking story and why? To get an idea of their main influences, as well as a starting point for us as interviewers to dig into their overall vision on growth. Everyone has a different one and that’s okay but understanding each variation and aligning it to our own is key.What publications and/or growth marketers are you inspired by? What do they read, who do they follow and in the first place: do they read and follow at all?How many ideas to grow this company can you come up with in 5 minutes? See how well they perform under pressure, how well they know the agency and prepared for the interview, how creative they are. Start a conversation about the ideas after. You can make it more specific by having them focus on a particular part of the funnel or an immediate problem the company is currently experiencing.Where do you see yourself in three years? Reveals their ambitions priorities as well as the fit with the company in the context of their own personal life.Where do you get your best ideas? We’re looking for people who think about this kind of stuff and try to optimize their daily routines for it. Ideally they also have a Trello board or notepad or something else to store their inspirations.Have candidates fill in the personality test: https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-testThough you are free to ask the candidate all these questions, I wouldn’t recommend it. Not just because that would be a long ass interview, but also because you should leave some margin for spontaneity to unfold. Your goal is to get to know the person in front of you, why they are sitting there, what the scenario of them working with you would mean for them and their life’s path. If the candidate’s motivations, personality, mindset and reported skillset match your requirements, you can move on to inviting them for a trial day. Trial Day The trial day is to confirm assumptions about the four dimensions that have emerged during the interview, as well as deepen the ones related to growth hacker DNA and skillset. Here’s a list of possible trial day assignments to choose from. I recommend making new combinations of these assignments for every trial day so you can filter out best assignments and weed out the best ones. As well as add new ones.

Answer format: LP in Instapage, Unbounce or similar. Look out for structure, copywriting (they should fill in the headlines) and CRO best practices.The Bullshit Test: How does YouTube / Airbnb / Uber / … grow? Ask the candidate to take a whiteboard marker and draw the flow of a digital product like YouTube: how is their growth engineered? We want the candidate to think out loud and draw the flow in real-time. This is to measure how good they actually understand growth and its mechanisms versus. how good they are at simply reciting blog posts. This exercise does not have to be perfect. This question is not to be asked on the exercise sheet upfront but to be asked out of the blue after the candidate presented their exercises.You’re assigned to grow an Ecommerce / SaaS / platform / .... How would you setup their dashboard? What metrics would you mainly track? Answer format: sketch on paper with explanation (in text or verbally at the time). Observing what metrics they choose per type of business will tell you a lot of about how much they understand the structure and business model of each. This is key to understanding how they can be grown.We’re big fans of side-project marketing. Try to come up with at least three ideas for a side-project. Answer format: text. Side-project marketing is where you develop little tools that scratch a particular itch of your target audience. You make them available for free (e-mail address opt-in or retargeting on Facebook) and leverage them as lead magnets for qualified traffic.Based on their website, traffic channels and whatever else you can find on them: put together a minimum growth strategy for [company]? Have them focus on channels, how they would use those channels, why those channels and how they fit together within a bigger picture strategy.Take a look at our Google Analytics. What does the data tell you about our funnel and what are your recommendations to optimize it? Ability to read and understand data, turn data into insights and insights into tactics.What would you do in your first 90 days on the job? Investigates candidate’s understanding of the job and the challenges he/she will need to tackle. Gives a glimpse in their strategic ability: how they fit different parts of growth together so they complement in each other going in the right direction.I take between 3 and 5 items from this list to put together a trial day, depending on how much work I feel each assignment should take. The trial days I’ve been running usually were between 4 and 6 hours. No applicant has ever managed to finish all assignments I’d given them, but that’s okay. It’s part of the trial process. I give them more work than they can handle to observe how they manage that additional pressure. It’s up to them to decide if they rather do all 5 exercises poorly or just 3 out of 5 but very well. I tend to prefer applicants that focus on quality over quantity but always give candidates the chance to motivate the approaches they’ve taken. When a candidate didn’t finish all tasks on the trial day itself, but does finish them at them and sends them over later, that’s a definite plus. Have more questions that could complete this list?

The best growth hackers have an excellent intuition about user psychology enabling them to make better hypotheses. They’re also extremely resourceful when validating hypotheses. They’ll learn everything from SQL to Optimizely to find out whether they’re right. The most common trait I’ve seen is their ability to move on from failure fast. Growth hackers don’t think about failure. They just keep testing because their success depends on how fast they validate their hypotheses. In turn, the best growth hackers have a history lined with many failures, but because they were so persistent on improving, they found big wins. Moreover, the best growth hackers know psychology better than people who have a P.h.D in the subject. They obsess over it - read hundreds of books, analyze every online and in-person touch point, and often collaborate about new psychological tactics. This obsession gives them the rare gift of testing foresight. For most people, they need, at least, several years of growth hacking experience to acquire these strong predictive powers.

Probe deeply and ask follow-up questions to gain further insights into the candidate’s competence, behavior, and thought process: How did you come up with the idea?How did you execute it?What made it successful?What you could have done differently?Don’t settle for factual information. Get to the ‘why’ behind the candidate’s answers. Strong candidates will give you a detailed answer with specific metrics, a step-by-step process, and the reasoning they followed. Foundational knowledge. Explore the level of the candidate’s foundational marketing knowledge, as well as the expertise in specific channels relevant to your situation. What do you do to understand behavior of your target customers?How do you prioritize your experiments?Take me in detail through your most compelling PPC campaignCreativity. To test creativity, throw new situations at the candidate because previous experiences can easily be embellished. Put your company’s or a hypothetical funnel on a whiteboard and ask what they would do to improve it. How would you acquire more users?How would you increase engagement?Look for those candidates who are able to keep coming up with new, actionable, and relevant tactics to exploit, rather than those who are pulling from the list from a blog article in the back of their head. Analytical skills. To test analytical skills, show them a report of an ad campaign you are running. What should we do? How can we optimize it?Listen for an ability to explain data clearly and draw insights to move forward, rather than focusing on the ‘right’ answer. 2. Try out the candidate in a work situation In his book Work Rules!, Laszlo Bock, former SVP of People Operations at Google, says that the best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work sample. This makes sense since the actual work the candidate will be doing doesn’t consist of answering questions in a one-on-one setting. By getting them to do some real work, you are making sure the growth hacker you are hiring can produce the required level of output and has the skills needed for the role. Take-home assignment. If it’s not practical to do an onsite trial, ask the growth hacker to do a home assignment. Here are a few possibilities: Ask them to give you a short write-up on what they would do in the first 90 days after they come into the role.Write up an assignment with a real-life situation that they would be working on once they join, say, optimizing performance in one of the channels, and include relevant data. Then ask for their thoughts and analysis.One day/half-day onsite trial. If your interview process is sufficiently rigorous, you may not need more than a day (or even a half-day) of working together to see if a potential hire has the skills, work ethic, and personality to be a good fit. Having the candidate work in your office and around your team helps you gauge many things that you won’t get a feel for in a take-home assignment, such as how well the candidate collaborates with others, deals with uncertainty, and “hacks” his way forward. Your growth hacker candidate most likely has a full-time job, so ask her to take a day off. Prepare a specific problem to work on, ideally a challenge currently faced by your business, and work together. For example, at Canva, if the candidate passes the interview, he is first given a home assignment, consisting of growth hacking-related questions. Should the candidate do well on the home assignment, he is invited for a half-day onsite challenge. One-week trial. Most startups think they don’t have the luxury of doing a one-week onsite trial with candidates, but if you consider what’s at stake, it may be something worth looking into. A week can give you an even better appreciation of the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses and screen out those candidates that can’t walk the talk. Freelance/contract trial. You can take an even slower approach to hiring a growth hacker by having him work on a project a small number of hours each week on the side of his current full-time job, usually at night or over the weekend. The trial period in this case can last a few weeks. While the trial can’t guarantee that the growth hacker you will bring onboard will work out, when combined with other data points in your evaluation process, it increases your chances of making the right hire.

It’s only the planning and strategizing that provides you an oasis in this scramble of competitive desert. 1. Know your Customers:  To understand the customers gives you a strategic edge while planning a sales campaign. The more accurate data  you have, greater are the chances of your success. This information will give you an insight of your customer's behavior, their requirements and about their demographics - that will further steer your major business growth decisions and allow you to map a marketing plan.  2. Foresee the Marketing Environment:  To have an understanding of your customer is essential, but there may also some business opportunities in the corner that emerge as a result of changing global scenarios. For example, in the wake of environment awareness, if your business provide eco friendly solutions, you can gear a worldwide promotion of your brand and company as a whole. 3. Customize Your Services For The Customers:  Having worked on marketing plan, now it’s high time to be assured that your product or services are providing solutions to your customers in real terms. Instead of tailoring and presenting things in the way the customer wants. often startups fall into the trap of making the product the way they want to sell. Be customer centric!  4. Design Targeting Advertising & Customer Communications:  In the competitive era of business, placing a few advertisements on billboards or online is not gonna make any difference to be get noticed. Consumers are bombarded with thousands of marketing promotions and they take less and less notice. You need to do something pretty special to stand out of the crowd. In order to appeal your targeted audience, make sure that your messages are clear and highly creative. 5. Human Capital:  Your employees are your assets - provide them proper training and fix their roles they need to be more efficient in their their tasks. From the receptionist to your sales rep, be assured that they are self driven and motivated, provide them the tools they need and make them feel responsible for their roles in the complete business plan. If every individual is integrated , your business will grow very much itself.  6. Have a Pricing Strategy  Pricing is a powerful strategy for sales acceleration- decide what you are your goals and what message you want to convey by fixing your price at a certain level. High prices means that you may possibly sell less, on the other hand it gives the impression of a premium product. Similarly, low prices gives you a breakthrough to dominate a particular market, although it leads to low profitability in a short term. Be aware that pricing is a segment of this whole strategy, and position it wisely in your marketing plan.  7. Respond to Complaints Well  Be highly committed to give customers an excellent experience of your services. If there is a complaint - respond quickly and positively. Always remember that your brand image can be damaged if people spread bad word about your business. A complaint if handled well may consequently turn the person into a loyal customer. Surprise and delight your customers by going above and beyond the call of duty for them. Always focus on building trust as it is a powerful selling tool. 8. Start prospecting to kickstart your sales campaign Sales prospecting is the logical next step of your growth hacking startegy. You need to generate high quality data concerning your targeted audience. For that no need to google it or extract all leads manually. Only need a prospecting tool that do it for you in a simple click.  Prospecting tools extract very accurate data on social media such as Linkedin, Xing, Crunchbase, Github, Viadeo or Twitter and export them to CRM or CSV file. The best prospecting software on the market right now is Salesfinder - #1 Social Prospecting Platform as it generate up to 70% verified email addresses and export them to pretty much all CRM.",2021-03-06T21:34:47.768Z,"What tools can be used to find the best growth hacker?

CRO, SEO, SEA, SMM, SMA, content marketing, email marketing.This is no easy task and usually even one requires months to be even slightly on ""professional"" niveau. Most growth marketers do come from digital marketing fields. This is not a role open for beginners in marketing. I'll give you an unorthodox answer that may help you to understand how most of those growth hacking examples mentioned in other answers were born. Do Things That Don’t Scale!  First, let me give you a bit of context to help you understand what ""things that don't scale"" exactly means: A simple economic principle of scale is demonstrated by Elon Musk and the construction of the Gigafactory. The basic premise is that if you double the production of an item, the cost of production of each unit reduces by 22%. So if it cost $100 to build 1 battery, it costs $156 to build 2 batteries ($78 each unit).

First, let me give you a bit of context to help you understand what ""things that don't scale"" exactly means: A simple economic principle of scale is demonstrated by Elon Musk and the construction of the Gigafactory. The basic premise is that if you double the production of an item, the cost of production of each unit reduces by 22%. So if it cost $100 to build 1 battery, it costs $156 to build 2 batteries ($78 each unit). That’s scale. Doing things that don’t scale is really just doing something that you have to do over and over again, for the same gain each time. Now you're asking: Ok, but what that has to do with growth hacking? Here's the thing... You will rarely figure out a great growth hacking by just thinking about it or looking for other examples. Most growth hacking ideas will emerge from doing things that don't scale first. Why? Because the things that don't scale are usually the tatics that will get you closer to your customers and will provide you the insights that will let you later hack your growth. Want one example? Let's have a look at Tinder: Tinder have a great example of a marketing action that doesn’t scale, but which was almost integral in the success of the app. When Tinder was being launched, the founders ran a series of exclusive parties across colleges in the US, with the only prerequisite being that you had downloaded the app. This activity didn’t scale because each party only initiated the same number of required downloads. Does that make sense? You invite 200 people to each party. They each download the app. That’s 200 downloads for each party. And the parties all cost the same. That’s something that doesn’t scale, but that put Tinder in a path to be the successful app that it's today: More than 40,000,000 downloads. Now, the parties weren’t the only form of marketing Tinder employed, but they were effective for a couple of reasons: They hit the ideal demographic for the app;They demonstrated exactly the purpose for the app;They fed into the mystic of Tinder.What Doesn’t Scale So what are some ideas of marketing exercises that fit the bill, that don’t scale up, but might nonetheless fit your business if you’re willing to work hard enough. Cold calling, it’s a grind, and its inefficient, but everyone does it because it works;Smash out some regular press releases;Organise launch and publicity parties;Form Street Teams who will push your product among their area of influence, often for no more recompense than free access to it;Talk to people who use your competition;Arrange user testing with real people, and listen to what they say.

(Note: Big 'ole platforms like Salesforce probably aren't your best bet.) - Development: This isn't technically a ""need to have,"" but the more you can know about how to code (even if you're not a full time developer), the more successful you'll be. - Writing: You don't have to be Shakespeare. In fact, it's probably best if you aren't. But coherent sentences and proper grammar are a must.

The Interview The goal of the interview is to get to know the candidate to the extent that you can assess whether or not to invite him/her for the trial day. Focus on these four dimensions: Skillset — do we think he/she has the necessary skills for the role?Growth Hacker DNA — does she/he think like a growth hacker?Mindset — growth mindset, entrepreneurial, curious, ambitious, hungry, work ethic etc.Personality — do we expect he/she will fit well within the team?Next up is a list of questions that trigger insight in one or more of these dimensions. This list has been growing ever since the first day I started interviewing candidates and will continue to be expanded. I will update this answers regularly. For every question, I’ll define a high-level range of answers you ideally want the candidate’s answer to fall within. Note that this is just an indication. There is no right or wrong and the profile I’m eyeing for a growth role might differ from yours. The order of questions as listed here, is random. What are the latest apps you’ve installed on your phone? What are some apps you use a lot? This is to gauge how much of an early-adopter, how technology-curious our candidate is.What are your favourite marketing tools? Same idea, but more job-specific.What book are you reading right now? To dig in hunger for learning, growth mindset. They should be reading something right now or at least say they are. A good growth hacker is a little bit subversive, he or she is willing to portray reality as it suits them as long as the negative side-effects are minimal. Saying you’re reading something right now while you’ve actually already finished the book is an example of such subversiveness.What does your ideal vacation look like? We’re looking for adventurers that travel regularly and far rather than beach tanners who always go to the same places.What are your strong points as growth marketer? To find out where they situate within the T-shaped profile. Are they landing page builders, PPC-experts, what’s their experience with Adwords, Facebook Ads, copywriting, virality etc. More interesting that the actual skills is to get a feel of how they think of themselves and how they talk about themselves. They should have a fair degree of self-confidence, but at the same time a degree of humbleness that is required to learn from interacting with reality.What are you not good at? Self-awareness is key. You want people that are humble, aware of their flaws and determined to turn flaws into strengths.What have been the biggest setbacks in your life and how did you handle them? To understand what your candidate’s priorities are and how much resilience they have to bounce back.We want to sell more growth hacking workshops to big companies in retail. How would you approach this challenge? They don’t have to come up with a waterproof strategy, but you’ll want to gain insight in how they perform under pressure and unforeseen challenges as well as inform ourselves on how they think and how they move from high-level idea to possible actions.Tell us about your previous job. Why are you not there anymore? To understand the candidate’s motivations and personal journey so far. How does your company fit into their life’s path? This question is meant to be a conversation starter. Ask lots of why’s.Acquisition, activation, retention, referral, revenue. What would you optimize first and why? Calls them out if they have no idea what the pirate funnel is (this happened already), then provides in how much they understand it as a driver for growth. There is no right or wrong answer, this can be different in multiple contexts, make them feel they shouldn’t be afraid to be wrong. Your goal is to have a conversation about the different stages and how they influence one another. That being said, it’s rarely a good idea to focus on acquisition first, except in very early stages of startups where they need to acquire traffic to gain data about landing pages and product. To make it more tangible, you can present a particular company, business model or even a full-fledged case.What does ‘growth’ mean for this company? An abstract question to get them to lay out the funnel of the company and the metrics that indicate various stages - as well as areas to focus on and what improvements in one stage of the funnel mean for the rest of it.What’s your definition of growth hacking? This understanding is key. Start a conversation on the topic of growth, experiment design in a broader context, how it’s different from digital marketing, the relevance of it to startups and corporates. They need to get it’s about rapid experimentation to validate ideas, while at the same time maintaining focus on the bigger strategical picture (i.e. not losing oneself in needless experimentation), as well as resources vs. possible impact.Do you have any experience in giving workshops and/or public speaking? Immediately relevant if you’re an agency because of workshops that have to be conducted with clients.How do you see your role here? To understand the extent to which the candidate is aligned with what will be expected of him or her. Steer the resulting conversation onto their strengths and weaknesses and how both would influence their role within the company.What are some of the coolest things you’ve done in marketing and/or growth? This question can tell us a lot: what they’ve actually done, what they find important, how impressed they are with themselves.What’s the last experiment you’ve run in your personal life? Measures the learning-by-doing mindset as well as attention to detail and habit-building.What’s your favourite growth hacking story and why? To get an idea of their main influences, as well as a starting point for us as interviewers to dig into their overall vision on growth. Everyone has a different one and that’s okay but understanding each variation and aligning it to our own is key.What publications and/or growth marketers are you inspired by? What do they read, who do they follow and in the first place: do they read and follow at all?How many ideas to grow this company can you come up with in 5 minutes? See how well they perform under pressure, how well they know the agency and prepared for the interview, how creative they are. Start a conversation about the ideas after. You can make it more specific by having them focus on a particular part of the funnel or an immediate problem the company is currently experiencing.Where do you see yourself in three years? Reveals their ambitions priorities as well as the fit with the company in the context of their own personal life.Where do you get your best ideas? We’re looking for people who think about this kind of stuff and try to optimize their daily routines for it. Ideally they also have a Trello board or notepad or something else to store their inspirations.Have candidates fill in the personality test: https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-testThough you are free to ask the candidate all these questions, I wouldn’t recommend it. Not just because that would be a long ass interview, but also because you should leave some margin for spontaneity to unfold. Your goal is to get to know the person in front of you, why they are sitting there, what the scenario of them working with you would mean for them and their life’s path. If the candidate’s motivations, personality, mindset and reported skillset match your requirements, you can move on to inviting them for a trial day. Trial Day The trial day is to confirm assumptions about the four dimensions that have emerged during the interview, as well as deepen the ones related to growth hacker DNA and skillset. Here’s a list of possible trial day assignments to choose from. I recommend making new combinations of these assignments for every trial day so you can filter out best assignments and weed out the best ones. As well as add new ones. The order of questions as listed here, is random. We would like you to write an article together with Sean Ellis. How do you get his attention? Answer format: text. Candidate should be creative, realistic and show empathy towards the target persona.How would you build our email list? Answer format: text.

Answer format: LP in Instapage, Unbounce or similar. Look out for structure, copywriting (they should fill in the headlines) and CRO best practices.The Bullshit Test: How does YouTube / Airbnb / Uber / … grow? Ask the candidate to take a whiteboard marker and draw the flow of a digital product like YouTube: how is their growth engineered? We want the candidate to think out loud and draw the flow in real-time. This is to measure how good they actually understand growth and its mechanisms versus. how good they are at simply reciting blog posts. This exercise does not have to be perfect. This question is not to be asked on the exercise sheet upfront but to be asked out of the blue after the candidate presented their exercises.You’re assigned to grow an Ecommerce / SaaS / platform / .... How would you setup their dashboard? What metrics would you mainly track? Answer format: sketch on paper with explanation (in text or verbally at the time). Observing what metrics they choose per type of business will tell you a lot of about how much they understand the structure and business model of each. This is key to understanding how they can be grown.We’re big fans of side-project marketing. Try to come up with at least three ideas for a side-project. Answer format: text.

Investigates candidate’s understanding of the job and the challenges he/she will need to tackle. Gives a glimpse in their strategic ability: how they fit different parts of growth together so they complement in each other going in the right direction.I take between 3 and 5 items from this list to put together a trial day, depending on how much work I feel each assignment should take. The trial days I’ve been running usually were between 4 and 6 hours. No applicant has ever managed to finish all assignments I’d given them, but that’s okay. It’s part of the trial process. I give them more work than they can handle to observe how they manage that additional pressure. It’s up to them to decide if they rather do all 5 exercises poorly or just 3 out of 5 but very well. I tend to prefer applicants that focus on quality over quantity but always give candidates the chance to motivate the approaches they’ve taken. When a candidate didn’t finish all tasks on the trial day itself, but does finish them at them and sends them over later, that’s a definite plus. Have more questions that could complete this list?

This goal is mainly achieved through adjusted content delivered at the right time in the right place.CONVERT: Conversions can happen at any stage of a customer journey (micro conversions), but here it is meant as the conversion of a potential customer to a paying customer or a user of a free service.In the digital growth model, this step is possible to automate by, for example, triggered email sequences, “tripwires,” limited offers, showing benefits, offering several payment options, and so on.For some products and services, it is necessary to use an actual sales person to convince the prospect to make that final decision.DELIGHT: When the customer has bought the product or service, the focus will shift to making the customer happy with his or her decision. Here we include onboarding to ensure that the customer actually starts to use the product or service.Ensure that the customer experience is so good that the customer wants to be a returning customer and, in the end, is so pleased that he or she is willing to share a recommendation with his or her network and friends.ENHANCE: You can do a ton of marketing and conversion optimization, but if you do not have a product or service that resonates with your target audience, then you will never grow at the rate you want.This step is about developing your product or service in an agile way based on the lessons learned throughout the whole customer journey. This information could even lead to creating new products and services.In many cases, it is possible to adjust a product or service to support growth tactics.In some cases, it could even be the business model that needs to be changed to optimize for growth.Key Questions That Drive Growth This model helps us find the answers to the key questions for growth: How can we learn more about our future customers?

Not a lot of people know that I made a career switch from Mass Communication to marketing. According to me, both go hand in hand, both required influencing people, that's why I never got that 'Switch' feeling. I started off my career as content writer and worked with over 20 different companies and over there my career went from content writing to distributing etc. Around the same time, I started taking digital marketing seriously and spent a lot of time reading books and blogs about it and also experimenting my learning on my social media pages and it worked out in my favor. I joined a company as 'Social Media Manager' worked there for almost one year and moved to another company as 'Growth Hacker' I’m the path where the product meets marketing, I don't code, but at the same time, I don't have to put ads on billboards or social media but rather maintain a lot of sheets which have a different set of audience grouped and feedback around what worked and what needs to be scrapped. Not going to say it is a necessary trait, but growth hackers need to be creative mastermind because their job is to silently plug an addiction rather, the product as a need in a person's head.

Has been a driving force to build strategy, build platform, market and promote businesses for years. Digital and Social Marketing has progressed from search optimization to a vast and complex marketing function. Considering all the challenges that today’s Digital Marketing brings for us, we should be aware of them and stay prepared for the changes that businesses need to implement. Hard Task of Changing Employee Psychology: One of the most significant challenges in Digital Transformation is changing employees working behavior and their psychology towards any significant organizational change. The hunger is not present in most of the organizations. To get that we need to infuse positivity and desire among the employees. The future predictions for Digital Marketing are: 1. Augment Reality: It's going to come hugely for businesses due to enhanced mobile technology. The presence of user base in colossal quantity AR will bring revolutionary marketing approach to product or service based companies. There is a massive use of augmenting reality is already seen across the world with the increased usage of mobile phones and approximate presence of more than four billion devices across the world it is almost beyond our reach to stop it. It will eventuality define product delivery and service delivery in a different way. Whatever you have been buying till today with human intervention will now be done by a machine. A machine can explain in detail that human cannot do with AI it can bring in emotional touch to it as well. The significant impact of Augmented reality seen in the automobile to FMCG sector, even I can expect to see Malls without any service staff it's already coming up as Amazon Go and I don't think bigger players like Google or any other company would be left Behind for a long time from this race. So complicated and challenging time expected for businesses. 2. Age of typing less communication: As content is driving us, the technology of voice to text will take over the typing function and provide you a tremendous opportunity to bring your imagination to the paper. You can do it without laboring to type. What you are thinking to represent the same you don't anymore need to type it in the document. With these changes now people will interact with technology more often. So, digital marketing will be the most important driving force for any company and when it comes to the role of content that is very important for an organization, now any employee any worker of organization can contribute for it. 3. Influencer Marketing Vs Digital Marketing We have seen many companies hire influencers to promote the brand to market the products. However, considering the cost, they charge it doesn't always realize as a profitable investment. Businesses don't get the return they expect. Above all the value has to be born by the customers. So, if these costly and overcharging influencers get's removed and a knowledge-based digital presence created, will that deliver better result? Its a matter of A/B Test that industry is already doing. In the coming days, influencer marketing will become a critical thing where companies will think and invest 4. Amazon appearing as the next platform for marketing: We are using Facebook & Google for our business promotion. However, have you thought of Amazon? If not, start thinking about it. The reason being its one of the best emerging platform providing value to the consumers & businesses both. It has the potential to build your brand and take to a large section of customers more efficiently. Amazon with a massive amount of traffic also has very high user retention rate. It can be the next challenge for existing advertisement platforms. If you are not considering it, start to learn how Amazon can help you today. 5. Dangers with today’s Digital Asset: Recently we saw a colossal attempt at damaging personal, commercial and Government information by hackers. However, the primary thing that has happened is the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). It now provides an opportunity to any person or business to protect its hard-earned digital assets. However, starting from state-sponsored hacking to safeguarding of ransomware we all need more from government and entrepreneurs. A Mechanism must begin providing better response to people. A result driven digital display advertisement to give better returns in programmatic is needed. These are not the concerns that a marketer can handle, but indeed these are coming up as one of the more significant challenges for the marketing industry. Digital Marketing as a whole is bringing up lot more complexities for small businesses who are busy providing services to its clients. If these problems and not solved from any end of Technology we will only get a deteriorating digital infrastructure providing less value for marketers and increasing unrest in the Digital Marketing segment. I hope to see more stable and information-driven digital age for our future bringing more fruitful result for the investors.

Foresee the Marketing Environment:  To have an understanding of your customer is essential, but there may also some business opportunities in the corner that emerge as a result of changing global scenarios. For example, in the wake of environment awareness, if your business provide eco friendly solutions, you can gear a worldwide promotion of your brand and company as a whole. 3. Customize Your Services For The Customers:  Having worked on marketing plan, now it’s high time to be assured that your product or services are providing solutions to your customers in real terms. Instead of tailoring and presenting things in the way the customer wants. often startups fall into the trap of making the product the way they want to sell. Be customer centric!  4. Design Targeting Advertising & Customer Communications:  In the competitive era of business, placing a few advertisements on billboards or online is not gonna make any difference to be get noticed. Consumers are bombarded with thousands of marketing promotions and they take less and less notice. You need to do something pretty special to stand out of the crowd. In order to appeal your targeted audience, make sure that your messages are clear and highly creative. 5. Human Capital:  Your employees are your assets - provide them proper training and fix their roles they need to be more efficient in their their tasks. From the receptionist to your sales rep, be assured that they are self driven and motivated, provide them the tools they need and make them feel responsible for their roles in the complete business plan. If every individual is integrated , your business will grow very much itself.  6. Have a Pricing Strategy  Pricing is a powerful strategy for sales acceleration- decide what you are your goals and what message you want to convey by fixing your price at a certain level. High prices means that you may possibly sell less, on the other hand it gives the impression of a premium product. Similarly, low prices gives you a breakthrough to dominate a particular market, although it leads to low profitability in a short term. Be aware that pricing is a segment of this whole strategy, and position it wisely in your marketing plan.  7. Respond to Complaints Well  Be highly committed to give customers an excellent experience of your services. If there is a complaint - respond quickly and positively. Always remember that your brand image can be damaged if people spread bad word about your business. A complaint if handled well may consequently turn the person into a loyal customer. Surprise and delight your customers by going above and beyond the call of duty for them. Always focus on building trust as it is a powerful selling tool. 8. Start prospecting to kickstart your sales campaign Sales prospecting is the logical next step of your growth hacking startegy. You need to generate high quality data concerning your targeted audience. For that no need to google it or extract all leads manually. Only need a prospecting tool that do it for you in a simple click.  Prospecting tools extract very accurate data on social media such as Linkedin, Xing, Crunchbase, Github, Viadeo or Twitter and export them to CRM or CSV file. The best prospecting software on the market right now is Salesfinder - #1 Social Prospecting Platform as it generate up to 70% verified email addresses and export them to pretty much all CRM.",2021-03-06T21:50:47.647Z,"Who are the most successful self taught growth hackers?

It only serves a promotional purpose of making people aware of growth at Startups. That's less of an issue now though since awareness is on the path to ubiquity, thanks to the growth hackers craze.  Growth engineering, growth PMs, growth designers and growth analysts will not go away. B2B needs sales and marketing like ecommerce needs internet marketing like consumer internet needs growth. Large growth teams at companies like Facebook and LinkedIn did not emerge because of some misguided fascination with buzzwords. They exist because they are really effective. Growth is a centralized function that's an essential part of successful consumer tech companies. It's as indelible as a finance team is in my opinion.  The catchy phrases will go away, as they should, but the essential roles will not. Hi there, I’m 24 years old and I’ve been officially Growth Hacker for more than 1 year one. Growth hacking really is a mindset and you can prove yourself as a Growth Hacker by actually doing stuff. I’d encourage you to do some Growth Hacking projects without charging much (or nothing at all) leveraging your experience as an Ecommerce Manager. Then you’ll be able to approach (and get approached by) startups or compagnies with real value! I’ve also just written a blog post about Growth Hacking Resources which I think you’d like. Cheers and good luck! In the simplest terms, we test marketing & sales concepts using A LOT of data. We run endless split tests, spend hours pouring over funnels, and often have some programming chops for task automation, hacks, and data gathering.

Should be able to do some coding and utilizing many different tools to get things done.Growth Marketer: Marketing with a focus on growth.  Would expect them to be well versed in conversion rate optimization and A/B testing, and many different marketing channels.Growth Specialist: Same as growth marketer.Growth Analyst: Marketing with a focus on analytics.  Mining the data for insights into how to optimize marketing channels better, building customer profiles, optimizing customer retention.Growth Engineer: This is an actual software engineering role.  Projects are very wide ranging, from front-end to back-end.  Projects will be very results-oriented.Technical Growth Marketer: Pretty much the same as growth marketer.Growth Developer: Same as growth engineer.Online Marketer: This is a bit more narrowly scoped than growth marketer.  I wouldn't expect them to pursue any offline channels, running maybe slightly less ""out-of-the-box"" campaigns.Digital Marketer: Same as online marketer, but a bit newer and more used now.Web Marketer: Same as online marketer, maybe a little older-sounding to me.  Not sure why but this makes me think they'd be focused on SEO.My own title is ""Technical Marketing Manager"", but could very well easily be ""Growth Hacker"", ""Digital Marketing Manager"", ""Growth Manager"", etc etc.  the tl;dr here is they're mostly interchangable. I will answer this question from my personal experience. Before I became a Growth Hacker, I was a Digital Marketer for 3 years. And when I’ve heard the term Growth Hacking I thought – as many others – another buzzword. bääh. However, I can’t agree less now. Why? Because since I am a Growth Hacker, I’ve learned and lived the difference. As a Growth Hacker you are not only tech-savvier, more data-driven but you also work a lot more on the product – what drives Growth basically. In my 3 years as a Marketing Manager, I almost only worked on Acquisition and Activation. We worked on Newsletters, Website Optimization, ASO, but never on referral, revenue and retention – not even on SEO (I’ve never touched a tool or code, because that was the job of a developer, who was basically always full with todos^^) These topics were only covered by the product teams, designers or external experts. Back then, it made sense for me. Now I totally disagree. A designer is an expert in UX and such. But he/she does not know a lot about data and driving Growth. A Product Manager knows how to deliver fast and with high-quality but little about user needs, design and data. And external experts – let’s say for SEO can push your page on Nr. 1 on Google, yes, but he/she has no idea (or little) about the other aspects in the funnel. That work separation makes sense when you want to improve but not when you want to grow fast. A Growth Hacker has the broad knowledge of marketing (t-shaped) and is not afraid to combine technology with marketing. That’s why Growth Hacking is more a mindset than a profession. Growth Hacking means know-how and the ability to act fast and data-driven. Growth Hackers are not better than digital marketers, but they work different for sure. And that’s the secret for growth! :) According to Google Trends, growth hacking has been one of the most-discussed topics last year. It is also a fundamental business and marketing practice and hence it is likely to continue to trend and stay around for a while. What is growth hacking? Growth hacking is a method that enables you to increase your customer base and ensures that they continue to stay active by influencing their network. It could be a single tactic or a combination of many hacks that coaxes these customers to create a domino effect in their online ecosystem. Increasing the customer base as an objective is vintage but the ways to accomplish it has evolved over time. The most recent ones which have worked wonders are popularly called as growth hacking strategies and now is a great time to explore them, if you don’t want to be left behind. How to use growth hacking to your success? There are millions of ways to adapt growth hacking trends but there is no hard and fast rule that defines which one is the best. Here are some stepping stones that have been explored by some of the most popular growth hackers out there. IdeateWith growth as your central theme – be it measurable marketing objectives, competition, business evolution or use of technology in marketing; give yourself a brief to crack. Once you know which verticals to tackle, round up your team and ideate on the best ways and latest technologies that can be used and tested as a growth hack.ExperimentNewer the technology the better, as it makes way for a plethora of digital marketing experiments. These experiments will help you learn which growth hacks work and which don’t. They could be related to the best use of latest platforms like Periscope, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. or simply building a beautiful website that bridges the gap between you and your customers. Make a note of the key learnings and measurements as they might come handy in future.MonitorGrowth hacking is heavily dependent on data-driven marketing and vice versa. Your ideas and experiments will hold water only if they are supported by strong numbers. Hence, monitor and measure every experiment or campaign you run to increase your customer base. Their results give you a bird’s eye view of what you need to do next – whether to optimise the same campaign/experiment or adopt a new growth hack.OptimizeCampaign optimisations are often looked upon as a key to improving the numbers. Businesses resort to them only when they have unrealistic marketing objectives to be achieved against tight deadlines. But if used properly, optimisation could open a treasure trove of great growth hacking strategies. For e.g. the experiments that you have conducted so far may not have given you great results but they look promising. Here, optimisation can help in tweaking the experiments enough to enhance the outcome.GrowFinally, everything will boil down to how you chart out your growth journey using these hacks. Out of 10 ideas, you might have experimented with 6, monitored them all, optimised 3 of them and only one of them actually worked in scaling your growth. So, does that mean you should explore newer growth hacking strategies? The answer to that is yes and no. Yes, keep looking for the latest hacks and no, don’t give up on the old ones as you never know which one is gold.Growth Hacking Realized – Airbnb While the above steps sound great theoretically, you might be screaming for an example that puts things in perspective. So, let’s consider the growth story of Airbnb – the poster child of growth hacking strategies. Airbnb is an online platform that allows people to turn their bedroom/ spare room into a lodging space that can be rented by strangers. Today, it’s a revolution but it all started with two individuals who decided to do things differently.  The Idea Designers Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky were not able to afford the rent of their San Francisco apartment. So, out of survival instinct, they decided to rent out their loft. They had the option of posting their listing on Craiglist (a portal where people look for accommodations), but they felt that it would be too impersonal. So they gave it some thought and decided to build a simple website instead that would make their listing look personal and warm. The Experiment They built the website in a time when a design conference was coming to town and there was a lack of hotel space. They put up pictures of their loft-turned hotel space along with an appealing offer of home-cooked breakfast in the morning. Then they waited. They didn’t know how well this would work or whether it would even work. But eventually this got them three renters and within a week they started receiving inquiries asking when this facility will be available across cities and countries. This came as a surprise. The Smart Hack After some in-depth market research and planning, they set up a website for the international audience where people world over could list properties or book them for lodging. But now the problem was, how do they let people know about the existence of Airbnb in the smartest and cheapest possible way? They went back to the drawing board and decided to leverage Craiglist for its massive user base. They created a form that suggested the users to post their listing on Craiglist as well to get better traction. Optimisation While they did this, they optimised the user experience on their website with great pictures, warm language & story like descriptions and also ensured that the property listings earned more through Airbnb than on Craiglist. This changed the game for Airbnb as their customer base shot exponentially at minimal cost.  Growth Journey Airbnb could have continued with their Craiglist hack but they were smart enough to move on in time from poaching customers to focusing on augmenting their own product. They found out that they were not very popular in cities like New York, London, Paris, Vancouver, and Miami. The reason – renters were posting poor quality pictures of their properties and the users didn’t get to see what they are paying for. They could have tackled this by sending out a series of ‘How to’ emails. Instead, they sent a group of professional photographers to these places to click good quality pictures and posted them on the listings. Needless to say, this worked wonders for them not only in terms of increased bookings but also a spike in the trust factor owing to the authenticity of the pictures Since then, Airbnb has explored unique and human growth hacks like turning mere homestays into local living experiences, thoughtfully rebranding itself into a lovable brand, etc. Have you ever used a growth hack to leverage your startup?

It either appeared to be too predictable or not suitable enough for me. I just wasn’t hooked. I tried Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, Sopranos, The Wire, Prison Break…..but none could give me the same amount of satisfaction as Breaking Bad did. Then I tried Dexter.  Something about this show was really intriguing. From the opening credit scene where Dexter prepares his breakfast to the the abrupt cuts….this was different. I guess I am really into the idea of an “Anti-Hero”. There’s nothing more impressive to see a man doing what he thinks is right and not worrying about what others think about him. I really don’t promote Dexter’s actions but he was the only protagonist who gave me a similar vibe to Walter White in Breaking Bad. Plus the cinematography and direction was excellent. And last but not the least Michael C. Hall’s performance was top notch. I really think Dexter should be given a try unless one is too afraid of bloodspills and dead bodies. It was really sad to see the show end that way. That could’ve been better (spoiler alert). After Dexter was over, I was in a similar situation where nothing I watched next felt right. But that changed when I started watching Mr. Robot.  I’m in the middle of Season 2 right now, taking things really slowly. To be honest Mr. Robot is really educational for an IT student like me. And I can assure that a fair amount of research was done in writing the script. All the security breach and cyber attack scenes were accurate enough. Let’s just hope it doesn’t end like Dexter. P.S.

I was the head of growth for several startups and run one of the largest growth hacking communities online, Marketers & Founders. A great growth hacker can validate intelligent hypotheses fast. The best growth hackers have an excellent intuition about user psychology enabling them to make better hypotheses. They’re also extremely resourceful when validating hypotheses. They’ll learn everything from SQL to Optimizely to find out whether they’re right. The most common trait I’ve seen is their ability to move on from failure fast. Growth hackers don’t think about failure. They just keep testing because their success depends on how fast they validate their hypotheses. In turn, the best growth hackers have a history lined with many failures, but because they were so persistent on improving, they found big wins. Moreover, the best growth hackers know psychology better than people who have a P.h.D in the subject. They obsess over it - read hundreds of books, analyze every online and in-person touch point, and often collaborate about new psychological tactics. This obsession gives them the rare gift of testing foresight. For most people, they need, at least, several years of growth hacking experience to acquire these strong predictive powers.

For most companies, this takes the form of reaching an unmet need or discovering potential buyers who weren’t previously a part of the market. By successfully reaching out to a new market, companies can position themselves as the leading provider and acquire most of the benefits from opening the market resources. To learn more about this, discover How Growth Hacking Became A Successful Marketing Strategy. Why Many Startups Struggle There are many reasons why startups struggle – and, unfortunately, as many as 90% of them ultimately fail to meet their goals. Sometimes new entrepreneurs lack experience, and can’t quite get their ducks in a row when their business needs it to survive. Even experienced entrepreneurs can struggle to handle every aspect of a new business, and simply trying to multitask isn’t enough to get the job done. That’s why we offer best growth hacks, a worry-free service to let you focus on your products and services while we focus on helping you grow your business. Effective Growth: An iterative and Data–Driven Process A major part of Growth Hacking is the scientific process of designing and validating – through multiple iterations – a growth strategy that best suits your business’ needs. It’s a lot like comparing formulas in a laboratory to see which one offers the best balance of cost and results. The validation of the marketing strategy happens on a cyclical process based on testing, tracking, and progressively optimizing the results. In this way, it’s possible for a growth hacking consultant to create specific plans, define realistic goals, and ultimately make the growth process more effective. There’s no mystery or guesswork here – just data-driven facts. We perform Growth Hacking on three different levels MEASURING With measuring, we acquire quantitative measurements of user behavior that help us to understand who they are, what matters the most to them, and what refinements will make products and marketing more effective for them. ANALYSIS Once we have those measurements, we start working on constant analysis to help better understand the real-world impact of the strategy. Constant analysis is critical to successful growth hacking - in fact, many companies forget to reassess their marketing strategies, and that's often why they fail. OPTIMIZATION Finally, we work to implement the strategies generated by measuring and analyzing the company base. Much like analysis, optimization is an ongoing process, and it always has more growth for your company as the goal. Cleverativity best marketing agency will analyze, design, and validate a custom marketing strategy and techniques that's perfect for your business. We'll also help implement it so you can focus on running the rest of your business without the distractions that marketing can cause.

You remember that moment when you were young and your parents wouldn’t allow you to go to a party? At that time, You could have tried climbing out of the window, you could have said you were going to a private birthday party (which you weren’t) or would have said you were sleeping over at a friend’s place (which was true up to a certain degree). The point is, your goal (metric) was to go to the party, but the methods of achieving that goal were different. Some more successful than others. This is what growth hacking is. You set a goal (going to the party) of something bigger and better, even almost impossible and you try to get there in the fastest way, with the least amount of resources. Some tests will fail (like climbing out of the window) but if you test enough you’ll find a better approach (staying at a friends place) to reach your goal. In order to better understand Growth hacking, there is 3 things that you need to remember: First of all, Growth Hacking is not about hacks or tools. Just like in any sports, Growth Hacking is about processes & experimentation. If you don't train yourself to work out every single week, you won't see results. If you don't try anything new, you'll always fall behind. Use this guide to set up the growth process within your company: Growth Hacking playbook part 1/20: Process before tactics Secondly, Growth Hacking is not a process that was made only for Marketers, it can be applied to new product innovation and to the continuous improvement of products as well as to growing and existing customer base. The reason is simple. Most of the time you need at least 3 different skill sets to implement some of the best growth strategies: A Designer (to make everything beautiful)A Coder (to make everything work)A Marketeer (to make sure people get to see whatever you want to test)More experienced people can be a blend of 2 or 3 of these types. They are worth gold. Alright, you got your process and team in place, it’s time to unleash the tactics, right? Not really. Thirdly, the best growth ‘hacks’ are not because of a guy drawing an idea on a napkin. It was based on data. The key to growth is finding who your best customers are, solve their struggles and find out where you can get more of those people. Pretty simple, but therefore not easy. You might be thinking, how do I find my best customers? One simple word: Analytics. Most of the time, your product won’t be fully ready. In fact, I don’t think any product is every ready. Yet, there are always a couple of people that are going to (almost) complete your full funnel nevertheless. These are the people you want to pull out of your analytics and meet face-to-face to understand their motives. Now is the time you can start sketching your persona’s for marketing purposes and unleashing the tactics that fit their profile. Use this complete guide on setting up your analytics to track the full customer journey and pull those people out of your database. Growth Hacking playbook part 2/20: You don't know what you don't track How it’s implemented: Set up the growth process within your company. Generate and test ideas accordingly to test assumptions you might have.Create a cross-functional team with a mentality that is willing to fail.Use qualitative research and quantitative data analysis to gain deep insights into your user behaviour and preferences.Happy Growing! The best way to understand growth hacking and what growth hackers do is to first understand what is meant by the term hacker. A hacker is someone who is more concerned with achieving an objective than following a prescribed process. In other words, hackers care more about what needs to get done than how it should get done. As a result, hackers often come up with innovative ways to get things done. For example, a hacker may be trying to get unauthorized access to a computer system.

A hacker is someone who is more concerned with achieving an objective than following a prescribed process. In other words, hackers care more about what needs to get done than how it should get done. As a result, hackers often come up with innovative ways to get things done. For example, a hacker may be trying to get unauthorized access to a computer system. It doesn’t really matter how he does it (and there often isn’t one specifically prescribed method) so long as whatever he’s doing gets him access. Because hackers are more concerned with what needs to get done than how it should get done, they tend to be pretty anti-authoritarian and also not do so well at bigger companies where they are expected to do things a certain way. A growth hacker is a hacker whose objective is to grow the number of users for a specific product. While lots of people consider user growth to be a marketing function, this assumes that there’s only one way to get users (namely, marketing). But this isn’t true. In fact, more and more over the last few years we’ve seen new products grow from zero to millions of users with little to no marketing at all. There are lots of non-marketing decisions that affect user growth. Building viral product features is the most obvious, but there are many others (I’ll cover these in a future post). As a result, it doesn’t make sense to place growth hacking within a particular department like marketing or engineering. Instead, it ends up being a cross-functional role.  The idea is that for every decision a company makes, a growth hacker should ask: ”What will be the impact on growth?” For example, when Facebook was still in its early stages they built a cross-functional growth team led by a growth hacker that touched many other departments, including Marketing, BizDev, Product, Finance and even HR. Among many other projects, the team was responsible for making Facebook available in every language through crowdsourcing, implementing a robust system for importing email contacts, and even building out a “Facebook Lite” which was eventually shut down Over the last few years, truly innovative growth hackers have developed various frameworks and best-practices. Guys like Noah Kagan (AppSumo, Mint, Facebook), Mike Greenfield (Circle of Moms, LinkedIn), Dave McClure (500 Startups, PayPal) and many others have pioneered techniques focused on virality, email, search engine optimization & marketing. I also wrote a post recently in which I put forward the claim that growth hacking = lean marketing (http://www.growhack.com/2012/09/05/is-growth-hacking-lean-marketing/).",2021-03-06T22:04:03.423Z,"What is growth hacking?

A growth hacker is a hybrid of marker and coder, someone that uses processes, data, metrics to grow a product and make informed decisions.  According to Neil Patel,   Growth hackers use their knowledge of product and distribution, find ingenious, technology-based, avenues for growth that sometimes push the bounds of what is expected or advised. This is the process I personally follow: Hypothesis. This means determining an area for improvement.Build. Get everything in place. Emails, code, wireframes, images.Execution. Do everythingMeasure. Kill/Maximize. Didn't work? Kill it. Works? Maximize conversions.Second, I'm going to list the skills you might need to become a great growth hacker.

I've worked with several great engineers and designers that fit the definition of ""can build products independently and produce gains in growth rate"". I don't know any that refer to themselves as growth hackers though. If you're looking for the best people I think you'll find plenty of them who are not labeled as ""growth hackers"".  In terms of people who understand how to grow a product though, here are a few people that I think are very knowledgeable and have demonstrated their knowledge:  Gustaf Alstromer (strong on mobile growth and rounding that out with web growth experience while currently working at Airbnb)Marco Zappacosta (met with him recently and he clearly understands how to grow stuff given how well Thumbtack is doing)Hiten Shah (has grown a few SaaS businesses e.g. Crazy Egg and Kissmetrics)But there are also loads of engineers / designers / analysts that also understand growth at a level beyond what ""hacking"" implies. Many of them work on growth and engagement at companies like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Quora, etc. If you're looking for the best, look for a track record of experience. The title doesn't necessarily indicate who the best are. Not sure about ""most used,"" but here are some commonly used ones: Guest PostingYou don't have an audience for your blog yet?

Post to Quora (and other forums where your audience is)If you're asking questions on Quora but you aren't answering them, then you're missing out. Encourage ReferralsYou can tell someone to use your product all day and they'll ignore you. But if one of their friends suggests it, you're almost guaranteed a new user. Here are some drop-in referral tools: ReferralCandy; Referral SaaSquatch; and Friendbuy. Track Your EmailsI use RocketBolt because it has a bunch of other features for tracking leads. If you're OK being limited to email open tracking, there's also Yesware. And if you want a CRM with open tracking (but only works with Gmail), there's Streak.  Create a Private BetaMight be kind of counter-intuitive, but people like exclusivity and are often more likely to signup if they think they're getting access to something special that few other people have. Depending on your product, it's a bit of a gamble, but it's usually worth testing. Add UTM Codes to Every LinkI'm ashamed to admit how long it took for me to recognize the value of UTM Codes for supercharging my Google Analytics account. They're crazy-important because they're going to help you know which growth hacks are most successful. The word ‘best’ is what makes this question a bit controversial. Allow me to share my two cents on the topic. For the record, I am the CEO of Growth Sandwich, a Product Marketing agency that doesn’t compete with Growth Hackers as we are working on Product challenges with Pre-Product/Market fit stage companies. Most of us have heard stories of founders who had a bad experience working with growth marketing agencies. Stories that (usually) start with excitement and anticipation but end with a respectable loss of earnings and disappointment. What is the reason behind this? Is there something wrong Continue ReadingThe word ‘best’ is what makes this question a bit controversial. Allow me to share my two cents on the topic. For the record, I am the CEO of Growth Sandwich, a Product Marketing agency that doesn’t compete with Growth Hackers as we are working on Product challenges with Pre-Product/Market fit stage companies. Most of us have heard stories of founders who had a bad experience working with growth marketing agencies. Stories that (usually) start with excitement and anticipation but end with a respectable loss of earnings and disappointment. What is the reason behind this? Is there something wrong about the clients and their expectations, or about the growth marketing agencies? We will go for the latter… There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with the way most growth marketing agencies close and serve their clients. We knew it and decided to do something about it. Is our research going to prevent you from hiring one of these agencies? Most likely not. However, it will, at least, help you, understand that when it comes to growth marketing agencies, you always need to do your research. Why (and How) We Conducted the Research The “Why” Behind the Research The “why” behind this research is simple: we wanted to uncover the way growth marketing agencies sell their services and close new clients. You see, nowadays we experience the spread of misinformation, the quick ones win, and so do “growth hacks” that promise growth equal to Dropbox, Airbnb, and Robinhood. However, most times, these promises don’t come easy. What We Did (and How) Our methodology was—once again—simple: 1) First, we did online research using terms like “growth marketing agency,” or “growth hacking agency.”  To be clear: we’ve known most of these growth marketing agencies since we work in the same industry. The point was not to make a list of direct and indirect competitors but to follow the journey anyone searching for a growth marketing agency, could follow. 2) Then, we made a list of the most popular results in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Page). The process that we used is relatively simple, even for someone who is not savvy. In fact, anyone can follow the same journey as we did, and see for themselves. What is more interesting though, is not how we conducted the research, but what we discovered. Note: We used only organic search results for our research, and not results from Google ads. 3) Next, we created a list of 15 agencies, and plugged them into a Google Spreadsheet:  Here is the meaning of each column: Replied: If the agency responded to our initial Email.Meetings Before Proposal: The number of meetings required before we got a proposal.Access Asked: If the agency asked for access to evaluate our status (i.e., access to Google Analytics account).Access Given: If we granted access to any of the requested assets.Discovery (y/n): If the call that we received was a discovery call, meaning that the agency tried to identify our needs.Proposal Speed (in days): The number of days needed, to get a proposal from the agency.BS Meter: Our internal BS-and-fluff-meter4) Finally, we contacted each one of the agencies in our list and tried to make a “Discovery Call.” Only 4 (four) of the agencies that we contacted didn’t respond. 2 (two) of them initially responded but they never returned our call . We never managed to reach them on the phone, probably due to a scheduling conflict or because of other reasons. Thus, we proceeded with the calls with 9 (nine) of the agencies in our list, to discuss the needs of a real company with real business needs. What We’ve Discovered 1) Where is the Discovery Phase? Is it possible for an agency that makes thousands (and even millions) of $ in annual revenue, not to have a Discovery Phase? You can note “yes” in that column. 63.6% of the agencies that we managed to reach didn’t have a clear Discovery Phase. If you are wondering why the Discovery Phase is essential, let me give you a quick example. Let’s assume that you visit the doctor for a health issue that you encounter. What’s the first thing doctors do when they examine a patient? They ask questions. And, why is this important? The reason is, they can’t prescribe any medication before finding out what’s wrong with the patient. “What surprised us is that agencies with hundreds of thousands (and even millions) of $ in annual revenue, didn’t have a Discovery Phase.” Similarly to doctors who ask questions, an agency MUST identify what the problem is before making any suggestions. In our case, that didn’t happen. Except for two agencies*, all the others tried to sell us services without identifying the problem that we were experiencing. That’s a red flag; and, it’s so big that should scare us right away. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the only one… *We can share contact details for the two agencies upon request. 2) Rushed (and Even Scammy) Proposals That’s a bold statement, but most of the proposals we received were rushed (and looked scammy). Here is what I mean: 66.6% of the proposals we received were sent within 5 (five) days, with just one meeting and no discovery questions.53% of the proposals were promising “growth hacks” that were irrelevant to our (pretend) needs.Most proposals were selling all of the agency’s services, without caring about our pretend business needs.Some agencies used fake data to impress us—for example: “you can get 40% Reply Rate to a cold Email campaign.”26.6% of the proposals we received, promised outdated practices that could get us penalized in the post-GDPR era—for example, cold Emailing is (still) ok and works fine.A small percentage (13%) included false statements—for example, x tactic optimizes Conversion Rate by 8% (as if this was a benchmark and can work for everyone).Most times, it was a junior marketer who was trying to sell us second-hand growth tricks, and handled the “discovery call.”Finally, many proposals were focusing on quick conversion (a staggering 40%), rather than on a thorough break-down of our problems and the proposed solutions.Going down the rabbit hole, we found out that most growth marketing agencies use buzzwords and complex jargon to impress their prospects. To what extent? Just keep reading. 3) Buzzwords and Complex Jargon That’s common among growth marketing and growth hacking agencies. However, throughout our undercover research, the BS-and-fluff-meter turned red. We saw how vividly agencies use buzzwords and complex jargon as a way to impress the prospect.Do prospects fall for that? Most likely, yes. For us, it was just another red flag, as we were trying to uncover the inefficiency behind the fancy words. 4) Growth Marketing Agencies = Narcissism What is the definition of a narcissist? Well, according to Wikipedia, a narcissist is: “A person who has an excessive interest in or admiration of themselves.” We knew that agencies like talking about themselves, their case studies, the companies they’ve worked with or the rewards they’ve received. We hadn’t expected though that this would overshadow the Discovery Process. The narcissism involved is depicted if we take into consideration the words that we kept hearing: “We are,” “We did,” “We achieved,” and “We had.” That’s another red flag and it applied in 60% of the cases. Don’t (ever) fall for that. 5) Junior Marketers; Why Not? Taking a look at the profile of the employees working in large growth marketing agencies, we identified a pattern. Most agencies —with a few exceptions— employ ,mostly, junior people. In fact, 53% of all the agencies, we included in the research, employ 51.5% of junior employees on average. This is not a red flag on its own; but combined with the fact that these junior employees are called to handle and solve complex marketing problems, without supervision and a clear process, can be a red flag. Our initial assumptions came true: most growth marketing agencies care mostly about closing the sale (even though their sales process is far from outdated) and then, pass the client to a junior who must deliver on a project that far exceeds their skills or knowledge. Why? Simply because a junior is cheaper than a more experienced employee. The best part? That many of these juniors (usually called “growth hackers” or “growth experts”) are coming from totally irrelevant—and even non-digital—fields that have nothing to do with marketing. Would you hire someone who has an irrelevant background (to what you are looking for), is inexperienced, and charges thousands of $ per month to take care of your marketing and growth needs? I hope you answered “NO” to that question… Clients Are NOT the Victims Clients shouldn’t employ the role of the victim in this situation. Even if in some cases they are, they (really) shouldn’t be. “Yes,” there is a serious flaw in how growth marketing agencies close and serve their clients, but you can’t say that you didn’t know. Instead of abandoning the situation to its fate, here is what you can do: Educate yourself, and compare the proposals available.A doctor’s job is to fix you, not to please you. Stop buying services that please you, and start hiring responsible people that are data-driven and support their statements with facts.Ask difficult (but fair) questions. Ask them about a few times they failed and why they did so; check their portfolio, approach past clients and ask about them.Hire the people that explain the why’s and the how’s and stop trusting “growth hackers” and other (self-taught) magicians.If you want to hire a growth hacker, at least, first, learn what growth hacking is. Watch this course to learn more.The Bottom Line? So, there you go: you visit the website of a growth marketing agency. You are pumped by the client logos, the (irrelevant) testimonials they have at the bottom of their page, by their well-crafted website copy, and by their “x Ways to Improve your Facebook Ads Performance” blog post. My question is: would you work with that agency? The internet is a place where (literally) anything can be transformed into something valuable and attractive. However, most times, we don’t know what’s behind the curtain. My point is: if a shed can be transformed into London’s best restaurant, why can’t a group of junior marketers with a non-existent discovery process sell services of thousands of $ to startup founders, and business owners? But, we like looking on the bright side of things. If anyone can (still) sell growth hacks and cheap marketing tricks with a short-term effect, then anything in marketing is possible. Note: Throughout this process, we identified two agencies that indicated a high level of professionalism. They even resisted on giving us a price quote, if they weren’t given more information on our company and our business needs. We respect that, and we acknowledge their honesty. If you want us to give you their names, feel free to write to us, and we’ll share further details.",2021-03-06T22:14:37.591Z,"Who are the best growth hackers in London? ",Quora

Having said that, digital marketing is a highly evolving field that changes or leads to changing the various strategies in tandem with the latest trends in technologies that help in a better user experience. User experience holds a very crucial position in digital marketing, or rather any marketing related field, as everything here revolves around the customers. Marketing is usually done where the eyeballs are. And in this case, it is the Internet. And this is reason, why digital marketing is gaining more popularity over the past few years. In 2020, you can certainly expect a lot of people moving on to the online platforms such as social media, search engines, etc. everybody wants information at the tips of their fingers. And digital marketing helps you exactly with all that. Here is a figure to show you how many people went online in the past year that is 2019. As can be seen in the figure itself, you can make out the increasing number people constantly being online for some needs or the other being online. What is digital marketing? Digital marketing still helps businesses with online promotional activities carried out using all the best possible online platforms like social media, search engines, websites, blogs, digital TV, digital billboards, etc. Thus, it is still the same, but then the strategies that are used in it, have changed considerably. For example, take the SEO or Search Engine Optimization strategy. The SEO was pretty simple a few years ago, where there was hardly any competition, and no awareness of going digital. But with the proliferation of the awareness and increasing competition, and the introduction of many new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, voice searches, etc., the SEO has changed drastically over time. Now it is more about using the relevant keywords throughout the website and even working on your content optimization vigorously. Thus, SEO itself becomes very tricky to handle for nay website, as you would also have to constantly keep a closer eye on your competition, and what all keywords they are using, what content they are using on their website, etc. Social media marketing has changed over time, with many social media platforms gaining more popularity amongst the masses. And thus to reach out to this wider audience, it is very important to have the best social media marketing strategies in place. Now, in order to be adept at digital marketing, you would have to imbibe a constant learning approach that would help you keep updated and stay at the top of all the things in the industry. Thus, I would highly recommend you attend the free online demo session conducted by the Digital Vidya Institute on their website to learn more about the course and subject in a holistic way. People hate them. They've grown ad-blind. Marketers don’t consider screen size, the fact that my time is mine, nor did they consider content, nor context. I didn’t dive into my Flipboard app to have to be bothered by an ad from Brand X that makes me swipe to make it go away. (I’ve become adept at swiping away ads) Marketers think they can just take a desktop advertising strategy and throw it on mobile, because that’s where the eyeballs are. Well, consumers didn't shift to mobile so they can see a smaller version of your ad. Quite the opposite. They spend 90% of their time in-app so they can get away from web-browser ads, and get to the real content that they want. WE screwed up print with ads We screwed up the radio with ads We screwed up TV with ads We screwed up the Internet with ads. PLEASE, let’s not screw up mobile with ads. Don’t believe me? Check out our survey here of over 5,000 people on their in app ad preferences.

You do not have to meet advertising force with an opposite force. Small armies using unconventional methods are the winners in 66 percent of wars over the past 200 years, and online marketing competition is no different. Your growth hacking is a product of the little tips that you find on hidden message boards. If you are using a new app that connects people that overlap with the target audience of your company, then you may not have to use the big social media platforms at all. For instance, if you are marketing to artistic Millennials, you will find a much easier time organically connecting to people on KanKan or Moorus than you will paying for ads on Facebook. Growth hacking is all about testing strategies by hand instead of accepting the predetermined strategies that are given to you by the larger social media platforms on the Internet. You are able to weigh the time, manpower and money that other strategies require and pick the best from this wider spectrum rather than limiting yourself. You will test strategies by hand in order to create your own predetermined arsenal that is customised to the business that you are trying to promote. Finally, as a growth hacker, you will help to create the sales funnel for the business. Taking great notes at every step of the process is essential, and knowing your audience will aid in this. For instance, if you know that you can convert a large number of Facebook page visitors into website views but not Twitter, then you know to focus your efforts on that particular forum. Perhaps you have gained traction in a niche forum that feeds a larger social network with stories and content. Because none of your competitors have this angle on the audience, you have a different sales funnel than any of your competitors.

Evaluate experience and skills in an interview Track record. Having outstanding results differentiates real growth hackers from impostors. Your growth hacker should prove her worth by providing examples of how he crushed it. Probe deeply and ask follow-up questions to gain further insights into the candidate’s competence, behavior, and thought process: How did you come up with the idea?How did you execute it?What made it successful?What you could have done differently?Don’t settle for factual information. Get to the ‘why’ behind the candidate’s answers. Strong candidates will give you a detailed answer with specific metrics, a step-by-step process, and the reasoning they followed. Foundational knowledge. Explore the level of the candidate’s foundational marketing knowledge, as well as the expertise in specific channels relevant to your situation. What do you do to understand behavior of your target customers?How do you prioritize your experiments?Take me in detail through your most compelling PPC campaignCreativity. To test creativity, throw new situations at the candidate because previous experiences can easily be embellished. Put your company’s or a hypothetical funnel on a whiteboard and ask what they would do to improve it. How would you acquire more users?How would you increase engagement?Look for those candidates who are able to keep coming up with new, actionable, and relevant tactics to exploit, rather than those who are pulling from the list from a blog article in the back of their head. Analytical skills. To test analytical skills, show them a report of an ad campaign you are running. What should we do? How can we optimize it?Listen for an ability to explain data clearly and draw insights to move forward, rather than focusing on the ‘right’ answer. 2. Try out the candidate in a work situation In his book Work Rules!, Laszlo Bock, former SVP of People Operations at Google, says that the best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work sample. This makes sense since the actual work the candidate will be doing doesn’t consist of answering questions in a one-on-one setting. By getting them to do some real work, you are making sure the growth hacker you are hiring can produce the required level of output and has the skills needed for the role. Take-home assignment. If it’s not practical to do an onsite trial, ask the growth hacker to do a home assignment. Here are a few possibilities: Ask them to give you a short write-up on what they would do in the first 90 days after they come into the role.Write up an assignment with a real-life situation that they would be working on once they join, say, optimizing performance in one of the channels, and include relevant data. Then ask for their thoughts and analysis.One day/half-day onsite trial. If your interview process is sufficiently rigorous, you may not need more than a day (or even a half-day) of working together to see if a potential hire has the skills, work ethic, and personality to be a good fit. Having the candidate work in your office and around your team helps you gauge many things that you won’t get a feel for in a take-home assignment, such as how well the candidate collaborates with others, deals with uncertainty, and “hacks” his way forward. Your growth hacker candidate most likely has a full-time job, so ask her to take a day off. Prepare a specific problem to work on, ideally a challenge currently faced by your business, and work together. For example, at Canva, if the candidate passes the interview, he is first given a home assignment, consisting of growth hacking-related questions. Should the candidate do well on the home assignment, he is invited for a half-day onsite challenge. One-week trial. Most startups think they don’t have the luxury of doing a one-week onsite trial with candidates, but if you consider what’s at stake, it may be something worth looking into. A week can give you an even better appreciation of the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses and screen out those candidates that can’t walk the talk. Freelance/contract trial. You can take an even slower approach to hiring a growth hacker by having him work on a project a small number of hours each week on the side of his current full-time job, usually at night or over the weekend. The trial period in this case can last a few weeks. While the trial can’t guarantee that the growth hacker you will bring onboard will work out, when combined with other data points in your evaluation process, it increases your chances of making the right hire. Related: A Practical Guide to Interviewing a Growth Marketer How to Try Out a Growth Marketer Before You Hire One To understand which skills to learn first, you need to know that there are three levels of Growth Hacking skills: Fundamental Skills, which are mostly mindset and insight-skills, like the Growth Hacking Mindset, being technical enough to be able to use different tools and understand how to use data (honestly it’s a lot easier than you think!).Generalist Skills, which are the basic skills that you need for any experiment that you will be running, because you always need to interview customers/users, always write text and (almost) always need visual design.Specialist Skills, which are the skills that you only need in specific instances.These specialist skills are the skills that you should mostly learn ‘on the job’, because you can’t know upfront what kind of experiments you’ll be running if you don’t work at a company yet. Some companies never use social media and others never need a referral program. Therefore, you should learn these skills first, but when you learn them you develop yourself to become a “T-shaped” Growth Hacker The most important skills are the Fundamental Skills where you should learn how to growth hacking works and what kind of mindset you should have. After you feel pretty comfortable to explain to others what growth hacking is, you can start reading more about the basic Generalist Skills, like copywriting and visual design. If you want to know what each skill means; I’ve written a full article on all the growth hacking skills, where I go in-depth on each and every skill, provide you a better view of what you should be able to as a starting growth marketer and there is also some learning material with each skill. Read the article here & feel free to share it if it helps you: Growth Hacker Skills in 2019: Technical, Analytical and Marketing Skills | Ward van Gasteren I’ve interviewed over 70 growth hackers in the last year and a half. I was the head of growth for several startups and run one of the largest growth hacking communities online, Marketers & Founders. A great growth hacker can validate intelligent hypotheses fast. The best growth hackers have an excellent intuition about user psychology enabling them to make better hypotheses. They’re also extremely resourceful when validating hypotheses. They’ll learn everything from SQL to Optimizely to find out whether they’re right. The most common trait I’ve seen is their ability to move on from failure fast. Growth hackers don’t think about failure. They just keep testing because their success depends on how fast they validate their hypotheses. In turn, the best growth hackers have a history lined with many failures, but because they were so persistent on improving, they found big wins. Moreover, the best growth hackers know psychology better than people who have a P.h.D in the subject. They obsess over it - read hundreds of books, analyze every online and in-person touch point, and often collaborate about new psychological tactics. This obsession gives them the rare gift of testing foresight. For most people, they need, at least, several years of growth hacking experience to acquire these strong predictive powers.

Follow @majavoje There Is More About Female Growth Hackers If you want to know a large list of female growth hackers, you should check the article that Cali Pitchel wrote. On this post, you'll find a list of 50 female growth hackers. This article was written almost 2 years ago but however is a good list. In the comments section, you can add more female growth hackers if you know someone. Furthermore, Cali Pitchel made a list on Twitter (#hacklikealady) where you can subscribe and add more professionals. Awesome! On the other hand, there is a blog that you must follow. Everygirl is the blog for women where you can find everything: career and finance, fashion and beauty, living, wellness, travel and so on. However, I love the content, I love the style and I love the user experience of the blog. It's amazing. Follow it.  Screenshot Everygirl Homepage Conclusion I remember a documental about the Spanish crisis. This documental says that the 80% of the businesses who it was running or managed by a woman never got the crisis. Yes, 80%! That means, statistically, the women were better on management than men. In my opinion, I think we need more women in the power. Really, we do need it. You can find more information in this post Who Are The Best Female Growth Hackers? - The Diary Of A Growth Hacker. One possibility is around Virality: 1. Companies share in order to bring more visibility and more talent 2. Applicants share to get better chances to be interviewed, but they could also forward / share the offer to their friends if relevant If you want to make something viral, you need to give some incentives. If Job Posters are paying to add their offer, you could offer a discount to the one who share. You could offer a Job Board to companies with a ""Powered by"", explaining your Value Proposition, which could get your message in front of a larger audience. One thing you could use is LinkedIn, you could post your Job Offers through their API and then send back the traffic to your website when people want to apply. It's difficult to give you ""Growth Hacks"" without any details on your Business Model. Growth Hacks need to be designed accordingly to your Value Proposition & Strategy. Also look at AngelList, they have a good scope between Investors / Startups / Jobs. Having this kind of Value Proposition could make your product viral in itself (""look where I found my last employee, he's a genius"").

Define your growth hacker persona Take the time to think through the goals and responsibilities of this position. Here are some questions you need to ask yourself: What outcomes do you want your growth hacker to achieve? Being specific helps you better understand the type of growth hacker you need to bring on board.What does your ideal growth hacker look like in terms of industry expertise and experience with specific channels? If you are looking for your first growth hire, for example, you probably want a strong generalist with relevant experience in your space who can hit the ground running from day one.What values does growth hacker need to have in order to fit in with your existing team? You need to be clear on this because people can learn the technical skills, but they can't change their basic values and personalities.2. Create a great pitch (job description) Hiring a top-level growth hacker in today’s market is a sales process from start to finish, so you must have a great sales pitch to pique the candidate’s interest in the role you are offering and get them into a conversation. Here are some things you need to highlight: The opportunity. Tell the candidate what makes your opportunity exciting. Outline your vision for the future and what you want to accomplish and, most importantly, how the candidate is expected to contribute to success.Expectations for the role. Indicate direction and areas that the growth hacker will own. State what you want a growth hacker to accomplish on the job by listing specific outcomes and the timeframe for getting there. Here is an example from Grammarly: What the candidate needs to bring to the table. Focus less on experiences and more on the results they achieved. This makes it easier for the candidates to assess whether they qualify for the role. Identify critical skills a candidate must possess based on your traction to date. Here is an example from The Hustle: Your offer. Summarize what the role offers in terms of experience and professional growth and provide detail on compensation and benefits that you are offering. If you are offering valuable non-financial benefits, be specific about them.3. Conduct targeted search Here are the options you can consider: Referrals. Referrals from your existing employees, advisors, and other members of your network are an effective hiring strategy. The key is to set up a systematic approach to mine everyone’s networks for best possible people. Yet, even with a strong network, finding a top-notch growth hacker who fits your exact requirements and has a track record of driving growth for companies in your space is still a long shot.Job boards. Most startups use job boards as a default recruiting strategy because it is easy and usually free. While you may get some interesting profiles, the real growth talent likely won’t surface because the best growth hackers are not active job seekers.Growth hacker communities. You can look for growth hackers where they hang out online and offline - GrowthHackers, assorted groups/channels on Slack, Reddit and Facebook, as well as meetups and conferences. These communities were created for a different purpose though, so your job ad outreach will likely get lost in the overall information flow.Direct outreach. Contacting growth hackers on LinkedIn is another possible option. Just searching for a ‘growth hacker’ will bring up a ton of names. The problem with this approach is that it takes a lot of time to identify relevant candidates and figure out who is the real deal. And with LinkedIn being crowded by recruiters, many candidates simply don’t respond to a cold outreach.Specialized talent sourcing platform. Another option is a dedicated talent sourcing platform for growth hackers, such as Growth Engineers. We help startups hire full-time and freelance growth hackers with a proven track record of driving growth for companies in their space. Clients outsource to us the heavy lifting of sourcing and reaching the hard-to-find growth hackers, so they only have to consider top-quality talent matched to their specific needs.At the end of the day, there are no shortcuts if you want to find a good growth hacker. You either invest a ton of your own time and effort or you lean on someone for whom solving your staffing challenge is the raison d’etre.

For most companies, this takes the form of reaching an unmet need or discovering potential buyers who weren’t previously a part of the market.

To learn more about this, discover How Growth Hacking Became A Successful Marketing Strategy. Why Many Startups Struggle There are many reasons why startups struggle – and, unfortunately, as many as 90% of them ultimately fail to meet their goals. Sometimes new entrepreneurs lack experience, and can’t quite get their ducks in a row when their business needs it to survive. Even experienced entrepreneurs can struggle to handle every aspect of a new business, and simply trying to multitask isn’t enough to get the job done. That’s why we offer best growth hacks, a worry-free service to let you focus on your products and services while we focus on helping you grow your business. Effective Growth: An iterative and Data–Driven Process A major part of Growth Hacking is the scientific process of designing and validating – through multiple iterations – a growth strategy that best suits your business’ needs. It’s a lot like comparing formulas in a laboratory to see which one offers the best balance of cost and results. The validation of the marketing strategy happens on a cyclical process based on testing, tracking, and progressively optimizing the results. In this way, it’s possible for a growth hacking consultant to create specific plans, define realistic goals, and ultimately make the growth process more effective. There’s no mystery or guesswork here – just data-driven facts. We perform Growth Hacking on three different levels MEASURING With measuring, we acquire quantitative measurements of user behavior that help us to understand who they are, what matters the most to them, and what refinements will make products and marketing more effective for them. ANALYSIS Once we have those measurements, we start working on constant analysis to help better understand the real-world impact of the strategy. Constant analysis is critical to successful growth hacking - in fact, many companies forget to reassess their marketing strategies, and that's often why they fail. OPTIMIZATION Finally, we work to implement the strategies generated by measuring and analyzing the company base. Much like analysis, optimization is an ongoing process, and it always has more growth for your company as the goal. Cleverativity best marketing agency will analyze, design, and validate a custom marketing strategy and techniques that's perfect for your business. We'll also help implement it so you can focus on running the rest of your business without the distractions that marketing can cause.

You remember that moment when you were young and your parents wouldn’t allow you to go to a party? At that time, You could have tried climbing out of the window, you could have said you were going to a private birthday party (which you weren’t) or would have said you were sleeping over at a friend’s place (which was true up to a certain degree). The point is, your goal (metric) was to go to the party, but the methods of achieving that goal were different. Some more successful than others. This is what growth hacking is. You set a goal (going to the party) of something bigger and better, even almost impossible and you try to get there in the fastest way, with the least amount of resources. Some tests will fail (like climbing out of the window) but if you test enough you’ll find a better approach (staying at a friends place) to reach your goal. In order to better understand Growth hacking, there is 3 things that you need to remember: First of all, Growth Hacking is not about hacks or tools. Just like in any sports, Growth Hacking is about processes & experimentation. If you don't train yourself to work out every single week, you won't see results. If you don't try anything new, you'll always fall behind. Use this guide to set up the growth process within your company: Growth Hacking playbook part 1/20: Process before tactics Secondly, Growth Hacking is not a process that was made only for Marketers, it can be applied to new product innovation and to the continuous improvement of products as well as to growing and existing customer base. The reason is simple. Most of the time you need at least 3 different skill sets to implement some of the best growth strategies: A Designer (to make everything beautiful)A Coder (to make everything work)A Marketeer (to make sure people get to see whatever you want to test)More experienced people can be a blend of 2 or 3 of these types. They are worth gold. Alright, you got your process and team in place, it’s time to unleash the tactics, right? Not really. Thirdly, the best growth ‘hacks’ are not because of a guy drawing an idea on a napkin. It was based on data. The key to growth is finding who your best customers are, solve their struggles and find out where you can get more of those people. Pretty simple, but therefore not easy. You might be thinking, how do I find my best customers? One simple word: Analytics. Most of the time, your product won’t be fully ready. In fact, I don’t think any product is every ready. Yet, there are always a couple of people that are going to (almost) complete your full funnel nevertheless. These are the people you want to pull out of your analytics and meet face-to-face to understand their motives. Now is the time you can start sketching your persona’s for marketing purposes and unleashing the tactics that fit their profile. Use this complete guide on setting up your analytics to track the full customer journey and pull those people out of your database. Growth Hacking playbook part 2/20: You don't know what you don't track How it’s implemented: Set up the growth process within your company. Generate and test ideas accordingly to test assumptions you might have.Create a cross-functional team with a mentality that is willing to fail.Use qualitative research and quantitative data analysis to gain deep insights into your user behaviour and preferences.Happy Growing! The best way to understand growth hacking and what growth hackers do is to first understand what is meant by the term hacker. A hacker is someone who is more concerned with achieving an objective than following a prescribed process. In other words, hackers care more about what needs to get done than how it should get done. As a result, hackers often come up with innovative ways to get things done. For example, a hacker may be trying to get unauthorized access to a computer system. It doesn’t really matter how he does it (and there often isn’t one specifically prescribed method) so long as whate Continue ReadingThe best way to understand growth hacking and what growth hackers do is to first understand what is meant by the term hacker. A hacker is someone who is more concerned with achieving an objective than following a prescribed process. In other words, hackers care more about what needs to get done than how it should get done. As a result, hackers often come up with innovative ways to get things done. For example, a hacker may be trying to get unauthorized access to a computer system. It doesn’t really matter how he does it (and there often isn’t one specifically prescribed method) so long as whatever he’s doing gets him access. Because hackers are more concerned with what needs to get done than how it should get done, they tend to be pretty anti-authoritarian and also not do so well at bigger companies where they are expected to do things a certain way. A growth hacker is a hacker whose objective is to grow the number of users for a specific product. While lots of people consider user growth to be a marketing function, this assumes that there’s only one way to get users (namely, marketing). But this isn’t true. In fact, more and more over the last few years we’ve seen new products grow from zero to millions of users with little to no marketing at all. There are lots of non-marketing decisions that affect user growth. Building viral product features is the most obvious, but there are many others (I’ll cover these in a future post). As a result, it doesn’t make sense to place growth hacking within a particular department like marketing or engineering. Instead, it ends up being a cross-functional role.  The idea is that for every decision a company makes, a growth hacker should ask: ”What will be the impact on growth?” For example, when Facebook was still in its early stages they built a cross-functional growth team led by a growth hacker that touched many other departments, including Marketing, BizDev, Product, Finance and even HR. Among many other projects, the team was responsible for making Facebook available in every language through crowdsourcing, implementing a robust system for importing email contacts, and even building out a “Facebook Lite” which was eventually shut down Over the last few years, truly innovative growth hackers have developed various frameworks and best-practices. Guys like Noah Kagan (AppSumo, Mint, Facebook), Mike Greenfield (Circle of Moms, LinkedIn), Dave McClure (500 Startups, PayPal) and many others have pioneered techniques focused on virality, email, search engine optimization & marketing. I also wrote a post recently in which I put forward the claim that growth hacking = lean marketing (http://www.growhack.com/2012/09/05/is-growth-hacking-lean-marketing/).",2021-03-06T22:31:41.542Z,"What is growth hacking?

There's a ton of info on growth hacking. Just read a few things and start experimenting. Learn from your results, ask questions, and repeat. Just keep going until you get something to grow ;) They will likely be extinct. Growth hacking involves flexing on a unique set of marketing, analytics, design and coding skills that don’t necessarily scale. Most startups need these skills badly before they reach product market fit, since this helps them get quick traction. Once the company matures and develops at least one viable acquisition channel, the marketing funnel needs to specialize and develop scalable processes. This is when growth hacking gives way to specific competencies like performance marketing/UA, content marketing, email/chat marketing, offline (event-based) marketing, affiliates etc. Truth be told - if you are a growth hacker at a company for an extended period of time, you’re probably not good at your job. To give a nuanced answer to your question — the skills will still be very relevant, but might not warrant a long term role at a company. Some other trends that I’m seeing right now — A lot of contemporary ‘growth hacks’ are being productized rapidly. Many features that were once growth hacks - like chat-bots, popups, web scrapers, automated email outreach etc. are now viable businesses themselves. Examples of these are: SumoMe.comOptimonk.comLandbot.ioHellobarA corollary of this is that the role of technology in the marketing/growth stack will continue to grow through 2025. Marketing will move from a tech enabled function to a tech-driven one in many ways. So if you’re looking to be competitive in the growth job market in 2025 - focus on the skills and learning, rather than targeting a specific role. Build a broad base and then focus on 1–2 core areas (SEO, email/chat marketing, landing pages and CRO etc.) and you will be in high demand. At the end of last year, we benchmarked growth marketer/growth hacker compensation levels (salary + equity). Here is the salary picture.  We define a junior to mid-level growth hacker as having 2-4 years of experience in growth/digital marketing/product roles and a senior growth hacker as having 5+ years of experience. Growth hackers also typically receive equity as part of the compensation package. On average, a junior to mid-level growth hacker in an early-stage startup should expect to receive 0.5-2.0% in equity participation. A senior growth hacker at a later-stage company gets about 0.1-0.5%.

However, I can’t agree less now. Why? Because since I am a Growth Hacker, I’ve learned and lived the difference. As a Growth Hacker you are not only tech-savvier, more data-driven but you also work a lot more on the product – what drives Growth basically. In my 3 years as a Marketing Manager, I almost only worked on Acquisition and Activation. We worked on Newsletters, Website Optimization, ASO, but never on referral, revenue and retention – not even on SEO (I’ve never touched a tool or code, because that was the job of a developer, who was basically always full with todos^^) These topics were only covered by the product teams, designers or external experts. Back then, it made sense for me. Now I totally disagree. A designer is an expert in UX and such. But he/she does not know a lot about data and driving Growth. A Product Manager knows how to deliver fast and with high-quality but little about user needs, design and data. And external experts – let’s say for SEO can push your page on Nr. 1 on Google, yes, but he/she has no idea (or little) about the other aspects in the funnel. That work separation makes sense when you want to improve but not when you want to grow fast. A Growth Hacker has the broad knowledge of marketing (t-shaped) and is not afraid to combine technology with marketing. That’s why Growth Hacking is more a mindset than a profession. Growth Hacking means know-how and the ability to act fast and data-driven. Growth Hackers are not better than digital marketers, but they work different for sure. And that’s the secret for growth! :) I’ve interviewed over 70 growth hackers in the last year and a half.

The purpose was to buy a food coatings business that was doing about $6M in gross sales (today’s dollars) a year and buy the founder’s likeness and his services as the coating’s brand representative. There was a garage office where the coatings were mixed, packaged and sent out and where the book keeper tallied up the royalty checks. If one of 600 restaurants sold a dinner branded with this company’s product? Caching! 6 cent royalty along with the required purchase of the branded coating. The partners paid $15M to buy the guy out. Yes, he was making money using licensing. His name and coating product yielded royalties. As it turned out, this stage of the business was going to evolve…a lot. The partners had written a check for $15M for a $6M operation and now it was time to expand….but how? One of the restaurants who featured the brand on a couple menu items was owned by a man named Pete Harman. Pete put together the design and logo for a 2500 square foot fast food unit with a counter and a drive through. He had it all down to the menu. He showed up in Louisville and met with the partners. John Y. Brown and Dick Massey agreed and the plan was born. They would sell licenses (franchises). Both single units and regions. Between that moment and 1969 (5 years) they built out 3,100 restaurants. Did you read that right? They averaged 50 unit openings a month and eventually went public. Essentially, using licensing, they went from $6M to $3B in five years. No internet, no mobile phones, you added shit up with a pencil and a piece of paper. In July of 1968 they opened more than 600 units. Is that enough of a “growth hack” for ya?  That’s him working the pressure cookers for the most successful fried chicken operation in history. He dropped out of 7th grade, but, Harland Sanders worked every day of his life and it paid off…through licensing.

It’s only the planning and strategizing that provides you an oasis in this scramble of competitive desert. 1. Know your Customers:  To understand the customers gives you a strategic edge while planning a sales campaign. The more accurate data  you have, greater are the chances of your success. This information will give you an insight of your customer's behavior, their requirements and about their demographics - that will further steer your major business growth decisions and allow you to map a marketing plan.  2. Foresee the Marketing Environment:  To have an understanding of your customer is essential, but there may also some business opportunities in the corner that emerge as a result of changing global scenarios. For example, in the wake of environment awareness, if your business provide eco friendly solutions, you can gear a worldwide promotion of your brand and company as a whole. 3. Customize Your Services For The Customers:  Having worked on marketing plan, now it’s high time to be assured that your product or services are providing solutions to your customers in real terms. Instead of tailoring and presenting things in the way the customer wants. often startups fall into the trap of making the product the way they want to sell. Be customer centric!  4. Design Targeting Advertising & Customer Communications:  In the competitive era of business, placing a few advertisements on billboards or online is not gonna make any difference to be get noticed. Consumers are bombarded with thousands of marketing promotions and they take less and less notice. You need to do something pretty special to stand out of the crowd. In order to appeal your targeted audience, make sure that your messages are clear and highly creative. 5. Human Capital:  Your employees are your assets - provide them proper training and fix their roles they need to be more efficient in their their tasks. From the receptionist to your sales rep, be assured that they are self driven and motivated, provide them the tools they need and make them feel responsible for their roles in the complete business plan. If every individual is integrated , your business will grow very much itself.  6. Have a Pricing Strategy  Pricing is a powerful strategy for sales acceleration- decide what you are your goals and what message you want to convey by fixing your price at a certain level. High prices means that you may possibly sell less, on the other hand it gives the impression of a premium product. Similarly, low prices gives you a breakthrough to dominate a particular market, although it leads to low profitability in a short term. Be aware that pricing is a segment of this whole strategy, and position it wisely in your marketing plan.  7. Respond to Complaints Well  Be highly committed to give customers an excellent experience of your services. If there is a complaint - respond quickly and positively. Always remember that your brand image can be damaged if people spread bad word about your business. A complaint if handled well may consequently turn the person into a loyal customer. Surprise and delight your customers by going above and beyond the call of duty for them. Always focus on building trust as it is a powerful selling tool. 8. Start prospecting to kickstart your sales campaign Sales prospecting is the logical next step of your growth hacking startegy. You need to generate high quality data concerning your targeted audience. For that no need to google it or extract all leads manually. Only need a prospecting tool that do it for you in a simple click.  Prospecting tools extract very accurate data on social media such as Linkedin, Xing, Crunchbase, Github, Viadeo or Twitter and export them to CRM or CSV file. The best prospecting software on the market right now is Salesfinder - #1 Social Prospecting Platform as it generate up to 70% verified email addresses and export them to pretty much all CRM.

According to me, both go hand in hand, both required influencing people, that's why I never got that 'Switch' feeling. I started off my career as content writer and worked with over 20 different companies and over there my career went from content writing to distributing etc. Around the same time, I started taking digital marketing seriously and spent a lot of time reading books and blogs about it and also experimenting my learning on my social media pages and it worked out in my favor. I joined a company as 'Social Media Manager' worked there for almost one year and moved to another company as 'Growth Hacker' I’m the path where the product meets marketing, I don't code, but at the same time, I don't have to put ads on billboards or social media but rather maintain a lot of sheets which have a different set of audience grouped and feedback around what worked and what needs to be scrapped.

Curious - To make sense out of lots of data of and information of different sorts it takes an inquisitive mind that knows how to formulate questions and lots of them.Intelligent - There are so many levers, so many tools, so many different aspects of a single product that it takes an intelligent mind to be able to grasp enough of it to produce working growth hacks.Open minded - You can't allow any ""we've already tried that, didn't work"" or ""that's not how we usually do it"" people here. (In my experience that rules out a lot of the PR consultant in this world.)Bold - A growth hacker must be good at assessing situations, especially the risk and chances to reward involved. And there must be a willingness to take some risks. Smart risks, as Steve Jobs put it.Social - I'm not sure it must be a an expert at handling social situations, but the growth hacker must have really good intuition around how people work.

It is also a fundamental business and marketing practice and hence it is likely to continue to trend and stay around for a while. What is growth hacking? Growth hacking is a method that enables you to increase your customer base and ensures that they continue to stay active by influencing their network. It could be a single tactic or a combination of many hacks that coaxes these customers to create a domino effect in their online ecosystem. Increasing the customer base as an objective is vintage but the ways to accomplish it has evolved over time. The most recent ones which have worked wonders are popularly called as growth hacking strategies and now is a great time to explore them, if you don’t want to be left behind. How to use growth hacking to your success? There are millions of ways to adapt growth hacking trends but there is no hard and fast rule that defines which one is the best. Here are some stepping stones that have been explored by some of the most popular growth hackers out there. IdeateWith growth as your central theme – be it measurable marketing objectives, competition, business evolution or use of technology in marketing; give yourself a brief to crack. Once you know which verticals to tackle, round up your team and ideate on the best ways and latest technologies that can be used and tested as a growth hack.ExperimentNewer the technology the better, as it makes way for a plethora of digital marketing experiments. These experiments will help you learn which growth hacks work and which don’t. They could be related to the best use of latest platforms like Periscope, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. or simply building a beautiful website that bridges the gap between you and your customers. Make a note of the key learnings and measurements as they might come handy in future.MonitorGrowth hacking is heavily dependent on data-driven marketing and vice versa. Your ideas and experiments will hold water only if they are supported by strong numbers. Hence, monitor and measure every experiment or campaign you run to increase your customer base. Their results give you a bird’s eye view of what you need to do next – whether to optimise the same campaign/experiment or adopt a new growth hack.OptimizeCampaign optimisations are often looked upon as a key to improving the numbers. Businesses resort to them only when they have unrealistic marketing objectives to be achieved against tight deadlines. But if used properly, optimisation could open a treasure trove of great growth hacking strategies. For e.g. the experiments that you have conducted so far may not have given you great results but they look promising. Here, optimisation can help in tweaking the experiments enough to enhance the outcome.GrowFinally, everything will boil down to how you chart out your growth journey using these hacks. Out of 10 ideas, you might have experimented with 6, monitored them all, optimised 3 of them and only one of them actually worked in scaling your growth. So, does that mean you should explore newer growth hacking strategies? The answer to that is yes and no. Yes, keep looking for the latest hacks and no, don’t give up on the old ones as you never know which one is gold.Growth Hacking Realized – Airbnb While the above steps sound great theoretically, you might be screaming for an example that puts things in perspective. So, let’s consider the growth story of Airbnb – the poster child of growth hacking strategies. Airbnb is an online platform that allows people to turn their bedroom/ spare room into a lodging space that can be rented by strangers. Today, it’s a revolution but it all started with two individuals who decided to do things differently.  The Idea Designers Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky were not able to afford the rent of their San Francisco apartment. So, out of survival instinct, they decided to rent out their loft. They had the option of posting their listing on Craiglist (a portal where people look for accommodations), but they felt that it would be too impersonal. So they gave it some thought and decided to build a simple website instead that would make their listing look personal and warm. The Experiment They built the website in a time when a design conference was coming to town and there was a lack of hotel space. They put up pictures of their loft-turned hotel space along with an appealing offer of home-cooked breakfast in the morning. Then they waited. They didn’t know how well this would work or whether it would even work. But eventually this got them three renters and within a week they started receiving inquiries asking when this facility will be available across cities and countries. This came as a surprise. The Smart Hack After some in-depth market research and planning, they set up a website for the international audience where people world over could list properties or book them for lodging. But now the problem was, how do they let people know about the existence of Airbnb in the smartest and cheapest possible way? They went back to the drawing board and decided to leverage Craiglist for its massive user base. They created a form that suggested the users to post their listing on Craiglist as well to get better traction. Optimisation While they did this, they optimised the user experience on their website with great pictures, warm language & story like descriptions and also ensured that the property listings earned more through Airbnb than on Craiglist. This changed the game for Airbnb as their customer base shot exponentially at minimal cost.  Growth Journey Airbnb could have continued with their Craiglist hack but they were smart enough to move on in time from poaching customers to focusing on augmenting their own product. They found out that they were not very popular in cities like New York, London, Paris, Vancouver, and Miami. The reason – renters were posting poor quality pictures of their properties and the users didn’t get to see what they are paying for. They could have tackled this by sending out a series of ‘How to’ emails. Instead, they sent a group of professional photographers to these places to click good quality pictures and posted them on the listings. Needless to say, this worked wonders for them not only in terms of increased bookings but also a spike in the trust factor owing to the authenticity of the pictures Since then, Airbnb has explored unique and human growth hacks like turning mere homestays into local living experiences, thoughtfully rebranding itself into a lovable brand, etc. Have you ever used a growth hack to leverage your startup?

For example, one of my friend startup was targeting an audience whose age is between 18 years to 35 years, now the question arise is where do you find this people hanging around in metro city of India ?  The best place to market your product is cafes, where normally you will find such crowd with this age group, so now if you advertise your product/service in various famous cafe actually helps you to get users.  In fact selecting cafe which provides free wi-fi service becomes added value in your marketing, because your audience can actually visit your website or app right from their mobile. So understanding your user/buyer personas is an important factor in growth hacking and making a product according to their requirement is also a growth hacking. Best Example.  Flipkart concentrated on customer support and quality service, however there were many other eCommerce stores in India but what all those stores were lacking into was customer support and quality service.  Flipkart focused on these 2 areas and delivered the right message through various channels to end user which is the result what they  are today in eCommerce industry in India.   The biggest challenge what eCommerce Industry was facing in India was trust relationship and if you are in India then you know how hard is to convince people to go online and buy things.  The message what flipkart delivered to people didn't only help their own brand but it really helped other companies in Building trust relationship with their users.

Evaluate experience and skills in an interview Track record. Having outstanding results differentiates real growth hackers from impostors. Your growth hacker should prove her worth by providing examples of how he crushed it. Probe deeply and ask follow-up questions to gain further insights into the candidate’s competence, behavior, and thought process: How did you come up with the idea?How did you execute it?What made it successful?What you could have done differently?Don’t settle for factual information. Get to the ‘why’ behind the candidate’s answers. Strong candidates will give you a detailed answer with specific metrics, a step-by-step process, and the reasoning they followed. Foundational knowledge. Explore the level of the candidate’s foundational marketing knowledge, as well as the expertise in specific channels relevant to your situation. What do you do to understand behavior of your target customers?How do you prioritize your experiments?Take me in detail through your most compelling PPC campaignCreativity. To test creativity, throw new situations at the candidate because previous experiences can easily be embellished. Put your company’s or a hypothetical funnel on a whiteboard and ask what they would do to improve it. How would you acquire more users?How would you increase engagement?Look for those candidates who are able to keep coming up with new, actionable, and relevant tactics to exploit, rather than those who are pulling from the list from a blog article in the back of their head. Analytical skills. To test analytical skills, show them a report of an ad campaign you are running. What should we do? How can we optimize it?Listen for an ability to explain data clearly and draw insights to move forward, rather than focusing on the ‘right’ answer. 2. Try out the candidate in a work situation In his book Work Rules!, Laszlo Bock, former SVP of People Operations at Google, says that the best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work sample. This makes sense since the actual work the candidate will be doing doesn’t consist of answering questions in a one-on-one setting. By getting them to do some real work, you are making sure the growth hacker you are hiring can produce the required level of output and has the skills needed for the role. Take-home assignment. If it’s not practical to do an onsite trial, ask the growth hacker to do a home assignment. Here are a few possibilities: Ask them to give you a short write-up on what they would do in the first 90 days after they come into the role.Write up an assignment with a real-life situation that they would be working on once they join, say, optimizing performance in one of the channels, and include relevant data. Then ask for their thoughts and analysis.One day/half-day onsite trial. If your interview process is sufficiently rigorous, you may not need more than a day (or even a half-day) of working together to see if a potential hire has the skills, work ethic, and personality to be a good fit. Having the candidate work in your office and around your team helps you gauge many things that you won’t get a feel for in a take-home assignment, such as how well the candidate collaborates with others, deals with uncertainty, and “hacks” his way forward. Your growth hacker candidate most likely has a full-time job, so ask her to take a day off. Prepare a specific problem to work on, ideally a challenge currently faced by your business, and work together. For example, at Canva, if the candidate passes the interview, he is first given a home assignment, consisting of growth hacking-related questions. Should the candidate do well on the home assignment, he is invited for a half-day onsite challenge. One-week trial. Most startups think they don’t have the luxury of doing a one-week onsite trial with candidates, but if you consider what’s at stake, it may be something worth looking into. A week can give you an even better appreciation of the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses and screen out those candidates that can’t walk the talk. Freelance/contract trial. You can take an even slower approach to hiring a growth hacker by having him work on a project a small number of hours each week on the side of his current full-time job, usually at night or over the weekend. The trial period in this case can last a few weeks. While the trial can’t guarantee that the growth hacker you will bring onboard will work out, when combined with other data points in your evaluation process, it increases your chances of making the right hire. Related: A Practical Guide to Interviewing a Growth Marketer How to Try Out a Growth Marketer Before You Hire One First, let's start by defining a growth hacker.  A growth hacker is a hybrid of marker and coder, someone that uses processes, data, metrics to grow a product and make informed decisions.  According to Neil Patel,   Growth hackers use their knowledge of product and distribution, find ingenious, technology-based, avenues for growth that sometimes push the bounds of what is expected or advised.

Here is how to tell you are ready to hire a growth hacker. 1. You have achieved product/market fit Don’t go looking for a growth hacker if you haven’t built a great product or service that customers want. You’ll be wasting money on bringing leads that either won’t convert or churn. Instead, your product must resonate with a target audience and demonstrate strong organic adoption. 2. You have a scalable business The investment in hiring a growth hacker is justified if your business is scalable. What does that really mean? There are two attributes that make a business scalable: operating leverage, in other words the potential to grow revenue with minimal incremental cost, and large addressable market. 3. You have infrastructure and processes in place You need to make sure you are in a strong position as an organization to handle growth. If you begin to grow without a healthy technical foundation and structure and documentation around operational processes, you will find your resources stretched thin, impacting your customer service levels and reputation. 4. You know how to scale your team As you move into the next growth phase, you will need additional resources. Have you identified the key operational areas that you will need to build up? Do you know where to go to get the talent you need? If you start thinking about these questions after you see strong growth, it will be too late and you will be time-pressured into making bad hires. 5. You know how to fund your growth You need to understand your path to profitability, how much financial runway you have, and your options for getting additional funding. Forecast what your revenues and costs may look like in a fast growth scenario, so you understand the size of the potential financing gap before you invest in hiring a growth hacker. 6. You have adopted a growth mindset The mindset of small bets, quick iteration, and creative thinking is a hallmark of growth hackers. To work with them effectively, you need to be comfortable with their approach. Accept their methodology of testing potential growth drivers and be prepared that it will take time and some failures before they can identify scalable and profitable customer acquisition channels for your business. 7. You understand growth yourself As for any other role, you should not hire a growth hacker without first sitting down and making a conscious effort to educate yourself on the basics. Without understanding the fundamentals of growth hacking, you won’t know how to evaluate and manage a growth hacker, resulting in a bad hire and damage to your bottom line.",2021-03-06T23:02:01.596Z,"How does a growth hacker work for a company and contribute to its growth?

I was the head of growth for several startups and run one of the largest growth hacking communities online, Marketers & Founders. A great growth hacker can validate intelligent hypotheses fast. The best growth hackers have an excellent intuition about user psychology enabling them to make better hypotheses. They’re also extremely resourceful when validating hypotheses. They’ll learn everything from SQL to Optimizely to find out whether they’re right. The most common trait I’ve seen is their ability to move on from failure fast. Growth hackers don’t think about failure. They just keep testing because their success depends on how fast they validate their hypotheses. In turn, the best growth hackers have a history lined with many failures, but because they were so persistent on improving, they found big wins. Moreover, the best growth hackers know psychology better than people who have a P.h.D in the subject. They obsess over it - read hundreds of books, analyze every online and in-person touch point, and often collaborate about new psychological tactics. This obsession gives them the rare gift of testing foresight. For most people, they need, at least, several years of growth hacking experience to acquire these strong predictive powers. If you’re passionate about growing early-stage companies, then it’s worth it. At the end of last year, we benchmarked growth marketer/growth hacker compensation levels (salary + equity). Here is the salary picture.  We define a junior to mid-level growth hacker as having 2-4 years of experience in growth/digital marketing/product roles and a senior growth hacker as having 5+ years of experience. Growth hackers also typically receive equity as part of the compensation package. On average, a junior to mid-level growth hacker in an early-stage startup should expect to receive 0.5-2.0% in equity participation.

You do not have to meet advertising force with an opposite force. Small armies using unconventional methods are the winners in 66 percent of wars over the past 200 years, and online marketing competition is no different. Your growth hacking is a product of the little tips that you find on hidden message boards. If you are using a new app that connects people that overlap with the target audience of your company, then you may not have to use the big social media platforms at all. For instance, if you are marketing to artistic Millennials, you will find a much easier time organically connecting to people on KanKan or Moorus than you will paying for ads on Facebook. Growth hacking is all about testing strategies by hand instead of accepting the predetermined strategies that are given to you by the larger social media platforms on the Internet. You are able to weigh the time, manpower and money that other strategies require and pick the best from this wider spectrum rather than limiting yourself. You will test strategies by hand in order to create your own predetermined arsenal that is customised to the business that you are trying to promote. Finally, as a growth hacker, you will help to create the sales funnel for the business. Taking great notes at every step of the process is essential, and knowing your audience will aid in this. For instance, if you know that you can convert a large number of Facebook page visitors into website views but not Twitter, then you know to focus your efforts on that particular forum. Perhaps you have gained traction in a niche forum that feeds a larger social network with stories and content. Because none of your competitors have this angle on the audience, you have a different sales funnel than any of your competitors.

The first, for EngineerJobs, was discovering the subreddit r/engineering and r/EngineeringStudents/. Reddit is a fickle audience of nerds and people that hate self-promotion, but another writer and I ingratiated ourselves to that audience by providing a ton of value without asking for anything in return. We answered loads of questions. We offered our expertise on what jobs were hot in what market. We asked what we could do to help engineers and engineering students struggling to find work. Going so far as to review resumes and cover letters. As Paul Graham says, “doing the things that do not scale.” And we also allowed the questions that kept coming up to inform our content strategy which, in turn, meant that we were writing more and better content we already knew engineers cared about. As a result they began sharing our posts on these subreddits for us and our traffic exploded. Within 18 mos of implementing this strategy we went from ~7M to 33M pageviews (annually). Now, to be clear, this was not all Reddit’s doing - but rather these subreddits were gatekeepers to a wider community. For every Reddit share we averaged 12–20 Facebook shares (and one post was picked up by Matlab and went even more viral; into 40,000 share territory) and often several backlinks. For a site that needed to monetize on the back of viewable impressions on job postings and advertisement revenues, this was great return on investment. … Secondarily, for Zift (a parental software company), we’re investing early on in helping non-profit organizations tackle problems we know are near and dear to parents. One example, we sought out experts and developed screentime guidelines in partnership with FOSI to assist families with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This has led to press coverage and conference speaking opportunities and ??? who knows what other doors will open down the line… which allows us to continue to expand our brand. And each of these become an opportunity for introduction to us from someone the consumer already perceives as being authoritative and trusted. A warm lead rather than a cold intro, if you will. Just because we try to provide as much value as we can to a good cause. … The story of “growth hacking” is often the story of finding a big audience and figuring out how best to provide value to it, or incorporate it. > Zynga (Farmville) grew on the back of Facebook. > AirBnB grew on the back of autoposting through Craigslist. > Paypal grew by offering a better payment solution than checks on eBay. And so on, and so forth… Most “hacks” aren’t hacks at all. They are very intentional vehicles by a new company to provide insane value (education, entertainment, ease of use, convenience) to a large, existing audience.

Screenshot Everygirl Homepage Conclusion I remember a documental about the Spanish crisis. This documental says that the 80% of the businesses who it was running or managed by a woman never got the crisis. Yes, 80%! That means, statistically, the women were better on management than men. In my opinion, I think we need more women in the power. Really, we do need it. You can find more information in this post Who Are The Best Female Growth Hackers? - The Diary Of A Growth Hacker.

In turn, the best growth hackers have a history lined with many failures, but because they were so persistent on improving, they found big wins. Moreover, the best growth hackers know psychology better than people who have a P.h.D in the subject. They obsess over it - read hundreds of books, analyze every online and in-person touch point, and often collaborate about new psychological tactics.

You do not have to meet advertising force with an opposite force. Small armies using unconventional methods are the winners in 66 percent of wars over the past 200 years, and online marketing competition is no different. Your growth hacking is a product of the little tips that you find on hidden message boards. If you are using a new app that connects people that overlap with the target audience of your company, then you may not have to use the big social media platforms at all. For instance, if you are marketing to artistic Millennials, you will find a much easier time organically connecting to people on KanKan or Moorus than you will paying for ads on Facebook. Growth hacking is all about testing strategies by hand instead of accepting the predetermined strategies that are given to you by the larger social media platforms on the Internet. You are able to weigh the time, manpower and money that other strategies require and pick the best from this wider spectrum rather than limiting yourself. You will test strategies by hand in order to create your own predetermined arsenal that is customised to the business that you are trying to promote. Finally, as a growth hacker, you will help to create the sales funnel for the business. Taking great notes at every step of the process is essential, and knowing your audience will aid in this. For instance, if you know that you can convert a large number of Facebook page visitors into website views but not Twitter, then you know to focus your efforts on that particular forum. Perhaps you have gained traction in a niche forum that feeds a larger social network with stories and content. Because none of your competitors have this angle on the audience, you have a different sales funnel than any of your competitors.

Growth hackers are so meticuluous people that they use their business data wisely and adjust their marketing strategy to their ever-changing data. As for your question, I’ll try my best answering with explanatory examples. To begin with, growth hackers use data to track the creation distribution and then the impact of certain tactics so that they can use this data to guide smart decisions. A digital funnel is a pathway that you want someone to take in order for them to do something that contributes to your growth. It is really important to measure the volume of each step in that funnel. But what is more important is to measure what happens between them, that’s conversion. By measuring the efficiency of the funnel, you can identify where your funnel is weak and once you know the lifetime customer value of each customer, you can even reverse engineer the funnel and make smarter marketing spend strategic decisions. Once you have grown your target audience, you have to do something to keep them loyal to your brand. That’s where your retention tactics come into play. Basic idea here is to create continuous value in your customers’ eyes so that they will never leave you. You might want to try focusing on your user experience, especially in the initial phase, you have to impress your users. Otherwise they won’t even bother figuring out your service. Later on, you have to keep them busy and engaged with your content. Here, you might want to try a rewarding system for users to keep them engaged. For further instance, if it’s a mobile application you can give them some sort of points to spend when they use your service on a regular basis. It can be developed much better of course. Moreover, you always need to have a back-up plan when the things go sideways. If you start losing your users / customers, you have to win them back with a concrete plan. E-mailing them or sending messages could be a way of achieving this. Especially the lesser they look like automated e-mails, the better your chances are at winning them back. I hope it answers your question! All the best!",2021-03-06T23:17:15.546Z,"Are there any academic papers talking about a growth hacker? ",Quora

Still trying to figure this out… In all seriousness, being “good in data science” isn’t rocket science (it’s data science :-)), it’s learning business, statistics, and programming by way of databases and scripting languages like R or Python. Then the hard part comes in - solve a problem using data. Find an insight. Get people excited about data. 1/3rd of my role is being a data evangelist. I get people excited about data.

Honestly speaking, having a team dedicated to growth works best when they’re in-house. The growth team needs to live, breathe and talk the product/service to be able to produce a sustainable, long term growth. However, having a marketing/growth team of A players in-house is not possible for every startup. Common reasons: Lack of quality - Finding good digital marketers with strong base in SEO, communications, design and user experience is very difficult.Expensive - The good ones are fu**ing expensive. You know why? Because setting up your website/app/product/services for success requires a lot of time and work. The marketers have to know the industry in and out, competition, prices, keep up with the market trends and what not. Then understand you product/service through and through - create compelling content around it, find your target users and find ways to present them your site.So the reason why we set up Ghaas is: To make good digital marketing discoverable. Companies and entrepreneurs looking for result oriented folks to work with should not have to go through stacks of resumes and days of interviews to find good marketers.To make good digital marketing accessible. We know it’s financially draining to hire a solid marketing team in-house. Thats where Ghaas comes to rescue - you’ll have a dedicated, talented digital marketing team run by experienced growth marketers at your disposal.We’re the next best thing to an all star, in-house marketing team. We’re not a huge, 50 people agency - we’re a small team of ex-founders, growth marketers and product guys. We bring all the skills necessary to run growth for a company, while keeping ourselves agile, fluid and fast.

My two cents to that is a research we made on the most reputable growth hacking agencies in Europe. If you value your business and money, please read it carefully before you work with any growth hacking agency. By the way, I am running Growth Sandwich, a Product/Market fit agency, so, by definition, we don’t compete with Growth Hackers. Most of us have heard stories of founders who had a bad experience working with growth marketing agencies. Stories that (usually) start with excitement and anticipation but end with a respectable loss of earnings and disappointment. What is the reason behind this? Is there something wrong about the clients and their expectations, or about the growth marketing agencies? We will go for the latter… There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with the way most growth marketing agencies close and serve their clients. We knew it and decided to do something about it. Is our research going to prevent you from hiring one of these agencies? Most likely not. However, it will, at least, help you, understand that when it comes to growth marketing agencies, you always need to do your research. Why (and How) We Conducted the Research The “Why” Behind the Research The “why” behind this research is simple: we wanted to uncover the way growth marketing agencies sell their services and close new clients. You see, nowadays we experience the spread of misinformation, the quick ones win, and so do “growth hacks” that promise growth equal to Dropbox, Airbnb, and Robinhood. However, most times, these promises don’t come easy. What We Did (and How) Our methodology was—once again—simple: 1) First, we did online research using terms like “growth marketing agency,” or “growth hacking agency.”  To be clear: we’ve known most of these growth marketing agencies since we work in the same industry. The point was not to make a list of direct and indirect competitors but to follow the journey anyone searching for a growth marketing agency, could follow. 2) Then, we made a list of the most popular results in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Page). The process that we used is relatively simple, even for someone who is not savvy. In fact, anyone can follow the same journey as we did, and see for themselves. What is more interesting though, is not how we conducted the research, but what we discovered. Note: We used only organic search results for our research, and not results from Google ads. 3) Next, we created a list of 15 agencies, and plugged them into a Google Spreadsheet:  Here is the meaning of each column: Replied: If the agency responded to our initial Email.Meetings Before Proposal: The number of meetings required before we got a proposal.Access Asked: If the agency asked for access to evaluate our status (i.e., access to Google Analytics account).Access Given: If we granted access to any of the requested assets.Discovery (y/n): If the call that we received was a discovery call, meaning that the agency tried to identify our needs.Proposal Speed (in days): The number of days needed, to get a proposal from the agency.BS Meter: Our internal BS-and-fluff-meter4) Finally, we contacted each one of the agencies in our list and tried to make a “Discovery Call.” Only 4 (four) of the agencies that we contacted didn’t respond. 2 (two) of them initially responded but they never returned our call . We never managed to reach them on the phone, probably due to a scheduling conflict or because of other reasons. Thus, we proceeded with the calls with 9 (nine) of the agencies in our list, to discuss the needs of a real company with real business needs. What We’ve Discovered 1) Where is the Discovery Phase? Is it possible for an agency that makes thousands (and even millions) of $ in annual revenue, not to have a Discovery Phase? You can note “yes” in that column. 63.6% of the agencies that we managed to reach didn’t have a clear Discovery Phase. If you are wondering why the Discovery Phase is essential, let me give you a quick example. Let’s assume that you visit the doctor for a health issue that you encounter. What’s the first thing doctors do when they examine a patient? They ask questions. And, why is this important? The reason is, they can’t prescribe any medication before finding out what’s wrong with the patient. “What surprised us is that agencies with hundreds of thousands (and even millions) of $ in annual revenue, didn’t have a Discovery Phase.” Similarly to doctors who ask questions, an agency MUST identify what the problem is before making any suggestions. In our case, that didn’t happen. Except for two agencies*, all the others tried to sell us services without identifying the problem that we were experiencing. That’s a red flag; and, it’s so big that should scare us right away. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the only one… *We can share contact details for the two agencies upon request. 2) Rushed (and Even Scammy) Proposals That’s a bold statement, but most of the proposals we received were rushed (and looked scammy). Here is what I mean: 66.6% of the proposals we received were sent within 5 (five) days, with just one meeting and no discovery questions.53% of the proposals were promising “growth hacks” that were irrelevant to our (pretend) needs.Most proposals were selling all of the agency’s services, without caring about our pretend business needs.Some agencies used fake data to impress us—for example: “you can get 40% Reply Rate to a cold Email campaign.”26.6% of the proposals we received, promised outdated practices that could get us penalized in the post-GDPR era—for example, cold Emailing is (still) ok and works fine.A small percentage (13%) included false statements—for example, x tactic optimizes Conversion Rate by 8% (as if this was a benchmark and can work for everyone).Most times, it was a junior marketer who was trying to sell us second-hand growth tricks, and handled the “discovery call.”Finally, many proposals were focusing on quick conversion (a staggering 40%), rather than on a thorough break-down of our problems and the proposed solutions.Going down the rabbit hole, we found out that most growth marketing agencies use buzzwords and complex jargon to impress their prospects. To what extent? Just keep reading. 3) Buzzwords and Complex Jargon That’s common among growth marketing and growth hacking agencies. However, throughout our undercover research, the BS-and-fluff-meter turned red. We saw how vividly agencies use buzzwords and complex jargon as a way to impress the prospect.Do prospects fall for that? Most likely, yes. For us, it was just another red flag, as we were trying to uncover the inefficiency behind the fancy words. 4) Growth Marketing Agencies = Narcissism What is the definition of a narcissist? Well, according to Wikipedia, a narcissist is: “A person who has an excessive interest in or admiration of themselves.” We knew that agencies like talking about themselves, their case studies, the companies they’ve worked with or the rewards they’ve received. We hadn’t expected though that this would overshadow the Discovery Process. The narcissism involved is depicted if we take into consideration the words that we kept hearing: “We are,” “We did,” “We achieved,” and “We had.” That’s another red flag and it applied in 60% of the cases. Don’t (ever) fall for that. 5) Junior Marketers; Why Not? Taking a look at the profile of the employees working in large growth marketing agencies, we identified a pattern. Most agencies —with a few exceptions— employ ,mostly, junior people. In fact, 53% of all the agencies, we included in the research, employ 51.5% of junior employees on average. This is not a red flag on its own; but combined with the fact that these junior employees are called to handle and solve complex marketing problems, without supervision and a clear process, can be a red flag. Our initial assumptions came true: most growth marketing agencies care mostly about closing the sale (even though their sales process is far from outdated) and then, pass the client to a junior who must deliver on a project that far exceeds their skills or knowledge. Why? Simply because a junior is cheaper than a more experienced employee. The best part? That many of these juniors (usually called “growth hackers” or “growth experts”) are coming from totally irrelevant—and even non-digital—fields that have nothing to do with marketing. Would you hire someone who has an irrelevant background (to what you are looking for), is inexperienced, and charges thousands of $ per month to take care of your marketing and growth needs? I hope you answered “NO” to that question… Clients Are NOT the Victims Clients shouldn’t employ the role of the victim in this situation. Even if in some cases they are, they (really) shouldn’t be. “Yes,” there is a serious flaw in how growth marketing agencies close and serve their clients, but you can’t say that you didn’t know. Instead of abandoning the situation to its fate, here is what you can do: Educate yourself, and compare the proposals available.A doctor’s job is to fix you, not to please you. Stop buying services that please you, and start hiring responsible people that are data-driven and support their statements with facts.Ask difficult (but fair) questions. Ask them about a few times they failed and why they did so; check their portfolio, approach past clients and ask about them.Hire the people that explain the why’s and the how’s and stop trusting “growth hackers” and other (self-taught) magicians.If you want to hire a growth hacker, at least, first, learn what growth hacking is. Watch this course to learn more.The Bottom Line? So, there you go: you visit the website of a growth marketing agency. You are pumped by the client logos, the (irrelevant) testimonials they have at the bottom of their page, by their well-crafted website copy, and by their “x Ways to Improve your Facebook Ads Performance” blog post. My question is: would you work with that agency? The internet is a place where (literally) anything can be transformed into something valuable and attractive. However, most times, we don’t know what’s behind the curtain. My point is: if a shed can be transformed into London’s best restaurant, why can’t a group of junior marketers with a non-existent discovery process sell services of thousands of $ to startup founders, and business owners? But, we like looking on the bright side of things. If anyone can (still) sell growth hacks and cheap marketing tricks with a short-term effect, then anything in marketing is possible. Note: Throughout this process, we identified two agencies that indicated a high level of professionalism. They even resisted on giving us a price quote, if they weren’t given more information on our company and our business needs. We respect that, and we acknowledge their honesty. If you want us to give you their names, feel free to write to us, and we’ll share further details. Yes, there are many ‘growth hacking agencies’ but as Savvos says, it’s about finding the right one. Growth marketing is centered on a process that delivers incremental growth over time based on the data received as you roll out the growth process. Many traditional digital marketing agencies have merely rebranded themselves as ‘growth hacking agencies’ without a fundamental shift in their thinking.

Growth marketing is centered on a process that delivers incremental growth over time based on the data received as you roll out the growth process. Many traditional digital marketing agencies have merely rebranded themselves as ‘growth hacking agencies’ without a fundamental shift in their thinking. Here is a recent post on how traditional marketing agencies are dying - The death of the digital marketing agency. To clarify, I co-founded a business called Rebel Hack, a London based digital growth hacking marketing agency to help great ideas get above the noise using growth marketing and data analysis. One of the things we have identified is that there are basically 2 forms of project we work on. The first is ‘idea validation’ and the second is ‘scaling businesses’ with traction.  Startups that have not validated their ideas have a very different set of problems that those that have found some level of early traction. In this phase founders should not be aiming to grow their business, instead they focus on what validation looks like; identifying and finding measurable outputs that enable them to feel more confident about pushing for growth. Ultimately it’s about finding product market fit - and this is really hard! Trust me. This phase is very much focussed on user testing, usability testing, social media outreach, advocate and community building alongside mini traction tests to find out where your potential customer base is lurking. Very often there are hands on interviews and little pivots until you have identified a problem that really does exist, and have a product that solves it in the eyes of the users. There is no easy win, and I would almost say this is the hardest kind of project to work on. Some startups are unrealistic in their approach, so much so that we’ve had to refuse to work with them. One for example, asked that we take an untested app to a million downloads in 3 months! We’re lucky in that we’re able to be thoughtful about who we work with, it’s a partnership after all, and some founders are genuinely fantastic to work with. It’s about open transparency, working together and building a solid relationship. As Morgan Brown, one of my growth heroes, reminds us, “growth is a team sport”! The second type of engagement is heavily focussed on growth. A deep foundational growth rather than one of spending lots of money on digital media or acquiring a ton of emails. In this phase businesses with product market fit and signs of traction are looking to push for rapid growth, identify and implement quick wins. In this kind of engagement we approach growth marketing in a very holistic manner, looking for wins down the sales and product funnel. It’s very much about unlocking potential growth by leveraging multiple experiments in an iterative approach to make multiple incremental improvements down the funnel. This is where process and agile marketing come in, being able to reprioritise based on what you are seeing in the data so that you can move quickly to exploit opportunities as they emerge. Ask any ‘growth hacking agency’ to explain in detail their process for growth. It should be clear, repeatable and always based on data. I echo Savvos’ point that if you (as a startup) are not able or willing to change your mindset and understand growth is a process that requires product development, retention work alongside top level awareness and acquisition, then you are doomed from day 1. There is such a thing as ‘bad growth’ - you need to find ‘profitable’ ways to grow your business and not get consumed (like so many) in vanity metrics. Building sustainable growth engines into your business requires a highly focussed approach and a real understanding of your business/unit economics. Data strategies are critical, and much like the product should be implemented early on and improved with.

As you start exploring each marketing channel there will be additional skills you will need to acquire. For example, read up on the fundamentals of Google Adwords before committing any money to that platform. It's easy to blow through your money and time, with nothing to show, if you don't understand how it works. My newsletter Growth Hacking Digest can help in this regard. It's the same for all the marketing channels. You need to acquire at least some knowledge before you conduct your tests. You can’t really learn growth hacking in business school.

Connecting with people on Linkedin, meeting up for coffee and sharing knowledge. There are a bunch of reasons why growth marketing has become increasingly popular in recent years. Startups are looking to grow as fast as possible while spending as little as possible. Growth marketing can be extremely cash efficient.Venture capital firms are looking for a liquidity event within ten years or the fund will not be able to return capital to its limited partners. With this timer on venture-backed startups, companies must accelerate growth at all cost.Growth marketing is data driven. At small and large companies alike, the board room is becoming increasingly data driven. Through funnel analyses, a/b testing, surveys and other experimentation, growth marketers are harvesting valuable information that can drive decision-making on the highest level.Marketers have heard stories of incredible success with growth marketing.

GrowthHackers - A Community for the Growth Obsessed to Connect and Get Inspired managed by Sean Ellis Morgan Brown and others is relatively new, but they have done a GREAT job with attracting a lot of growth-minded individuals who contribute regularly and almost everything on that site is worth reading. Startup-marketing.com  is a blog that was run by Sean Ellis as well, and although it’s no longer active (at least to my knowledge) the content that is on there is still a goldmine.  Dave McClure famously devised ""Pirate Metrics” due to the acronym AARRR (acquisition, activation, retention, referral and revenue) I recommend viewing Startup Metrics for Pirates  Brian K Balfour has a great blog at brianbalfour.com  Andrew Chen writes a lot about virality at andrewchen.co, he played a large role in popularizing the term “growth hacker”.  Noah Kagan is probably the coolest due on the ‘net. You should checkout okdork.com and AppSumo.com. He posts a lot of creative acquisition ideas on Quora, youtube, etc. He’s everywhere so follow him. There are others, but the point is not to get overwhelmed. Paid resources: GrowthHacker.tv provides interviews some big names and gives a good overview of what growth hacking is and how to think of it. You can find some good online courses at GrowHack.com which is run by Conrad Wadowski Mattan Griffel and Ankur Nagpal, all very accomplished and growth oriented individuals. Knowledge.ly has some interesting courses as well. Ryan Holiday wrote Growth Hacker Marketing which is a good overview of growth hacking and I’d recommend it if you’re interested in the topic. Also, I wrote a guide on this called http://accel.io/guide/the-beginners-guide-to-scrappy-growth-hacks I partnered with Moz, CrazyEgg, Growth Hacker TV and Page on Knowlede to create a nice package of extended free trials/coupons and content. So, there’s a lot of content out there. You should read/watch a little bit at a time and then actually DO the things you learn! A lot of people forget that part :) No need to reiterate AirBnB/Craigslist or reference Facebook and Twitter. Growth is EVERYWHERE. Go where people are and give them a reason to come to your site, then make sure you can track and onboard them properly, retain them, etc, etc. etc. It’s a process. Just go out there and do it. It’ll click overtime as long as growing things gets you excited and you make a real effort to do so. A little bit at a time, learn about your customers, find what’s working and double down. Also, don’t be afraid to reach out for help. A simple email has lead me to opportunities that I never thought I’d be able to get. People love to help, and people who are really passionate about growth will share ideas, opportunities, etc.  Good luck!",2021-03-06T23:24:35.565Z,"What are the best books or web resources on Growth Hacking and User Acquisition?

Virtually everyone is an expert in the field, everyone claims to do it all the time, but the only ones who have ever really done it are just not in the room. But while pubescent teenagers eventually grow up and the topic (for most) normalizes, the Internet is like Neverland, where it was decided at some point that you just won't grow up No wonder, then, that hardly a day goes by without blogs and magazines raving about the new miracle weapon from the marketing arsenal. Unfortunately, we've all fallen for a big lie: Growth Hacking is the solution for everything.  That's certainly not the answer you expected from such a headline. Probably you ended up here because you want a project to grow and you or your boss have heard about this crazy ""Internet"" and in the course of a very tough meeting the phrase ""Let's go virally"" has fallen and you are now looking for answers. Although it may not seem that way right now, this article is just right for you. Growth Hacking History The idea behind the concept is to stimulate maximum attention and brute growth with as little monetary input as possible. More on my definition on Growth Hacking, here: What is growth hacking? Those who wanted to grow quickly before the birth of the Internet had to go through a high marketing budget, which I affectionately call a brute force approach. If you simply bomb any available advertising space over a correspondingly long period of time, you will sooner or later find your way into the brain of your consumers - mission accomplished. It still works today, but this strategy is not a real option for start-ups due to limited resources and skills in the field. Fifteen years ago, doing something out of nothing was quite difficult, but the rules of marketing and advertising changed drastically with the birth of social networks. This revolution turned passive consumers into active broadcasters, which became the basis for growth hacking. Companies such as Facebook, Snapchat, Tinder and Spotify have all achieved impressive and sustainable growth with comparatively few resources. The Misunderstanding The above examples show that the subject cannot actually be denied and that there must be something to it. It's true that these new players, who are now easily overshadowing traditional companies, have done something different. However, I think it is wrong to call this approach growth hacking, or to pretend it was really something new. In truth, what these companies did was a well-known strategy. The fact that something so old and elemental is celebrated as the new big thing shows that we currently have a very fundamental problem in understanding marketing. There are two big misunderstandings about this issue. On the one hand one believes that by copying ""tricks"" one can copy the success of others and thus maintain virality. Instagrams cross-posting feature was such a trick or Twitter's suggested user. Here are countless examples of smart and very successful decisions that all have one thing in common: They can't be copied because they only work in the context of the product. Growth hacking does not only consist of such smart tricks, but also relies heavily on the use of cost-effective channels such as blogs, kickstart pages and newsletters. These are intended to guarantee that the stall burns down without a large budget. The Conclussion Now it happens that marketers and entrepreneurs read the countless articles, listicles and columns on the topic and try to transfer the advice to their business. But instead of relative growth figures in the three-digit range, in the end they only created content cemeteries and squandered a lot of time, capital and potential. It's not nonsense, it's just not new for the most part.  Since it became a buzzword, it's been expanded pretty broadly as a concept, and now looks mostly like product management. To quickly summarize some of the info that's out there: a growth hacker is someone who can come up with creative marketing ideas, prototype them, and measure the impact of their product over time. More broadly, growth hackers are responsible for an entire product funnel: acquiring users, activating them during their first couple uses of the product, and engaging them over a longer period of usage of the product.

Since it became a buzzword, it's been expanded pretty broadly as a concept, and now looks mostly like product management. To quickly summarize some of the info that's out there: a growth hacker is someone who can come up with creative marketing ideas, prototype them, and measure the impact of their product over time. More broadly, growth hackers are responsible for an entire product funnel: acquiring users, activating them during their first couple uses of the product, and engaging them over a longer period of usage of the product. It’s great to be able to do all this, but we’ve already got people who do most of these things, and they’re called product managers. The best PM’s are creative enough to come up with product ideas, technical enough to prototype them, and data-savvy enough to measure their success. This was true before we had growth hackers. Product managers were clearly thinking about the success of their products before growth hacking came about it, and there were plenty who measured success quantitatively. When shipping a product, even a PM without a strong metrics background is most likely measuring how many people adopt it and how much they’re using it over time. If that person has the resources, he or she would probably A/B test strategies to get more users to adopt it and use it over the long-term. These basic tactics have been best practices since before growth hacking adopted them. Even the user acquisition aspect of growth hacking was already a part of the PM’s job description in some respects - we had viral coefficients and A/B testing of landing pages long before we had growth hackers. Admittedly, an increasing amount of distribution comes through product, rather than traditional marketing, with the emergence of Facebook, Twitter, and the rest of the platforms. And yes, only engineers can take full advantage of those platforms. But, for most companies growth hacking isn’t a new job or even a new way of thinking, it’s a new responsibility for product managers that emerged when distribution methods matured. I walked into a talk a few months ago here in New York where a self-proclaimed growth hacker gave his spiel about the practice. The room was overcrowded and people were hanging on to the walls eager to get their questions answered at the end of his presentation. The questions and discussion went on and on and way over the allotted time we had in the room. It was clear to me that growth hacking was the buzz word du jour.

The room was overcrowded and people were hanging on to the walls eager to get their questions answered at the end of his presentation. The questions and discussion went on and on and way over the allotted time we had in the room. It was clear to me that growth hacking was the buzz word du jour. But rather than dismissing it as a fad or a self aggrandizing propaganda tool I want to acknowledge the enthusiasm that everyone in that room felt. Yes, it is not unlike the responsibilities of a product manager or even a CMO. Yet what I saw in the youthfulness of the presenter was the future of what I believe marketing – and advertising should and will become.  In the old days we used to message out. “Try our product, it is so awesome” and we would take that very same message and drape it with all sorts of entertainment value and we would get very clever about it and sometimes people would remember the product or service that was associated with the message. But most of the time they would not. And then came the web when advertisers tried it some more and they noticed that messaging out was becoming less effective. And then came mobile when everyone noticed that messaging out was not only ineffective but gosh darned annoying. Think about it. This may sound pedantic to most of you but your mobile device is the most personal thing you carry. It’s what connects you to your friends and the world around you. And most people would rather forget their wallets at home then forget their phone.  So advertising has no place on mobile. But smart marketing does. And this is where growth hacking fits in. Born from the world of technology growth hacking is about optimizing the user experience so that your user becomes your advocate. And thus, no need to advertise because, as we know, the most effective advertising is word-of-mouth. Especially amongst friends. And their friends. And their friends.  From what I can tell, growth hacking is in its early phase. Most practitioners are young and haven’t been through the full customer life cycle, the ups and downs, of a product launch. Or a brand crash. Witness the ups and downs of some of our most valued brands – like Facebook or Instagram - as they bumble (and shed users) with privacy issues and things they should know better to mess around with. And most are still figuring out the loyalty thing and how to retain the user/customer over time. I mean, gosh, how many apps do you still use?  Let me step away from the title for a second and let me tip my hat for the enthusiasm of the movement. It is a pragmatic approach to a very simple idea – how to make your product – or service – better. And it reminds me of the early days of advertising when, in the early twenties, advertising agencies partnered with manufacturers to make their products better. Before agencies became all about the message out the best of them were actively involved in the product life cycle because most manufacturers had no internal marketing, or product management, team. And before they became all about the message out the best agencies spent enormous time researching customers and helping to hone the business model. And many times even affecting the actual design of the product itself (think the Coke bottle).  The best agencies and marketing teams still do this but growth hacking, in my humble opinion, is at the tip of the spear of a new wave and age of product and service design and development because they are actively aware of the user/customer FIRST and are not encumbered by the legacy of a management team who are stuck in the world of “message out”.   Yes, you will have charlatans, snake charmers and hoodwinkers but the best growth hackers will drive real value. And that is how they should be measured. So give them a break. The best will float to the top and their products will show it. Let’s see where they go. I feel fully confident that they will upend the industry and make all marketers, product and service designers and product managers smarter and better.",2021-03-06T23:25:13.124Z,"Is Growth Hacking nonsense?

Advertising is expensive and the results are generally impossible to measure accurately, so this should only ever be used by established market leaders. Marketing costs are variable (depends on the industry), but generally lower than the costs of advertising. Everything is measured, and the campaign is considered a success if the average customer acquisition cost is lower than the average customer lifetime value. Growth hacking techniques require very little (or even zero) money to implement, and as such the costs don't need to be measured and analyzed. If you spend $0 and you don't get any new customers, you still break even. What is measured is how many new customers are acquired for each existing customer the company has. Rather than paying to get new customers, the idea is to leverage the company's non-monetary value instead. This requires a great deal of creativity usually, and a very good understanding of the entire company- particularly the technology platform and its current financial health. In summary, the point in which marketing becomes growth hacking: when the company is growing (getting new customers) without spending money to make that happen. We are different people. We have different mind-sets. But from the outside we are same-same. Same-same, but different. Whereas the traditional marketer solely focuses on acquisition and activation.

Simply doing SEO, SEM and social media doesn’t make you a growth hacker. No. Scraping LinkedIn profiles for email details. Asking people to refer the product via Whats-app. Or integrating with incumbent platforms to steal users. All for free and at scale. Those make you a growth hacker. Growth hacking comes from a necessity. The necessity to scale at insanely low costs. Which means that a growth hacker has to be creative, fast, and work with no budget.

But, in accordance to various surveys and statistics, customers are no longer very intrigued by outright advertising and outbound marketing. So, here content becomes king as it acts as a very powerful tool to create traffic and convert potential customers into leads. Here is where inbound marketing comes in and the right strategy for the same would really help the business to create more number of leads and retain them. Mentioned below are some effective inbound marketing strategies, which can help you grow your customer base and help you to run your business better: 1.	Blogging Posting interesting and useful blogs on your website can help generate traffic and establish credibility and value. Moreover, it is seen that 77% of businesses that post blogs, attract more traffic on their website which can thus help your business get more visibility and recognition. 2.	Use SEO to increase visibility With the growing use of smartphones, people like to save their time by shopping and browsing online. For you to gain more visibility in the online space, you should make sure that the content and your website is optimized. This is really crucial as 93% of online shopping experiences begin with a search engine. 3.	Produce quality content The content that you post online should be of quality and must be authentic along with being optimized as it would help create trust and would be useful to the reader. Potential customers that like your content will revisit your website and there is a higher chance of conversion. 4.	Guest Posting Guest posting is one of the most effective inbound marketing strategy. This is because it will help you establish good relationships with various influencers. Not just that, but you will be provided with backlinks and helps you get an authority in the online space. 5.	Inbound Services Inbound customer service is a service provided to customers or potential customers to help them with product information, inquiries, registration, payments, etc by ringing a single number. This is one of the most potent ways of converting and retaining customers. 6.	Make your content interesting Analytics, data and graphs are really helpful ways of communicating messages through your content. But it becomes a little boring for the reader to read on if there is no story to your content. This is why, adding a connect and making your content interesting is very vital. 7.	Customer Reviews Customer reviews can act as a very effective marketing tool as it helps your business to appear more reliable. Moreover, customers these days are really cautious before making a purchase and prefer going through reviews to establish a sense of credibility and trust. It is also seen that 88% customers trust the reviews given by other customers just as much as they trust recommendations by their close ones. 8.	Reward your loyal customers These are the customers who would potentially make repeat purchases if you service them well. After all, it is a herculean task in itself to create new customers so retaining the old, classic and loyal ones becomes crucial to the business. Rewarding them would want to make them come back and make recurrent purchases from you. Conclusively, inbound marketing strategies have much higher conversion rates than that of outbound strategies. This is because the attention span is falling and you really need to engage and intrigue potential customers to convert them to leads. So the various strategies mentioned above would can be conducive to garner more traffic and make new customers. Consistently put out original, relevant, quality content. From the title down to the keywords used, make sure everything reeks of quality. There’s a wide range of content to choose from—case studies, testimonials/success stories, in-depth articles. Whatever answers the question, “What does our target market need?” Of course, there’s not one specific need because not one customer is alike.

So, it’s vital to add variety to the content that you make available. Try out tutorials, tips and tricks, listicles, and how-to guides. Go social and promote your content. There’s always LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. Promote your content using any of these channels and include call-to-action triggers. Whatever you do, make sure you share content in channels where you get the most qualified leads. You can post 20 tweets a day with 0 leads or you can post 7 posts daily via Facebook and get 4 leads. See my point? Good. Gated content, maybe? I know some marketers are against gated content but it delivers us baskets full of qualified leads each week. I guess being a SaaS company, our audience are mostly after premium content—think real value. Gated content only works if the material you’re guarding can provide solutions, add value, overcome challenges, and displays how your product can benefit your target market. If you’re thinking twice about using gated content, Pinpointe has identified the pros and cons for you. A free trial sounds like a sweet deal. Offering a free trial doesn’t mean you don’t trust that your product could make money, it’s a gateway for qualified leads to know your product’s value. Once signed up, you should send personalized messages to offer assistance so they can get the most out of the free trial. All of the above sound great, right? But, how can you come up with relevant content? How do you know if your gated content strategy is working? How would you identify which social media platform is getting you results? How do you track free trial sign ups and send personalized content? The answer is data-driven inbound marketing. The right tools can help you gain insight on data that really matters.

Also removing the brand name on blog post titles like ""......................... | Example"" also helps resolve near to duplicate issues. You can use Canonical tags to resolve this issue.  Also check if you have posted same post twice and also CMS sometimes creates a duplicate copy of your blog posts.  7. Use Default Comment SystemThe texts written by users in the comment section is also stuffed for keywords & search engines might send traffic to your blog posts based on those keywords. So use the default comment system in your blog than using theirs party comment systems which are unable to get crawled & indexed by Google.  8. Use rel=""nofollow"" for external linksIf you are providing link to other websites from your blog posts then add rel=""nofollow""  to the links so that you won't be passing link juice for other websites. Also it makes you safe if you are linking the website with low authority. 9. Use a Good themeA theme can Make or Break your blog. So always choose a good theme which has low load time, code validated, responsive & meets the guidelines of the search engines.  10. Update FrequentlyI donno why I write it at last, but you should frequently post on your blog. Your blog is what you write & Search engines like the fresh contents like you like the fresh fruits. I read through many of the answers given including Ryan Stewart’s. They all offer good advice. Keyword ResearchInternal & external linksOptimized pagesI love the part where they talk about user oriented quality content. They say it is one of the most critical factors, and it is. It is true.

Keyword ResearchInternal & external linksOptimized pagesI love the part where they talk about user oriented quality content. They say it is one of the most critical factors, and it is. It is true. But what is it? Without a solid answer to that question you won’t be getting SEO results from your blog in 2017. STARTING WITH TEXT The way content is delivered is changing. In the past, we had targeted text as the foundation of good content. By the end of 2017, video content will represent 74% of all internet traffic. Yes, video is the way forward and I will give you my exact strategy in just a minute. Before that, it should be noted that textual content remains important. Here’s the formula I use to know when I have quality textual content. 1. 1000 to 1500 words with more being better. 2. Niche targeted articles that relate to each other. 3. Use of sub-heads, bullets, numbers and short paragraphs as appropriate. There are some things to notice missing. Keyword Research: If I do it, then I do it after the fact, not before. Google wants client driven content and I want to make the search engine giant happy. To that end I focus on content that will be valuable to the viewer without even thinking about the search engines. MOVING TO VIDEO Did you know that YouTube videos rank on Google? Sure, you did. That is why I use Screen Cast-O-Matic for creating videos that are then uploaded to YouTube. Once there, I go into the video manager and optimize the video for ranking purposes. After that, I grab the code so that I can embed the video on my blog. By following this process, I end up building a powerhouse YouTube channel as well as the blog that we are wanting to have ranked on Google. While this is happening, I’m also ranking on the search results within YouTube so I’m getting in front of my audience in two ways instead of just one. Besides, typically speaking, YouTube videos that are done right will rank on Google organic results faster than a blog post. This is especially true if you are just starting out. While I am aware that YouTube is not your blog, the traffic that can flow to your blog because of this process can be quite significant. HOT TIP: That’s why I would make sure that you are sharing the love across your social media sites. The more places that people find your content the better advantage it is for you. I would especially include Twitter and consider these two tools. 1. ManageFlitter (I love this tool) 2. Post Planner (Great for creating schedules) If there is one social media platform I would recommend you, it would not be Facebook, but Twitter. I’ve secured more clients faster at no cost from Twitter than any other social media resource available on the market today. My point here is the more social you are with your sharing the greater flow you will receive to your blog from associated traffic. As more people visit your site from these different locations you will be in prime position organically if the time on site remains high and the bounce rate is low from the traffic you receive. IMAGES INCLUDED When talking about images many people think we are referring to stock graphics. And we are. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. To stop there would be so limiting. The images you use within your content strategy are critical. Recently heard of someone getting fined $700 for using an image within his Website or social properties that he did not have copyrights for. Don’t do it. Instead, use Google to secure your images. Please follow the process linked to above or you will be in danger of breaking copyright laws. HOT TIP: Wouldn’t it be nice to have Memes and Infographics that you could use without concern? Using that Google process above is your way forward. Google has tons of these types of graphics available and free to use, even for commercial purposes. I use WordPress with my blog. Another piece of advice as it relates to images involves completing the associated details when you uploading images. It does take a bit of time, but Google wants to know that your images are “accessible”. That means that blind people can use the technology available to them to see what is taking place on your site. This is very important because it is a ranking factor. So, you want to have all the following: 1. Optimized Title 2. ALT tag optimized 3. Description completed 4. A targeted caption. HOT TIP: The caption appears below the graphic. Lots of people enter a couple of words and are done with it. This is a mistake. People will often scan your images before reading content. Having 2 or 3 sentences below your content catches their eye. If they are compelling sentences it can pull them into reading your entire article. Thus I consider the caption of images to be a critical ranking factor to be included. A WORD ABOUT COMMENTS So far, I’ve mentioned what you can do to increase Google organic ranking with your blog. This last item is what other people do. Give them an awesome presentation and they will leave nice comments for you. This is even more true if you ask for the comment. Most people wait till the end of the article for that. I don’t. At least not always. Instead, I’ll make an appeal for a comment about 1/3 the way through the article. Since no one else seems to be doing this, I believe it will catch the viewer off guard and they will respond. I will also weave a request into the end of the article as appropriate.

But, many businesses are using a blog without any clear idea of what to write about or how they can promote their brand.

Thes Continue ReadingBlogging Tips: How to Improve Your Business Blog and SEO A business blog it's a very effective and useful tool for your business. You can promote and grow your brand, attract new customers, generate engagement, build relationships, and increase sales. But, many businesses are using a blog without any clear idea of what to write about or how they can promote their brand. Here are some effective blogging tips about how to improve your business blog and how to grow your brand. 1. You Need to Know Your Target Audience You should never write a blog post without knowing who your intended readers are. These readers are your target customers. They are the people that interested in learning about your business. So you need to know: Who your readers are What they care about Their interests and issues Problems your business can help them solve Knowing this will help you choose topics to write about and create a blog that your customers will care about. 2. Use Long-Tail Keywords If you want customers to find your website when they search online, your blog posts must include related phrases or keywords that customers will type into a search engine. Before you write each post, brainstorm these phrases (known as ""long-tail keywords"") so they can be included in your blog post. 3. SEO - Optimize Your Blog Posts Optimizing your blog posts for online search (search engine optimization or SEO) means adding signals that tell search engines what your post is about. When search engines read these signals, they can direct relevant traffic to your website. The main keyword that you select should be found in the post's title, at least one heading, and once or twice in the body of the blog posts. Secondary keywords should appear in headings and the body of the post. When you include these keywords in your post, they should appear as natural as possible. Do not add keywords randomly or in sentences where they don't fit organically. This is known as ""keyword stuffing"" and signals to search engines that your site is not trustworthy. Keywords should also appear in the: URL of your post Blog post title Image names Image descriptions Meta-description of your post's content By optimizing all these places, you send multiple signals to search engines and make it easier for them to direct customers to your blog. 4. Blogging and Marketing Plan Blogging is a form of digital marketing. It should be a part of your marketing strategy to have the best results. If you are advertising a product or service on social media or email marketing, include it on your blog as well. If your business is mentioned in the media or you appear on a TV spot, put that in a blog post and include a link so that visitors can learn more about your business. If you are launching a product, write several blog posts on related topics, and publish them. So you can generate interest and help customers understand how the new product will benefit them. 5. Blogging and Qualities Customers want to know that you care about solving their problems. By planning out relevant, helpful posts, you show that you understand the needs and concerns of your customers. More",2021-03-06T23:35:37.868Z,"How can I improve my blog SEO? ",Quora

Bigger budgets, increased pay and more career choice are just some of the benefits digital marketing professionals can look forward to this year and beyond. Debating over whether to change career direction or what to study next? You might want to discover the four big digital marketing benefits first. They’re good, we promise. 1. Become an In-Demand Professional You’ve heard of the digital skills gap, right? There’s 150,000 digital jobs predicted by 2020 and not enough digital professionals to fill them. This provides those studying digital marketing with a unique competitive advantage – you’re gearing yourself up for a career where demand exceeds supply. Always a good move. During the recession recent graduates were plunged into a world of uncertainty, job scarcity and all around terribleness. Wouldn’t it be nice to gain a fresh set of skills that could future-proof your career, increase your job security and even enhance your career progression? The most important thing for you is that you need to take back control of your career and reestablish the confidence you lost during the recession. Remember this: companies still want your valuable skills – you might just need to turn them digital. According to Mondo demand for digital marketing professionals will rise by 38% this year. It’s time you took advantage. Top Tip by Vaibhav Kakkar: Before you embark on your digital marketing career find out what the most in-demand digital marketing skills for 2020 are - 1.Benefit from More Career Choice The headquarters of many of the world’s leading digital giants like Google, LinkedIn and Twitter are located in Dublin, providing a wealth of job opportunities for digital professionals to choose from. Rarely a week goes by without a new onslaught of digital jobs announced for multinationals, national brands and even SMEs. For example, this year Ryanair created 200 digital jobs, many of which were digital marketing positions. At the Web Summit Taoiseach Enda Kenny also announced 400 new digital jobsacross a range of digital marketing roles, including social media. What’s more, LinkedIn is soon set to double its workforce to 1200 staff and Microsoft plan to hire 100 more digital graduates. With such a wide array of new opportunities available digital marketers can afford to get picky about the type of company they’d like to work for. We’d encourage you to take advantage of this choice and think of what kind of business best suits your career needs. 2. Consider These Sectors: According to the 2014 Marketing Salary survey by The Marketing Institute and Alternatives the top five areas recruiting for digital marketing positions this year are Foreign Direct Investment, FMCG, Agency, Utilities financial services (and after an absence of several years). 3. Get Paid More Than Your Peers We’ve already talked about how demand for digital marketing professionals is exceeding supply. In traditional economics we all know what happens next – the value of the product increases along with the price. When you’re working in a fruitful industry with a large skills shortage you can think of yourself like a commodity – and negotiate your salary accordingly. A recent survey by Prosperity found that digital salaries are rising faster in 2014 than in the previous five years. What’s more, the pace of growth is set to fasten. For example, the average salary for a digital marketing manager in Dublin is €68,00. And it’s not just managerial level digital marketing positions experiencing a salary surge – entry level PPC positions have jumped from €25,000 last year to €28,000 this year. The 2014 Marketing Salary survey by The Marketing Institute and Alternatives confirmed the positive findings. The survey revealed quite a few exciting advancements for digital marketing professionals. Here are our favorites: 50% of respondents received a salary increase this year, two-thirds received bonuses and 61% said their businesses are hiring again. Exciting Video: Your digital skills are in demand further afield too. This inspiring video highlights the key skills American businesses are seeking and the salaries you can expect to earn: 4. You Can KickStart Your Own Career In more traditional careers like advertising you’d have to wait for a coveted internship or graduate placement to open up so you can gain experience and create your own portfolio. The digital marketing world, however, provides a host of opportunities for you to kickstart your own career before you even set foot in a workplace. Want to to stand out to potential employers? Invest in building a powerful social media presence, gain your own Twitter followers, start your own blog and contribute to relevant online conversations. There are a whole host of online exams like the Google Analytics examand HubSpot’s Inbound Certification exam you can take to boost your CV and showcase your digital marketing knowledge. There have been plenty of examples of people who have been hired after showcasing their talent and abilities through social media. For example, Dublin based fashion illustrator, Holly Shortall got noticed when she tweeted her illustrations to celebrities online. A number of of glossy magazines and top fashion brands then approached her and commissioned her work.

For example, business development managers can provide information gained from their network about early trends to which PMs might not have access. Also, in the case of a mature product business developers can identify opportunities to partner with others in the ecosystem. I hope this helps! In short, the biggest difference between the two, is the size of the company. At larger companies where countless products are being developed simultaneously, product management is great practice for what it is like to be the CEO of a small company. However, at smaller companies (such as startups) business development requires more technical knowledge and the responsibilities of product management fall on the CTO or CPO. The person in charge of business development at a startup, will be expected to redesign systems to be able to infinitely scale on demand without a high cost variance. “Business Development” is a fancy name for “sales”. Product Management is responsible for creating marketable products for sales to sell.",2021-03-06T23:37:52.510Z,"What is the difference between business development and product management? ",Quora

This is the content that’s irresistibly enticing to your audience. A great way to start (as with everything else) is a Google search. Search some of the top keywords for your niche. Only this time, instead of focusing on your top competitors, pay attention to the links downstairs in related searches. Inbound marketing As traditional online marketing using Google AdWords or Facebook Advertising becomes increasingly expensive, businesses are turning their collective minds to inbound marketing. This beautiful, sustainable technique relies heavily on premier quality content and its distribution to precisely targeted audiences in order to drive traffic as well as conversions through the roof over time. It relies on patience, smart decisions backed by data, and a keen understanding of the target audience. A good, inexpensive way to start is with your blog. Create fresh, relevant, and timely content to pique your readers’ interest and keep them coming back for more. Add keywords (smartly and sparingly) and a unique tone that’s inherently yours to help build a solid foundation for SEO and brand identity. Inform and educate While attractive, enticing content will get you visitors, it may not ensure loyalty. To truly build a loyal readership, focus on creating content that has a, as one marketing expert puts it, “extended shelf-life”. Identify your target audience, study the user personas, and build some nice, long, detailed content – guides, walkthroughs, lists of actionable insights, etc. A quaint example is Tracey Jones’ “Setup guide for Google Analytics for Small Businesses”, published earlier this year on the Themify blog – It became a one-stop-tutorial for WordPress beginners and intermediates and ensures a steady stream of returning visitors to the blog. Stop salivating over the keywords (in the title alone, no less!) You can create similarly informative content and promote it via Guest Publishing (see Point #1) and other well-known, niche-relevant communities. Tip: LinkedIn advertising can get your content noticed (and talked about – which is the goal since eWOM travels faster than the speed of light) by influencers in your niche. Start creating original content and sharing it on social media. The more engaging and authoritative it is, the more people that will visit, share, and discuss, thereby building traffic and long-term SEO. Don’t use shortcuts like buying traffic or black hat tactics. Honest growth leads to permanent growth, as your organic traffic will continue to rise as your content is read and shared",2021-03-06T23:38:28.072Z,"Which is the fastest way to drive free web traffic to a new website?

And trust me, you want to take advantage of these features, both to stand out from your own resume and from other profiles. For instance, on a resume you’re limited to your employment history and professional items from the past. On your LI profile, you can share both your professional past AND your future professional goals. Your future professional goals can be incorporated in your headline, summary section, and interests section (i.e. exemplified by the companies you follow and the groups you join). The headline and summary sections are also a good place to show a little bit of your personality and work philosophy. Another great feature of LI is you can include a digital portfolio in your profile. You do this by adding media, files, and links of samples of your work in both the summary section and in each job entry. This keeps your profile from feeling “flat” and gives viewers an idea of the type of work you’re capable of. In addition, you can showcase your writing ability (if you like to write or are looking for a role that requires a lot of writing) by posting articles on LI on a regular basis. These articles show up on your profile and can be shared via the newsfeed and within your groups. Also, under the “Career Interests” section you can add a personalized note to potential recruiters. Finally, probably the most obvious way your LI profile should differ from your resume is you should include a photo of yourself. While there are several new resume templates in platforms like Canva that have a place for you to insert your photo, it’s still frowned upon in some industries to include your photo on your resume. But it is expected of you to have one on your LI profile. You don’t necessarily have to hire a professional photographer for your picture, but it should be a photo of you looking professional. It should be one of you wearing the type of clothing typical of your job or industry, and the background should be of a work environment. It amazes me how many people still to this day will use a wedding photo of them and their spouse for their LI profile picture. Or a photo with their bestie (if you and your bestie are of the same gender, how am I supposed to know which one of you in the picture is the one I’m reading about???). Don’t ever do this! The thing that SHOULD NOT differ from your resume is your descriptions of your past jobs. Just like on your resume, you want to include the things you accomplished in your job and the results of your work. If you choose to only list your job title, company name and dates of employment, you’re leaving a huge, gaping hole in your LI profile. Especially if a recruiter decides to save your profile to a PDF, which is an option available to them directly from your profile (see screenshot below).  When your profile is saved and downloaded as a PDF, it pops up in a resume format. Not having all of your profile filled out, especially all your job descriptions/duties/accomplishments, will make the PDF look like a very sparse resume. Don’t believe me? Go to your profile and click the “More” button under your headline. When you “save to PDF” and the downloaded PDF pops up, are you happy with how it looks? If not, you need to go back and fill out your profile more thoroughly.

Use the media uploads to showcase awards you’ve won, articles you’ve written, curricula you’ve developed, and so much more.

Good luck with your job search. Great question! In today’s day, an age LinkedIn has quickly become one of the job search and marketing tools used today by recruiters and hiring managers.

In today’s day, an age LinkedIn has quickly become one of the job search and marketing tools used today by recruiters and hiring managers. When writing a resume the main focus is to be concise and showcase your accomplishments within 1–2 pages. Often things have to be left off to save space such as volunteer experience, awards, jobs from your early career, etc. however, the great thing with LinkedIn is you aren’t confined to the borders of a piece of paper. Instead, you have the freedom to go into detail and really showcase some of your additional skills and allow your personality to shine, in a professional manner of course. Here are some key ways you can differentiate between the two. The Summary/About Me Section: On LinkedIn, you are allowed up to 2,000 characters where you can go into great detail about who you are and what you bring to the table. This is also a great place to say why you are passionate about your job or the field you are in. This section should also be written in the first person to add an additional personal touch.Supplemental Information: As I said above, LinkedIn allows you to share and expand on all the things you are able to fit on your resume. Do you volunteer at the local homeless shelter on the weekends? Did you get to travel to Africa and work at school for a summer? Maybe you studied abroad during your undergrad. Whatever the case may be, feel free to add it on your LinkedIn.Professional Experience: Due to the fact that your resume is heavily targeted to the position you are applying, LinkedIn is the perfect place to further expand on some of your job responsibilities and accomplishments that may not have added value to your resume. You can also add older experiences as well and show have you have progressed throughout your career.Ultimately, your LinkedIn profile allows you to be a little more creative and personable. Remember that is it is still a job marketing tool, so remain professional but allow yourself to have a little more freedom.

Create an eye catching app icon, take good-quality screenshots to showcase how your app works, write as much clear as possible about your app so people could understand what it is and how to use it. Encourage downloads and pay attention to comments and feedbacks. 2. Market your app!

There are millions of ways to promote your app, believe me! Read more ideas about app marketing here. 3. Consider alternative distribution channels! Finding it difficult to gain visibility on Apple Store and Google Play? Offer your app on multiple alternative app stores and increase your downloads. In many cases, alternative app stores offer a more favorable revenue model and allow reaching new markets (Chinese, Korean, Indian). Check out these numbers: AppChina has 30 million users; Tencent App Gem has 80 million users; Anzhi has 25 million users; Amazon Appstore has 25 million apps downloaded every month. Exposing your app to such audiences almost equals success. Remember, that Apple Store and Google Play are not the only marketplaces! Read more about alternative app stores here. 4. Apply for Awards! Every app is unique, so why not showing this uniqueness to the world and winning an award? Winning an award means more exposure, recommendations, shares, reviews, social buzz and...downloads, of course. Check out these award sites: Appy Awards, Best App Ever Awards, AppCircus competition, Apple Design Awards, Appsters Awards, Best Mobile App Awards and others. 5. Improve your app! Pay attention to what people say about your app and what features they want to be included or improved. Work your way to create a truly useful app that brings real value to consumers. Fix bugs, test new add-ons, or plug-ins. Encourage reviews and let your audiences see how dedicated you are. When you get enough traffic to your app, you can try monetizing it. How? Well, very easy. By displaying ads. There are many services and companies nowadays that can help you create your first ads, manage ad space and generate incremental revenues with your app! SmartyAds offers SDKs (Software Development Kit) for iOS and Android apps. By integrating SDK into an app, developers get access to the pool of demand worldwide and can sell ad space immediately! Mobile inventory is very expensive and highly personalized, so advertisers are willing to pay more for it. So the action plan is the following: launch your app -> promote it -> gain stable traffic -> monetize your app! It’s much easier than you think! Good luck!

The competition is fierce and there is a lot of duplication in regards to the value propositions for each application.  In a cluttered and often saturated market, it's becoming more and more difficult to stand out in the crowd. Luckily, this challenge is faced by everyone and not just the bedroom developers looking to make their dream of riches from an application come to life. It's a challenge for everyone in the space. Those who have the best marketing understand the importance of developing a well rounded, consistent and comprehensive marketing strategy similar to what they would for an actual business. The best strategies have a combination of content marketing and paid advertising post and pre-launch of the app.  The following is what I'd consider the Battle Plan for app marketing: Pre-Launch Battle Plan:1. Develop a Strong Value Proposition Statement:Your value proposition statement is what you need to understand and identify first and foremost. You need to be able to create a clear set of messages that illustrate exactly what it is you offer and what unmet need you're fulfilling. Depending on the type of application, this can be very challenging to figure out. Below is a few example value propositions that can be attributed with some of my favourite apps: Instagram (company) - Create beautiful photos and share them with friends.8tracks - Find great music curated by music lovers.Draw Something - Have fun with friends playing pictionary 2.0.Penzu (diary) - Keep your memories and journal secure with Penzu.Shazam (music identify) - Find out the name and artist for any song playing nearby. Once you have established your value proposition for people you will want to bounce it off people and see what they think of your product. Often times, entrepreneurs get caught up in their apps being able to offer this, that and the other thing without focusing on the core problem. Thus One of greatest pieces of advice I received over the last few years was specifically related to the importance of clearly being able to describe your product. Thus, I recommend explaining it to your mom, dad, cousin and even a stranger and ask them to describe how the app works right back to you. You might be surprised at how complicating your app sounds on the first pitch. 1A. Run Google Adwords:For a couple dollars a day you can run a few different ads all with a different call to action and see which gets the most clicks. As you review the different call to actions and identify which one was the most successful compare that to your value proposition and recognize that there could be an insight there that leads to a reason to change or revise your content. 2. Incentivize Word of Mouth with a Landing Page:Now that you know what your product offers, it's time to tell the world. You need to develop a landing page that clearly communicates the problem your application will solve and why people should download it. The first thing you want to do is ensure that you have a landing page that clearly communicates what your product offers. To do this, you may need to develop a video and show exactly how the application works to clearly show the process to your potential customers. DrawSomething has a great description video that showcases exactly what the app does:  While it's very important to communicate what your product does - Capturing leads (emails) trumps even that at this stage. Driving this initial buzz and interest is a great way to not only validate your idea but also ensure that you have a potential customer list early on.  LaunchRock is an easy to use option which is built on a viral loop that can easily generate results. The process for this is simple and one that every app should consider at this stage:  Collect Info - User submits their information (Email)Incentive - You provide an incentive to share - Ex. If 20 of your friends sign up using this code we'll send you a XYZ Brand T-Shirt.Socialize - Provide the user with a promo code, ability to share via FB, Linkedin, Twitter and Email.Launch a blog, write guest posts for other blogs, comment on relevant blog posts,  write articles, write an e-book, speak at conferences and events, open a Twitter account and start sharing information that illustrates your point of view.  There’s no end of ways to get your message out there.  Do your homework and find out where your market hangs out.  What forums do they participate in?  What blogs and newsletters do they read?  Get your message in front of them in the places where they already are. 3. Connect with Relevant Influencers:Have influencers write about your app and link to your landing page. Do a search for those who are in your industry. Here is a template email for you:  Hey Jeff, it’s Ross here from ABC Appication and I just wanted to drop you a line and say how much I've enjoyed following your site. The layout is great, always relevant info, and I've downloaded your eBooks for my own reading. I've actually shared the one on marketing your iPhone App with a few of my friends and they were completely blown away. Either way, I'm an entrepreneur and have followed more blogs over the past few years than I care to admit and I have to say, you're consistently sharing great work so keep it up. Back in September you wrote a great piece on an Application that [XXXXX]. I thought the way you covered their founders and gave an honest and critical review was awesome and probably beneficial to the founders and your viewers. As I stated earlier, I am the co-founder of an new App, XYZ, that gives users a chance to [XXXX]. We've generated quite a bit of traction through our landing page alone with over 500 sign ups and I wanted to see if you would be interested in a sneak peak demo of the product. Furthermore, I would like to send you along a App Store gift card just so when we do launch you can download our app and it can be considered on the house. Heck, if you don't like the app after doing a demo we'll still send you the gift card and you can use it to download the latest track from The Killers (Check their Spotify or Grooveshark).  Let me know if you have any questions and thanks for reading this email… I know you're extremely busy. Ross  The process for building an email for an influencer is quite straight forward: 1. Don't be a Jane Doe: The influencer you're pitching is probably contacted by someone just like you every single day. Before you email her, develop a connection by retweeting their stuff or sparking an off-topic conversation.2. Do your research: Make sure your blog references their work or something that made you think this would be of interest to them. 3. Tell them why you matter: Let them know what it is about your app that is actually important. Why people (specifically her audience) should care.4. Stroke the Ego: Not every influencer has an ego but some of them do. In that case, compliment them here and compliment them there but don't go over board with the butt kissing - That gets tired and lame. 3A. Media Gets a Press Release:If you're reaching out to a journalist or someone in the media you should also consider sharing a press release. When you write this however, don't think of the document as a information document - Write a story. Make it captivating and ensure that it's compelling. There a few different spins you can put on the story - Here are a few ideas: - Local & David/Goliath Spin: Best Friends Launch an App to Destroy Instagram- There's a problem and you're Batman: XYZ App Solves XYZ Problem For a more detailed description on how to get press check this out:How To Get Media Coverage For Your Startup: A Complete Guide 4. Cross Your T's & Dot Your I'sA lot of Startups think that the fact that they were accepted into the Apple Store is their one way ticket to success and riches. Urmp-Wrong. There is a lot more to it than that. First and foremost, you need to do everything you can to ensure that when someone does find your app in the appstore - They want it. Here's a few things to ensure are perfected before launch: 4A. The Right Screenshots: The screenshots you show in the App Store need to be the money shots within your user experience. They need to clearly identify the value of your app and also demonstrate simplicity and ease of use. For most apps, you're going to have competition below and above you no matter what. Thus, you want to try and standout however possible and this is just one of the many ways to do it. See below:   4B. Make sure you have the right name: The name of your app is often something you put a lot of work and pride into but it's often overcomplicated. Ensure that your name is (1) easy to pronounce and ideally (2) the URL is available for purchase. 5. Develop a Facebook PageEveryone knows that Facebook is the most popular social network in the world. The reason I'm mentioning it is because it's one of the many places (most convenient) where one brand can share content that goes viral in the matter of minutes. Recent changes to Facebook have increased a users ability to reach the masses and your brand can do the same. Use Facebook to keep friends, family and people who are interested in your product in the loop with the App. At the end of the day, Facebook is free and easy to use. When someone likes your business page it's published in the news feeds for their friends and network to read. If you want to take it even further you can also add everyone to an Open Group (this could piss some people off) and share additional content within the group. They will get notifications every time you post an update to the wall of this group - Photos and simple text updates alike. Be sure to use Facebook to share screenshots of the app, share photos of the team working and let everyone know about the launch event you'll be holding in a few weeks! A few additional resources for Facebook content marketing can be found here:   Stop Sharing Boring Posts, Make a Viral Facebook Status3 Types of Facebook Marketing Content Mistakes to AvoidHow to Go Viral on Facebook Using Reactive Storytelling Post-Launch Battle Plan: 1. Invest in Advertising Campaigns:Awareness is going to be crucial at this stage so you will need to do everything you can to spark the attention of people from all over the world. To do this, I suggest investing into online display ads, mobile display ads and Facebook ads. The combination of these three types of ads can present you with an opportunity to drive people directly to your app or leads for info acquisition. Here are a few things you should keep in mind:  Captivating Photo: The idea that a photo can say 1000 words is very accurate. Photos are very important when you develop advertising campaigns but every photo can be perceived in a different way. I'd recommend taking the time to test multiple photos with your ads and see which ones spark the most interest or click throughs.Perfect Headline: Your headline has no choice but to be short and sweet. Take the AIDA approach with your headlines: Capture Attention, Spark Interest, Insight Decision, Drive Action. If you can do this you will find success and be able to get a user to go from simply someone aware to someone downloading your application and sharing it with their friends.Call to Action: Tell them to click or download. That simple.2. Press. Press. Press:You already know how to pitch an influencer and journalists so now it's time to get down to business. If you think it was important to spark the interest of media back when you were still building, your efforts are about to level up. The relationships you built while building the app need to be used once again to announce the launch. If you're going to one of the larger media outlets like TechCrunch or Fast Company you need to give them an exclusive. The same goes for users like Robert Scoble (journalist), try to give the A-list media/influencers a chance to access your app or news before anyone else. Here are a few pointers again:The Classy Way To Get Media Coverage For Your StartupHow To Get Media Attention For Your Startup 3. Seed Forums - Spark Conversations:Find every app and startup relevant forum you can get your hands on. You will be looking to use these forums to get insights, feedback and most importantly - Downloads of your new application. After you launch your app you should head out to a variety of different tech forums and talking about this App. Whether it's on HackerNews, MacRumours, Crackberry, Tuaw or a local forum to place emphasis on the local entrepreneur aspect. Develop these threads and spark an ongoing discussion about your product or the industry in which you are playing in. There are numerous ways to promote an iOS app to get more exposure and installs.

My initial urge was to say duh...yes, and call this a self-answered question.  But I'll add more to provide additional details to the cited article. Inbound marketing is most cost-efficient in sales conversion as the customer is coming to you with an expressed interest in the product.  Even if they've reached your site through search or display advertising campaign, the cost per conversion of that customer is likely to be lowest compared to other channels. If the customer does not convert right then and there (which is most of the time), then the question of re-marketing comes into play.

Inbound marketing is most cost-efficient in sales conversion as the customer is coming to you with an expressed interest in the product.  Even if they've reached your site through search or display advertising campaign, the cost per conversion of that customer is likely to be lowest compared to other channels. If the customer does not convert right then and there (which is most of the time), then the question of re-marketing comes into play.  How you do this will depend on what you're selling.  Let's assume that we're talking about a B2B product or service with a long sales cycle.  What many companies do is to create a lead form in which a value exchange takes place - give contact info in exchange for downloading a white paper or viewing an online video, for example. Now that you've got the contact info, it is critical that you really think through the next series of contact events.  If you email them, are you emailing them additional information to something they already have?  If you call them, the call should be about learning more about their needs vs. talking about your product pitch. The goal of inbound is to get prospects to self-identify themselves.  Outbound marketing is then used to cultivate the leads and further narrow the prospects so that you are able to hone in on the ones that are a right fit.  Each contact with the lead should be about a positive value exchange so that you are able to lead them further down the sales funnel efficiently. The 'how' is a whole separate topic on its own which gets into marketing automation technology and analytics which can hep the marketer to all these things efficiently. In the digital era we live in, it’s likely you’ll hear things like - outbound marketing is dead, or that it’s overrated and ineffective. Depending on the niche you operate in, you might not need to engage your target group via outbound methods, but I strongly disagree they are useless. In most cases, having a party mix of inbound and outbound approach is probably the smartest thing you could do. The thing is, methods of offline marketing are not outdated per se.

Sure, customer behavior has changed, no doubt about it, but this doesn’t mean you should rely only solely on the internet to engage and communicate with your audiences. The shift of power which is now completely in the hands of consumers, means outbound methods need to evolve - not to be completely disregarded. Consumers don’t like feeling like they are being pushed on, but they won’t mind being interrupted if you show them something cool. I believe the power of interruption should not be thrown away that easily, but it has to be fresh enough in order to find a way to rise above the noise. Nobody will buy anything from you if you don’t provide value, and despite what the majority may thing - outbound marketing can be precious in this context. Just take guerrilla marketing as an example: it’s creative and fun, and if executed properly, it will bring people towards your brand, not away from it. Outbound methods demand an equal (if not even bigger) amount of creativity, especially for rising brand awareness.",2021-03-06T23:40:32.788Z,"Do you integrate your inbound and outbound marketing tactics?

Saturdays would generally be working days (although Satursays and Sundays were weekly off days). I would sneak out to go catch a movie or do shopping with my cousin. Mostly clothes, sun glasses, watches, shoes. Sometimes it would be for buying household stuff (TV, washing machines, beds, mattresses), kitchen appliances (bread toaster, sandwich maker, mixer/grinder etc). I did some of my best work during this time for which I am still known among my peers. My salary was steadily increasing every year. Then 2008 Feb I got a promotion and my salary was increased to INR 10 lacs. This was one of the biggest milestones for me personally. I felt I had arrived. I booked a car (a high end Maruti Dzire - who's waiting period was 8 months). It was a long cherished dream which had come true after putting a lot of effort over the last 2.5years. I got my car in December of 2008. Just when I was basking in glory of my professional achievements, a rude shock was waiting for me. My 2nd brother (2nd of 3) passed away at my home due to natural causes 10 days after my car got delivered. It was the most petrifying moment of my life. My telephone call to my eldest brother (living in Chennai) to inform him about death was THE MOST difficult call in my life. My salary grew steadily for the next 4 years (but at a slower rate versus the past) , I booked an apartment around this time. I pledged almost all my savings on this one and it got stuck in some legal rigmarole after the 1st floor had been constructed. It was about 16 lac rupees of my money which was stuck with it. And this was a very reputed and NATIONALLY KNOWN BUILDER (MANTRI DEVELOPERS) I lost my Mother to natural causes in 2012, I was contemplating of relocating to Chennai to stay near my eldest brother. So I somehow managed to convince the builder to return my 16 lac deposit. I got the principal back (without any interest) on grounds of empathy. It took me 3 months of relentless pursuing although. It was nothing less than a miracle. I changed jobs in 2013. I negotiated a 50% hike (way off the market average of 15% to 20%). I bought a 3 BHK Apartment in the same area for almost double the price. I did my house warming in Nov 2013. Got engaged the same month too. I got married in Feb 2014 and shifted to the house. My wife worked as a corporate lawyer for an Engineering Services MNC in Delhi. She took a transfer to Bangalore and continued working for the same company. Initially a couple of months we cooked, but out work commitments got in the way and we started either eating out or ordering food or ate junk food especially when my wife would travel out for work. This effected our health. So we hired a cook who would come in the morning and cook us breakfast, lunch & dinner and leave. My wife would commute to and from work by an Auto we got fixed for her on a monthly basis. In little more than a year’s time she got an excellent opportunity to become the India Legal head of a Manufacturing MNC, which she took up. We bought our 2nd Car (a small car) since her Office was in the Factory which was away from the city. She was quite excited by the thought of being able to drive to work. But during a trial run a day before (along with me) a truck whizzed past our car and she decided she will not be able to drive in this chaos. So we had to hire a driver to ferry her to and from work. In between the two of us, I take care of the capital expenses (home loan,car loan, vehicle insurance, gifts for others & my wife etc) and the household bills (telephone, electricity, gas, newspaper, cable etc), my wife takes care of the running expenses (groceries, entertainment - movies / eating out, home upgrade - anything new needed for sprucing our home, clothes & accessories). She’s also supports her younger brother (who just went to the US to pursue his MS) and her parents as and when required. We pay our own life insurance premiums. Whatever excess cash if left out goes into a pool which is then invested appropriately by my father in law. We try to take two to three vacations in a year (during our anniversary & our birthday’s) - mostly within India to keep the travel time at the minimum. We do opt for A-Grade resorts & hotels while on vacation. We book well in advance to get a good deal on the tickets & accommodation. We eat out every once in a while (once in a week or two mostly). We have our regular places and we have our special occasion places . We go to a multiplex maybe once a month on an average. We also try to help out people around us (and working for us) as much as possible - helping our Dhobi’s daughter with a portion of the admission fees to get into a private school, helping my maid buy new books for her children etc. We give away all of our old stuff for free, like we gave away my bike (Avenger 180) to my cousin, We associated with some Charitable NGO’s and we try to help out as much as possible. Also both of us are quite pious individuals and we try to donate as much as possible to a temple we visit every Saturday during special puja’s. Personally speaking I think money has liberated us in some ways, but over all it has made us more responsible adults. We are thankful and grateful to the almighty and are humbled beyond words by the grace of the lord on us. Going anonymous because none of my friends and family knows that I earn that much.

I have lived with my friends for few days when they got irritated I shifted to other friend's place. If you ask why I didn't shift to my best friend's house, because I am very close to his family also and they would do everything for me that I didn't want. So, after 2 months it was good profit of around 50–60K and after that month the graph kept grew. So within 4–5 months we we're having a profit of 4–5 lac/ month. We both have seen limited life during our college days and I have seen it after college days as well with my 22K/month salary. So, when we have started earning that much our expenditure and lifestyle also has changed. My expenditure got really really high, I was spending huge amount every month without saving a bit. When I visited my home I shopped for 80K for my folks. Even when I was there I was spending huge on my friends and family, my best friend also went to my home with me. As my home is far away I have to travel by air whenever I go home but he never flew an airplane before, so it was also an exciting moment for him. Back in home we had a big box old fashioned 24inch TV. Once my best and I went to my aunt's house with my mom. My cousin who is 8 years older than me was showing off his newly bought 32 inch LED TV before us. I am used to such things from that cousin from childhood. But my friend didn't take this matter easily. He got up and asked me to go with him. So, I left with him leaving my mom to chat with Aunt. He directly took me to the store and bought a 42 Inch smart LED TV and we paid all cash. Even the shopkeeper was in awe, we we're just 24 then and we bought a TV like buying vegetables from market. It was unusual because our state is not a rich state people don't buy such expensive stuff like that within 5 minutes. Usually people come with family to see which TV is good, then discuss and then pay mostly through installment. I was feeling very Happy. So, got back home with the TV my mom already reached home by then. My family members were all awestruck, they didn't have any idea how much I am earning. They were all proud just to get the idea that I am earning well. But still after a year earning 4–5 lac/month, we both have no savings. We still spend according to our adopted life style. I am still not satisfied with the money I am earning now. I am now concentrating on another business related to farming, from which I can generate a profit of 1–2 crore a year in the starting phase. And if God still be with me I can make it to 7–10 crores within next 6–8 years. I am now just 25 and I have enough time to make things. But which hurts most is I am still unable to settle down with anyone. The first problem is I am Gay. For me finding a partner is very tough. But in the previous year the people I have shown interest to and vice versa all were attracted by my money spent on them. I was serious with one guy , gifted him.many things one day he dropped a bomb and said his father has arranged marriage for him and within a month he got married. So, now again I am all alone and trust is a big issue for me. Now I don't tell that I am an employee in an MNC and people seems not jumping with interest on me for relationship. A2A.

Since freelancing gives you enough time, its great to discover your hidden skills. With time I added one more skills to my freelance career of making Digital Forms (Paper-Free forms) and it includes all main doc formats like PDF, Word, Excel, & Web-form. After I gained success in online freelance market in these two niches, I changed my niche to a broader skill i.e ‘Management’ and started managing web development projects. I always liked doing different things with technologies. In my teenage, I learnt and did many things which amuses a young mind like FB hacking and all (I even managed to hack into 37 accounts of people I knew; never tried to read their personal chat though: this became boring cuz it was not a hard thing to do anymore). I believe I am a guy who likes understanding a process and making it easy in my own way and when I successfully do that, I switch to new one. I even host on Airbnb and got the Superhost title within first 8 months of hosting. I don't have a job, I choose my jobs, I choose my niches… How do I do this?I choose a process, then I start learning the process, then I start taking part in the process, Then I start getting money from the process (not enough yet), I take a break… I do things, I learn more, I fear cuz I have not earnt anything after my break cuz I didnt get back to work, all I was doing after it was learning. I get back to process, I make more… I am now learning how to make a process successful and then award the process handling and delivery to a person you find honest. And then run to next process and repeat.

Do you? I am still in way of learning on how to make bigger amounts, that's why I take breaks from work and concentrate on other things… required to bring money. I am just 23 and have got to the stage of earning this amount in 2016 only. In 2015, it was between 50 thousands –1 lacs usually. I can't say how does it feel to have a salary around 2–3 lacs, cuz I dont have a salary plan. I have my profit plans, my startup plans, and my investment plans. All coming into picture at the right time. All this so far came cuz of my honest behavior with clients, my knowledge, and experience with self confidence. I have delivered in past and will try to maintain same quality while I expand my vision into niches of my choices. I haven't spent anything on advertising so far. Avi Edit 1: By hacking I only meant to collect ids and passwords of people using Phishing way back then. It was just for learning and recreational purpose. Back then i.e about 6–7 years ago I thought phishing is hacking so I used the term hacking in my answer. And the passwords I got were only used for checking whether its the right one or not and then I saved it in a text file at once place. That was all, no other actions were made from any account. I am now not making the same amount mentioned above and am making less than half of it as I am focusing on making remote working more reliable and quality controlled for both freelancers and clients. Plus the new market conditions and growing competition is making it hard for most freelancers to earn the same amount, I could have been making same or even more if I had been regular without those breaks mentioned in the answer and if I had only been focusing on making more money. But I am giving most of my time from about an year to Rebutton (the platform that is focused on making remote work quality-centric and reliable). If you’re going to start with freelancing in 2017; you should know the real market conditions and that its not same like before. You should be very good at what you’re doing and you cannot such think of making in lacs that easily now.",2021-03-06T23:42:45.479Z,"What is it like to earn around 2-3 L per month in India? ",Quora

This is because there are a ton of different careers in this arena, each of which is quite varied in terms of required skill sets as well as aptitude and natural abilities. Whether you veer towards business and management, tech or the creative end of the spectrum, there will always be digital jobs available. Here’s a breakdown of some of the areas that are expected to be in demand and have a solid salary trajectory in the coming years. 1. Content Managers & Strategists Content management is really a central role for any agency or digital marketing team as it touches on almost all levels of marketing – and it encompasses much more than just writing and social media activity. Content managers need to understand not only how to create SEO-friendly content from the ground up, but how to organize, store, and manage it as well. They need to understand how it feeds into different subsets of the marketing plan. They also need to have a grasp on how to develop and share the huge variety of content that is out there. Content managers may be in charge of social media strategy, managing a team of writers, developing editorial calendars, creating engaging videos, reporting and strategizing using analytics, and a whole range of related activities. They need to be able to coordinate teams and work with a diverse range of clients. To this end, they not only need to be great writers, but they also need to be able to create stellar content that works across multiple channels. They also need to be good at relationship building, creative, organized and self-motivated. Earning potential: $80 000 USD and upwards annually. 2. Virtual Reality Developers and Editors This is quite a high-tech job but it’s so new and interesting and there’s plenty of room for those who are in the realm of creative – tech. If you are someone with a background that combines technology and creativity, if you are into graphics or even special effects, virtual reality might be a great field for you. People come into virtual reality from the video arts or if they are well versed in various creative software suites. You may end up with a director type role or start out as an assistant, tester or editor. As a product, VR is still quite expensive to purchase and is a highly specialized field. It is being used more and more in digital marketing campaigns and to this end, those that have a strong foundation in technical arts and digital marketing management will be highly valued. Earning potential: At the very low end of the spectrum, a VR specialist can expect to earn $65 000 USD but there are plenty of opportunities to make $80 000 - $100 000 USD and upwards annually depending on the industry. 3. SEO/SEM Specialists SEO and SEM are crucial for solid digital marketing campaign and to this end, anyone who can demonstrate a solid technical knowledge and combine it with digital marketing expertise, especially in the managerial end of the spectrum, will be the highest earners in this field. SEO and SEM are difficult to specialize in, in part because search engine algorithms are always fluctuating. Businesses must stay up-to-date in order to have a consistently high ROI and the bigger the business is, the more complex this can be. In addition, e-commerce sites and those that depend highly on internet traffic for profits will be particularly dependent on a strong SEO / SEM strategy. Basically, most businesses will want to rank high, so they will need people with deep expertise in these areas and this trend is not likely to slow down, especially as digital technology continues to permeate more and more aspects of our lives. Earning potential: The low end of the spectrum for these types of jobs is $62 000 USD annually but more experienced SEO/SEM specialists and analysts can expect to earn at least $100 000 USD annually. 4. UX Designer User Experience (UX) designers are responsible for the end-to-end development of websites and digital marketing applications. They may or may have a deep technical background or they may be better versed on the design end of the spectrum. UX designers are focused on understanding the website from a whole marketing experience, and to that end they need to understand audiences as well as have an in-depth knowledge of the product or service a given client offers. They will typically take the lead role in project management for visual design and testing, with a specific eye on the usability of a website or application from start to finish. Earning potential: The starting salary may be as low as $50 000 USD annually but experienced designers can earn over $150 000 USD per year. 5. Email Marketing Specialist Email marketing is an example of a specialized area of content development and marketing. People in charge of email marketing are typically extremely well versed in marketing as well as copywriting and editing. Email continues to be one of the strongest modes of content out there. To do this well you need to be able to write persuasively. You’ll also be in charge of campaigns, launches, and PR activities based on extensive databases of customer data and various lists. Email marketing is primarily a lead-generating activity and thus specialists would likely be working in tangent with digital marketing and/or content managers on targeted campaigns. Earning potential: E-mail marketing managers can expect to earn around $50 000 USD depending on experience. 6. Digital Marketing Managers & Directors CMOs and VPS can expect to make well over 100 K per year, as can creative directors. This takes years of experience in the field but this may not take too long if you have plenty of managerial experience under your belt. An effective digital marketing manager or creative director needs to have a solid grasp of everything to do with marketing and business. They must be extremely well versed in strategic planning and execution, as well as financial forecasting. And they must be able to delegate while taking risks and holding firm on decisions. Earning potential: Digital marketing managers and directors can expect to earn in a similar range as other marketing managers, which can exceed $100 000 USD annually. 7. Analysts & AI Specialists Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’re probably aware that AI (Artificial Intelligence) is one of the hottest up-and-coming technologies and it’s not about to go away soon. And with the rise of big data, anyone who can create systems to analyze this information in such a way that it can be applied to strategic marketing will be highly in demand. Most people who specialize in these areas will have technical degrees and a computing science background. If this is something you’re interested in, you’ll want to get a solid understanding of data optimization and machine learning, as well as have an in-depth knowledge of programming. Data analysts will always be in demand as the world becomes more and more data-dependent because of, for instance, the Internet of Things. Earnings potential: Data Analysts will likely be taking home at least $100 000 USD a year, and AI engineers will earn twice this much or more.

BEST PRACTICES A) Avoid Bulk Email: Don’t send the same email to everyone. Your prospects might be on the different stage of buying cycle. So seeing useless mail can irritate some of them. The second type of bulk mailing is, you bought a list from somewhere and just shot an email. This is more dangerous. There is a chance of getting blacklisted or mark as a spam. B) Personalize the communication: Design your mail communication in a way that user feel that you wrote the mail especially for him/her. For personalizing, you will have to do lots of segmentation and classification. You can automate all that later. There are hyper-personalisation options available in many tools eg: How is the weather in [CITY] (Here you can do mail merge of geo-tagging of user location and automation tool will insert the same) Use personalized auto responder when anyone opt-in C) Respect Persons Time and Add Value: Most precious thing in this world is time. If I spent the time to read your mail then you should deliver appropriate value which makes me better me. Simple ! D) Write compelling Subject Line: Subject line is the opener of your mail, a user first read your subject line and then decide to open your mail or send that in the trash folder. E) Humanize Your Mail: Human does business with human only. Your mail should not sound like a machine, who is talking on behalf of you to your customer/user. Give human touch in your mail. Use human emotions in your communication. F) Landing page should be sync with mailer: It is very important that your landing page should look like a further extension of your mailer. So avoid using common landing pages. Develop special landing pages with every mail campaign. G) Must have “unsubscribe link”: There is n number of reasons when your users can take a decision to stop getting mail from you and you should respect their decision and facilitate them with unsubscribe button to do so. H) HTML Vs Text: This is a big debate that which email format is best. In many cases, HTML mailer fails to cross security wall of mail inbox. But still there is no right answer, you should have A/B testing. In generally when you have some promotional messages like sale or discount, there HTML format works better. Text mailers are reverse engineering of email marketing. It works greats when you are doing very personalized mail campaigns. It works well also when your HTML emails open and CTR rate is going down. Keep agnostic view upon the format use which is working best for you or you can use a good mix of them also. I) Test Your Mail Before Pushing Send Button: You can choose focus group to test your mail first. You can do the famous 5-second test as well (Send a copy of the email to a friend or business associate. Can they quickly tell what your call-to-action is? If so, you’re golden. If not, keep working.) J) Sustain The Relationship: Sustaining a relationship with old one gives you better ROI than acquiring the new one. Sustaining the relationship is very simple, just understand, engage and solve the problems of your prospect.

You have to surround yourself with people who want to improve. You have to surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, who know more than you, and who can teach you something you don’t know. One of the best ways to do this is to join the right online community. Because the best online communities are built with people who are gracious at giving, and who often share their best ideas and knowledge without holding back. These are communities that are carefully curated, with moderators on the constant lookout for spammers and shills.

And because the variety of services provided by these organizations is not the same. Let's take a look at the various elements that will help you choose the best digital agency for your business: #Services Offered The first thing you should always consider when looking for Digital Marketing Companies to work with is the characteristics and variety of services they offer. A good agency should offer as many services as possible under one roof. This will save you the problems of finding another company for a specific service as you can easily delegate all your digital marketing needs of that company. A full serviced agency typically offers: 1. Web design and development 2. Search engine optimization and marketing 3. Mobile marketing 4. Email marketing 5. Social media marketing 6. An Online advertisement 7. Online status management #Portfolio And Testimonials A Top Digital Marketing Companies will always have a portfolio that consists of clients with visible levels of success. You can easily access this portfolio from their web site. A portfolio page that lists a good number of clientele is more reliable than one that displays only a few. Testimonials are another criterion to help in choosing a digital agency for your business. Good agencies will have feedback and testimonials from previous customers. The more testimonials, the better. #Online Presence And Reputation It's only natural for an organization that deals in digital marketing to have a visible online presence. Does it have a Facebook page and if so, how many Likes does it have on the page? What is its Twitter following like? Social media existence and activity is a good measure of a company's reputation. A quick Google search using the company's name as the search term will reveal a great deal of information and facts about the company, including reviews and feedback on review sites, if any. A search query that returns very little result may not be the best company to have your marketing work delegated to. 1.

That is a “method” of cold calling, (and the lowest ROI producing method known to sales at that)  Cold calling is contacting any suspect / prospect who currently isn’t “raising their hand” at the moment. So even if you call your best client and ask for referrals… guess what… When you call that referral, it’s still a “cold call” because the prospect wasn’t raising their hand nor asked to be contacted nor was expecting your call. It’s still an interruption.  A sales person shouldn’t base the prospects “temperature” on how much they know about the prospect but rather, how much the prospect knows and has interest in the product or service a sales person is selling. A warm call - is when for example a lead form gets filled out on a website. The prospect has some level of interest. A hot lead - is when an inbound call comes in and the prospect says “I spoke with so and so and they bought your system and I want one too!” Or, your current clients come to you and say they need more or something else.  Social calls / Social selling - is using social media tools such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook etc to brand you and or your company as as an industry expert as well as to lead capture a prospects contact data in order to utilize drip marketing campaign techniques in order to continue to brand and position oneself as the solution provider for a prospects problem. To be successful in sales, you will need to fill your sales pipeline from all channels. The difference is pretty simple actually. Cold calling is reaching a contact you’ve had no prior communication with by phone. Typically this is for the purpose of sales. A warm call is reaching a contact you’ve had some correspondence with at one point or another (email, SMS) by phone. Hopefully that clears things up! Cold calling is as the name suggests making outbound calls to potential opportunities who have potentially never heard or dealt with your organisation. This type of calling is the most difficult as the 'hit-rate' is very low. Warm calling is making outbound calls to organisations that have contacted or have a basic relationship with your organisation. The chance of moving these people into the different phases of the sales funnel are significantly higher than the cold calling approach. It is a role of marketing to try and give the demand generation area of the business as many warm opportunities Continue ReadingCold calling is as the name suggests making outbound calls to potential opportunities who have potentially never heard or dealt with your organisation.

They fix the simplest problems we have which we had grown so accustomed to that we had assumed they were fixed. The best businesses re-imagine the problem within the framework of technological advances. The biggest opportunities are to meet the problems that people had grown complacent of. They had grown so used to that they have accepted them as a way of life. Uber is the prime example; smartphone technology had been around for 3 years before it was founded, so the technology existing wasn’t the issue, people were simply incapable of imagining an alternative to the inadequate service taxi’s provided. The problem sat in plain sight for over quarter of a decade before Travis recognised the potential solution. Immediately a thriving business burst free and solved a problem everyone had and experienced but nobody appreciated. Never accept the way things have always been done as the only way they can be done. The best Idea for 2016 however is a simple facebook page. It’s community within facebook called UBER HIVE. It solves the equation “ I need X but Y” What is Uber Hive? Uber Hive is a taxi management community for Uber partners. Why do I need Uber Hive? I want to earn with UBER but the pay is low. What can Uber Hive do? Uber Hive is the platform that helps network Uber partners to predict price surges. The hive enables partners to share and monitor high attendance social events happening in their location. How does Uber Hive work? One thing Uber does to try to predict demand, and therefore surge pricing, is study its data to anticipate surges before they happen. “How do we get more cars to the demand before it happens?” Kalanick asked. One solution for Uber has been to put heat maps on drivers’ versions of the maps that visualize anticipated high-demand areas 15 minutes ahead. [Forbes] Uber Hive follows a different route to predicting demand. It follows the social route. Uber Hive works, based on the guiding principle that high attendance social events are surge triggers. The hive utilizes the awareness of community members to share surge triggers in their current location with one another within the community.

While I think that Stack Overflow remains a valuable site for getting answers to specific handyman-level coding questions - i.e. the type of questions concerned with various gritty specifics of practical programming - the community itself is a different matter. Many users are helpful and civilized, but there is indeed a certain profile that is prevalent enough to sporadically spoil the experience, and not just for new users seeking someone to do their homework. You can be an experienced professional with a high reputation, yet still encounter the same toxicity, for instance when trying to learn Continue ReadingWhile I think that Stack Overflow remains a valuable site for getting answers to specific handyman-level coding questions - i.e. the type of questions concerned with various gritty specifics of practical programming - the community itself is a different matter. Many users are helpful and civilized, but there is indeed a certain profile that is prevalent enough to sporadically spoil the experience, and not just for new users seeking someone to do their homework. You can be an experienced professional with a high reputation, yet still encounter the same toxicity, for instance when trying to learn a new programming language or asking for various clarifications that someone finds unworthy of addressing. It doesn’t matter if the question is well-formed, non-duplicate and without an obvious answer that a quick Google search can find. These “rude” users tend to have one or more of the following characteristics. Over-identification with their reputation points and/or career. They act as if having a high reputation and knowing various details of a programming craft makes them smarter and superior humans relative to others, and that their knowledge warrants a condescending, snide tone directed towards anybody who they deem to be below their level in their area of competence. In other words, they feel a desperate need to establish their authority and superiority. It doesn’t matter if you’re a PhD physicist just trying to get some basic programming done, or someone who is an expert in X asking an innocent question about Y. These are personality equivalents of Warlock from Die Hard. They lack compassion, capacity for self-reflection and a perspective on life. They tend to be expert fachidiots who usually care about little else than programming and technology. Trigger-happy downvoters who don’t like theoretical questions, or questions they don’t understand because they don’t provide a full context in terms of the intended use. You can recognize them by comments such as “Why would you need that?” and similar. In minds of these people, if you’re not asking something that is obviously practical, you should be downvoted. They will not simply skip the question, but assume that you’re dumb because they can’t envision why anyone would ever be interested in this. Similarly, if they can’t discern a full context of what you are trying to do, they will automatically assume - with full confidence - that what you’re doing is wrong! and non-sensical. There are instances where their comments are justified, but many times they are not. To avoid these users, it’s best to always state your questions in the context of sample practical problems.People who downvote a question/answer because they think it’s a duplicate, or subjective, or off-topic, even when it’s not. Sometimes, questions get marked as duplicates and downvoted, even though they are not about the same thing, or are just marginally related, or maybe the answer is the same but the question is about something entirely else. Sometimes, some questions will be marked as off topic etc., even though there are many of the exact same nature - usually older - which are not only not closed, but have a high upvote count. It’s just how the dice falls.People who feel that being nice is superfluous and verbose. To them, communicating in a polite tone is an unjustified waste of energy that just gets in the way of getting to the point. Their attitude presupposes the false dichotomy between politeness and candor, and they don’t think they should care about how anybody feels about their tone.In summary, people on Stack Overflow are needlessly rude for many of the same reasons some people in general are rude: underdeveloped personality, lack of perspective, and over-identification with their (in the grand scheme of things not particularly impactful) work in order to feel important and to derive meaning in life. I never hated Stack Overflow, but today I got very annoyed.

Moreover, the question in itself isn't opinion-based in that there must be a reason for the Java compiler to allow the statements, and that's not just any programmer's opinion. It also isn't too broad in that there won't be numerous circumstances in which the given code could possibly be useful. That's just captain obvious speaking.  I think that people sometimes judge too quickly, and people with respectable reputation should also consider the usefulness of their comment before posting it.  Important edit: I don't hate on the platform/community. It saved my ass before and there are many very capable people there who are helpful. Lots of respect to them (and Stack Overflow, obviously).",2021-03-06T23:56:10.940Z,"How did Stack Overflow manage to grow successfully in the market with thousands of other IT forums? ",Quora

As far as I know, these two have plenty of similarities, yet their definitions appear to be different. Inbound marketing is focused on delivering the relevant content at exactly the right time. Content marketing is mainly concentrated around creatin, publishing and distributing content across multiple platforms channels and social media. More to this, content strategy’s aim is primarily to ensure that this content is read by those who may find it useful and applicable. Content marketing tries hard to build a relationship with a customer, whereas inbound marketing focuses on inspiring customers to take an action after interacting with this piece of content. Overall, I believe that a balanced combination of both of these methods might lead to developing a great customer-service relationship and high amount of purchases in the end. The reason there are so many marketing terms for essentially the same thing is that people in the marketing profession know how important it is to “own” and market a term; and so try their best to do that whenever they can. Two very successful examples of this are the terms “content marketing” and “inbound marketing.” New words for the same marketing concepts are regularly being invented and competing to become the standard term. All claim to mean something different by their promoters; but considering the terms are new and language is constantly evolving, the difference is very subjective. Here Continue ReadingThe reason there are so many marketing terms for essentially the same thing is that people in the marketing profession know how important it is to “own” and market a term; and so try their best to do that whenever they can. Two very successful examples of this are the terms “content marketing” and “inbound marketing.” New words for the same marketing concepts are regularly being invented and competing to become the standard term. All claim to mean something different by their promoters; but considering the terms are new and language is constantly evolving, the difference is very subjective. Here you can see the increasing popularity of the terms “content marketing” and “inbound marketing” in recent years:  “Content marketing” is a term popularized by the marketing education and training organization Content Marketing Institute (CMI). They define it as: “a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.” “Inbound marketing” is a term popularized by marketing automation software company Hubspot. They define it as: “Inbound marketing is about creating valuable experiences that have a positive impact on people and your business. How do you do that? You attract prospects and customers to your website and blog through relevant and helpful content. Once they arrive, you engage with them using conversational tools like email and chat and by promising continued value. And finally, you delight them by continuing to act as an empathetic advisor and expert.” As you can see, both essentially refer to the same concept. Hubspot’s definition for inbound marketing emphasizes that it’s not only about creating relevant / valuable / helpful content - but it’s specifically content for a website or blog, and once the customers arrive to the website you should engage with them directly through tailored communications. Of course, that would be part of their definition because that’s what Hubspot’s software is designed to do. “Content marketing”, like “inbound marketing”, of course would generally also involve at least some web content and “inbound” techniques for converting people who see your content into customers. However, the teachings of CMI (the ones who popularized the term “content marketing”) focus on the importance of having an overarching content strategy that takes into account all content channels you plan to use meet your company’s marketing objectives, which in addition to your website could include print publications, a video channel, podcasts, branded events, and more. In the end, it really doesn’t matter which term you use. It’s clear that communication (e.g. “content”, “storytelling” etc.) has always been and always will be an important aspect of marketing. Don’t get caught up in the semantics - just start communicating with your customers!

If you want to get traffic from Google and rank well, you’ll need to have a site that Google views as high quality. It has certain signals that it uses to gauge a site’s quality. To understand the Google search engine and why some sites rank higher than others, you’ll need to have an understanding of PageRank. Staying updated on Google algorithm changes is important. Of course, there are a few principles that are timeless and good policy. For example, maintaining a quality site with accurate information is top priority, because content is king. These things won’t change. But being aware of any changes or updates to the Google guidelines and complying with what they’re looking for is required, too. These resources will help you do that. They also contain solid advice that you can use for your SEO efforts. Add these blogs to your RSS reader to stay on top of all things SEO: Google Webmaster Central Blog: The official Google SEO blog for all things related to its search. Written for webmasters.

In any case, I’ll give you my three favorite blog sites which you can check out: The Moz Blog The Moz Blog is one of my favorites because they have a blog on pretty much everything. Almost any part of SEO you could think of and a bunch you may not even know exist are on their blog. You can learn tons of information about SEO, current trends, updates, etc., from there. One of the main things that I like about this blog is that there is a steady stream of conversation on each blog. People openly discuss the details of each blog with one another. The discussions are almost always light-hearted and interesting which is great! HubSpot Blog HubSpot Blog isn’t quite as broad as The Moz Blog, but it is accurate. Anything that is approved to be placed on HubSpot Blog will up-to-date and accurate information. This blog tends to aim at beginner SEO users but does also have content for the experienced and experts. At the end of the day, there is something for everyone on this blog! There’s no comment section for this blog but you can still learn a lot from it. If you have questions, there are plenty of forums where you can chat with people as you obviously must know considering what I’m replying to. SEMRush Think of SEMRush as the blog for beginners. It tends to have topics that lean toward the newbie side of SEO. If you’re an experienced SEO user, this blog may not be for you. Still, it is an interesting blog with a decent amount of conversation going on. The comments section is not as full as The Moz Blog but there are still plenty of people asking questions or giving their views. Want to Rank-Up?

Many people claim it to be dead as there are new, emerging ways of marketing. Yet, it doesn’t mean that cold calling magically stopped working. What is more, it led to the creation of new combinations of marketing techniques that tend to be even more efficient and customer-satisfying.  Also, it is important to consider the fact that there are still some businesses that don’t use social media or other modern outlets. Thus, cold calling may be the only way of getting to such a business. It brings as to a conclusion that we can’t simply judge one technique as working or not. Everything depends on the market you target, types of your leads and other factors that you have to take into consideration.  Cold calling has changed over the years. People use different methods to make the most out of it. One of the most popular and efficient methods is to make “warm calls” instead of cold ones. How does a warm call differ from a cold one? Warm calling requires from you to do a proper research on the people you want to call to. Thanks to that you can later relate to their hobbies, interests, job, need and wants. Thus, you can create the feeling of you knowing them. Also, you somewhat justify the reason to call them as you know them, right? If you can relate to everyday things of a person over the phone then you are just one step away from closing the deal. People will be much more eager to talk to you if you show that you actually care about them and know something about them.  As I’ve mentioned before some people try to combine different marketing techniques to create new and more efficient ways to market their products and services. You can do the same with cold calling and try combining it with social media. How? You can choose one social media platform where you can find your leads, let’s say it is LinkedIn. Then you invite your leads, engage in what they do and create a feeling of knowing each other. Yet, don’t be too intrusive. No one likes that over-attached friend that comments on everything you do. Just let them know who you are, let them remember your name and show that you are interested in what they do. After such a process you can try calling them. I bet the results will amaze you as people will be happy to talk to you because it will seem like a friendly convo instead of typical, marketing call. If you want to get more insights into combining cold calling with social media I encourage you to read an article wrote by Noah Mithrush. Noah explains why such a combination works so well and why you should try using it on your own.  Also, I’ve recently published an article in which I try to answer the question of whether cold calling should be a part of modern marketing. I suggest you give it a read as it covers the topic quite well. What is more, if you are into making cold calls you’ll find there useful tips and tricks on how to execute it properly. As you can see cold calling is still alive and is a sufficient marketing technique. Remember, every technique will work better or worse depending on such variables as a market that you target or type of your leads. If you are interested in making cold calls you can use a proper software to make it much simpler and more effective. If you want to try one I suggest you go for CrazyCall. It provides all of the needed features that you may want to use and much more. I bet it will help you enhance the effectiveness of your cold calls.

I hope I have given you a good description of what Salesforce is and what you can achieve using it. I'm not sure what tier we use at the moment, but I would bet that it's close to the highest (if not the top). We are happy with it, but Salesforce is not a ""one size fits all"" solution.

We are happy with it, but Salesforce is not a ""one size fits all"" solution.  We used SugarCRM for quite a while before making the switch to Salesforce.  To be honest, Sugar was very close to Salesforce in many ways.  At the end of the day, it is up to you to find ways to drive adoption of your CRM.  You can select the best solution out there, but if no one uses it, what good is it to your business? The best part about using Salesforce was that it cost so damn much that upper management made it a priority to ensure that it was used to the fullest. When we were using Sugar, that wasn't the case.  The software was free and the only cost was my time and effort to maintain and enhance the system.  We had some sales people that used it all the time and were quite happy.  We had others that were technology averse and preferred to manage data on the back of paper napkins. If you don't have 100% adoption, how will you use your CRM for proper forecasting and reporting? The answer is that you won't. I say your first goal should be to determine how you want to use the CRM to manage your customer interactions and grow your business. Do you have a call center that will need access? Help desk? Do you have an insides sales team? Outside sales? Do you have complex lead assignment rules? What rules will govern when a lead becomes an opportunity? What statuses will drive your Opportunity forecasting? Do you have 3rd party applications that will need to use an API to access the CRM? Do you need Web-2-Lead forms? Your next step should be to devise a process that will mandate 100% adoption (Hint: a great way to ensure a CRM's use is to tie sales commission payouts to closed opportunities in your CRM :).   Finally, use the information from step one to begin the selection process. This space has filled up with competition in recent years.  Salesforce is not the only game in town and there are many other robust solutions out there. When used properly, a CRM will help your business grow in many ways. It will allow you to improve customer satisfaction, to better forecast sales, and to leverage trends to increase sales and to open your eyes to opportunities you didn't see before. Just make sure your team wants to use it as much as you do...",2021-03-07T00:00:54.035Z,"Is Salesforce meant for startups or larger companies? ",Quora

By ""initial"" I'm going to assume you are in Traction Phase 1: ""Phase I ... involves pursuing initial traction ... in ways that don’t scale – giving talks, writing guest posts, emailing people you have relationships with, attending conferences and doing whatever you can to get in front of customers"". ‐TRACTION, Chapter 3 Simply put, getting initial Traction means investing in RELATIONSHIPS. Gary Vaynerchuk is the most effective marketer in the world at this approach and we've built our Helpful Marketing strategy by adopting his best practices. I'm currently doing a free version of our email course for startups working on Traction Phase 1: http://try.sohelpful.me/traction_course.html So far it has been a lot of fun and we're going to try to keep it going.  Here is what I advise and some common land mines we see. (Just FYI this advice is geared to a B2B startup - B2C startups also get traction through relationships but you'll instead be building relationships through people who can get you promotion.) BUILD CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS BY BEING HELPFUL My advice is to relentlessly pursue opportunities to help your prospective customers 1-on-1 with anything related to the problems you're solving. This is best done face-to-face over a meeting, but 30-minute Skype calls or Hangouts also work.  To get these opportunities you'll have to go out and find them and engage them in live events (meetups, conferences) or share helpful content and guides on places they hang out like LinkedIn groups on Quora questions.  Once they show an interest in you and your work try offer to help them. Don't work for free - just spend 30 minutes with them giving suggestions to help them solve their problems. WHY THIS WORKS Here's the deal. There are too many products and new businesses all screaming for your customers' attention. They are tuning it all out.  The one way you can get above the noise is by paying attention to THEM. Helping them, earning their trust. They'll tell you their problems and how to solve them. You'll learn what marketing copy to write on your sales pages and what channels to use to sell to them. And strangely enough a few you help will buy from you - even when your product isn't working or even finished. Customers are not rational and by selling YOURSELF they will trust you above everyone else screaming for attention. LANDMINES I ask all of the entrepreneurs in the course to email me and tell me about their businesses and what they're doing to get Traction. Here are the 3 most consistent issues I see: Not having a focusMost entrepreneurs are way too broad in their definition of initial customer and the problem they are solving. Save your big vision and market pitch for investors. To get your initial customers you need to hyper-niche. Overall this is the biggest difference between entrepreneurs getting traction and those being ignored. Please, please focus! Not thinking long termTechcrunch and the startup entertainment industry have created illusions about overnight successes. It takes years.  Even if you're solving a real problem and have a unique solution (FYI: highly unlikely) it will take time for people to absorb it, change their behavior and adopt it. Trying to scale prematurelyUnfortunately I think a lot of people skimmed the first part of their book and missed the keys to their strategy: 1. Brainstorming traction channels.2. Doing it in 3 phases. So people are just grabbing on to the latest growth hacking fable they read about and jumping right into it without realizing the years of work it took to get to that point. Again, this is for STARTING - not SCALING a business. Helping people 1-on-1 will get you the first 100 customers but not the next 1,000. I'm going to assume you're the biz side of things with no developers. If you are, in fact, a developer who's actually building your product and don't have anyone to market it, a lot of this still applies: 1>Set up a landing page with KickoffLabs so that you have somewhere to drive traffic and the ability to utilize robust analytics and email without building out a bunch of stuff. Make sure the content is SEO-friendly for your specific industry and try to get organic traffic churning so you can ""validate"" in some way that people actually are searching for what you're building and are interested  Continue ReadingI'm going to assume you're the biz side of things with no developers.

Make sure the content is SEO-friendly for your specific industry and try to get organic traffic churning so you can ""validate"" in some way that people actually are searching for what you're building and are interested enough to sign up. 2>Establish the brand online by setting up the FB, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and whatever other social media presence you want and start seeding content across all of them to help solidify your brand voice/presence. 3>Figure out who your CORE market is (hint: it's not ""everybody with a smart phone"" or any variation of that phrase....pick ONE NICHE.) and go after them with blog posts  and tweets and by literally just reaching out to wherever they're already looking and get in front of them (for instance, if you're target are midwestern parents, try to get the attention of Real Simple magazine and see if you can't get a write-up or a retweet or something). 4>Once you have traffic coming in the door and people are using your product, push for word-of-mouth. If people love what you're building, they'll share it! You can help them by providing shareable tidbits of useful information or by offering referral rewards. If you have users but they're not telling their friends about your product, there's a reason. Figure out what that reason is and make the appropriate changes. 5>Make sure you remember that it's better to have 100 users that LOVE your product than 1,000 that are just ""meh.""

(This is in part what we do at Algocentric Digital Consultancy)The important thing from all this is is to figure out where you are in your SaaS company stage; Are you a startup?Rapidly Growing?Scaling into an enterprise?Next, figure out if your agency has the ability to meet your long-term vision and goals. Perhaps they’re fantastic at Paid Social but have no idea what they’re doing with SEO. It’s your job to community your needs and goals and figure out if their expertise suits your specific challenges. If they’re not experts at something, then hire them for a specific portion of your total marketing plan. Then, go ahead and find another service provider to handle the chatbot stuff, while your programmatic agency is focused on buying media and another agency is doing SEO. Agencies typically do a few things really well, while others are add-ons and are not the main area of expertise for that agency unless they have 500+ people and are truly a full-service digital marketing agency, which is rarely a case. Last, but not least, in the age of data, you absolutely MUST OWN YOUR DATA and get reporting. If your potential agency doesn’t let you own your accounts, then you should look elsewhere.

Every agency claims they are the best or has something to say about why they are the best. Even what pages are rank the best for Google search keywords like “best SaaS marketing agency” keeps changing. So the good news is that there are some objective filters you can use to figure out who truly deserve that title. The first of course, is to use awards and objective, third-party directory review sites. How many top-tier awards has an agency one recently? Have they won any awards by search engine land, Ad Age, Marcomm, DotComm, Muse, or Inc.? But even awards can be tricky because it requires a dedicated professional to spend the time to package up an application and go through various stages of review and the budget to pay for the expensive award application fee. That’s right, not awards are free and many awards only review people who apply, not people who are good but didn’t have the time to apply. So another filter would be directories. Currently, clutch and up city are the top directories that use third-party reviews to rank different agencies. Clutch has a more extensive phone based independent interview with actual clients, so in that way, you could argue it is more transparent since anyone who leaves a review has to be a current or previous clients of that agency and their reviews are much more detailed than the standard Google review since the interview goes into depth about a lot of details of an agency services. That said, there are a lot of other directories out there that get less attention but do the same thing. Google is one of them, the Manifest is another, then there is HubSpot agency directories, Facebook partner agency directories, and so forth. So definitely check out those directories and sort by category, service line, number of reviews, and average reviews. Next, you have to look for common, obvious red flags of bad agencies. To an untrained eye, it’s easy to overlook all of these. But to someone who has been in the industry for a while, they are so common. I don’t want you to make the mistake of hiring an agency with these red flags so here they are.  Now, here’s five more… 1. Agencies that lock you into long contracts Lengthy contracts (anything over 12 or even 18 months) handcuff you to whatever results an agency produces. By the time they fail to deliver, you’ve already forked over the cash, and you can’t leave when the results falter. And no matter how they paint a picture of a rosy future, your feelings of buyer’s remorse will sting. But you don’t have to be locked down if that’s not what you want. In particular, watch out for contracts that last two years or more because that’s longer than what other agencies, like us, offer. We recognize how horrible it can feel to be glued to an advertising agency, especially if they are underperforming. We’ve been known to set up tracking and improve marketing performance through an initial trial period to show our worth. 2. Agencies that fail to take the time to understand YOUR business deeply Every business or industry is different. Beware of marketing agencies that fail to take the time to understand the nuances of your unique business. Especially in B2B, there are lots of moving parts to the customer journey and psychology of your buyer that take research and empathy to understand. When an agency knows the ins and outs of an industry, it can find and persuade prospects to convert at a lower cost per lead. Therefore, look out for agencies that default to a cookie-cutter approach. A one-size-fits-all marketing plan often falls flat because it doesn’t account for the differences between businesses, such as seasonality and price point. Some clients prefer PDF marketing reports, while others like to see automated spreadsheet reports. We deliver what works best for each client. Additionally, we communicate frequently, so everyone’s aware of what we’re working on and how we’re pacing towards our goals. To illustrate the trust they end up having in our approach, here’s a testimonial from a client: 3. Agencies that don’t eat their cooking When you look for an agency, check to see if the firm is using their service offerings in their digital marketing and recruiting. For example, look to see if they use retargeting by seeing if their Facebook and Google Display ads follow you around after you visit a service page or if they have a consistent organic social media presence. What does their website look like? If it’s partying like it’s 1999, that will likely translate to using outdated tech and aging tactics. 4. Agencies that hide poor performance with minor metrics No matter how great an agency appears to be at delivering a positive ROI, life never guarantees marketing results. Frequently, marketing firms fail to meet their clients’ expectations and goals. When this happens, you want to find out about bad results as soon as possible, and calmly correct the direction and strategy. But that can’t happen when agencies deliberately hide bad results. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of digital marketing metrics to choose from, which makes it easy for an agency to find and emphasize a minor result that looks good. Pro tip: A quick way to see if poor performance is hidden is to identify which metrics the report highlights first. If the metrics put up front are minor and granular, like bounce rate or time on page, that’s a red flag The longer true candor is delayed, the less real work gets done. Look, we all have brilliant ideas that don’t perform as well as we’d hope. That’s the nature of marketing. At WebMechanix, we try our best to be equally as clear when results aren’t what we hope for as we are with wins because we value honesty. By always being transparent, an agency can establish a trusted relationship and work together to improve marketing results faster. We also know you don’t have time to read an essay, so we try to ensure the accountability of marketing reports short and understandable. That way, the most important metrics are front and center and one eliminates distracting metrics. 5. Agencies with low accountability, understanding, and direction AUD (accountability, understanding, and direction) is the framework we use at WebMechanix to build trust with clients. We strive to stay as trustworthy and reliable as possible by maximizing AUD to increase transparency and confidence. If you’re considering a team for hire, ask them how they make sure: They are held accountable for results and progress.Everyone understands new initiatives, digital marketing terms, task and budget progress, and goals.Strategic direction is prioritized and updated, especially when new ideas pop up or results fail to meet expectations.Do they put a clear plan in place? Or will they fumble when answering your questions because they aren’t familiar with priorities? I’ll throw our hat in the ring here.

Digital marketing is a vast field to explain in a sentence, however, if I give a try – Digital marketing is the type of marketing done through online or the digital technology world. Like print media or electronic media, online is another platform to market products and services. People or more connected and interacts faster online. Thus, digital marketing not just helps clients to market their products better through online but also users who can reach out to products from their system or mobile phone.  Various popular channels in digital marketing includes Search Engine Optimization, Social Media Marketing, and Content Marketing, Mobile Marketing, Search Engine Marketing and more. Some of the basic rules followed by Digital marketing Service in India are listed below: 1: – A Flexible Website This which allows you to manage your content effectively. With tools like WordPress available companies can manage the most sophisticated website with low levels of technical skills akin to those required to use Microsoft Word. This allows any business to publish content on the web with great ease and without the need for external costs and delays 2:– Regular and Fresh Content As we move more and more into a world where our prospective customers have the power to seek us out on the web, we need to leave content for them to find that will lead them to want to know more about our business. Many businesses are not used to creating content on a continuous basis and we have found the most effective way for a business to generate good quality content is to introduce sometimes simple changes to core processes in the business that result in generating new content. 3:- Building a Steady Stream of Visitors Building a steady stream of visitors to view the content wherever you have deployed it. For example, you may have shot a number of videos that are deployed on YouTube, your strategy being to encourage people who have watched these videos to click through to your website. You may have developed a series of articles which you add to your website or blog and optimized for specific keywords that you have decided to target. 4: Marketing Automation Attempt to engage with people who express an interest in what you have to sell by capturing their details and taking them through a multi-step nurturing process that educates them enough so that they understand the benefits and know how to buy from you. This is best managed in some form of Marketing automation system that can automate some of the follow-up required to improve conversion effectively. 5 – Developing a Social Face to The Company This might involve participating in one or more of the major social networks like Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn. It could also be achieved by posting videos on YouTube or writing blog posts which draw the attention of a crowd because of the value of what you write to the readers. The purpose of this fundamental is to encourage people you develop relationships through these channels into some form of marketing process that increases the chance of them doing business with you. Digital marketing is as easy as it is tricky, and one to be in that field and wants to at number 1 position, and for that they have to be thorough in it, and the best way to be is when you get yourself trained in the subject, and when you are doing that, do it in right way.

Today, that means that you need to meet them where they are already spending time: on the internet. Enter digital marketing -- in other words, any form of marketing that exists online. From your website itself to your online branding assets -- digital advertising, email marketing, online brochures, and beyond -- there’s a huge spectrum of tactics and assets that fall under the umbrella of digital marketing. And the best digital marketers have a clear picture of how each asset or tactic supports their overarching goals.I get this knowledge from http://www.lipsindia.com. It is the source where we can learn a lots of things abount digital marketing. Here’s a quick rundown of some of the most common assets and tactics: Assets · Your website · Blog posts · Ebooks and whitepapers · Infographics · Interactive tools · Social media channels (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) · Earned online coverage (PR, social media, and reviews) · Online brochures and lookbook. Tactics Search Engine Optimization (SEO) The process of optimizing your website to ‘rank’ higher in search engine results pages, therefore increasing the amount of organic (or free) traffic that your website receives.

Affiliate Marketing A type of performance-based advertising where you receive commission for promoting someone else’s products or services on your website. Native Advertising Native advertising refers to advertisements that are primarily content-led and featured on a platform alongside other, non-paid content. BuzzFeed sponsored posts are a good example, but many people also consider social media advertising to be ‘native’ -- for example, Facebook advertising and Instagram advertising. Marketing Automation Marketing automation refers to the software that exists with the goal of automating marketing actions.

For marketers who want to track a closed-loop experience, it’s critical to: Have the right marketing and sales technology in place to gather and analyze lead data.Organize lead data.Track engagements and touchpoints throughout the sales cycle.Tie activities to outcomes.And continually analyze lead sources that bring the most qualified leads to your business.So, how would you rate your organization’s performance over the last 12 months at producing leads and sales through various channels? Section 5 of Marketing Score asks just that. This post dives into each of Marketing Score’s 18 potential channels for marketing- and sales-qualified leads. Online Lead Sources As digital marketing takes precedence, marketers aim to meet consumers where they prefer to research, engage and purchase: online. How does your business rank in brining in quality leads from the following sources? Blogging: Blogging efforts optimize your website for new visitors (see #3 below), and nurturing existing leads. Think of the prospect who finds your latest blog post via a long-tail search. He or she my have never heard of your company before that post. Track blog entrance pages, engagement, RSS subscribers, and CTAs incorporated into your blog content or layout to measure the impact of this channel.Premium Content: Does your website include a library of gated, or premium, content? Resources like ebooks, podcasts, white papers, primary research and webinars, provide value to your website visitors—who are willing to exchange basic contact information for that value. Measure premium content pieces for overall downloads, as well as individual topic or campaign performance.Organic Search: Optimize your website with persona-focused content to gain an advantage in organic search. Organic traffic is prime for bringing new and highly qualified visitors to your website. An answer to organic search should be relevant, and provide value to the visitor.Below, SEO is the top lead-to-customer conversion source reported in HubSpot’s 2013 State of Inbound Marketing report, which supports the nod to better qualified leads generated from organic search.Paying attention to organic search means staying up to date on the latest search engine updates. For example, Google’s encrypted search (a.k.a. not provided) poses an extra challenge for marketers evaluating the keywords driving new leads to your website. Is 2013 the Year Marketers Lose Keyword Research?, by HubSpot’s Hartley Brody (@hartleybrody), explains the shift, and how marketers are adapting. For more on this topic, I found this article interesting too: Organic Search Leads Traffic and Conversions Yet Trails in Budgets and Mindshare, by Seth Besmertnik (@besmertnik).Email Marketing: How advanced and engaging are the email nurturing campaigns your organization runs? Are you also able to tap into strong partner or industry networks to expand your reach with additional qualified leads?A survey from CMO Council and Lithium found email to be consumers’ preferred method of brand communication, according to Social Media Today. Email can sometimes feel like an old tool in the marketing mix, but put yourself back into a customer’s shoes—it’s a go-to for prospect questions, service and support, and loyalty touchpoints. Advanced email solutions can make email marketing contextual, personalized and efficient. Segment leads accordingly, and respect leads’ inboxes for a lasting and valued communications channel.Digital Advertising: Does your organization pay for banner ads, social ads, and/or paid search or retargeting campaigns? To gauge the effectiveness of paid channels, measure impressions, click-through rates, then content engagement after that first click. Include relevant content and calls to action for all paid digital ad efforts to better quantify results.Media Coverage: Media coverage optimizes your website with powerful referring links, can improve overall brand awareness and credibility, and can make your company top-of-mind throughout the sales cycle. Track visitors coming to your site from PR efforts or brand mentions in the media, then qualify this channel as those visitors become leads and work through the funnel.Seven Metrics PR Should Track to Gain Respect, by Gini Dietrich (@ginidietrich), highlights opportunities for traditional PR efforts to measure data-driven, bottom line results.Social Media: As more consumers go to social media for customer service or to poll friends and family for advice on upcoming purchases, the channel becomes an increasingly important source for marketers to track.Evaluate the quantity and quality of your brand followers, and track engagement and overall reach of each social channel. From there, consider goals that impact leads and bottom line impact. Track social media as your referring source for downloads, forms, registrations and sales.Finding heavy social media referrals or engagement? Consider social CRM software that can tie to web analytics. Inc. overviews 6 options here: The Best Social CRM Programs.Website: Last, but probably most important—is your website a lead-generating machine? It should be. Your website houses valuable persona-focused content, contact information, product and solution information, and more. It’s also likely the hub that social, advertising, event, email and other tactics drive traffic to. Teach leads to go to your website for solutions and relevant information, and make sure your website is set up to collect valuable lead insights.Offline Lead Sources Ten years ago, it was easier to differentiate between online and offline lead sources. Today, more and more traditionally offline sources have an “online” component or the goal to drive traffic a brand’s digital space. For the sake of breaking this post down into more digestible sections, we’ve deemed the following as offline, with the understanding that many do (or should) have digital strategies or tactics incorporated.Direct Marketing: Still sending direct mail? How are you measuring leads generated? Consider driving further engagement with vanity URLs to supplement direct mail pieces with relevant, engaging content. Include calls to action that will further qualify leads and track online activity.Traditional Advertising: Are you still measuring impressions for traditional print, radio, TV or billboard advertisements? Tie this data to leads and sales with dedicated promo codes, vanity URLs, or calls to action that prompt “impressions” to turn into identifiable leads.Sponsorships: Sponsorships are pure “pay-to-play,” so it’s critical to track leads and sales generated for bottom-line return. Start by organizing all the sponsorships your organization pays for. Evaluate the goals for each, then put the processes in place for tracked measurement against those goals.Often, events and organizations you’re sponsoring are willing to help you prove value. If you’re sponsoring a show or event (also see #13), for example, work with that organization to promote tracked landing pages, or tie airtime to viewer regions, time on air, etc. Consider tags for all referring links, and promo codes with branded marketing efforts.Affiliate / Partner Programs: Some organizations are a natural fit for affiliate or partner programs. Consider manufacturers who sell through distribution channels, resellers, software service providers, consultants and more, or value added resellers (VARs) who partner to sell industry technology.Designate dedicated campaigns for partnership opportunities and marketing efforts to identify leads that come in from this channel. If you have multiple affiliate or partner programs running, be sure to measure and compare quantity and quality of leads from each program to determine the best performers (and where to allocate resources for the most impact).Events / Shows: Events are an investment for brands at all stages of the marketing funnel—from awareness with new prospects, through the loyalty and retention of existing accounts. When measuring effectiveness of events as lead generation drivers, consider cost per new lead, overall quality of each event’s leads generated, and how many of those event leads turn into longer-term sales opportunities.Events are perfect opportunities to merge the online and offline experience. Generate meetings and event excitement pre-show with an online campaign to start measuring (and qualifying) lead activity. Encourage in-person leads to connect online at show then post show to nurture the relationship.Inbound Phone Calls: Many leads (and customers) opt to pick up the phone to talk to someone when evaluating options, searching for detailed or specific information, or seeking service and support. Even though that engagement is happening “offline,” call tracking software enables marketers to gather data on what prompted a call, what happened during the call, and actions following that call to connect online and offline marketing efforts.Outbound Sales: If you’re making outbound calls, you likely have a list of prospects or cold business phone numbers to call. Evaluating this source comes with lead scoring and updates to your complete lead database. Integrate call center tracking or management with your CRM to further track outbound call efforts.Referrals: Encourage others to drive visitors and leads to your website, products or services. For example, if your company offers training or consultative services, encourage those who’ve already taken the training to share resources with others with a profit-share offer.For more information, check out The Essential Outbound Call Center Checklist, from Angela Morris of Customer Management IQ, which outlines a 10-part call center audit, including measurement.Speaking Engagements: Track success of corporate speaking engagements by new connections, followers, visitors and leads. Consider making your presentations and contact information available with an easy-to-remember vanity URL promoted during the event. Include a few downloadable assets to drive lead gen, and nurture new social connections with dedicated monitoring lists.Traditional / Offline Networking: Often times, the best leads come from in-person networking. Manually tag these leads and the offline sources in your CRM or contact database after each event to keep offline networking opportunities in the lead source mix. If driving networking connections online, consider a dedicated landing page or separate social list.",2021-03-07T00:04:02.988Z,"How do I get organic traffic and sales leads for my business? ",Quora

If you’re on the path to become a digital marketer, it is advisable to understand the nitty-gritty that goes behind the basics of digital marketing and blogging. It is the most common way of marketing undertaken by any brand, business or individual trying to create an online presence of their own. 86 per cent of content marketers use blogging as a part of their marketing strategy. If you are a newbie in the digital realm, the first step you should take towards building your way up is through blog posts. Writing blogs on your website helps drive more traffic to your website and generates better reach for your brand. The phrase ‘Content Is King’ plays an important role when talking about blogging. As a brand, it is important to keep a check on the content you upload and its relevance. There is more to blogging than just writing blogs. Content marketing deals with specialists using their expertise to cook up new and innovative ways to write blogs, show content online and boost their reach globally. An average blog today includes a minimum of 1236 words. When writing a blog, it is important to keep in mind the quality of the content. The success of your blog depends on how well it is showcased. Digital marketers today consider blog content as their top inbound marketing priority. Because, if you can attract consistent readers, your website and brand will spread across organically via word of mouth as well as reshares; faster than you can imagine. Brands that publish an average of 16 blog posts or more every month tend to receive at least 3.5% more traffic on their website compared to the brands that put up less than five blog posts. Here consistency is key. If you are consistent with your content, your customer will showcase the same behaviour with your brand. If you haven’t started with blogging yet, it’s time you step into this pool of words without looking back. I hope this helps you out!
