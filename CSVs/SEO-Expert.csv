One can only do freelancing with Back-linking but it will never be going to make you a Professional SEO Expert or Specialist. If you want to be a successful Search Engine Optimizer, you have to be concerned about a lot of things. Only Off-page Optimization is not enough to be an SEO-Guru; you must achieve expertise on On-Page, Off-Page, Key-Word Research, Content and other related topics. This post is for the ones who think themselves as an SEO expert with their little knowledge. Here, I will also discuss what you have to do to be an SEO expert and how can you get a high-level job for this. So shall we start? First you have to know properly about The Web Let me tell you something in plain simple English, “You Can Never Be an SEO Expert Unless You Have a Proper Knowledge about the Web since You Are Going to Do SEO on Websites”. So, you must have to know how to manage, customize and run websites, how does the server, domain, hosting, IP signal, CMS, etc. works because you might need to work on the Structure of Websites at any time. You have to be prepared to take any necessary steps if there is any problem in the Website and must know how you are going to apply SEO Optimization to provide solutions. It is a myth that you need to learn about Web Development to gain concepts about The Web. You can do it with just Google Searching. To have better knowledge of HTML HTML is the primary part of a Website. It gives birth the Website. A Search Engine only indexes the HTML code of a Website to index a particular site. So, you have to know HTML well to be a professional Search Engine Optimizer. You must know how to work with these specific fundamental tags such as <a>, alt, meta, title, <h1>, <strong>, <img> etc. Knowing HTML does not include all the tags. So, do not panic. You can rapidly learn to use and work these tags with Google Search. It is a must to know Keyword Research Only a single mistaken keyword is enough to demolish an SEO project. On the other hand, a single accurate keyword is sufficient for your desired success. Some people believe that choosing an ideal/correct keyword means the half of the SEO is done And to elect the accurate and lucrative keywords, you have to perceive keyword research. One thing is for sure, if you want to be an SEO expert you must perceive keyword research, how to ferret out a niche, how to detect low competition keywords, how to do competitor analysis etc. You need to know about keyword trends therewithal. Which keyword is being searched oft-times, Which country is searching for the keyword more often, How many CPCs are therein etc. because, if you do not exert the particular keyword neither you will be able to get your desired number of visitors, nor you will be able to make room in Search parameter. Thus, you have to have detailed knowledge about keywords if you intend to become an SEO specialist. You Have to gain expertise in Content Writing There is an epigram, “Content is the king of SEO”. That means SEO is just a fantasy without Content. So, if you claim yourself as an SEO expert then you better have proper knowledge of Content Writing so that you can expertly write about any topic. A professional Search Engine Optimizer means a good content writer since a better content attracts visitor and provides support to keep them in reach of your league as well. Why would anyone visit your website if it does not have informative and accurate content? Therefore, ask yourself, How you are going to write content? For whom you will be writing content, What are you going to write? How much should you write? When to write? Well, it is not that easy to be a good content writer. You have to be fluent in English. Even if you are not fluent, keep writing and trying and practicing until you reach a point where you can, at least, write correct English. Take help from Other’s writings, follow their style, check where your mistakes are and correct them. Sooner or Later, your English will gradually improve. You Must Know How to do proper On-Page optimization On-page is one of the most significant parts of Search Engine Optimization. Without On-page, SEO is like walking a blind road and whoever walks on this road shall be called Blind SEO Experts. So, if you want not to be a Blind SEO Expert you better learn the A-Z of On-Page Optimization. There are different classes of On-Page Optimization. To do On-page Optimization, you have to know- How To Use Meta Tags.How To Do Title Optimization.How To Do Description Optimization.Keyword Density And Keyword Replacement.The Usages Of Sitemap.XML, Robots.Txt, Webmaster Tools, Analytics.Website Structure And Layout.URL Optimization.Image Optimization.The Usages Of Heading Tags (H1, H2, H3).How To Do Internal Linking Etc.So, if you want to be an SEO-Guru, you should learn about On-Page Optimization in details. Otherwise, you will never get quality freelancing projects and even if you do, you would not be able complete them accurately. You have to be an expert in Off-Page Optimization as well Only On-Page optimization is not enough. To be a professional, you have to know Off-Page optimization too as it comes right after the On-page optimization. The word Off-Page Optimization refers to Promotion. Again, only Back-link Building and Off-Page Optimization will not do any help if there is no planning. An SEO expert will always do Off-Page Optimization with proper planning. Plan will raise these questions in an SEO expert’s mind- How many back-linking are needed for the website? What types of back-linking are required? Where to get the back-links? Etc. Below are the things that you need to attain to be an Off-page Optimization Expert- The Ability to Build Up Links In All Platforms.Anchor Text Optimization.Ferreting Out the Back-Link Websites In An Exact Way.Link-Wheel and Tire-Back-Linking.Page-Rank, Page/Domain Authority.Link Management.Citation (For Local SEO).Content Marketing and Promotion.Concept About Google Penguin Update..There are a lot of other factors than the above ones but to be an expert; you have to achieve at least these significant factors. Without On-Page Optimization, one cannot think about building a search-engine friendly website. On the contrary, without Off-page optimization, you can do the ranking of a website. Hence, to be an SEO specialist you have to master your skills on both of these matters. Expertise on Analysis, Tracking and Budget Planning is also necessary A Professional SEO Optimizer is the one who analyzes his work. So, you have to come up with the expertise on Analysis, Tracking, and Planning as well. An SEO Expert is a solution provider and is also concerned about things such as How many visitors are visiting the website, Which keywords are attracting the visitors, Which keyword got the ranking, Why a keyword is not getting ranked, finding out the obstacles and how to fix them. Besides, if he uses anything that is paid, he will determine the budget and Return on Investment (ROI) and operate his work and link-tracking according to that. If you are not yet an expert on these matters, then you are still not an Expert in SEO too. If you want to build up your career on Search Engine Optimization, then follow my instructions and advice. Whatever you do, do it properly. Claiming yourself as an expert in SEO with lesser knowledge is like a being a failure in the troop. It is hard to become an SEO expert in a short period but if you follow my above discussions and work as I have said then there could be a chance for you to become an expert in few months and build up your career along the way. There is a huge demand for SEO experts in he whole world. Latterly in Bangladesh, the demand of SEO experts is gradually touching the heights of the sky. A lot of organizations are asking for Search Engine Optimizers. But the sad fact is the demanders are not even expert in SEO and thus, many people are losing work. This is not just only happening in local works but is happening in freelancing as well. People are losing works in Marketplaces because they are failing to fulfill the requirements of the buyers. But how long you will survive like this? A little hard work can make you a successful Search Engine Optimizer. Stop wasting your precious time in bidding and other useless stuff and start learning. The accurate knowledge in SEO can help you to make a bright career as this sector is coming to everyone’s concern lately. Soon it will be huge and there will be a lot of SEO experts. So, are you preparing yourself to make room in the Ocean of SEO experts? To be an SEO specialist, you have to have knowledge about a lot of things regarding general and advanced SEO and experiences of your own. One can only do freelancing with Back-linking but it will never be going to make you a Professional SEO Expert or Specialist.

I've been doing it for 17 years, accepting invitations to speak at advanced search conferences on advanced topics & have a long and impressive track record of growing sites. The thing is, I rarely write articles, nor do most of the advanced SEOs I know. And when we present at conferences, we usually can't share the details of our strategies due to client contracts and competitive reasons. Plus every site has its own unique challenges.  My wife doesn't read SEO articles - heck, I barely do. But she does understand the value an SEO brings. She is actually much more critical of US scientific research (follow the funding). She also understands that SEO isn't cut and dry like traditional science. As Peter points out, SEO is an incredibly complex moving target.  I've worked with a number of scientists who tried to enter this field who failed miserably. For example, about 10 years ago one scientist I worked with shared a study he did where he measured the pixel count of the nav bars for the top 100 websites, as if that were the secret to driving mass amounts of traffic to a site.  Even Google itself has stop hiring as many scientists - they used to rely on them almost entirely, but now they admit that GPA, degrees, and even the college turned out to be meaningless. Unless Google makes their search algorithm publicly available, you won't be seeing very many sources or references in SEO articles. There are certainly studies out there & some very solid, but they are few & far between and can become outdated with the next algorithm change. The best SEOs rely on experience, experiments, and a thorough understanding of what search engines consider valuable content and what internal & external signals they will key off of long-term. And remember, only half of is SEO science - the other half is more of an art (how do you get websites to link to yours naturally?).   When I used to work in the financial industry, there were a few services that tracked the buy & sell recommendations of financial newsletters and published their track record. It would never happen, but it would be cool if we could do that for SEO experts (pull in all their client's organic search traffic growth figures).",2021-03-05T19:55:52.122Z,"What do scientists make of SEO experts?

Should I keep my answers brief, or should I take a little time and educate them about the awesomeness of SEO? Many professionals in this industry still find it challenging to explain to someone in a different field exactly what they do. Then again, when my wife, a nurse, comes home and tries to share stories and challenges from her day, I feel like she’s speaking a foreign language. So maybe it’s the same for any profession. In the SEO industry, however, communication and clarity are important. Hopefully, I can clearly answer the question: “What is an SEO Specialist?” Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps people find products and information on search engines like Google and Bing. An SEO specialist, then, researches and analyzes the trends and best practices online to develop and implement strategies that improve search results. The overall goal is to increase the level of traffic to a website by using keywords and keyword topics to improve the user experience and meet search engine guidelines. Search engines, however, are always changing. And SEO specialists have to keep up. Let’s think about what exactly we mean by this. Consider, for example, a search for the keyword: “SEO.” Adam Heitzman, Co-Founder/Managing Partner, HigherVisibility ""If you want to rank for a specific keyword, make sure you have a webpage that answers questions about it,"" says Heitzman. Sounds easy enough, but too many companies miss this simple strategy. Heitzman explains further, ""A practice I like to use is to take a step back and think about if I were searching for 'x keyword' what questions would I have? How can I incorporate this into my page so that the user has no reason to leave?"" Say it Ben Holland, VP of Digital Marketing, MWI If you're over 40 you might think of people ""typing a search"" into Google. But voice search is the next big thing, and it is changing what keywords people use, when they search, and how they get search results. On Google, the results you get from a voice search often show up in an answer box on the search engine results page (SERP). When there is a result in that box, Google will often ""speak"" the result back to you. ""With more platforms leveraging voice search, getting your site to appear in the answer box is going to be key,"" says Holland. He recommends SEOs creating headings that match questions users may ask search engines, then answers those questions directly below in a concise manner. ""Once you have the structure of your page perfected it is time to improve the page's visibility in the SERPs. The key is to make it to the first page--if you can get on the first page you can show up in the answer box, even if you don't have the #1 ranking for non-voice results."" Understand Customers Aleyda Solis, Founder, Orainti You can't market to someone you don't understand might be the best way to sum up Solis' advice. She emphasizes the importance of building customer understanding into your processes, rather than making it a one-off activity. ""You need to answer the questions 'What's your audience search behavior in your target market? What, when, how and from where do they search? How are your competitors already answering those queries?'"" she says. By answering these questions and others Solis says ""Then you'll have the required understanding to identify the best way to connect with your search audience and will be able to identify which technical, content and link aspects of your site needs to be optimized and promoted in order to maximize your visibility in search results for relevant queries."" Understand People Wil Reynolds, Founder and CEO, SEER Interactive ""Spend as much time to understand people as you do to understand Google,"" Reynolds says. ""Understand why people buy, why people trust, the impact of branding on purchasing--search engine algorithms don't buy things from your company, people do."" Choose Keywords Wisely As much as SEOs these days talk about search intent and focusing on topics rather than keywords, when someone goes to Google they still type (or speak) keywords into the search engine. ""Invest a lot of time in researching the keywords that potential customers will use,"" Beal says. ""The terms and keywords that are native to your industry may not match actual search queries."" Given that up to 15% of all Google queries are completely new, this is more than mere hype. Make it About Them, Not You Duane Forrester, VP Organic Search Operations, Bruce Clay, Inc. Successful SEO doesn't depend solely on technical considerations, but often the people involved. An impatient manager can end an SEO project before it has had time to succeed. A content team with other priorities can leave a core component of SEO without fuel to make it run. ""Make others the hero. Show them how doing the SEO work supports their own goals,"" says Forrester. ""They win, you win, the business wins. Otherwise you look like someone trying to get others to take on more work."" Forrester says it helps to keep in mind that everyone has a set of goals they're working towards, and that when you succeed in showing them how SEO helps them reach their goals, then they'll help you succeed with your SEO goals. Become the Expert John Rampton, digital marketing expert ""Whatever industry you are in you should become an expert in it,"" says Rampton. ""Then be out there in the world helping others and proving you're the expert."" Rampton advises doing this by creating valuable content like podcasts, videos, slide decks, talks, and blog posts to help others become more knowledgeable about your space. ""The more of an expert you become, and the more content you create as a result, the better it will be for your brand and the SEO results will follow. Then it will start growing by itself because you'll become the person other people ask to speak at events, be a guest on a podcast, and give comments for articles.""",2021-03-05T19:56:10.408Z,"What do SEO experts do all the time?

One fact is constant within SEO, and that is this: It is intertwined with traditional marketing and has added an inbound twist: SEO HELPS BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET BE FOUND. No matter how the methods evolve and change (as Google's algorithm and Bing, Yahoo, etc.) that will always be the number one goal and task at hand. Staying up-to-date is one key factor to being an SEO expert.  My job on a day-to-day basis often consists of setting up local search profiles, submitting sites to google for indexing, choosing when to index and when to no-index, optimizing pagespeed, optimizing usability, picking keywords to bid on in my niche, and good old fashion research and experimentation. :) Keep in mind, search engines showcase websites like products, they want you to keep coming back. So if you have a website that doesn't fit the bill, you will be deeper and further down in the search results (and most people dont go past the 1st page) Check out searchengineland.com if you want some more beginner's info and news on the subject. -Cheers!",2021-03-05T19:56:28.116Z,"What is the role of an SEO expert?

Q. Will I own my own results? Elaboration: Some SEO companies will optimize and rank a page in their control that is not on your domain. When your engagement with them ends so does your traffic. This is a shady practice - make sure that the SEO company will be optimizing your site and that the SEO efforts will remain intact after they cease to provide services to you. Q.

Q. Will I own my own results? Elaboration: Some SEO companies will optimize and rank a page in their control that is not on your domain. When your engagement with them ends so does your traffic. This is a shady practice - make sure that the SEO company will be optimizing your site and that the SEO efforts will remain intact after they cease to provide services to you. Q. Will I own my own data? Elaboration: Some SEO companies set up accounts with their credentials rather than yours. This may not seem such an issue but when you cease services and want to look at your history you will find that they own all the data and you have no access to important settings and historical data. Make sure all accounts will be owned by you and in your control. Q. What is your minimum contract length? Elaboration: Check what the minimum contract length is. Some SEO companies try and tie you in. Make sure you ask this question and then ask them why if they want to tie you in. Q. How do you build backlinks? Elaboration: Link building is one of the most difficult and important aspects of SEO. It is also possible that the SEO company has some bad practices that can actually damage your site. If they answer with things like - directory sites, Web 2.0 or automated bot - walk away. Q. Do you buy links? Elaboration: The practice of buying links is commonplace. It is also against Google's terms of service (unless it is marked as sponsored - in which case it does nothing for SEO) and can get your site banned or penalized. Be aware of the risks and practices involved and generally you should walk away if the link building process relies heavily on buying links. Q. Do your services violate Google's terms of service? Elaboration: Google it’s some specific details in its terms of service and guidelines on SEO. Some (in fact many) SEO companies operate practices that are in violation of the terms of service. This is risky and can lead to your site being penalized. An SEO company that does violate the terms of service may not openly acknowledge this but it still pays to ask the difficult questions to a potential SEO company before hiring them. Q. What experience do you have in my niche or vertical? Elaboration: Experience in a particular niche is useful. It’s not required but it does help. Some SEO companies are very niche focused whereas others more generally SEO practitioners. There is quite a bit of debate in the industry about which is better. If you have a thorough competitive assessment process this helps tailor an SEO campaign to a particular niche. SEO is not a one size fits all type of service. Q. What is your process? Elaboration: Ask this question and you should get a near immediate and detailed response. If you don’t walk away. A process is what gives SEO efficiency and also helps with organization. If an SEO company can’t give you a detailed response in their process - walk away. Q. What KPIs will be used? Elaboration: Lastly, ask what Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be used to measure performance. Marketers can get crazy with KPIs but really your main concern for KPIs should be traffic and conversions. Make sure you discuss these and ask how they will be reported on before starting an SEO engagement.",2021-03-05T19:58:23.388Z,"What are the best questions to ask when you shop for a SEO expert?

But, SEO is not simple; search engines such as Google utilize complex algorithms to evaluate websites - and those algorithms are updated and improved upon on a regular basis. Designing and delivering proper SEO takes knowledge and skill. Some of the listed parties have been writing about SEO for quite some time, while others are relative newcomers whose much younger blogs have already exhibited significant, innovative content worthy of reading; one has even pointed out important connections between cybersecurity and SEO. 1. Rand Fishkin As one of the co-founders of SEO tool provider, Moz, Fishkin has been involved with SEO since the field's infancy. Besides offering insightful points and commentary, Fishkin is also more forthcoming than many other bloggers - he does not shy away from controversy, and says things as he sees them. He publicly called out a sexist ad run by a well-known online marketer, has written pieces on topics such as How content can succeed by making enemies, and bluntly discussed personal topics such as A Long, Ugly Year of Depression That's Finally Fading and My Complicated Relationship with No Longer Being CEO. 2. Guy Sheetrit Guy, who has been working in the SEO field for over a decade, founded Over the Top (OTT) SEO consultancy about four years ago. OTT specializes in advanced SEO techniques and unique optimization methods that have earned it a top position in many SEO company ranking sites as well as an undeniable top organic presence; the firm counts among its customers firms like Coca Cola, China Mobile, and Victoria's Secret. Guy and his team share innovative tips on their company blog, and you can also find Guy's writing in any of the many publications to which he contributes including Search Engine Journal, Search Engine Watch, Huffington Post, SEMRush, Adweek and Business.com: Expert Business Advice, Tips, and Resources. I personally have a special fondness for one wise quote I have seen from Guy stressing the need for considering security when designing and implementing SEO - ""If you're in SEO and you're not into cybersecurity, I'll see you in my rear-view mirror."" 3.

After leaving Google, she founded and bootstrapped a search analytics firm, Nine by Blue, which she sold in 2013 to search marketing firm, RKG. Fox then went on to lead Keylimetoolbox, a software company specializing in developing and providing SEO tools. Keylimetoolbox has three core products. The first is a Google search console and Google analytics data. The second is SEO investigation and forecasting (which includes troubleshooting and redemption). The third is a server log analysis feature that allows site owners to reverse engineer Googlebot's crawl of sites in order to determine where the bot found issues.

We can break down programming based elements of SEO into 2 segments: Technical SEO includes tasks such as: PageSpeed: SEO experts will want to make sure that sites load blazing fast - ideally under 2 seconds for users in all locations.

We can break down programming based elements of SEO into 2 segments: Technical SEO includes tasks such as: PageSpeed: SEO experts will want to make sure that sites load blazing fast - ideally under 2 seconds for users in all locations. Put simply, fast load speeds are achieved by minimizing the number of files loaded, minimizing code on each page, compressing files.Valid HTML/CSS: Matt Cutts claims that invalid code won’t affect rankings, but it depends on what exactly is invalid. The most important aspect here is making sure the page is easy to view from the user experience, and that Google is able to make sense of the page it is crawling.Responsiveness/Mobile-Friendliness: Any SEO expert knows the importance of responsiveness in websites. On high end sites, this can involve a lot of testing across devices/screen resolutions, or by using tools such as BrowserStack.Using code that works across all browsers: Ever so slowly it’s becoming easier to write code that works across all browsers, however there is still no one-size-fits-all. Google won’t rank your page #1 to a user browsing in Internet Explorer 8 if your website doesn’t work in that browser. If you want to maximise your reach, your site needs to be compatible across all browsers and versions. Again, a tool such as BrowserStack can be handy.Website Security: To ensure a website is appropriately secured you’ll need to make sure the site and server is configured to work with an appropriate SSL certificate. Additionally, that site should not be loading “mixed content” (a mix of files from HTTP and HTTPS). This is more of a devops task that requires knowledge of both programming and server configuration.Though Content SEO is less about the code, there are still some elements that need to be considered, such as: Correct use of title tags: in the case of automatically generated pages, this needs to be done in a descriptive, compelling, unique way that is appropriate length.Proper use of meta tags: back in the day many SEOs decided it was smart to add a few million meta keywords per page. Devs with no clue are still doing this, damaging the potential of otherwise great content. Concise meta description tags are still useful, though this is changing fast.Using correct heading hierarchy: From experience, this is the simplest way to make Google happy. It’s amazing how many off the shelf WordPress (or otherwise) themes use bad hierarchy across a website. Simply tidying up heading tags through pages makes for a better user experience and an easier time for Googlebot. Take the time to learn this and you’ll be one step ahead of many self proclaimed SEO experts.Logical lists: want more space in Google SERPS? Maximise exposure in rich snippets by making numbered and bullet lists easy for Googlebot to understand. This is one of those cases where less formatting is more. KISS!Depending on the type of site you’re running, structured data/schema is also useful code that you’ll want to learn how to use. This can help for local SEO (e.g., address, contact details), eCommerce sites (e.g., product weight, product dimensions, product colors), recipe sites (e.g., ingredients, method) and so on. Please note, this is not an authoritative list of what programming knowledge can do for you. The takeaway should be that having a theoretical knowledge of SEO is great, but to make sure you get results, you’ll want to be able to verify that your code is up to scratch. Without a working technical knowledge of HTML/CSS/PHP and other technical elements (.htaccess, Apache config, etc), you will need to trust your developer to do the right job. This is possible but can take some trial and error. All the best!",2021-03-05T19:59:23.840Z,"Why should SEO experts know programming? ",Quora

Should I keep my answers brief, or should I take a little time and educate them about the awesomeness of SEO? Many professionals in this industry still find it challenging to explain to someone in a different field exactly what they do. Then again, when my wife, a nurse, comes home and tries to share stories and challenges from her day, I feel like she’s speaking a foreign language. So maybe it’s the same for any profession. In the SEO industry, however, communication and clarity are important. Hopefully, I can clearly answer the question: “What is an SEO Expart?” SEO helps people find products and information on search engines like Google and Bing. An SEO specialist, then, researches and analyzes the trends and best practices online to develop and implement strategies that improve search results. The overall goal is to increase the level of traffic to a website by using keywords and keyword topics to improve the user experience and meet search engine guidelines. Search engines, however, are always changing. And SEO specialists have to keep up. Let’s think about what exactly we mean by this. Consider, for example, a search for the keyword: “SEO.” Back in the day, the search results looked something like this:  At the time (2011ish) SEO Company - Search Engine Optimization Firm - SEO Agency - Best SEO Company | SEO.com ranked third in the search results. You’ll also notice that aside from Google’s own entry and Wikipedia’s definition, the other results are all SEO companies. These days, the results are a bit different for the same search. Now, this is what it looks like above the fold:  And this is what you get below the fold:  Do you see a theme with these results? Some kind of trend that suggests the type of results Google wants to deliver for that keyword? That’s right. Currently, there is only one agency showing up in the top ten organic results. (For what it’s worth, we currently rank #11.) Instead, you get a lot of begginer’s guide, how-tos, and definitions. Google learned that when people search for the term “SEO,” they were more likely to click on information over a list of services. So, eventually, the algorithm changed to incorporate this behavior, and now it delivers the types of results it believes the keyword is really asking for. An SEO specialist needs to be able to spot these trends, understand what they mean, and develop strategies that work within them. (In our case, we’re working on a massive guide to SEO that will be published soon. Stay tuned for that.) When I’m asked what I do for a living, I debate in my head how to answer the question. Should I say: “I’m an SEO” and wait for the inevitably confused look?

Without that knowledge, I’ll try to give as broad of an answer as possible. For starters, if you know absolutely nothing about SEO do yourself a favor and read Moz’s beginners guide to SEO. It will give you a good foundation. From there, becoming an SEO “expert” will give you a few options in where exactly you want to specialize and focus your expertise… The way I look at it, SEO can be broken down into 2 broad categories: Technical (coding, HTML, web dev, etc)Non-technical (marketing, content, strategy, etc)With a background in software engineering you will certainly have a leg up on the technical side. If you don’t already, a knowledge of HTML (most importantly), javascript, and PHP will help you out in the SEO industry. However companies and agencies are usually dependant on their development team for more in-depth coding skills. SEO experts or specialists are usually hired for their expertise in the marketing and strategy side of the field, with coding and technical knowledge being a secondary benefit. If you are looking to get hired at a company or agency, focus on learning about the wider realm of digital marketing and how all the pieces fit together (as an SEO you will need to work alongside PPC, social, email, and other teams. Collective success will be based on cooperation). I personally like the way Hubspot academy (free sign up required to access) explains inbound marketing. It also gives you a comprehensive picture as to how the sales funnel works and where SEO fits into the picture. Most of all, as an SEO expert you should understand and appreciate the power of search engines! So don’t be afraid to use them! A majority of my education in SEO has come as a result of careful googling and attentive reading. When you encounter a problem, challenge, or question in SEO, try googling it!

Put another way: An SEO expert is someone that knows how to get more traffic from a search engine. SEO strategy for your business can help draw consumer traffic to your website as well as grow sales and revenue. SEO Is a primary source of leads- Inbound strategies are the most effective and successful source of leads among Business to Business (B2B), Business to Customer (B2C) and non-profit organizations. Inbound includes search engine optimization, social media, content marketing, referrals and others. SEO promotes better cost management- SEO lowers advertising costs. When you already have a top ranking, there is no need for you to pay per click or advertise your page. You will continue to stay above the rest of the search results as long as Internet users click your search links. SEO Builds Brand Credibility- Ranking first, second or third may give your customers the idea that you are one of the top players in the industry. It shows that you are popular and many users have researched you, too. SEO Leverages Social Sharing- Are you engaged in social media like Facebook? SEO plays an important role here. Content shared by users on social networks are directly related to SEO specific parameters like title tags and meta descriptions. This is what you see when people share posts and stories on their Wall, Google+ profile, or in a tweet or share. An SEO strategist will help you manage this process, in collaboration with your marketing and communications department. Through SEO you get to control what people read, think and do on social sites and spread through their networks at the speed of light. Understanding SEO helps you understand the environment of the web- With the always-changing environment that is the World Wide Web, it can be a challenge to stay on top of the changes as they take place. But staying on top of SEO includes being in the loop for the major changes taking place for search. Knowing the environment of the Web, including tactics being used by other local, comparable businesses and competitors, will always be beneficial for those brands. Easy-To-Understand Reports- It’s essential to generate and interpret reports on the performance of your SEO activities. By doing so, you’re able to evaluate whether your efforts are helping you to achieve your business goals, determine the impact of your marketing on operations and identify new opportunities or threats from competitors. An SEO expert understands the significance of the statistics provided in the reports and will convert them into usable business intelligence that you can easily digest. Hiring an SEO Consultant Saves Money and Resources- While SEO tools and software are helpful, they are useless for someone who isn’t well-versed in SEO. Most SEO software can cost you upwards of $150 per month or $1,800 per year. That’s a lot of money to spend on tools you don’t know how to use.

If you are looking to hire an SEO consultant, here are a few questions that you should ask. 1. What types of results have you driven for businesses similar to mine? Why ask: SEO is not a one-size-fits-all solution. You want to identify a proven expert, who has delivered outstanding results for businesses similar to yours and understand what they did to accomplish this. 2. How will you develop an SEO strategy for my business? Why ask: Modern SEO strategy requires a holistic view of your digital properties that covers three major areas: technical SEO, user experience, and off-page SEO. You want to make sure the consultant can articulate how they will address all three to reach your goals. 3. How will you conduct keyword research? Why ask: You want to understand the consultant’s approach to uncovering user intent behind keywords and understanding what type of content should be developed to address it. 4. How will you build links? Why ask: You want to know whether they will be using spammy link-building techniques that can put your site into a penalty box or today’s best practices based on earning links from credible sites by providing high-quality content. 5. How will you approach mobile SEO for my website? Why ask: Google announced it is moving to a mobile-first index, making mobile optimization a central part of any SEO effort. You want to understand how the consultant will ensure good user experience for mobile visitors. 6. How do you run SEO experiments? Why ask: Google is continually changing their algorithm and testing is the best way to figure out what works and what doesn't for your site. You want to understand how the consultant will prioritize and execute experiments to improve your ranking. 7. How will you approach content, social media and PR? SEO can rarely be successful without strong content marketing, PR, and social media efforts. If you don’t have in-house capabilities in these areas, you need to understand which of these the consultant will be handling on his or her own and which may require additional resources. 8. Do you abide by Google's posted best practices? Why ask: You want to make sure the SEO consultant can corroborate their recommendations with a statement from Google that supports both the issue that needs to be improved and the approach they prescribe. This will prevent you from wasting time and money on doing wrong things. 9. What challenges did you encounter with implementing SEO changes in the past and how did you overcome them? Why ask: To overcome SEO implementation roadblocks, a consultant needs to be skilled at working with client teams and have the ability to communicate what he or she is trying to do in a way that secures internal buy-in. 10. How do you measure the success of your SEO efforts? Why ask: You want to understand how you will know you are succeeding. A good SEO consultant will define success metrics around your business goals. 11. What results should we expect and over what time frame? Why ask: You want to know when your investment will start paying off based on the consultant’s experience with other clients. 12. How will we track progress and how often will you report? Why ask: You want to know how you will keep the score (preferably, via a third party tool that you can access any time) and when the consultant will be providing reports reviewing performance against your goals and explaining changes implemented. 13. What is your minimum engagement length? Why ask: SEO consultants typically have a minimum engagement length requirement of anywhere from 3 to 12 months. It’s important you understand what type of commitment is required before you proceed any further. 14. How much do you charge for your services? Why ask: Proven SEO consultants know their worth. You want to find out their typical pricing range to make sure it fits your budget. 15. What will you need from us to get started? Why ask: You need to understand what the consultant requires from you to create a plan, kick things off, and do their job effectively, including information about your business and access to your Google data.",2021-03-05T20:09:19.333Z,"Which is the best question before hiring an SEO expert?

Essentially, your alt text is part of the HTML code that describes images you use in your ecommerce website, blogs, emails, and any other internet-based efforts. These descriptions are in place for several reasons—first and foremost to provide information when images can’t be viewed. Website visitors might be prevented from viewing images for any number of reasons. The images can be blocked by browser plugins (such as ad blockers), the images might just not render in the browser (like text-only browsers), or the images might simply fail to load from your servers (no one's perfect). Alternative text is also highly valuable for visually impaired visitors who might be using software to have your website read to them. Alt attributes help your SEO performance because the search engine robots are not able to read images. Instead, the search engine robots crawl the alt attributes of each picture on your site. The alt attribute is a key element in Ecommerce sites that sometimes is not taken into consideration, but if you do it correctly it might be an opportunity for your site to improve its rankings in the SERPs and to drive more relevant traffic into your Ecommerce site. Also, the alt attributes are a great place in your site to utilize your existing keywords and help increase your chances of showing up in image searches.

If the answer is no, don’t panic, but ask what expertise they have that relate to your business. How much of your SEO work will you do in-house? Many SEO companies outsource their workload which can negatively affect your business as it is hard  to monitor what that third-party company is actually doing to your website. You should preferably look for in-house SEO Experts. What kind of changes will be required to my website and will they be noticeable? Do not be alarmed by this, much of what the SEO Expert will do to your website requires changes. It is important that you stress the fundamental elements of your website that need to be kept untouched. Can you show me examples of your SEO work? Often you will hear that it’s hard to show evidence of success due to SEO largely revolving around technical competence, however your chosen SEO professional should still be able to provide you with examples of business’s that they have helped in the past. For example, keywords used to rank a business higher. What volume of traffic increase is it reasonable to expect and over what time frame? This is a perfectly fair question to ask and your Expert should be able to provide you with a rough estimation. Do not be surprised if you hear results to be expected within weeks or months into the future. What do you you require from me? It is important that you aware that you may need to devote some time providing your chosen SEO Expert with as much information as they need on the range of products/services that you offer. How will you choose keywords? This is a process that you should become involved in to ensure your website is being found using the integrity and the legitimacy that you think it should be. How long have you been doing SEO? Another perfectly fair question to ask, SEO is by no means a new skill and often the longer an SEO professional has been in business, the more experienced and adept they are to the constant changes in Search Engine Optimisation. Will the SEO Expert be writing your content or will they work with existing content? Every SEO Expert should be proficient in SEO Copy-writing. Generally speaking they will use a balance of existing content and new content to ensure your website keeps its integrity and has the new content needed to rank your website highly. Ask the SEO Expert to scope out how they would optimize your site? It may be probable that you don’t understand the extend to which your SEO Expert is going to optimize your website however it can not hurt to be provided with a detailed plan of what exactly is going to happen, also including estimated target dates for completion. What on-page and off-page SEO strategies will they be using? It’s important that you seek advice on off-page SEO to ensure your chosen professional is using legitimate SEO practices and techniques. There are many Black-Hat SEO Experts who will adopt poor practices to rank your website often at a cheaper price. Your website will pay the price in the long run! Finally, Why should I choose you as my SEO expert? If you ask nothing else it should be this question. Trust your instincts, after all Search Engine Optimization is a business like any other.",2021-03-05T20:10:30.910Z,"How many SEO experts are in the world? ",Quora

Before we get started, make sure you subscribe to this channel. That way, when I release more advice on marketing and SEO, you'll get notified. When it comes to SEO, it's not just about being an SEO expert. You wanna have the passion for SEO. I have a question for you. Do you really wanna learn SEO? If you do, leave a comment with yes. If you don't, leave a comment with no. If you don't truly love and wanna learn SEO, you're not gonna be an expert. It's not about doing something just because it makes money. It's about love. When you truly love something, you wanna learn it, you wanna get good at it, you'll put in the time and effort that you need to to become an expert. See, if I just give you the tips in becoming an expert, and I will in this video, and you follow it, but you don't love what you're doing, and you don't care about it,you'll never be an expert. That's the first thing you need to do is make sure you truly love SEO, you wanna do it, and you wanna get good at it. Now that you have love, the second thing you need to do is set up a website. Go to Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS - WordPress or WordPress.com: Create a Free Website or Blog, set up your own website. It could be a blog, could be a blogging platform, it doesn't matter. That's just the first thing you need to do. Without your own website, you won't know how to implement these tactics, practice, or get good at it. The third thing you need to do is write content. When you have your website, if you don't have content,you're not gonna rank. As the saying goes, content is king. Publish content on what ever you're passionate about. Heck, it could even be SEO! It could even be your journey on becoming an SEO expert. If you're not passionate about it, you're not gonna do a good job blogging. The fourth thing is you need to build links. When it comes to building links, if no one's linking to your website, you won't rank. When you write this article on, let's say astrology, you wanna go to sites like Twitter or Buzz Sumo and see who else has popular articles related to astrology. Then, when you take those articles, you can put 'em into Ahrefs. It'll show you all the people linking to 'em. You wanna hit 'em up and being like, hey, John, I noticed you linked out to this article related to astrology. I have a similar one that just came out, but mine covers A, B,and C that theirs didn't. Feel free and check it out, and if you also like it, link to it. When you do that, more people will link to you, you're gonna have to send out 100 emails just to get a few measly links, and that's okay, because all of those links will add up, and it will really help you get rankings faster over time. On top of links, you now need to then start getting social shares. Similar to that BuzzSumo strategy, you can also see, again,you go to Buzz Sumo, see all the other related articles, click on view shares, see all the people who shared your competitors' content, and ask them to share yours.

Some searches are very popular, let me take as example gifts. The thing is, if you just search for gifts, it’s probably because you have no clear idea of what you want. Try it. If you search for gifts, Google is so sure that you don’t know what you really want that he’s already making some suggestions.  So gifts is very competitive, there are a lot of searches, but ranking on it will not make you a lot of money, from that search. But when the same person will refine their search, and maybe make this other search,  It’s less popular, but it’s more likely that it’s going to convert to a buyer. But you know what, even here it’s still quite competitive. You need to move down the tail, to have a whole bunch of easy opportunities.  And many more, in fact an infinity more. Now answering all these questions is a lot of work. You better find a way to create a lot of relevant content. Quora is doing well in that sense :) we’re creating the content for them.

And I expect that we will see a lot of small companies (maybe even those one-man-band digital nomad companies) creating crazily efficient SEO workflows. “For example, you could create a workflow that automatically identifies your high performing pages from Google search console and shares them on social channels using the HTML titles descriptions – a sort of automatic evergreen content sharing engine. Similarly, you could build a process that automatically creates internal links from well-linked pages on your site to other pages which are similar (but not performing so well) in order to share the ‘link juice’ and give them a boost.” “This is all part of a longer-term trend, in which I believe over the next few years we’ll see many aspects of SEO starting to also be automated and incorporated into content management systems. There’s a gradual shift that could eventually make SEO less of a job or career and more of a skill that is covered by a combination of marketing, product management, UX, PR, content marketing, and frontend development.” Prediction #1: Google will focus on E-A-T signals and political neutrality. The 2016 US Presidential Election drew a lot of eyes toward Google, Facebook, and other internet giants in terms of what, if any, role the internet plays in politics. Through all the controversy of that election, people began to mistrust the information they were consuming and grew paranoid about how various entities were using their personal data. Specifically, policies regarding data privacy and how internet giants monitor, filter, and/or promote “fake news” came under fire, both from US Congress and the court of public opinion. While it’s a stretch to say that there was an initial political agenda behind Google’s E-A-T (Expertise-Authority-Trust) movement, the argument can be made that the concept is adjacent to the public’s distrust in online content. Essentially, Google is specifically looking for trust and authority signals and factoring that into their algorithms. Going into another election year, it’s likely that Google will continue to make moves to that end in order to protect their user experience and dissuade anyone looking to scapegoat them for the political climate. What can you do? As a brand generating online content, it will be more important than ever to find ways to prove your E-A-T. You can do this by citing sources, utilizing the experts you have at your disposal to create authorship, and most importantly, making sure the information you’re putting out there is accurate. Prediction #2: Zero-click searches will continue to negatively impact organic click-through-rate. If you were to ask a question in Google today, chances are you’ll find the answer without ever having to click on a result. That’s because Google has put tremendous effort into building out rich features on their SERP experiences. We’ve seen them take on numerous industries in the past couple of years. Today, you can book a hotel room, make a purchase, watch a video, self-diagnose the scratch in your throat, and more, all without leaving Google. What industry will they seek out next? Restaurants? Ride share? Real estate? As impressive as this is from a user-experience standpoint, it really means that traffic coming through the SERP to your website is going to naturally see a downward trend. On the positive side, it also means that users who do click through to your website are going to be more qualified leads. At that point, they’ve likely already received the preliminary information they were looking for at the top of the funnel and are now closer to making a purchase.

So, though I’m unaware of the current status of your site, I can confidently say SEO performed intentionally and with knowledge can improve your website in many ways! SEO covers much much more than what the other comment described. A website created without SEO in mind is unlikely to get any organic traffic and is thus required to pay for leads if it is a lead based business. Without SEO, a site is likely to be slow, ranked after the first page (if at all), and unlikely to grab visitors that stay on the site for more than a second or two. SEO solves these problems and many more and can be the difference between zero or thousands of monthly visitors. Any business that cannot totally rely upon word of mouth for customers needs SEO, and what SEO does is follow Googles guidelines on how they want websites to be. This in turn drives constant traffic to your site. This is done in dozens of different ways, but some would include tagging correctly, optimizing for keywords site wide and in particular pieces of content, link building (internally and externally), optimizing images for speed and quality, setting up post campaigns and user engagement with online citations, social media listings, and business listings, among many more things.

Then you should learn everything there is to know about SEO and become an SEO Expert. Having SEO expertise is not a sole privilege of SEO professionals. It’s skill that can be mastered by anyone wishing to learn how to do SEO on their own. I’ve been practicing SEO for the last 15 years and in this post, you will learn what steps you need to follow to become an SEO expert. Why everyone should be an expert in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Before getting into the steps, it’s important to understand the difference between an SEO expert and an SEO professional. An SEO expert is someone that knows how SEO works and how to apply SEO to increase the rankings of a website in Search Engines. An SEO professional is an SEO Expert that practices SEO as a profession either by doing SEO consulting, offering SEO services or taking clients on a project-by-project basis. I’m mentioning this difference to point out that you don’t have to practice SEO as a profession to become an SEO expert. There are many advantages as to why you should improve your SEO skills even if you don’t plan to offer services to clients. Advantages of becoming an expert on SEO Increase your rankings and traffic – This is the most obvious reason as to why someone should aim in becoming an expert in search engine optimization. If you know how to optimize your website for search engines then you can take advantage of the increase in rankings and search engine traffic to make money online or build a successful online business. Less dependency on SEO agencies – I know that this is not what you expect to read in the blog of an SEO agency but that’s the truth. If you have in-house SEO skills then you can grow your business without depending on external support. Decrease costs – If you are a solo entrepreneur or blogger you can save a lot of money if you can do SEO yourself than having to hire an SEO consultent . Make better decisions as who to hire to work on your SEO – If you know SEO yourself then it’s much easier to decide which consultant or company to hire to work on your SEO. You will be in position to understand what their SEO packges include and judge if what they are suggesting can actually help your website achieve better rankings. Highly recommended for Marketing managers – if you work as a marketing manager then having a good understanding of SEO will give you an extra advantage over other marketing managers or colleagues in your organization. No business can survive online without SEO – SEO is no longer optional. Websites that are not build with SEO in mind, there is no way they can survive in the highly competitive online World. Knowing SEO and how to use it correctly, can make a huge difference in your website’s future. 10 Steps to become an SEO Expert Now that you are convinced that improving your SEO skills is not only for SEO professionals, let’s see what’s the fastest way to become an SEO Expert yourself. Step 1: Understand how search engines work Before even starting to think about SEO, the first step you need to take is to familiarize yourself with how search engines work. For many people this may be something that they already know (or think they know), but it’s always good to start with the basic concepts and then work your way up to the most complicated theories. The resources below will help you understand how Google search engine works, which is similar to how other search engine work too. Step 2: Get to know The Basic Search Engine Marketing Concepts  Before getting your hands dirty, you should have a general idea about all the different disciplines that make up search engine marketing and digital marketing and not just SEO. You should have clear in your mind what to expect from SEO and what other tools you can use in conjunction with SEO to make your Internet presence stronger. Step 3: Understand the true meaning of SEO SEO is not just about keywords and links, it’s much more than that. The true mission of SEO is to provide users with a great experience and give them exactly what they want. Your goal is not just about getting more search engine traffic but it’s about turning that traffic into recurring visitors and customers. SEO has a number of subcomponents, the most important are:  SEO Overview Technical SEO – Crawling and indexingOn page SEO – Page optimizationOff page SEO – Website promotionContent SEO – Optimizing contentStep 4: Choose the right SEO Training Once you start learning SEO, you will realize one thing: There is too much information about SEO on the Internet and so many things to learn and this at the end creates a mess. If you decide to do this on your own without any help, you will end up with an endless list of articles to read and things to try out. It took me years to learn SEO this way because back in 2000 when I started, there were no SEO training courses or guides you could read and have all the information in one place. Nowadays things are different. People wanting to learn SEO fast can do so by following a reputable course without having to spend endless hours searching the Internet and reading article after article. Resources you can use: **The Complete SEO Course** – Our own SEO course has everything you need to know about SEO. It covers both basic and advanced SEO concepts. You can take the course online or download the material as PDF and learn at your own pace. It is the only SEO Course you’ll ever need to read. **Google Digital Garage** – Google has created a new set of courses covering everything you need to know about Digital marketing. They don’t go into the fine details of SEO but they are a great resource if you want to familiarize yourself with online marketing. Moz SEOcourses – Moz is company famous for their tools but they also created an SEO course which covers the basics of SEO. It’s not complete but it’s a good start for beginners. SEO guide – This is another guide from Google. It covers SEO from Google’s perspective. This means that you will not learn what actually works for SEO but what Google wants you to learn about SEO. Nevertheless, take a couple of hours and go through the guidelines, there are some good pieces of advice worth thinking about. Step 5: Stay informed about SEO changes SEO is not a static discipline. SEO rules and algorithms change all the time. Google alone is making more than 250 changes to their ranking algorithms per year. Good SEO experts need to know about these changes and adjust their SEO campaigns accordingly. The best way to stay informed is to follow a couple of SEO news websites that are proven to provide information about on-going SEO changes when they happen and not after it’s too late to do something about it. Resources you can use: **Search Engine Roundtable** – A must follow website by all SEO experts. Daily news about everything that is happening in the SEO industry. For me this is the most valuable and useful SEO news website in our industry. **Search Engine Land** ) – One of the oldest websites in the SEO industry. Previously owned by Danny Sullivan, now he works for Google. **Google Blog** – Google recently established a blog for sharing news related to Google products. They occasionally share news about Google search as well. **Google search blog** – a blog by Google dedicated on Search. **Google Webmasters Blog** – the official Google webmasters blog. Follow to get news about the latest changes in search. **Reliablesoft SEO Blog** – Our own SEO blog. It is updated on a weekly basis with guides, step-by-step articles and resources to help you practice SEO efficiently. Step 6: Choose the Right SEO Tools The truth is you cannot do SEO alone. There is so much information to process and decisions to make and if you try to do everything manually, you will spend your precious time into analyzing numbers instead of working on tasks that can get you better results. It’s also true that good SEO tools cost but in the long term the return is much more than the monthly fee you will pay for a good SEO tool. Tools you can use: **Google Webmaster Tools (Free)** ****–**** **Google webmaster tools is perhaps one of the most useful tools for SEO. It is free and it can give you a lot of information about your website. Read my previous guide on how to use **Webmasters tools to improve your SEO** **Google Analytics (Free)** – Another free tool by Google. You can use Google analytics to learn a lot of things about your traffic and how users navigate your website. There are a lot of reports to explore and many metrics to analyze. This article, **Google analytics for beginners** , is a great place to start. **SEMRUSH (Paid)** – This is my favorite SEM tool. It’s not free but you can use it for your SEO, PPC campaigns, competitor analysis, keyword research, link building, social media monitoring and many more. It is updated frequently with new features and it’s one of the best investments you can make for your SEO. **Ahrefs (Paid)** – An alternative to SEMRUSH. It comes with a monthly subscription but it’s also one of the most respected SEO tools in the industry. Comes with a 7-day free trial so you can test it out before buying. Step 7: Practice SEO – Don’t stay theoretical SEO is not theoretical but it’s mostly practical. The outcome from studying the SEO theory should be a list of actions you can apply to your website and improve your exposure in search engines. The problem is that each website is unique and what works for one website may not be the best solution for others. That’s why it is necessary to actually practice SEO and not just stay theoretical. Reading case studies on how others have managed to succeed with SEO campaigns it’s a great way to get new ideas you can use and the inspiration you need to keep trying until you get SEO right. Step 8: Demonstrate your SEO Expertise They say that one of the best ways to learn something is to try to explain it to other people. This is true with SEO as well. I have learnt a lot of things and improved my SEO skills considerably when I started writing about SEO. My recommendation is to start an SEO blog or a personal blog and share your SEO experiences with other people. Over time you will find that sharing knowledge is a great way to learn new things about SEO and at the same time you help other people, which is a highly rewarding experience. Step 9: Be Patient There is no way to talk about SEO and not mention the word “patience” SEO takes time to work and you shouldn’t rush into conclusions too soon.  Age of pages ranking in Google Top 10 Results SEO is not the quickest way to increase your traffic. If you want immediate results then try PPC campaigns. SEO is about creating a long term sustainable business by building a solid foundation that will get you organic traffic 24/7 for years. Before making any SEO related change to your website you should take note of your rankings and traffic (for a period of time), before the change and compare it with the same period of time (in terms of duration), after the change. Monitor your rankings and traffic and give it enough time before taking further decisions. Step 10: Follow the leads of established SEO Experts Last but not least, in your path to become an SEO expert, you will face a number of difficulties. There will be times when you will be disappointed, frustrated and ready to give up. Don’t worry, this is normal to happen. If you read the stories of other people you will understand that none of them became what they are today because they are lucky. It’s the result of hard work and endless hours of testing and reading about SEO. The list below includes 5 SEO experts you definitely need to follow for inspiration and for understanding how SEO can be applied in scale. All 5 have managed to build multi-million businesses and they managed to do it because they know how to use SEO correctly Read their stories and spend some time analyzing their SEO practices. You may find that sometimes they do things differently than ‘traditional’ SEOs and this is because they have the confidence and expertise to try new things and experiment with SEO without being afraid to fail. neil patel – One of the most respected SEO Experts in the industry. Don’t just read his blog but try to analyze his practices and how he managed to use content SEO in scale. brain dean – He is the expert in link building. His blog is a great resource for case studies and techniques you can use to get fast results. eric enge – Speaker, Founder and CEO of Stone Temple. An SEO with years of experience in the industry. **Joost de Valk** – Founder and CEO of Yoast, the most popular SEO plugin. **Rand Fishkin** – Co-Founder of MOZ, great presenter and entrepreneur. Conclusion Everyone that has anything to do with a website or online business should become an SEO expert. The list includes marketing managers, developers, webmasters, web designers, social media managers, PPC experts, solo entrepreneurs and ecommerce owners. Why? Because SEO is at the base of all digital marketing campaigns. SEO principles will not only guarantee the maximum possible exposure in search engines but they can help a website in more ways. Becoming an SEO Expert is not easy but it’s not difficult either. The process includes a lot of reading, practicing and testing. If you are starting out now, the best way is to take a good SEO course so that you have all information in one place, use the right SEO tools and above all start practicing SEO. Learn from your mistakes and try again.

Yes, but we’re in a very transitional state at the moment. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is really a collection of marketing and site development best practices that any self-respective website owner should be doing anyway, even if search engines didn’t exist (with rare exception), but don’t, which is how “SEO Experts” were born. SEO can be broken down into three groups of activities: Content, Site Architecture, and Inbound Links. Basically, The whole reason a website exists is to hold content that is targeted at your audience on a properly built website that naturally attracts links from other relevant websites. Google and the other search engines know this, so they reward sites that do this well with a higher position in their index of web pages across the internet. This is, obviously, a different perspective than most SEOs present their job responsibilities, which is why so many of these activities have been repackaged and resold as something that mere mortals cannot understand. There are, of course, some search engine specific coding that can and should be done on the site architecture side of things, but again, if you’re a website developer in the age of search engines, then you should be doing these things anyway because it’s part of the modern definition of your job. When you hear of people dealing with “technical SEO issues,” most of these are just technical issues on websites that are causing SEO issues as well, but in reality should be handled anyway because they would cause poor user experiences. Same goes for creating any form of content, from writing copy to making videos - you’re doing these activities in an age where search engines exist, so you should be writing your copy based on research for your target audience, who would use a search engine to find you. Inbound Links are basically the same as “getting coverage” in the public relations world and modern PR people should have adjusted how they do business years ago to accommodate for the fact that they work in a world where search engines exist. But again, these things don’t always happen, which is why companies usually call SEO experts. Most enterprise sized businesses (i.e. large companies) have the resources to do these things on their own, but because most people have been sold the idea that SEO is outside of their job description, the best practices I described are often not done. This is where agencies like mine step in… we’re a full-service digital media agency, but we also provide educational services for medium to large companies that are pulling certain activities, including SEO, “in house.” We usually provide “audit and roadmap” services for companies, then show them how we did it and how they can incorporate these best practices into their current roles and responsibilities. This is the reason for my “Yes, but…” answer, because some companies haven’t realized this yet and still hire legions of “SEO experts” to do the heavy lifting in their organization. It’s a weird time to be an SEO. You’re either like me, and helping with the transition, or fighting against the tide of change. Are SEO experts still needed for businesses? Yes, but we’re in a very transitional state at the moment.

I am from and live in Italy, and I have recently decided to work as Amazon SEO consultant. E-Commerce here is like the “organic food” business: everybody likes, but just some percentages buys through it. Fortunately things are changing fast, and Amazon is inhaugurating 2 other big warehouses, making tv advertising, and so on. They know there is an huge gap to bridge between UK , Germany and France, (the first two countries Amazon’s turnover is well over 11.0 and 6.0 billion euros) and Italy, where no figures are available but I guess it is still much lower than 1.0 billion, probably around 0.5 billion (2016). But, I still have to “explain” potential customers” i.e. present sellers on Amazon that applying a little bit of clever Amazon SEO to their poorly graded listing may make a big difference. No need to say that, in the USA and Canada, where most Amazon sellers have already well understood the utmost improtance of a proper on-page and off-page optimization, then there are several excellent agencies, working 24/7 and optimizing hundreds and hunfreds of listing for customers that invest in it but they get much higher returns in terms of sales. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have some professional, well trained and quite affordable Amazon SEO expert and, infact, many western companies are appointing them to make things running better on Amazon. Of course, a seller needs to be somehow “picky” when decides to choose one of them: the distance is not a problem but there is more need to double-chekc their actual skills. IMHO, such the present situation being, then Amazon SEO expert have a great potential in next future, but only if/where sellers fully understand the importance of doing things right.

As algorithms become better, what constitutes ‘good SEO’ will be closer to what constitutes ‘good marketing’ in general. Things are already going this way, but we will see even more of a user focus, and less of a technical one. Search engines will do better at crawling sites, without having to rely on a good structure, mark-up, sitemaps, or even textual content as they become able to identify images and videos and match them with user intent. Search engines will be able to deal with duplicate content easily, identify spam quickly and accurately, perhaps even serve content on other websites more quickly - perhaps creating their own ‘AMP cache’. Technical SEO will become something that is very niche in some senses - the only real technical SEO issues will be rare, hard to diagnose and require an in-depth understanding to fix. The ‘basics’ that many consider to be technical SEO today will be taken care of by search engines - they will require a lot less help to crawl and index a site. The technical element to SEO will more be in the data analysis aspect - technical skills will still be important. Over time, search engines will be able to learn better what users are looking for - even more so based on context. Beyond using mostly keywords for intent, with an increasing use of voice search there will be more of a reliance on tone of voice, location, activity, who you’re with at the time, etc. Asking a question while writing a college paper alone might give you different results (i.e. long-form) than if you asked that question while in a bar with friends (i.e. short answer), for example. Links, I suspect will still be a big part of things, but detecting a genuine link that was earned by a brand compared to one that wasn’t will be something that search engines get better at. Spammy links may be dealt with by simply ignoring them (as I believe, many are now). It will become an SEO’s job to find at ways to delight, inform and entertain users. Get them on your website and keep them there - get users behaving in a way that shows search engines that they love your website. Create a brand they trust and keep coming back to. This won’t be possible if you’re still a keyword-focused SEO trying to figure out how to game search engines. SEO experts will need to be audience-focused and creative. Voice search will obviously be a thing, but perhaps not as much as many think. It’s still often easier, more discrete and quicker to enter text than speak what you want in many scenarios. Voice is good for quick searches, but less so if I want to price compare a very specific model number of a product. To be an SEO expert, as the question asks, the knowledge required is still likely to be very broad - a complete understanding of how the web works - how browsers render a page, as well as how people use the web - UX, UI, branding, copywriting, business skills, data analysis, some coding. Of course, specialising in a particular area is most likely since SEO is so broad, though experts will still have a good understanding of all of it. ‘SEO’ as a discipline will be something that marketers get into, rather than I.T. people for the most part. So in essence: -Less technical aspects to SEO (as search engines become cleverer), except for in more niche cases - there will still be a market for these skills -Still technical skills in the sense of data analysis (R, Python, advanced Excel, data science). -It will be seen over time as a less of ‘get-rich-quick’ discipline - because it will be harder to do with that mindset. -It will be fairly well understood by marketers and not seen as a geeky/highly-technical/black magic industry. -More focus on marketing, creativity, PR, UX/UI -Fewer hard-and-fast-rules. Each site will be treated differently - some will rank well despite their design, others will rank well because of it. It will be whatever users show positive behaviour on. There’ll be much less ‘do x and you will rank high’ They won’t go anywhere. As long as there is some form of searching for something online, SEO in some form will always be there. As algorithms become better, what constitutes ‘good SEO’ will be closer to what constitutes ‘good marketing’ in general. Things are already going this way, but we will see even more of a user focus, and less of a technical one. Search engines will do better at crawling sites, without having to rely on a good structure, mark-up, sitemaps, or even textual content as they become able to identify images and videos and match them with user intent.

Bottom line if you do get a handle and figure out how to get your page to the top and Google don’t want it there they have a team of engineers against you to figure out what your doing to get someone they want on the top to the top. Look at examples of YouTube they do this so they are always giving you what you need exactly.Social Media back in the old days people relied on search engines to search for things. Now social media does SEO. If you have a question you can search right on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest the list goes on or you can ask the question on your wall and have your friends and family answer the question for you or they will find the content. All these companies take away from traditional search so the reach isn’t as great. With that being said making sure your social media is primed for keywords can give you an advantage when someone is searching for what you have but you have to be connected as a friend and they have to trust you so building relationships is very important.Ads even if you get the top spot for a short time their is going to most likely be 1–10 Ads that show up before your suggestion so the top spot isn’t what it used to be.Viral when things are trending and are going viral Google will show it favor to test it out right when something happens an hour ago we start searching for it and it shows up in the top spot of google on video, blogs, shopping, news if it is hot it’s on top.Social Media and viral together again google wants content on their site that people are sharing on social media that is why you see all the huge companies withmillions of likes on their fan pages pumping out fresh content every day.The good news Google has and always will want one thing like I said at the end of number 5 fresh content. So if you are a blogger, have a website, make videos, whatever you do create content that is original focus on one key word and make the whole post about that topic and talk about it 7 ways from Sunday in a natural conversational way. If you have a blog or channel don’t talk about 7 different topics until you are crushing it in the sleeping bag department and Google realizes your topic is all about sleeping bags than you can create another section in your site and start on tents because that goes with sleeping bags, than flash lights because that goes with that than batteries because people need them for flashlights than items that go with batteries that is how you would spread out and grow in a natural way. Put all your focus being a king of rich authentic content and you don’t have to worry about silly SEO tactics because Google will recognize you are the authority figure on the subject.

See what these 22 SEO experts are saying and we'll talk about it again! Admittedly, when we talk about SEO, netlinking is a must. Yet, too much to focus on the links, we often forget the basics. I'm talking about optimizing your site (SEO on-site). How many of you spent weeks looking for links without even checking that your site was optimized for search engines? You can have as many links as you want, if your pages do not please Google, you will remain invisible and your Analytics curve will remain at the floor level. Needless to say that without traffic, the only thing you will win is frustration ... By inviting experts in this article, I was hoping to highlight the essential elements that make in 2016 (and 2017), the basics of good on-site optimization. We can see a real consensus emerging around the content that must more than ever be at the heart of your SEO strategy So, experts, how do you make Google addicted to your sites and get your traffic off the ground without getting backlinks? Olivier Andrieu For my part, I will of course push open doors saying that I pay the greatest possible attention to the editorial structure of the content, the presence of my main request in the ""hot zones"", the to offer a lexical field as rich as possible, to offer internal mesh to other content and external to other relevant websites, etc. In short, the base. But that can take a lot of time. With, of course, a huge focus on the quality of the information offered and the least possible typing and spelling mistakes (which for me, who is dyslexic on the keyboard, is a real test: multiple proofreading required!). But there are two fields on which I pay even more attention: the Title (so the H1 because most often, I copy the H1 at the beginning of the Title)The meta description(so the chapo because most often ... see previously ).These two fields seem to me to be essential because they will be taken over by Google in its SERPs. And so it is they who will click the user or not . It would be a shame to position yourself and not be clicked, right? The idea is to make interesting, incentive , without ever going to ""putaclic"", of course ... My titles are also most often in ""Camel case"" to improve readability in the results. The meta description is here to make it all sexy . And as Google is currently modifying all its algorithms to gradually bring them to voice search, I always ask myself the following question: ""What the user will look for in an article such as I'm trying to describe ?"" The title of the article will often be used to ask the question determined beforehand (because that's how we work in voice search: we ask a question rather than align keywords) ... And I try in the content, to answer it. Joshua Vilys In our agency, we practice very few Netlinking campaigns. We play on the quality of editorial content to improve indexing and ipso facto recover natural links without maneuvering with the different techniques of acquisition of backlinks. For the quality of your website to propel you among the top results of search engines, build around the following indicators: Irreproachable grammar and spelling: for that, hire a web editor; or learn to write better.Reliability, expertise, authority: the content must be useful and well-developed. Your rewards and certifications are welcome. Do not hide the links to contact you, and highlight the general conditions of sale, the conditions of returns and the privacy policy.Positive feedback: look for the opinions of your best customers / readers.Useful clicks: use fewer banners. On less visited pages, place products and merchandise.Specific answers to users' requests: find your niche, and bring the right answers to customer queries. Choose the keywords based on their relevance, not just the number. Think about what the user is waiting for.Keep track of how much time users spend on your site - offer good design to improve the user experience and make your pages more engaging. Add images and videos as needed. Using Google Analytics, identify your best sources of traffic and set a strategy to improve traffic from those sources.Improve the conversion rate: test several versions of your pages with Internet users using an ""A / B testing"". Take inspiration from CRO's best practices to achieve this.Fewer banner ads: Limit the number and avoid them above the main pages of the website.Improve the clickthrough rate of user requests: fine tune the descriptions, URLs and titles of your web pages. Make them attractive and rewarding.Bet on the mobile: adapt the design, place fewer texts, write short sentences and reduce the loading time for the mobile version of your website.Remember that it is also essential to properly and regularly prune your website to keep a good ""QualityRank"" score. Detect pages and content to be removed from the site. Many companies do not know how much this technique is saving. Alexandre Santoni How to improve your SEO without additional link? Of course, the interrogation at this stage is complex insofar as the key lies in the analysis of acquired and unvested a target website. Beyond these unconditional parameters, here are three tips that I can provide through the cases I worked on: Defend your choices : we can end up with conflicts of interest between different poles of the web or applications of recommendations bordering the 20%. Knowing how to defend your SEO choices is the key to your success and more globally one of the keys to the success of a website. Knowing how to defend your on-site optimization choices and then having them applied is a real challenge for certain types of clients. Architecture planning and development : where possible, redesign and / or densification of the architecture brings results that can be spectacular. I study the keywords, I rework the levels, the titles according to the possible content. Be imaginative not to get stuck. In e-commerce for example, we all talk about faceted navigation and optimization of it. In fact 2016, a broad fringe of customers can not optimize SEO. Secondary solutions may exist to operate the long tail keywords. Think (also) about the quantity of pages : we are all focusing on quality, on real content, demented articles and product sheets without flaws. Yes, it is clearly a factor of success, it is an absolute obviousness. Now, having many perfectly worked pages give way to a more quantitative input with interesting results at the end. Semi-automation can have a map to play here. William Troillard This is not a natural reflex for us marketers, and yet it is a fact that we have been able to observe ourselves and which is further supported by this study : the pages containing external links are potentially getting better. Google SEO. Creating external links is disruptive in many ways: we fear for our reputation; we are afraid of creating exit doors; and / or that it creates a negative impact on his SEO. And yet! It's the opposite effect: it works! Search engines tend to reward sites that point outward and especially when they make it to reliable sources. In practice : Make links to blogs that you find credible;Make links to your influencers: these outbound links tend to bring you inbound links;Make outbound links to help your users: Before writing for robots, you write for your readers, outbound links should be a help for them to understand a concept or to deepen a topic.Christian Vilela The value and the tags to optimizeThe goal of SEO is to increase the quality, understanding, but especially the visibility of a website within the search engine results. To increase traffic , there is no magic. I invest very little time on social networks, but I use tools and methodologies that allow me to better position myself on these search engines. First and foremost, I write articles that may be of interest to my readers. The more interesting, relevant and quality content is, the more the content becomes ""shareable"" , so over time I increase my chances of finding myself on the first page of Google search results. The keyword to remember on the web, as in business, is: ""value"". ""Value"" is your best marketing tool. I would prefer that 10 visitors stay on my website for 5 minutes rather than 100 visitors for 5 seconds. Basically, for my articles and the pages of my website, I'm only trying to optimize the keywords of tags TITLE, H1, H2, file name and ALT tags. H1, aim readers, TITLE, aim at robotsFor blogs and small corporate websites, WordPress is my favorite platform. However, basically with WordPress, the content of the title of your articles and pages will also be used for the values ​​of tags TITLE, H1 and the link of this new article / page. I suggest you use one of the following extensions to allow you to independently edit the TITLE and H1 tags of your articles and pages . The reason why it is sometimes useful to have different TITLE and H1 tags is that the H1 tag is usually more visible to the reader because it is part of the content of your page. As the title of a newspaper article, the H1 tag must first and foremost catch the attention of the reader who is already on your website. Any good copywriter knows that the title of an article is the advertisement of the article itself. If a title can not hold the attention, your potential customer will not go further. With the H1 tag, it is therefore necessary to find the angle that will capture the attention. If possible, dot this one with some important keywords for the SEO of your page. Finally, I suggest to bet more on the TITLE tag to help you with optimization for search engine robots. Keep in mind: The first words of the TITLE tag have more weight (SEO) than the last ones. Take the following title as an example: ""Effective marketing strategies to increase your profits"". The keywords ""Marketing Strategies"" may perform better than the keywords ""increase your profits"". Warning, sometimes search engines choose the ""bad"" keywords of your tags to display your pages in the search results. I recently published a Webapp article or mobile application, which route to take for your project , but doing a little analysis later, I found that Google posted my article for the following keywords: ""which road "","" take the road "","" which road to take "". So I rectified the shooting by modifying my tags H1 and TITLE for ""Webapp or native mobile application for your project?"" Nothing spectacular, I know, but a little more likely to attract ""qualified"" readers this time.

In that sense, the first technique to employ with a new SEO client is a technical audit of the current site and an analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. One client of mine already had a ton of backlinks and brand recognition, but the structure of their site made it confusing to navigate and internal linking was almost non-existent. In this case, it made the most sense to get an organized URL structure in place with a sensical hierarchy of topics/pages. Another client had a great site (fast, well-structured, responsive, etc.) but had no links and little content. For them it made the most sense to create a content and link building strategy. There is no silver bullet. After major technical issues are sorted out (or at least on their way to being sorted out), one can begin to piece together how to optimize the site so it can better suit the company or organization’s unique business goals. Some companies just want organic traffic (think sites like BuzzFeed; those that generate revenue from AdWords and the like), while others are eCommerce (think sites like Amazon; those that make sales online), and still others are looking to generate leads or quote requests (think General Steel; those that generate revenue from custom jobs or appointments). How well of a job you’re doing as an SEO expert is judged heavily on how well you are able to pair the results you get with the business goals of your client. The definition of an “SEO Expert” has seemed to become diluted over the years. I’d make the point that an SEO Expert is someone who can oversee the entire process of organic search marketing, from the technical to creative. It’s not only about content writing or keywording for title and description tags. A true SEO Expert manages the whole experience of a potential client, from the moment they go online to the point they finally make a purchase decision.",2021-03-05T20:27:42.538Z,"What are the basic techniques of SEO experts?

A person with a good work ethic can learn this inside 6 months, no problem but the other side of SEO, which in my view makes the difference between an average SEO and a great SEO, is real front-line experience.  In this industry, there is no substitute for actually working with a live site and trying to rank / optimise it and testing what works and what doesn't, then reacting the results of your changes.  This is where you will learn the most and it will make the difference when it comes to being effective when working with clients.  It can take many years to achieve sufficient depth of knowledge and experience working with a variety of sites in different markets to fully understand the complete picture.  A lot of it is trial and error in the beginning. Another thing to consider is that SEO is an ever-changing landscape so you have to try and stay up to date and be constantly learning new bets practices.   What worked a year ago, may no longer be effective or safe. There is a positive aspect to this though because if you come in and learn all the new stuff you may well be better placed than a lot of SEO's that haven't moved with the times and this can give you a great advantage. My advice to you would be to complete a really solid training program, I recommend Marketmotive's training courses (I have myself done some of their practitioner courses as a way of making sure there were no gaps in my knowledge).  They are excellent.   If you want to short-cut your learning do the master certification.  This will give you a great grounding as well as some project experience, it is pricey though - $3000 bucks I think.  Join their mailing list and get the early bird pricing if you are going to go down this route.  Learn google analytics also, being able to analyse data will make you a much better SEO and will ensure your skills cross over into other channels that are useful to your clients. Above all, I would say you should try and get a job working with an SEO team at a  reputable company (if this is an option for you).  By doing so, you will get to work with client sites and have the security of working under more experienced practioners. Good luck, if you have any more questions, I'm happy to help - get in touch.

For sure, the higher ranking, the bigger traffic, but that is not the only point. Website optimization is a complex issue that requires coordinated work of both SEO specialist, copywriter, sales manager, marketing manager and programmer, and the results of SEO can be analyzed in 6 months or more. This requires a lot of attention, experience in working with the particular website type and individual approach to every client. SEO specialists have to work on a weekly basis with each website, conducting analyses of their work, checking all tasks, developing new optimization options and discussing their work and results with the client. Personally I think that working with 10 or more websites negatively impacts quality of proposed SEO services. A good SEO specialist can effectively work with 5 or 6 projects, as all of them take a lot of time and efforts. Therefore, with the growing number of websites that need to improve their ranking, attract users and convert them into clients, the demand in SEO specialists is as well increasing.

Of course, most clients don’t want to know all the details so I answer their questions honestly and fully to the level they want to know. Once I see their eyes start to gloss over, it’s time to call it quits. And no matter what their interest level in the beginning, it never gets too far to the point where I have to “reveal” the nitty gritty. But when you know SEO, it’s remarkably simple and pretty straightforward. If you don’t know, then you pick up a trick here and a hack there (usually grey or black hat) and try to take advantage of the search engines. That’s when you usually get in trouble. Then most repeat the cycle thinking they just need to learn more tricks. The most fundamental thing, I’d say, someone needs to understand about SEO is to understand the purpose of the search engines. Taking Google as an example, what is Google’s main purpose in SERPs? It’s to provide good experience to the users. And that’s why relevancy is such a big thing. Then, you start to understand the purpose behind the anchor texts, lateral keywords, etc… So give big G what it wants and how it wants it. Not with the tricks but the core of what it wants (i.e., what the users want). And that is, answers to specific questions. That’s why we search things after all, isn’t it? Every keyword has an intention or a question behind it. So if you target a keyword, make sure the content answers that question. Remember that trying to game the system is a losing proposition. Google has teams of PhD mathematicians working to improve the algorithm. Do you really want to go against them? Or just work with the tide and let them do the work? In a nutshell, they want to emulate the human decision making as much as possible. When a person looks at the search results, what will they choose? What do they want to see in the first place? That’s the end goal. So cater to THAT, not tricks and hacks. That’s the biggest and best advice I can give. Kind of up in the air, but if an SEO person doesn’t get that and is caught up with tricks and latest strategies, I know they’re in it for the short haul and either pull their hair out trying to keep up or quit the game pretty soon. I’m sorry, I cannot reveal that… :) Joking aside, that varies greatly depending on whom I’m talking to. I don’t reveal even the common strategies if I’m talking to a potential competitor (e.g., owners of other marketing agencies), but I hide nothing when talking to clients. Of course, most clients don’t want to know all the details so I answer their questions honestly and fully to the level they want to know. Once I see their eyes start to gloss over, it’s time to call it quits. And no matter what their interest level in the beginning, it never gets too far to the point where I have to “reveal”  Continue Reading",2021-03-05T20:32:19.309Z,"What are the tips that SEO experts usually do not reveal?

An Expert SEO Specialist can diagnose the 10 major problems and solutions with a website’s/business’s SEO in 30 mins - 1 hour and prioritize them in terms of what would significantly improve traffic. It takes days for a good SEO specialist to come up with even 7 of those problems. Even more, a good specialist won’t know which items to prioritize and may spend hours on tasks that barely affect a website’s traffic. An expert’s ability to prioritize will save you serious money. Have them teach you the fundamentals of SEO and strategy, provide you with a comprehensive audit and roadmap, giving you the tools to drawn upon in your digital marketing endeavors.

Thats fast this marketplace is changing and hence the smartest SEOs will not be rigid with their approach. They will be nimble, agile and adaptable to changing scenarios all the time. This is the first smart technique if you’d ask me. Be adaptive. Another smart ability would be to unlearn. Far too many times SEOs (that included me for a long time as well) maintain that some strategies are ever-green and will stand the test of time. Thats why they don’t research or look around for new ideas or disruptions that can be better for them. e.g. for a long time, SEOs advocated using keywords in domain names as a SEO technique. So much so that they were adamant at times. They forced clients to buy long domain names just to accommodate keywords. Look at this - designer-outfits-store-san-francisco.com. Are you kidding me? Yes - this was one domain recommended by me to our customer back in 2006. It worked well until 2012 when Google whipped them all and all was lost over night. Our adamant attitude to have such keyword based domains brought its downfall. The reason - we did not unlearn based on the market changes and just kept pushing for the established. Big mistake in SEO. Be ready to unlearn and relearn all the time. Its all evolving all the time. New tech, New platforms, New marketplaces, New ideas and new disruptors. For a long time, I was convinced WhatsApp was a tool for forwarding good morning messages and personal chat groups. See how it has evolved as a powerful business tool now. Amazon disrupted search into search for information and search for shopping. AI is making marketing extremely powerful. Keep an eye on the future trends and plan your SEO strategy accordingly.

However, I advise looking for a US-Based company, as they are renowned for better customer support, especially the one that I’ve mentioned below. If you agree with the above, you find a reliable seo expert by using the simple criteria I’ve outlined below: Can the agency provide results?…Look at Case StudiesDo they provide good customer service?…Look at Customer ReviewsTherefore, you need to choose an SEO company that provides case studies and has good customer reviews, and by doing this, you’ll have full confidence knowing that the company you’ve picked can help your business grow! I found a great SEO agency by using ‘case studies’ and ‘customer reviews’ as my criteria: After looking around, I found an SEO company called The Hoth, who are based in Florida, USA. I found them after reading some of their helpful blog posts on ‘How to boost your Google rankings quicker with high quality link building’ - Blog Post Ironically enough, I found this whilst searching in Google, so I wanted to find out more about the company.  Anyway, they provide a range of SEO services, all of which are affordable and have no contracts, all with 24/7 Live Chat functionality. Their packages start from $69 and some agencies even pay them $10,000 per month. As I mentioned, they have some great case studies demonstrating their past results, where they’ve improved traffic to some of their client websites by up to 842.4% - Read More I currently use them for their Hoth X 500 service, which is an entirely managed SEO service which costs me $500 per month (yes that’s how much I believe in them)   But don’t worry they have a range of different plans suitable for every budget. They have a really solid reputation in the SEO industry, which is a reason that I initially started to use their basic $69 package… from the results that you can see above, alongside their reviews from other clients, it’s clear that they can provide good results. They mainly specialise in providing white-hat SEO services, and have a widely diverse range of plans to suit all kinds of clients (from large organisations to freelancers), all of their SEO services are featured below:  Here are some of their latest customer reviews.

A long time of SEO Experience ""Anybody can set-up a 'Search engine optimization organization' overnight and call themselves a SEO master,"" says Jill Whalen, CEO of aHigh Rankings. ""In any case, that doesn't mean they realize what they're doing. There are several easily overlooked details that go into the master plan of doing SEO and it takes numerous times of encountering what works and what doesn't to really make a decent showing with regards to."" Whalen includes that each site needs extraordinary SEO strategies to succeed. ""A SEO master with numerous times of experience will have the capacity to take a gander at any site and know precisely what should be improved the situation it to acquire web crawler activity, while another person at SEO will attempt similar things on each website, which will just have a restricted impact, assuming any,"" Whalen includes. 2. An Understanding of All Three SEO Levels Website improvement includes three levels: Specialized (the structure of a site, which can decide how simple or troublesome it is for web search tools to slither and file your substance) On-page streamlining (the utilization of such components as catchphrases and HTML labels in ways that assistance increment web index activity to your webpage) Off-page streamlining, (for example, external link establishment). ""You don't need a one-dimensional SEO,"" says Taylor Pratt, VP of item advertising for Raven Internet Marketing Tools. ""You require somebody who will approach their technique from each of the three edges to boost achievement."" ""On the off chance that web crawlers can't get to all the substance on a site, or some substance is covered too profoundly in the webpage, at that point whatever else done on the site will be futile as far as SEO achievement,"" Whalen includes. ""This implies all SEO specialists or organizations need to see all the specialized impediments and issues that web indexes may have, and they should have the capacity to express those to the designers of your site so the issues can be limited."" 3. A Proven Track Record of SEO Success It's anything but difficult to talk a decent amusement in SEO, notes Whalen. ""There are huge amounts of blog entries and articles that portray different SEO strategies one can utilize. In any case, it's something else to have upbeat customers. Anybody hoping to enlist a SEO expert or organization should check no less than three genuinely current references to examine how the SEO organization helped them succeed."" 4. Showcasing Savvy ""When you get past the specialized issues of a site, SEO is a great deal like conventional showcasing,"" says Whalen. ""Content should be composed in a way that diagrams the advantage to the client while driving them to a deal. What's more, everything must be done in a way that additionally bids to the general population at the flip side of an internet searcher who are searching for what your organization brings to the table."" 5. A Well-adjusted Perspective and Knowledge ""For quite a long time, I figured I could overlook subjects outside the hyper-centered SEO field,"" says Rand Fishkin, CEO and fellow benefactor of SEOMoz. ""On the off chance that it didn't need to do with positioning website pages in web indexes, bah hoax! That disposition was silly and off-base. The present SEO needs to see all of showcasing at a profound level, the brain science of humankind, the particular culture to whom they're promoting, the online networking scene, web examination, website composition and improvement, viral advertising, content, item, plans of action and the sky is the limit from there. When we separate SEO from these other basic practices, we settle on here and now choices that can eventually hurt more than they offer assistance."" 6. An Understanding of the Big Picture Does the SEO concentrate on changes (changing over a guest to your site into a client), or would they say they are more worried about web search tool rankings? In a perfect world, ""the concentration of any SEO technique ought to be to finish an objective (like expanding transformations), not to accomplish a specific rank,"" says Pratt. 7. The Capability to Fit in With Your Company's Culture Search engine optimization specialists must interface with a wide range of regions of a business including IT, promoting, client benefit, examination, and deals. The capacity for the SEO to function admirably with individuals from these groups is fundamental, notes Fishkin. ""The identity, trustworthiness and correspondence style of the SEO needs to coordinate the association or advance will be hard,"" he says. 8. Phenomenal relational abilities. Discussing correspondence style, a SEO should have the capacity to unmistakably convey why a change must be made to your site in wording that everybody comprehends, notes Pratt. ""It is highly unlikely a SEO can do everything themselves. So they should have the capacity to impart why a specific change should be made in wording that everybody gets it. They ought to have the capacity to converse with the IT group and the C-level group and express what is on their mind."" 9. An energy for execution. Search engine optimization specialists who love to complete things effectively typically make for perfect advisors, Fishkin says. ""Extraordinary SEOs discover approaches to work around difficulties and detours. Obviously, this implies your association must empower advance and not obstruct it or you'll break their soul and want to affect the organization emphatically."" 1.

Traditional marketing skills still apply: copywriting, consumer psychology, appealing to target markets, etc, but that just applies to providing quality content that google will recognize. You also have to implement proper keywords, without making it look obvious to google that you just packed them in there for SEO purposes. In addition to that, you also have to be excellent with website development. Making sure your site has fast load times, optimizing for mobile use and implementing script to analyze the data that comes from your page (bounce rate, re-targeting, exit intent, etc). You’re also competing with paid ads - companies that make way more targeting and monopolizing all of the high volume search terms. You don’t want to get caught up bidding against big companies for space, because though they are qualified leads, you pay a LOT for clicks so you better hope they convert. Ultimately, there’s a very tenuous balance between great content, proper coding, knowing when to scale, etc. As for experts leading people to believe it’s difficult, I don’t know many professions where people don’t want to tell you that what they do is difficult and proprietary to their company.
