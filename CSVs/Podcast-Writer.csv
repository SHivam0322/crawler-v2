During my journey, I’ve learnt several things. To become an established freelance writer, you need to- Write, write and writeIt may seem as a very lame suggestion and you may be like, duh I know. But believe me, to become an established freelance writer, the primary thing that you need, is to hone your writing skills. Practice writing as much as you can. 2. Read a lot Your writing skills will improve when you have a kack for reading a lot. It will not only increase your vocabulary but also will help you expand your horizon. 3. Learn new skills As much as quality content is preferred by clients, there are stuffs that you must keep in mind while writing for a them. When you become a freelance writer for a website, your client relies on you to write content that is good in quality and helps in ranking his website. Learn search engine optimization(SEO) basic html and wordpress. If you do not want to learn the languages, atleast learn SEO. After you’ve aquired your skills and have decided that now you CAN write for clients, here’s a list of things you need to do. Make a websiteA writer MUST have a website. If you do not, make one. You do not need to have advanced website making skills or learn a whole set of programming languages. All you need is just go to a free website maker like wix or wordpress and make one. 2. Write blogs Blog writing helps you hone your writing skills. And for your website visitors, this is the place where they’d be entertained and spend the most of their visiting time. This will also become an area where your prospective clients will examine your skills and consider you for their project. But before starting to write blogs, you need to choose a writing niche. 3. Choose a niche A writing niche is a just like genres. There are many writing niches. You may be familiar with few, like, fashion, lifestyle, IT, sports, business, health, entertainment etc. Do not be tempted to say that you can write on virtually any topic because believe me, nobody can. Juggle your options and choose the right one. After you’ve set up your website and have written few blogs, Start with writing internshipsClients will always want an experienced writer. They neither have time nor money to consider an unexperienced one. On the other hand, internships, though low paying, will consider you and give you projects to do. The end result would be an addition to your portfolio. There are many websites like internshala (many others are there, search them) where eminent companies register to offer internships. 2. Pitch on job boards Clients hang out on job boards to hire freelance writers. Here’s where you’ll meet prospective clients and get work. Before doing that, do not forget to add the links of your published works(from the internships)to your portfolio and provide a link to your portfolio and blog on your CV. 3. Register in freelance service providing website They are also a means to gain a clientele. Sites like fiverr, freelancer, truelancer etc provides opportunities for freelancers(not just writers) a platform to showcase their skills and get clients. On the other hand, there are websites like wittypen, iwriter, which are just for freelance writers. They will examine your skills before welcoming you onboard. 4. Make a professional twitter and linedin profile A professional twitter profile is very important. Twitter along with linkedin is a great place to expand your network. Do not just create a profile, add a profile picture and sit back. Follow people and in turn they will follow you back along with people who follow them. Tweet regularly (your can tweet about your work, your current project, about writing or promote your latest blog posts). I hope this answer was able to solve your query. You can personally contact me of you want to know anything else. :)",2021-03-05T06:39:09.090Z,"How do I start freelancing as a content writer? ",Quora

This means creating the writing which appears on websites that are designed to sell or promote a specific product. Content writers work according to the brief provided by a client. This brief will define their task and any SEO related requirements, such as keyword density. The job of the Content Writer is to turn this brief into a finished product which becomes part of the target webpage. Content is distinct from journalism or conventional copywriting in that it is designed to achieve prominence on the web, and must be tailored for this purpose. Content writing is almost always related to SEO marketing campaigns. It will involve writing tightly focused texts that include a set of keywords or phrases that have been researched by marketers. High-quality content will ensure that these keywords appear in the right density. The text will also be fluently written, clear and able to promote the product being described. The quality of the content produced also needs to be high. Poor quality content is less likely to achieve a high search engine ranking, meaning that the webpage in question will not be read by a large number of potential customers. The skills required for content writing are varied. They include the ability to write fluently and persuasively on a range of subjects while integrating keywords without losing readability. SEO is actually all about content marketing. And since content writing is indispensable to any genuine content marketing effort, we can safely say that SEO is actually all about content writing. How come? I’m describing that below. 5 Reasons Why Content Writing Is Important for SEO 1. SEO needs strategic use of keywords and search terms Although big advances have been made in terms of ranking web pages and blog posts according to their true value, keywords still matter. You can judge the importance of keywords by the fact that your ranking depends on whether you have used your keywords or one of its alternatives in the title of your web page or blog post, or not. It is only through strategic content writing that you can use the right keywords to satiate Google. If there is no content, it is very difficult for you to rank for the right keywords. 2. Social validation can only be obtained due to quality content I have personally seen that many web pages and blog posts rank well due to the social validation they have been able to attract despite having inferior quality content. But this can only be achieved by brute force and lots of money. For a small or medium-sized business, the only way you can get social validation is by quality content writing. When your content is great, when it delivers value, when people find what they are looking for through your content, they tend to engage with your content through social media and social networking websites. When they share your links on their timelines, Google sees these actions as social validation and then uses this validation to rank your links. 3. Quality backlinks can only be obtained due to quality content Backlinks are also a form of social validation but you don’t necessarily have to focus on social media and social networking websites to garner backlinks. Why would people link to your website or blog? Apart from the fact that sometimes you can pay websites and blogs to link back to you, in most of the cases, people link to you because they appreciate what you are publishing. 4. In order to rank your website and individual links, Google needs content This is a straightforward logic. If you don’t have content, what is Google going to rank? In Google Images Google ranks images, in Google Video, Google ranks videos and in the same manner, in the normal Google section, Google ranks text, your written content. This is why content writing is important for your SEO: it is giving Google something to rank. It also tells Google for what keywords and search terms your content should be ranked. 5. Content writing contributes to the “Search Task Accomplishment” factor This is a new trend emerging: does your content solve any purpose? Search Task Accomplishment is becoming a new buzzword on the Internet, especially in the content marketing and SEO circles. Soon, Google is going to rank your content according to the true purpose it solves. A user should be able to find exactly what he or she is looking for when he or she uses the Google search engine. Google is working on an algorithm that will be able to find if people are able to find exactly the information they need on your link. If yes, your rankings will start improving and if no, your rankings will start deteriorating.

You need to learn how to convey a characters feelings, how to describe actions, how (and when and how much) to describe settings, describe characters. You have to develop a feeling for dialogue and how to write it so that it comes across as realistic on the page (which is considerably different from what you hear when listening to real people talk). You need to learn how to trust your inner self, and at the same time you need to learn about your own proclivities and habitual modes of being, and how they may not contribute to your ability to get down on the page what you’re aiming for. You need to have an active imagination, to become a creative sort of person who really likes to make things.

So, as per the latest standards and circumstances, content writing could be referred to as “the expression of ideas or conveying the message in the form of words in such a way that it reaches maximum number of people making them aware of something or influencing them to take an action.” The primary job of a content writer is to develop content which can reach larger audiences usually generating more leads, developing copy that provides value and influences the audience to take an action such as buy a product, test a service, visit a website or anything.Let’s go a little bit more in detail about the primary tasks of a content writer. MAKE CONTENT RANK HIGHER ON SEARCH ENGINES Search engines like Google has around 63,000 searches at any given moment, it doesn’t take a genius to understand that appearing at the top of some search results can bring tremendous response to that piece of content ultimately driving good traffic to the organization publishing it.Internet is an incredibly large market than any other market with over 4 billion user, now you could easily imagine what a large audience there must be for any given domain or topic. Ranking higher means visible to all those people searching about that particular topic. So, this is the reason companies, and brands require professional content writers to bring more reach.This method is called Search engine optimization or SEO and it is a very important practice in content writing. This skill is highly on demand, and companies are looking forward for professionals with latest SEO practices to work for them.In case you’re aspiring to become one such content writer, you must have this skill.

If I were to recommend you with one such course, it would definitely be IIM SKILLS.

If one is desperate enough to build a career as a content writer, I am sure they can devote at least 4 weeks for that.There is a lot more about IIM SKILLS, but this is the least you should know to understand how to learn and where to go.

Once you get your first order you will get the second one in a week or two. It will take about three months for you to start earning decently about 10k -15k a month. But once you reach a certain level you can start charging more to make about 30 k a month. You need to find other ways or companies to work with too if you want to make around 50k or more.

That would be perfect way for you to start building up a writing portfolio and shift from an engineering to a writing position eventually. You can generate other useful tech documents that would be very much in line with your engineering background. You can for example try developing a System Configuration Guide for system admins and other developers. Or you can try writing systems specs, A&E Documents, or Marketing Requirements Document (MRD). Your engineering background would come in very handy when working on documents like that. Release Notes and QA Testing Scripts are other types of tech documents that you can easily start to write as an engineer. Get in touch with your Project and/or Product Manager and see if they could use your help in generating some of the documents I listed above.

You love your job, you’re good at it and you keep performing well to get further to earn your well deserved compensation - isn’t this the ideal career path? This is not rocket science but there are many challenges though. You may not know what passion you have. You may not know what your natural strengths are. You may have chosen a degree concentration that you’re not really crazy about and you don’t want to waste it (so you pursue a career you don’t really like). And in all likelihood, there aren’t too many openings in the market for the job you like. Why many people are not in pursuit of their ideal career? Because it takes persistence and perseverance. That is, may be they have tried for a while and not found their strengths and interests, they gave up. May be they knew what job they want but failed to land on one after a few tries. The hardest thing would be for someone who currently has a stable job to break out of his comfort zone to go for a different career, even though that’s what he’d love. My suggestion is to start early, preferably when you’re still in college. Take a personality test to find out what your natural interest and strengths may be. Keep an eye on jobs that fit your profile. Be aware of the qualifications required and make it a target that you can reach within 3–5 years. Then, go for jobs that leads you to the target.

Use of two spaces is an obsolete convention based on typewriter technology and will mark you as out of touch.

If editors or other potential employers or clients notice that you don’t know this simple fact, they may be skeptical about your writing skills before you’ve had a chance to impress them. 2. Take care that paragraphs are of varying reasonable length. Unusually short or long paragraphs are appropriate in moderation, but allowing a series of choppy paragraphs or laboriously long ones to remain in a final draft is unprofessional. 3. If you’re submitting a manuscript or other content for publication, do not format it with various fonts and other style features. Editors want to read good writing, not enjoy aesthetically pleasing (or not) manuscripts; efforts to prettify a file are a distraction. Style4. Do not, in résumés or in other text, get carried away with capitalization. You didn’t earn a Master’s Degree; you earned a master’s degree. You didn’t study Biology; you studied biology. You weren’t Project Manager; you were project manager. (Search the Daily Writing Tips website for “capitalization” to find numerous articles on the subject.) 5. Become familiar with the rules for styling numbers and apply them rationally. 6. Know the principles of punctuation, especially regarding consistency in insertion or omission of the serial comma, avoidance of the comma splice, and use of semi-colon.And if you write in American English and you routinely place a period after the closing quotation mark at the end of a sentence rather than before it, go back to square one and try again. 7. Hyphenation is important. In other breaking news, life isn’t fair. Don’t count on editors to cure your hyphenation hiccups for you; become your own expert consultant. 8. Avoid “scare quotes.” A term does not need to be called out by quotation marks around it unless you must clarify that the unusual usage is not intended to be read literally, or when they are employed for “comic” effect. (In this case, the implication is that the comic effect is patently unamusing.) Usage9. For all intensive purposes, know your idioms. (That should be “for all intents and purposes,” but you should also just omit such superfluous phrases.) On a related note, avoid clichés like the plague — except when you don’t. They’re useful, but generous use is the sign of a lazy writer. Spelling10. Don’t rely on spellchecking programs to do your spelling work for you, and always verify spelling (and wording) of proper nouns. Hope it helped!
