Whenever you come across a new word, write it down on one side of an index card, with its dictionary definition, along with characteristics and traits of the word, plus all the grammatical variations.  To extend your understanding of the new word, explore similar words (synonyms), opposite words (antonyms), examples and non-examples, and even word parts. On the flip-side, make your own sentence constructions by using the new word, to demonstrate your thorough understanding. Naturally, you can also copy the original sentence from which you have found the new word. Whenever you come across the new word in other writings, or in conversations, or in the news, write the full expression down on to the flip side of your index card.  This initiative is called sentence mining. Replicate this elaborate process with chosen words already inside your prevailing vocabulary, thus creating opportunities to expand similar possibilities along the same lines.  You can even use organising themes for the words so as to expedite your learning. This process may seem like a burden, but it's worth your while, as you are applying the sentence mining and multiplier effect to your vocabulary building and generation, especially from the standpoint of application-context possibilities. To sum up my proposition, the fire test of your increasingly rich and impressive vocabulary comes from your massive application and consistent usage in your everyday real-life activities [e.g. conversations, dialogues, meetings, discussions, writing emails, or reports or proposals or blogs, presentations, sales pitches, webcasting, pod-casting, etc.] , involving real communication with real people, as much as possible, so as to reinforce your practical utility.

It all depends on the goals. For a product where users often browse a list of visual items, then dig into one item more, then come back to the original context, it can be important to have pagination. Pagination allows users to re-orient themselves and also easily determine which items they've already seen and which ones they don't nee to pay attention to any longer. So infinite scroll can be disorienting here, especially for users who use the back button on their browser frequently. The best thing to do is test different design in different contexts and measure the results.

However, in that case, the best way to improve your conversion rate is by focussing on your audience and their needs within specific areas of your conversion funnel.

To overcome this obstacle, your best bet is to focus cater your site for the specific device type — mobile, desktop, or tablet — the bulk of your shoppers use. If most of your shoppers are arriving from mobile or tablet devices, don’t think just about screen size when optimizing your site.

Use a simple splash page if that is the case.Your page may be having loading issues with your visitors that you cannot see. Check your site page stats on your web host. Are all your pages loading?(2) Sales channel not working.Run a test to be sure your sale process works.(3) Sign up process is not working.Test your sign up using one of your email accounts.(4) Page is not readable.I sometimes see pages that cannot be read due to layout. Text is sometimes too large or too small. It may be too wide. Since browsers went to having tabs, fewer visitors are on a single web page and so do not narrow their page to read wide layout articles. Study layout fundamentals that newspapers and magazines use and understand how that works. Design your page to be readable by most people in your language. Browsers have the means to increase or decrease font size so focus on setting correct font dimensions to fit column or box size.(5) Colors or color combination is not working.Choosing a color theme is one of the most difficult parts of designing a converting page. Browsers can vary how color and objects are rendered in the views of each of your visitors. In general choose, simple and contrasting colors not likely to be an issue. (Red & brown don't work together for example.) Here's a very useful color palette selection site that does more than provide color codes.Color Combinations | Color Schemes | Color Palettes(6) Images not loading.Your image may be too large. Do not use a raw camera image as your wallpaper. It's too much to load. Or there may be a file naming problem you have overlooked. Filenames on your web host are case sensitive and should not have spaces. You might have to rename the extension. Some Windows programs or your camera may save your image as "".JPG"". Rename it to "".jpg"" because for me a file extension in all caps is annoying.(7) Video is not loading.Check to see if your video is still available. Some readers may block videos of some types of content. YouTube has new security features by default that may be restricting views of some of your visitors. If you are having that issue, that's an excellent Quora question to ask.(8) Page loading issues (assorted forms of non-loading).Referral link not formed properly.If page is referenced by a referral link, be sure that the link is correct. There should be no spaces in the link. Check with your program for the correct link if in doubt.Web host suspended.I get that one sometimes. The page owner needs to pay the bill or has violated TOS.Redirect Errors.Some advertisers use redirection to change target page to intended landing page. If you are promoting some other program page that you do not own, this may be a problem if your program does not accept redirection.Bandwidth Exceeded.Traffic was too much for hosting service.Increase web host service if this occurs. Or you can reduce your landing page size.Authentication Required. (I just got this now.)Landing page is to a secure area on your site (or the site of your program). Do not reference a page behind a wall that requires membership or payment to access.Account Has Been Suspended.If you are in an affiliate program, check the status of your membership.Affiliate Product or Service No Longer Available.Check that the merchant is still active in your affiliate program. Your Amazon merchant may have run out of the product for example.Cloudflare PageYour visitors might be getting this if your site is getting the wrong traffic (spam or DDOS attack). Check the quality of your traffic with your host stats. Check your WordPress for unwanted spammers. If you are getting this, here's an excellent Quora question to post.(9) Email Sales Channel IssuesIf your conversion depends upon a working email subscription, be sure to test that. Make sure your email can be read. Always have a text only version of your email that's brief and easy to read. Keep your email list fresh and current. Do not put too many links in your emails. Keep email topic focused on your message and make it clear what your reader is supposed to do. (signup, buy something, watch a video or just read your blog content)(10) Branding & Marketing IssuesMost advertisers use something to make the ad stand out such as a character, humor, a cartoon, eye-grabbing photo or anything to appeal to emotions. If you are offering food, you get the best photo of that food. Examine your page and determine how it can be improved so it stands out. Post a Quora question if you think this is your problem.(10) It might be the product or service being offered.This is where you need to take a critical look at your offer and determine how marketable it really is. Read all reviews, both positive and negative. Perhaps the price is too high for your visitors. Maybe you need to start with something smaller (trial size). Or is there something that can be for free (free signup)? Or it might be you are targeting the wrong audience. Build a fan page first to get that audience and then target those people. One way to become a better advertiser is to view the ads of others. I have done this since 2004 with ad viewing programs. I summarize my experience on this page where you can find a variety of different advertiser types and tips where to go to find professional marketing help. There are many free or low cost ways of testing your ad landing pages before paying bigger advertisers after you know it works.

AFAIK Perl basically does its storage in RAM (but even if you could find some virtual memory tweak, you’d be clobbered by the paging). I’ve had similar problems with ‘out of memory’ errors when I use rather large data sets and have limited memory. A few thoughts that may help: Determine how much memory you’re using by looking at system allocation of memory to your Perl program;Relate this usage to the size of the data. Find out how big your data can be (just) without crashing, to get an idea of the inefficiency of storage of those specific data. This gives you a baseline to improve upon.In passing arrays between routines, make sure you pass by reference (i.e. \@) as otherwise you’ll get huge spikes in memory consumption. You may be able to watch this dynamically using the technique you’ve chosen in (1). If you have multiple routines calling one another in a complex way while passing by value, this may well be your problem.If you can, read your huge file a portion at a time instead of ‘slurping’ in the whole file by saying e.g. @array = <$fh>; you can then parse that section, write it etc. and move on to the next section/line/whatever. It’s seldom that you have to read the whole file in in one go.Note that Perl’s memory handling is pretty inscrutable, and even undef generally won’t “free up” the memory to the system, but will free the memory for subsequent use by Perl. I’ve not examined the details of memory fragmentation in Perl, but I believe that defragmentation can occasionally be an issue. If you think this is the case and have huge hashes, it may be wise to clear out both keys and data. Also undefine variables in scope. Etc.Make sure your problem is the problem you think it is. Many a time I’ve stuffed up my code in some other way and blamed ‘inefficient memory management’ as a poorly tested and defective routine wreaks its havoc <wry grin>If after the above you’re still struggling, you may wish to go through all of the pain of carefully rewriting your code in another language like C.

I find it is often early-career designers who are thinking about themselves and the impact of their work (""their work"") -- they haven't quite figured out yet that design, while having aesthetic qualities and being something that can be elegant and beautiful -- isn't about them at all, or their artistic expression.  You should be an artist if you want to primarily play in this space and as a musician myself, I understand the innate need to express and create.  Unlike art (usually), UX design often involves many distinct individuals from different parts of an organization who may each contribute to the overall expression of a particular user experience. While your question is not about what the differences are between these two practices, I think this is an interesting point since the designer is not usually on the same pedestal than an artist may be.  Personally, as a designer, I love talking to [visual] artists, and usually if I do, apart from the specifics of their craft and portfolio, I am interested in some of the processes around things like the critiques used in art school.

Make sure that it is created in Photoshop Layers as this will help to select the right things at the right time without having to use the Photoshop slice tool.Build an eye catching website design that has all the elements like Header, Footer, Navigation Bar, Sidebar, etc. placed sequentially. Once you have a PSD website with all its essential components, you are ready to convert it to HTML. STEP 2 – KNOW YOUR TOOLS Converting a website design from PSD to HTML requires clear understanding and expertise in front end development. This encompasses, but is not limited to, HTML, CSS, JQuery and JavaScript. PSD to HTML conversion is not just about smattering HTML, adding a dash of CSS, and a bit of JavaScript for good measure. Converting modern web pages is critical and demands extensive knowledge of not just the markup language (HTML) and styling (CSS), but also the key features of a web page, including JQuery and JavaScript. Moreover, website design for mobiles and tablets is the call of the age and hence, those factors also need to be considered while translating a PSD design to HTML. STEP 3 – GETTING THE PSD FILES READY FOR CONVERSION Once you are ready with your PSD design and conversion tools, you will have to create a directory folder that will include /images directory for images and /jsdirectory for JavaScript. STEP 4 – START WITH SIMPLE STARTER LAYOUT To begin with building the HTML layout, it is important to analyze the design first by considering the Photoshop layout and identifying the sections that are unique. Some of the important components to consider are the background, header, slides, Service, Media, widget, Client, and footer. Pay attention when you name the id or class as these are the names that you will use to markup the HTML. Now, based on these, you create an HTML layout. STEP 5 – WORK ON EACH SECTION ELABORATELY TO MARK UP THE HTML Next, to mark up the HTML, you will have to focus more on individual sections like the Header, Slider, Service, Media, Background, Widget, Client, and Footer.

As your design can make all the difference. In this post, we’ll share web design principles that will increase your conversion rate. Many marketers harp on the importance of SEO, social media, creating lead magnets that convert and the like, yet having an excellent website design to start with is so often overlooked. While all of these components do matter, your web design isn’t just a “pretty face”: it can actually make or break your conversion rates. According to research from Stanford University, 46.1% of people say a website’s design is the top criteria for deciding if a company is credible or not. So it’s extremely important that your design looks professional. Whether or not your website is aesthetically pleasing also plays a big role in conversion rate optimization. Given 15 minutes to consume content, two-thirds of people would rather read something beautifully designed than something plain (according to this study by Adobe). So if you want people to read your blog posts, they need to look attractive. But that’s not all. If your website is unattractive, people will actually leave your site altogether. 38% of people, to be exact. That’s a whole lot of lost leads! So regardless of whether or not design is your forte, you can’t afford to overlook it. Learn web design, hire a freelancer, employ a designer, or do whatever it takes! To start with, here are a handful of important design principles that will give you an immediate and sustainable boost in conversions.",2021-03-06T08:44:50.709Z,"How do Web Design Companies increase conversion rate with optimization?

On mobile devices, important content should be arranged within the thumb zone (the reach of the finger mostly used while browsing on mobile devices).

USE BUYER REQUEST FEATURE Here is the place I've started, I saw that a lots of people are asking for help and I've just browsed through all the requests to find someone to work with. When you choose a buyer, be sure to show your best, this is the secret, not tell them something like, Hi, this is my gig, please order it and let's work! It's a huge turn off for buyers and you just show them that you're lazy enough and you just want to quickly take their money. Show that you are the right choice, choose your words carefully and show your interest in working with that person 3. DO 1000% ON YOUR FIRST ORDER If you got your first order, be sure to do 1000% on it. This is your door, the final feedback is the key to your Fiverr success. A low rate feedback on your first order it will harm your profile a lot! You just saw the competition here right? You don't want any feedback if it's not 5 stars. Of course, you will can't do 1000% on every orders that you will receive in the future, but be sure to walk in the Fiverr room with the right foot. You should always do your best in every order that you will get because a great feedback will bring you new customers and money, do it for the feedback and the money will come right to you when you don't even expect. 4. BE POLITE, RESPECT YOUR CUSTOMERS! You should always respect your customers, remember that they give you money, you won't be successful here if you don't respect your customers, who wants to work with an a**hole? You will meet here lots of people, some are nice and kind, some are the opposite, since you're still building your brand you would not want to upset any customer. You will gain more experience in meeting people and you will can choose in the future who you want to work with but for the moment, you're new and you need to please everyone, these people will make you rise you up. 5. STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF! If you know you don't deserve the money for the poor work you did, don't deliver it! you don't deserve the money and an awful feedback can pause your sales for weeks, is it worth it? Obviously not! I had an order from someone (I won't mention him) he asked me to do a few tasks, at firstly it seems very easy but in the fact I was not experienced enough to accomplish his order and I've had some problems with college and I should take care of them, so I choosed to refund the money because I knew that I won't be able to do a perfect job that I've promised him from the beginning. I did that and he was so kind and sent me 5$ for what I've started to do for him, I begged him to accept the work for free but he didn't wanted. This can happen to you too! Always do the right thing and you will be respected. 6. REWARD YOUR BUYERS WHEN YOU FEEL IT! (ALSO FOR BUYERS) When I say to give them a reward I am not referring to send them stolen stuff from the internet (like a lot of sellers actually do) despite the fact that is illegal you, the buyer, should not accept a stolen reward (books, guides, music albums, fonts etc from the torrents) as a buyer you should report this kind of behaviour directly to Fiverr. When a sellers gives you something and you're not sure they had the right to do it ask them for a license to prove they have full rights to resell what they've sent to you. If they can't, quickly report them. You, the seller, should only give rewards that you've created by yourself, write guides, design fonts etc so you will have the right to send it for free, don't steal other people work.

If what you mean is to engage in a conversation about UX design then I have a story for you. It is quite difficult to explain what we really do and there is no one way to explain it. The strategy that I apply is to customize my answer based on whom I am talking to (applying user centered design!). Coming back to the story: I used to pick up my dinner everyday from a food joint on my way back home from the studio. I had a good rapport with the staff and we used to discuss sports, politics etc. while my order used to get prepared. One day I was a bit late from the office and the server asked me what I do for living. Now, this fellow was from a small town and has received formal education till 10th grade (middle school) maximum. He was using a POS system at the food joint so he was familiar with digital interfaces. Me: I make websites, software and apps. (very simplified and generalized)Him: Oh okay He had a 'meh' look on his face which compelled me to explain more in detail what I really do. I had to find an example (context/scenario) that he might be familiar with to explain UX design. Me: Your food joint has an app to order food right?Him: Yes.Me: What do I first see when I open the app?Him: You can choose the outlet from where you can order food.Me: Right! But have you noticed that the app shows me the nearest outlet in bigger size and on top based on my location?Him: Yes.Me: Now that makes my life easy! I don't need to think about at which outlet should I place my order. So, that is what I do. I talk to people, understand their problems and figure out solutions that will make their life easier. He had a smile on his face when I explained it in this way. I am still not sure how much he understood from this but I hope he at least got the gist of it. 4",2021-03-06T08:56:00.490Z,"What would be some good ways for a UX designer to engage in a conversation with folks not very familiar with user experience design?

Have they acted upon it in any fashion beyond, perhaps, building a proof-of-concept vehicle that never left the confines of their R&D departments? Unlikely. And here’s why. There are many parts to the ICE vehicle’s powertrain and even general construction that stem from the fact that it uses internal combustion. There’s the gearbox, for example - a massive chunk of fairly complicated machinery that exists simply because IC engines have a very narrow efficient rpm range. There’s all the piping and machinery designed to store and pump the fuel. There’s the cooling and the electricity generation/storage. Most of these things would serve no purpose in an EV. I’m not even going to go into the whole bodywork thing. So while in theory, it would be possible, it’s not the most sound engineering choice. And, furthermore, it’s not a sound choice economically - such a vehicle would not be competitive in the least. That said, there is a sizable number of conversion kits, and shops that produce/install them. They are custom jobs, though, and priced accordingly. Most of them produce electric conversions of classic vehicles, or other cars dear to their owners. Besides, they do not make good EVs in the end, with low range, strange weight distribution, and subpar driving characteristics. Many even keep the manual gearbox, eliminating much of the benefit of an EV. So in theory, conversions are possible, they are just not feasible at scale. Yes and no.

I majored in English and now got my dream job as a UX/UI designer at Jongde. I’ve been through a tough period to get the job. Really feel like to share something useful that helps me became a UX/UI designer. Hope it brings you some inspiration too. UI/UX design, as the top spot in the top ten most influential IT skills, is very attractive for the layman and the novice designer both on job market prospects and salary. This is why so many people are eager to switch to be an interface designer or user experience designer. Somebody told me that you are also considering to change career. So you want to be a UX designer? Before you made the decision, I have some questions for you. How much knowledge do you know about user experience? Do you know how to become a user experience designer? Here is some experience summarized by predecessors in the user experience design industry for reference at first. 1. Do you know what a user experience designer does?  The terms of UX, UI, IA, and IxD are always complicated for layman or people who new to the design industry, so they cannot figure out what’s the difference between the terms. If you want to be a user experience designer, you have to know what is user experience, and what makes a good UX design. User experience (UX) refers to a person’s emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. 2. Are you passionate about UX design? Young people in the current era are flighty and impatient. So when you make a serious decision to become a user experience designer with no experience, it means that you have to learn a lot of knowledge in patience and immerse yourself in the design trends. So that to keep your enthusiasm of the design industry. The biggest secret to keep enthusiasm is keeping learning. 3. How much do you know about the principle of user experience? Have you read any design book?  It’s much better that you have some basic knowledge about the user experience design principle. But if you have no any basic knowledge, you may need to get an improvement on this. Because it’s very necessary to master the background information to be a good UX designer. Here is a full list of UI/UX design books. The Design of Everyday Things — Donald A. Norman Don’t Make Me Think — Steve Krug The Non-Designer’s Design Book — Robin Williams The Elements of User Experience — Jesse James Garrett 4. Do you know which tool the UX designer use? The empty theory is useless to make you earn for living. What the leaders and customers will like and more prefer to see is the real design, rather than the oral presentation about the design. The most practical method to present the demo to your leader and customer is showing the design draft to them directly. It’s the most intuitive way to tell your design ideas and the logic of the page and components. Learning the principles, and practicing the design tools, that’s the best way to save your time. What are the best mockup & wireframing design tools & Apps for UI/UX designers? Here are some. Invision — Design better, faster, together. Mockplus — Prototype faster, smarter, easier. Axure — Design the right solution. Justinmind — All-in-one prototyping tool for web and mobile apps. Uxpin — The full-stack UX design platform. 5. Where to find the inspiration for design? In addition to the principle and design tools, the other key element is the inspiration. The predecessors also summarized some UI/UX design inspiration websitescovered pictures, icons, and fonts, as well as the famous community like Behance and Dribbble. 6. Do you have a design portfolio that packs a punch?  Beat the competition–Marc Anderson reveals how to make your portfolio stand out from the crowd. 7. Where should you apply for your first job/internship? The first job/internship is a good chance to learn and improve yourself. So if you make up your mind to be a user experience designer, try to land your first job as a UX designer in a big company such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and LinkedIn. They have a well-operated department for design. You will get a big improvement on how to become a user experience. Moreover, you can also get the chance to be involved in the design process and solving problems. You know, there are many great designers in these great companies. All in all, you have to make yourself become valuable, that’s the primary purpose to get a job/internship in the big companies. 8. Find a place where you can talk to and learn form experienced designers. I highly recommended the Official Slack group of Mockplus. The Official Slack group has a great members of UX/UI designers, Product managers and Developers with more than thousands of messages communicating with each other. The admins are always online and can solve your problems in minutes if you have any. You can learn about design and get design inspirations and resources in this group. What’s more, this group offers many benefits to its members only. For example, Mockplus Black Friday 2017 is here for you now! Join Mockplus Official Slack group and the admin will offer you 40% off coupons and free UI Kits & Fonts Package. This time-limited offer is valid for all packages and runs until 31st November, saving at least 80 bucks off the regular price. Besides, you will get life-time free tech support on Mockplus even if you are not a paid user now. You may try out the Mockplus Black Friday 2017! Conclusion After reading these questions about user experience, I believe you have a better understanding on how to become a user experience designer. If your choice is “Yes, I do”, you also should realize that there is nothing “right” or “the best” way to be a designer in a short while. So, what’s idea on your mind? So, you see, it may be difficult, but you can, just find a way to follow.",2021-03-06T09:05:56.259Z,"How does the UX design improve the conversion rate of the business? ",Quora

That's how I have been learning English, for the past two years. I've given some tips on how I do this: - Listen to podcasts in English. Here, you'll have to choose which accent you want to have. If you want to have a British accent, then the audio resources offered by the BBC Learning English website (and other British-English websites) will help you. There are also good programs in which you can find podcasts: iTunes is an example. Download iTunes and search the internet for something like 'best itunes podcasts' and try finding sites that offer good podcasts on iTunes. There are plenty of them, and, if your level of English is at least intermediate (B1 or B2), then you are going to understand what they are saying, but you're not going to understand everything (and that's perfectly normal). If your level of English is advanced (C1 or C2), then you're going to understand most of what they're saying. Listening is a very important skill, and it will help your speaking skills, too, because by listening, you will learn the correct pronunciation of words. - Listen to radio in English. Once you have chosen your accent, try finding radio stations from a country in which the accent you chose is spoken. For instance, if you like the American accent most, then try radio stations such as WNYC Radio and others. Even if you can't understand what they're saying, keep listening. The more you listen, the more acquainted with English sounds you will become. But, before moving on to radio stations, you should spend some time listening to podcasts in English (if possible, listen to them with transcripts). Listening to podcasts while looking at the transcrips will give you a notion of English pronunciation and will prepare you to listen without any transcripts. This will take time (at least three months), but it will pay off.  Remember: try finding stations from countries in which the accent you want to have is spoken. - Read texts in English aloud. If you have a good knowledge of pronunciation and listening, try reading texts aloud. Choose texts from your English-learning books, or magazines and news sites, such as National Geographic and CNN. To avoid getting frustrated or finding the texts too hard to read, try reading texts that are easy to you, texts that are about something you like, something you're interested in. Also, don't speak too fast when you are reading, because sometimes you will end up mispronouncing some words or confusing them with similar words (this has happened to me countless times). Speak slowly! - Visit places in your city, town or region which are frequented by native speakers. This will help you find good opportunities to engage in real conversations. If you are shy or do not know how to start a conversation, just say something like 'hello!' or ask a question such as 'What country do you come from?', and explain them why you're talking to them (say that you're doing it because you learn English and would like to engage in real conversations). Also, you will have good people to help you correct grammatical or pronunciation mistakes. - Download books about English grammar. If you know the title of a good book on this subject, such as 'English Grammar in Use', then just type its title followed by 'pdf' into a search engine like Google. The search could be like this: 'English grammar in use pdf'. You will find some PDF documents in the search results. Open the right files and download them. - Make English a part of your life. You can do this by changing the language of your electronic devices into English, for example. You can also start searching things on the Internet only in English (for instance, if you want information on how to make a cake, then search 'how to make a cake', in English). This will require an intermediate level, because you will encounter a lot of words you do not know, if you're a beginner. Now, most of my web searches are done in English, and most of my knowledge on important subjects are also obtained through English-language websites. ;-) - Start writing a blog in English. If your level is upper-intermediate (B2), then you can start writing a blog about a subject you like or that interests you. Try using the new words you learn in the posts of that blog, and this will help you memorize them and it will be hard to forget them. In short, use the internet and its resources a lot to learn English! I hope this helps. It's called self-study. That's how I have been learning English, for the past two years.

Videos are interactive media forms than that of static content or other media files. When you create engaging videos, you can share your story precisely in a way you want others to perceive it. Ecommerce businesses can leverage the power of videos from the marketing perspective as well as to improve direct conversion. You can give a better understanding of the product by sharing a 360-degree product view. In online shopping, if the customer gets the experience of checking the product thoroughly before actually purchasing it, it can raise their trust in your brand. In this way, a total view of the product can improve the conversion rate of your store up to a great extent. These small product videos can be added to your product listings when you are updating your catalog, thus helps directly in bringing direct conversion to your store. From the marketing perspective, you can use any of these below video forms: Product demo: If you are establishing an ecommerce platform, you are selling ecommerce software/platform as a service. In such a case, you create the product demos to share a glimpse of the features your software is offering. This will excite the viewers and other businesses to connect with you and attain their business goals.Brand videos: Every brand has a specific story of evolution. If you share the story of your brand and the ways you tried to attain your goals, it builds a connection between your customers and the business. They may or may not convert, but they will surely be a lot more inspired to link with you in one or the other way. Your story can be a source of inspiration to some other business, or it can motivate an individual to be a part of your team. A brand video holds a lot of power, and you can make a lot out of it. You can try making the explainer videos to share your story. It’s the right time to draft your story and talk with others about your entrepreneurial journey.How-to videos & tutorials: If you are a manufacturer, you can share the how-to and DIY videos on your social handles to bring traffic on your Youtube channel. Those viewers who are interested in buying that product can navigate to your ecommerce store from the link shared in the description box. In this way, you can build connectivity, increase brand awareness, and improve the conversion of your store. You can get a powerful backlink to your store because of sharing the videos on a more reliable and trusted platform.Conduct live sessions: Live sessions made it is a lot easier way to connect with your business followers. The advent of social media enables every brand to make its social presence. You can grow your network with seller groups as well as by building a community. Even if you share the posts regularly to your social handles, it is not that interactive. By conducting the live video sessions, you can build connectivity between your business and your followers. When people start interacting with you, they will begin taking more interest in your products; in turn, they will observe an increase in your sales.Webinars: Webinars are again one of the finest ways to improve the product knowledge of your customers. When you are selling ecommerce relating products or software, you can share webinars that can help your customers. You can conduct the webinars based on the news features that you are adding to now and then. This way, you can keep your customers as well as viewers updated about your products.Share review videos: A customer believes in other customers more than the brand. So, that’s an obvious thing that your customers will check the reviews of your products. You can ask the views of your customers about your products and share those videos on your social handles.

Before going into wind power MPPT lets see what a wind turbine mechanical characteristics look like [1]:  It can be understood that if for a fixed wind speed (Vw1, Vw2 etc.) there is only one optimum turbine speed which gives maximum power output. Hence if this speed can be tracked the power generation will happen at maximum power. This can be done using the magical perturb and observe technique as shown in the following image [2]:  The idea of this algorithm is to keep increasing the turbine speed if the change in power is positive. If the change of power is negative, that means you had reached the peak now you are descending from it. This means you have to reduce the wind speed to go back to the peak. In this algorithm, the wind speed oscillates near the maximum power point of the peak of the power vs speed curve. The following image shows how a wind turbine speed control block diagram looks like [2]:  Hope this helps. I have taken the images from the following references: [1] A review of conventional and advanced MPPT algorithms for wind energy systems [2] http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/16255/intech-mppt_control_methods_in_wind_energy_conversion_systems.pdf 1",2021-03-06T09:26:37.239Z,"How can I design an MPPT system for a wind power conversion system?

If it’s talking, then you’d have a reasonable idea from the voice; which offers a greater variety of tonal nuances when it’s an actual human talking. Asking questions like ‘how much do you like coffee?’ or ‘how do you feel about underaged sex?’ are good contenders for gauging tonal nuances that stem from emotional reactions. If the AI satisfies this enough for you to be unsure (or is using writing as a medium), you should ask a strange, silly, or nonsensical question. These are often easy for humans to identify and reason through, but AI aren’t as capable of making the same logical connections. As examples: Why do we consider an alarm as going off when it’s actually turning on?If quizzes are quizzical, what are tests?Why isn’t there a mouse-flavored cat food?How would we know if a word was misspelled in the dictionary?An AI would resort to scanning a database of word connections, attempt to connect topics and apply meaning and intend behind the question, then strive to discern a suitable response. It’s unlikely that an AI would be overly conscious of the less overt theme behind the above questions. There’s a socially accepted phrase at play that is at odds with the definitions of those words when they’re considered in isolation. Humans can readily recognise that the word ‘off’ needs to be combined with the preceding word ‘going’ to reach the (otherwise) abstract meaning of that phrase. AI may be less successful at recognising the term ‘going off’ as being something other than ‘turning off’.Humans are better able to perceive the humorous word game at play. A poor quality AI may disregard the first half of this question, and simply give a definition of a test. A moderate AI may attempt to describe the differences between a quiz and a test. A superior AI may find the differences between a quiz and the word quizzical, and attempt to find similar differences between a test and ‘something else’. Importantly, the correct answer here isn’t ‘testicle’… it’s laughter; which would be very difficult for an AI to recognise and provide as a response.The distinction here relates to the emotional response a human is likely to have. We find the idea entertaining or delightful.. why not give a cat mouse-flavoured food, or a dog cat-flavoured food..? We’re not really interested in the ethics, health standards, and marketing barriers that an AI would likely provide as answers. The question is designed to spark an emotional response rather than obtain a logical answer.This is a catch-22 that creates something of a recursion error for an AI system. Logically, if a word is in the dictionary, the way it is written becomes the correct spelling. But an AI system would attempt to discover how a misspelled word would be identified despite any incorrectly spelled word immediately turning into the correct spelling. It creates an infinity loop that humans can intuitively identify and pull away from; allowing us to appreciate why the question is nonsensical and thus humorous.Identifying an AI system is reasonably easy.. at the moment at least. In time, we’ll see AI breach many of these barriers and make it virtually impossible to discern human from artificial entity; and I say ‘entity’ deliberately, because at this stage, they would have legitimate personalities and may even be considered to be self aware / conscious. The real distinction is whether the process is scripted or designed in a way that facilitates/generates self awareness.",2021-03-06T09:29:47.066Z,"What are you some resources about designing chat bot conversations?

The user sees a whole lot more value in a domain name than in an actual website. WordPress, Weebly, and Wix know that and that’s how they get clients. In reality they are selling domain names. But their marketing is well disguised as website builders. The honest truth looks closer to this “register your domain name with us and you get to choose from our selection of free templates. If you want a good design, pay an extra $50.” That type of marketing is very appealing to that one client looking to save time and money who doesn’t understand anything about content marketing, SEO, and Web Analytics. “You mean I can have a domain name and a website design right now for just $30/month? Sign me up!” So what’s dying is not really web design, but how people perceive web design. We live in an area where everything someone wants to know about anything is just one google search away. We live in times of “DIY”. So how do you convince people that custom design is better? You can try, but I’d suggest not to go that route. It’s a lost battle from the get. If you need to convince them, they are probably not the kind of client you want anyway. But if you really want to try, well, you can convince them by offering them more than just a custom design. Offer them a lot of value that justifies your cost. Also, let’s not forget that there is a huge communication gap between web developers, clients, and shareholders. It is as if we all speak a different language. And in a world where people use emojis to communicate more than they type actual words, a 10 buck template that doesn’t talk to you about SEO, Adwords, adding features, Web Analytics, ROI, etc., is way more appealing to the average guy than an actual human being that will make you feel stupid, even if that’s not your intentions. You see, you can use the most simplified language to make your client understand that what you’re selling is more than a custom design, that it is a tool that will help them attract more clientele and generate returns on investment, but, for the most part, you’ve already lost your prospects at “Hi I’m a tech consultant and a web developer” -> Gone. Good clients won't need convincing. They already know your value. But even then we need to offer them more than just a custom design… I don’t charge an upfront cost and host all my clients domain names for free in exchange for a monthly maintenance fee. I also sell graphic design services and send them brand new spanking business cards when they first sign up. Do you see that there is already more value in that proposition? Offer more value.

Any individual who has utilized an over-the-counter bug spray against cockroaches realizes that it takes an extensive measure of the toxic substance to slaughter one single bug, and cockroach pests are developing to turn out to be more impervious to customary bug sprays. This is particularly the situation with regards to the most well-known indoor bug, the German cockroach. Normally, numerous buyers are interested to know whether insects are killed subsequent to being sucked into a vacuum, and if cockroaches are not killed in this way, can the pest escape from a vacuum cleaner bag just to restore a shelter indoor? However, not only cockroaches are able to keep on living inside a vacuum, yet the eggs of a female cockroach can also endure and form into grown-ups before escaping away from a vacuum cleaner bag. In any case, if bugs are sucked into a vacuum cleaner bag, the bag ought to be promptly evacuated and set out in the sun or in freezing cold conditions to ensure that the bugs are killed completely. Essentially throwing the insect plagued bag into an outside dumpster is additionally an alternative. Hence, vacuum cleaner will not completely kill the cockroaches but will ensure that there is not escape for the insect to run away. It will be continue to stuck inside the vacuum bag until and unless there is an escape way. Therefore, it is highly suggested to hire a professional cleaning team to remove or clean cockroaches completely from home or office area.

Chris Goward There are generally three pricing models I’ve seen for conversion optimization agency services. Each has pros and cons.  1. Hourly project modelThis is a traditional agency approach, where the client pays for each hour of the agency’s service. Most lawyers and big ad agencies charge this way and many CRO agencies use this traditional model. The benefit here is you only pay for the hours of work the agency applies to your work. Most companies are familiar and comfortable with this type of arrangement.  The downside is that there’s no incentive alignment.

Hourly project modelThis is a traditional agency approach, where the client pays for each hour of the agency’s service. Most lawyers and big ad agencies charge this way and many CRO agencies use this traditional model. The benefit here is you only pay for the hours of work the agency applies to your work. Most companies are familiar and comfortable with this type of arrangement.  The downside is that there’s no incentive alignment. The agency is not incentivized to work efficiently and may, even unintentionally, add unproductive hours to the work. The incentives are least aligned in this model.  2. Monthly subscription retainer modelThis model may give the agency more flexibility in choosing the activities that are likely to give results rather than just those that spend more time. However, some agencies still justify the retainer amount by allocating hours against the monthly fee. Although that makes the accountants happy, it is counter-productive to aligning incentives.  This model works best when the agency is goal-oriented and agrees with the client on the goals to be achieved with the retainer. A long-term subscription allows the agency to take a strategic view of the engagement and work in partnership with the client.  3. Variable incentive modelAdding a variable incentive to the subscription increases the goal-alignment even more. The upside is that the agency clearly is incentivized monetarily to achieve specific goals to win their variable bonuses. The downside is that, if the agency does their job and achieves their goals, the client will end up paying more than in a defined monthly subscription. It’s more expensive, but also more directly aligned. Keep in mind, however, that money is not the only way to align incentives. As Dan Pink described in his book, Drive, monetary performance incentives are often not necessary and can sometimes be counter-productive. Use them wisely.  WiderFunnel (WiderFunnel Marketing Optimization Agency | Conversion Optimization), for example, uses a monthly subscription retainer for all clients, sometimes with a variable incentive component added but always with clear profit lift and ROI goals.",2021-03-06T09:46:33.864Z,"How does conversion rate optimization apply to careers outside of web design and copy editing?

Rather, target marketing allows you to focus your marketing dollars and brand message on a specific market that is more likely to buy from you than other markets. This is a much more affordable, efficient, and effective way to reach potential clients and generate business.  With a clearly defined target audience, it is much easier to determine where and how to market your company. Here are some tips to help you define your target market. Look at your current customer baseCheck out your competitionAnalyze your product/serviceChoose specific demographics to targetConsider the psychographics of your targetEvaluate your decision Don't break down your target too far! Remember, you can have more than one niche market. Consider if your marketing message should be different for each niche. If you can reach both niches effectively with the same message, then maybe you have broken down your market too far. Also, if you find there are only 50 people that fit all of your criteria, maybe you should reevaluate your target. The trick is to find that perfect balance.  You may be asking, ""How do I find all this information?"" Try searching online for research others have done on your target. Search for magazine articles and blogs that talk about or to your target market. Search for blogs and forums where people in your target market communicate their opinions. Look for survey results, or consider conducting a survey of your own. Ask your current customers for feedback.  Defining your target market is the hard part. Once you know who you are targeting, it is much easier to figure out which media you can use to reach them and what marketing messages will resonate with them. Instead of sending direct mail to everyone in your ZIP code, you can send it only to those who fit your criteria. Save money and get a better return on investment by defining your target audience.

Create your own Marketing/ Landing pages with PROFIT BUILDER in just few clicks drag and Drop. Definitely a ""NO BRAINER"" Webpage: https://jvz1.com/c/1638145/101562 YouTube:  The greeting page is straightforward site pages where guests are diverted at whatever point they click an outcome in a hunt or when they click a notice. Landing pages in member promoting are where a merchant would need a client or guest to be coordinated in the wake of clicking a notice of an associate site. Presentation pages frequently don't contrast that much from different pages of a site. Some online business visionaries utilize the landing page of their locales as points of arrival. Is this a decent practice? Would it be advisable for you to likewise think about creation points of arrival for the ad? Truly, you can utilize what other online business people do as a guide, guiding possible clients to the landing page of their locales. In any case, on the off chance that you need to get more from your online endeavours, and you need to get more cash-flow, making a presentation page for your web ad is a decent extra strategy. It would take a shot at your preferred position in the event that you make an exceptional page than having none. Reason #1: It is the main way you bring in cash in offshoot promoting through transformations. There are a great deal of partner advertising programs yet the greater part of them let the vendors pay the offshoot in compensation for each snap framework. What happens is, you join on a program at that point present your promotion. The proprietor of the program will at that point give your ad to associates to put it on their destinations. At that point, if a guest clicks your promotion they will be taken to your arrival website page and you pay the partner for the snap. As a dealer, you can bring in cash in associate promoting through changes, which implies when somebody purchases your item after the guests get coordinated to your site. More guests that the member direct to your presentation pages additionally implies greater expenses as well. So no changes imply no cash earned. Doubtlessly, you won't get any change in the event that you have distributed a promotion on your partner advertiser's site without a genuine point of arrival for the planned customer to be rerouted into. It's much the same as the advancement of a thing without really having a shop to offer your thing. Your advertising might be sufficiently appealing to convince people to purchase a thing, however without the page, in what manner will they realize how to purchase the thing? It is of most extreme significance to have a landing website page for your advertisements since it is the main path for you to produce benefits in member programs. Without landing website pages, everything you do is put away money spending it to take care of your members without really getting anything. Reason #2; Some website pages are not enough. Many people make the blunder of making their webpage's landing page as the point of arrival for their promotions. The equivalent is genuine for the individuals who utilize different site pages like a ""get in touch with us"" site page or the item page. Home pages are frequently evolved to give to a few clients and have a lot of hyperlinks to different pages or to different locales. On the off chance that you need to be compelling in an offshoot framework, we're certain that you don't need your arrival website pages to give the requirements of uninterested people, which may not be truly interested with your thing. When choosing greeting pages, you should consistently have the customer rerouted into that arrival page you thought of. Along these lines, your arrival website page must be proper to the search queries, the material and substance you had put on your promotion. It is likewise crucial the presentation page can lure your crowd to accomplish something-that is to purchase your item or if nothing else produce leads as possible customers. Last Thought You most likely joined a partner program with these variables. To financial plan your capital on advancement costs and to get more cash-flow. In any case, in the event that you joined a subsidiary program without really having an arrival website page, you'll wind up spending a lot without getting back income. So in the event that you despite everything don't have a greeting page for your advertisements, you better create one at this point. Also, ensure you make an extraordinary one. More guests that the associate director to your greeting pages additionally implies greater expenses as well. So no changes imply no cash earned.

Not at all - just get the ""Genesis"" DLC, which is a 15 minute interactive ""visual novel"" that recaps the whole story. To reach the golden path? Definitely. If you don't play Mass Effect 1 in a completionist way, certain events default to sub-optimal resolution, which then means that in Mass Effect 2 and 3, you will be ""robbed"" of the potential consequences of their optimal resolutions.Example: In Mass Effect 1, there is a massive mission on the planet Virmire. During this mission, if you play well, you can prevent the death of a certain NPC. If you do so, then you will meet that NPC in Mass Effect 3 (!) and he will survive even then. If you DON'T save him in Mass Effect 1, then he is considered KIA, is replaced by a stand-in character in ME3, but this character dies in ME3. And no - you cannot simulate the perfect playthrough with the Genesis DLC. Genesis is also available for Mass Effect 3, where it lets you recap the story of ME1 and ME2, again making the decisions. And again, no matter what choices you make, you will be left in a significantly sub-optimal situation as compared to ""the golden path"" possible if you play ME1 and ME2 thoroughly.Example: Perfect playthrough of ME2 means that you recruit everyone, earn their loyalty, upgrade your ship to maximum specs, and only after that trigger the final portion of the game. As a consequence, when ""THE TWIST"" happens, you are immediately ready to start the SUICIDE MISSION, thus making sure that EVERYBODY SURVIVES. Unfortunately, the Genesis II gives you the question ""Launch suicide mission immediately, or keep working on your crew and upgrades?"", with the first option resulting in death(s) of your squad members (some), while the other resulting in death(s) of the ship crew. Again, this then has consequences for ME3, as you won't meet as many faces as you could. Possible workarounds:1) Download a save pack - good souls have posted online save files of perfect playthroughs of ME1/ME2, so you just download this, put it in the correct folder, and you're good to go (appearance can be changed at the beginning of the import, don't worry).2) Start a new character, save the game, then use a Save Editor for Mass Effect 2, and by simple clicking/toggling of flags in the save file, you can construct any sort of history (results) in ME1. The problem with Mass Effect 1 is that it's an old game with somewhat clunky controls, unpolished gameplay mechanics etc., so modern players can be put off by it. It's even worse if you started with ME2/ME3 and then go back to ME1, which looks dated. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T10:00:08.511Z,"Do I need to play Mass Effect 1 to understand Mass Effect 2?

I was doing curls when he appeared like a dancer taking the stage, positioning himself in the limelight, preparing to hog approval. A little voice in my head said, ‘Oh Christ, here comes tedium’ and that voice got louder with every move he made. I dodged eye contact as best I could, concentrated on my form and turned up the volume on my iPod, listening, somewhat ironically, to Robert Knight’s impassioned plea: ‘Open up your eyes, then you’ll realize, here I stand with my Everlasting love!’ ... Ah, youth. He glared indignantly from his self imposed prison: how dare I make him want me? And anyway, why not get a jump on being pissy over the rejection that his pissy behavior was sure to guarantee? When I met his eyes, he shifted his head with a haughty flick, then looked back and waited for me to do something. I opted for bench presses: my face would be aimed at the ceiling and he’d be good as gone. Unbelievably, his head appeared above my supine body like a demonic moon. He gave me a knowing look, scowled, then disappeared. Nothing much of note happened after that, but he was there for all of it. Month after month he entered the spaces I was working out in and just hung around. He placed his body in my direct gaze then ignored me, or tossed me a glance like a hand grenade aimed at a foxhole. He had loud, theatrical conversations designed to be overheard then would tsk tsk at his phone, mumble some disparaging remark, then stare at me like I had knifed his cat. And I understand him, at least I think I do. Desire hurts, and few of us get what we want. Night can tighten like a rack, and after a couple decades the dream of having someone there with you seems so naive that you’re embarrassed you ever had it. So you choose a guy, or maybe your cock does. Then you aim and fire. “Real love will last forever, real love will last forever...” If it would have helped, I’d have walked right up to him and said, “Look, I’m not all that. I’m broke and self-indulgent and crammed with neuroses. My head is filled with men I want just as badly as you want me, and when four in the morning slinks in I’ve got a collection of failures that slink in with it. In short, I’m a romantic at the end of his run, just like you are. So drop the shit, give me a civil nod of recognition and let’s get on with our respective days.” But he was different—he was out for blood.

Go walk around, or drink a cup of water, or use the bathroom, or stretch a little bit. Then decide what you're going to work on next and do another Pomodoro.After about four Pomodoros cycles (with 5 minute breaks in between each), you should take a longer break of 20 minutes or so. The goal will be to hit a certain number of Pomodoros in a day, like 8 or so, and then hit that number again or more the next day. If you get really distracted during a Pomodoro (like you end up spending a few minutes on Facebook) then the Pomodoro doesn't count and you have to start over. This technique accomplishes a few things: It gives you an accepted relaxation / bucket time. Then you don't feel bad taking a break. In fact, studies show that breaks are important for optimal learning and focus. If you don't take breaks, you might not be as productive as you could be.It lets you recalibrate what you're working on every 25 minutes. I know that for me I often get unproductive when I'm working on the same thing for a long-time because I start focusing on stuff that isn't important but tricking myself into thinking its super important. (Have you ever found yourself spending more than 15 minutes agonizing over the formatting of a powerpoint slide?) The more often you step back and check in with the self, the more you'll feel like you actually worked on the tasks that you were supposed to.It provides a small, but reasonable challenge for you to maintain focus. You can defer distractions to a time that is at most 25 minutes away.It sets a personal challenge for yourself. By quantifying how many Pomodoros you've accomplished during the day, you'll naturally feel a desire to at least match that never the next day.You feel better at the end of the day. Most of us spend way too much time hunched at our desk and then we feel like shit at the end of the day. It's usually because we haven't been physically active, we didn't drink enough water, or stretch enough throughout the day. These 5 minute breaks are perfect for that. I find that at the end of a day when I practice pomodoros, I usually feel awesome.So how can you get started? Well it's as simple as getting a timer, a piece of paper, and a pen, really. But there are a few things I'd recommend: There's an app for that. Pomodoro Timer for the iPhone is a good one. There are a lot of fancy apps out there that track all your Pomodoros and are adjustable and whatnot, but this app does all I really want. It vibrates when your 25 minutes are up, and lets you pick whether you want to take a short or a long break when that's done. (My friend Jon notes that there's a cool desktop alternative called E.gg Timer, which has a pomodoro option at this url: Timer - E.ggTimer.com)Get a notebook, a day calendar, or even just a post-it at your desk to track your Pomodoros.

There are miles and miles of content that have been written about content marketing strategy. I believe there is just too much of “me-too” content out there, so before you decide to create anything, ask yourself two questions: Do we have a unique perspective to add to this conversation?Is the content quality good enough? Are we satisfying the curiosity of the sophisticated reader?Moreover, there are certain places where you should not look for content, one of them is Google Search. Interviewing your prospects can be a valuable tactic to use when searching for content ideas. Most teams overlook the following aspects of effective content strategy: Mistake #1 — Content strategy is only for the marketing team While it is essential that marketing should own content strategy, it’s also critical to involve the whole company and especially sales and customer success to your content strategy and content creation process. Sales reps are hearing the same or similar objections during the sales process and over time they understand how one message can be more effective than other. Customer success teams frequently receive the same questions from multiple customers, so why can’t this information be used in content creation. One of the most underrated and, at the same time, the most effective ways for company to create high performing content is to use internal customer usage data. If you sell a solution for outbound email automation, dig into your internal data and share data about average response rates, best days to send emails, how many emails it takes to receive a reply, how many steps the average outbound sequence takes, and so on. Your customers will love this and your competitors can’t easily replicate it. Mistake #2 — Not creating a clear positioning and story The way you position your company and product will drive your content strategy: what topics to write about, what voice to use, what terms and definitions to include in your content writing. Check out a few examples ofhow top tech companies position themselves to increase brand awareness and recognition. Mistake #3 — Starting with content before creating target customer profiles Conventional preaching to start with your target customer profiles is one of the very few approaches to content that the majority of marketers get right. Creating target customer profiles is not just about knowing your customer but also about understanding their goals, daily activities, problems, and values. Using target customer profiles, marketing teams can create an effective value messaging map that will act as a cheatsheet for your team. Mistake #4 — Focusing too much on awareness content and not enough on educational If someone says that their content marketing isn’t working, you can be 80% sure that the reason is too much focus on awareness content and not enough truly educational content is developed. High quality educational content is difficult to create, it requires deep industry knowledge. Often marketing does not possess this knowledge and processes aren’t yet built that allows marketing easy and frequent interaction with teams that have this industry knowledge. Since content marketing is usually only a priority for the marketing team, companies should consider incentivising people to collaborate with marketing on content creation and make this part of the scheduled responsibility. Mistake #5 — Not taking content distribution seriously Ensure that your team has a content distribution plan. It is not enough to post something on your website, share it on social media, and include it to your next newsletter. Build a simple content distribution plan that will stretch over 7–14 calendar days. I have discussed this topic in a separate article — How To Improve Your Content Distribution Strategy. Mistake #6 — Giving up too quickly There is enough said about companies that give up on content too soon or those that do content marketing just because everybody is doing it and they have to do something. Questions to ask: How to measure content effectiveness? What metrics to track? Some companies fall into the trap of thinking that content marketing strategy is something that only the marketing team needs to worry about. Managers fail to understand that we are moving toward a future where enterprise sales and selling are more about customer education and consulting than anything else. With tons of new hot trends in marketing we forget that product positioning and story drives content strategy that builds strong brands. We often forget that it’s less about demographics and more about a customer’s values that drive buying decisions. Quality and not quantity of content is what matters. Even the most amazing content needs to be seeded across multiple resources so that it reaches the influencers that can help it go viral. I recently wrote a detailed article - How To Track Customer Acquisition - where I discussed the biggest mistakes people make with content marketing. There are miles and miles of content that have been written about content marketing strategy. I believe there is just too much of “me-too” content out there, so before you decide to create anything, ask yourself two questions: Do we have a unique perspective to add to this conversation?Is the content quality good enough? Are we satisfying the curiosity of the sophisticated reader?Moreover, there are certain places where you should not look for conte Continue Reading",2021-03-06T10:04:18.433Z,"What are some of the biggest mistakes people make with content marketing?

It’s a collection of bots built by some of the biggest brands just to show you there is no end to how creative you can be. This is a GIANT opportunity for you to get a leg up on the competition… …but how do you create one? Chatbots for Business To put this into perspective (for those who are unfamiliar), you have an email list right? Think about email. Email lists. Email marketing. The Whole shebang! Now. Imagine you live in a world where you KNOW your message will land safely in your target's inbox AND you know they’ll see it. Wouldn’t that be amazing? I know some of you would give up a kidney for that!! On top of all that, imagine it lands safely in their inbox and they see it… …next, let’s say you are in the lead generation business, you need consistent leads to survive. You know how much time and energy it takes not only taking that new lead and pre-qualifying it, but also following up (time, and time again), to REALLY qualify them. To make sure they are exactly what you are looking for. What if I told you, you can ALSO do this with a laser-focused chatbot? I know… you’re skeptical… And that’s to be expected. How Influencer Press Made $10k off one client with a simple Chatbot Here is an example of a chatbot that works amazingly and continues to run solid... Founder of Influencer Press, Ulyses Osuna, created a baller chatbot that brought him in over $10,000!! Ulyses found that he could cut out so much unneeded time and energy trying to qualify clients by simply having a bot created that did this for him. He knew his buyers.He understood how to qualify them.And most important of all, he created it in such a way, that it gave the feel of an actual conversation!!Check Ulyses' bot & get the Case Study Message Influencer Press on Facebook Click the Button above and type ""Get Started"" in messenger. Okay, Sam… that's cool and all... but how the hell do I put something like this together? Glad you asked ! As everything goes in the world of business and, especially, in the world of marketing we must first know who our target audience is… AND REALLY KNOW THEM. Know Who The Hell You Are Targeting!! What kind of weirdos are they??  Creating a Buyer Persona is step one. Ever heard the term, “Back to the drawing board”? This is the epitome of that sentence in regards to business. If you don’t know who your customers are, how the hell are you going to get your message in front of them? How are you going to solve their problems? And don’t be “That” guy who says, “Oh, well I know who it is I’m targeting”… …take the damn time and actually do the exercise (you can thank me later). There are a few different templates you can use, from some very reputable sources: Hubspot Persona TemplatesOptinMonster Buyer Persona TemplateDigital Marketer Customer Avatar WorksheetHootSuite Buyer Persona’s w/Social Media DataSprague Media FB Specific Persona & Targeting WorksheetOur persona worksheet has been created by us, specifically for the work we do on Facebook for our clients… SOit looks a little different but may be exactly what you need. The premise for creating these personas is to not only understand who it is you are targeting but what message and offer to put in front of them, that they will actually NEED. Knowing their pain points can help you speak their language and hook them with the benefits of the solution you are offering! Figuring Out The Solution To find the perfect solution to a problem, you must first - KNOW THE PROBLEM!! You KNOW your audience. Now you must KNOW their problems. There are many technics for figuring this out… In fact, you may already have the solution, but if you don’t - here is a simple technique to figure this out. You just went through the whole process of figuring out your audience (assuming you did this), so now think back to your audience… Your buyer's persona. Bust out a pen and paper (or type your ass off) and put yourself in their shoes. Think about every aspect of their day… Do they have trouble waking up in the morning? Fixing breakfast for their kids before screeching off to work? Do they have a problem with eating healthy? Or even getting the right amount of time to consume a meal? Does their car malfunction a lot? Do they have a car or have to take the bus? What is their mode of transportation? At work, do they get bombarded with calls all day from telemarketers, vendors, clients, etc, who all want something from them? Do they have trouble getting home on time, picking the kids up from school, or making a decent dinner? Are you getting the gist of this? Now… …go through your list and start crossing off everything you cannot help with. For instance, if you sell supplements, you may have to focus on the aspects of their life that involve eating or feeding their children. If you sell software B2B, then focus on the problems they go through while at the office and what red-tape they have to run through to get anything done! And if for whatever reason you get lost in this exercise, call one of your previous clients (preferably one of the ones you liked working with) and ask them what it was that made them choose you. Or you can even link up with SurveyMonkey and create a survey to go out to your past clients. You really don’t need that many people to survey, as long as you ask the right questions. And with SurveyMonkey, their Basic plan gives you 100 free responses (surveys). Any way you slice it, you NEED to know how you will be helping them AND what is in it for them, because at the end of the day this is all they care about. And oddly enough, sometimes that means you are going to need to talk to your customers directly (...I know, contrary to what I am talking about right?). Of course, that also means they can lead to awesome relationships... This is a major reason why you’ll want to choose the right software to help stay connected to the user. Pick The Right Software There are many different chatbot builders out there. It’s important to understand them and know which one is right for you Now, there are many different kinds and versions of chatbot’s out there. Here's are four to choose from: ManyChatChatfuelAPI.aiBotsifyMobileMonkey (One of my favorites, specifically for Marketers, created by Larry Kim)However, we want to focus on the two popular ones right not... ManyChat and ChatFuel. Why these two? For a few reasons, but all-in-all you want a company that not only understands what the user wants (and have a decent UI) but also have growth enough, to change with the times and upgrade its program as we roll into the next few years. Now I am not going to break down the difference between these two programs. That’s a conversation for another time. If you want an in-depth analysis, check out Dana Gran’s blog post, ManyChat vs Chatfuel on ThinkTuitive.   I say, test them both out… Play with them a little bit and see which one you like best. Next, you need to know your target market’s buying process and where your bot will fit into this process. Where Will Your Chatbot Fit In? Are you planning on using it in the beginning of your funnel? The end? Everything in between? Its placement in the buying process is crucial. If you send freezing cold traffic to your bot, and you are trying to get them to buy a product, the likely hood they will convert is very low. Don’t misread that sentence, you CAN send cold traffic to your bot, but if you do your (for lack of a better word) “Chatbot-Funnel” needs to be about building trust and authority. Let’s go back to the basics real quick… Here is what a funnel looks like:  ⬇️ Visitors - Cold traffic⬇️ Lead - Optin or sign up⬇️ MQL - Marketing qualified lead⬇️ SQL - Sales qualified lead★ Opportunity - Perfect client / customerClient - Closed the dealIt’s fine if you have other channels operating at different stages, but when creating your chatbot, you must have a strategy for implementation. You can create a bot for any and every part of your funnel / the buying process once you know where your audience will be coming from. If they come from a blog post, test sending them to a bot that opts them into receiving a lead magnet (lead). Have an opportunity ready to buy? Send them through a bot that allows them to purchase (…yes, you can add payment integrations to your bot!!). If you offer a service and want to know more about your prospect, run them through a qualifying sequence. At the time of writing this, the most successful chatbots I’ve seen have been Lead to Opportunity (and even some client) bots. However, in order to make this successful you’ll want to have your qualifying questions and answers prepared. Qualifying Questions & Answers If you have spent enough time with clients (either on the phone or in person) you should have an idea of the questions they ask, the objections they have, and how to answer them. If not, have a detailed conversation with your sales and marketing team because this is VERY important… …hell, there should be NO reason you don’t know this!! Let’s use mortgages as an example (Why? Well… just because I have a background in Finance). The application process is the most important process. It runs everything you do from start to finish. This process can also take your sales team away from what they are good at… Selling!! So to help automate this process, let’s send them through some automation. Now, I am not going to build out the whole process for you, but let's look at the basics of what we need: Name, Address, Phone #, SSN ( ⬅️ test this one)IncomeDebtsGoalsAny sort of craziness that WILL pop up when you are ready to close !!If all these questions were answered, it would be like a salesman’s wet dream!  Here is a peek at one of Avaamo’s bots. Are you beginning to visualize the whole picture? You want to give users the opportunity to complete as much of this process as possible before moving them to the next stage in your sales process. Once you have completed what the questions that you want answers too, put yourself in your buyer's shoes. What answers might they give you? What if they don’t know? Over time you’ll be able to optimize your bot better but for now, consider every option they might give you. This is where understanding those objections and concerns come into play. If we know that when we ask a specific question we normally get X answer, but sometimes they’ll say Y or Z. We want to be able to predict the responses and be prepared. The last thing you’ll want is to have to follow up with everyone because there is a hole in your bot… …of course, it’s the nature of this particular beast when building out your bot. Building a Chatbot Now that you have the concept in place for what your goals are and how it’s going to work, let’s start building. Once again we are stepping into the shoes of the buyer. Treat this as if you were texting them. Think of it like this… Not only do you want to ask the right question, get the right answer, but you also want to make the user experience seamless. As if they were having an actual CHAT with someone. What does this mean? Here are 9 rules I like to follow: Be conciseDon’t be afraid to use texting lingo (lol, ppl, btw)Use emoji’s , but not all over the place… Rule of thumb: use them as a way to highlight specific actions.Use Gif’sMake it easy to read… Think minimalism. Keep the # of characters as limited as possible and try to break up huge paragraphs.Don’t use jargon... Speak like they would (you are trying to connect here folks!!).Use show “typing” in between messages… It gives the feel to the user, that someone is speaking directly to them.Let them know they are talking to a chatbot (give it a name to make it seem more human… damn robots!)Give them an option to talk to a human… they may get stuck OR they just may be anti-bot. In which case, you don’t want to lose them.It’s all in the details.  You’re wanting your prospect to feel a connection with you, even before you actually connect with them (crazy right?). This means your sequences and setup must be top notch!! But don’t stress when you don’t get it right the first time around. It takes time to really optimize a bot, especially for middle-stage sales & marketing processes… …hopefully you have some friends, co-workers, or even your best clients help you test out your chatbot.  MAKE USE OF AUTOMATION  Setup automation, autoreplies, and rules that make sense. Here is an example of one I created for an advertisement running where the person must type, ""Get Started"" in the comments section. I am sure you've seen these around a few times (test them out!). Remember this is about automation... So as much as you would love to have a bot just ready to go, we have to give it all the necessary tools and resources to succeed. We are telling the bot what to say and how to say it. Test, Test, Test, Optimize Bots finished, but we still need to take care of all the bugs and make sure it’s running properly. As previously mentioned… Reach out to your colleagues, employees, marketing & sales teams, anyone with a pulse who understands what you are trying to accomplish. Have them go through it with a fine tooth comb. Go through every nook and cranny. Have them ask off the wall questions and see how your bot responds. Now fix ALL these bugs. Once you do that, reach out to your best clients. Ask them to do you a favor. Send them the link and have them do the same thing. I promise you it will be painful. It may even take you a while to patch every tear and plug every hole, but after it’s completed it’s time to start rocking & rollin!! Oh, and be sure to start utilizing the ""Send to Messenger"" plugins on your site... it's almost like asking them to subscribe to your blog, but a whole hell of a lot easier. Here's a link to the developers Facebook Messenger platform, in case you want to build it out yourself (...nerds!!) Time to Rock & Roll None of this was meant to be easy. However, after some time playing around with it, you’ll understand why it’s important to have the right software, the right goals, and the right support behind you. This is exactly why marketers, like Tyson Isham, have created a community specifically around creating, building, and managing chatbots… Join the Facebook group here ⬅️ If you want to take your chatbots to the next level, then this group is where you need to be .

And then, when you actually talk about politics, it gets worse, because you then need to take sides for sure, and most of the time INTPs have original stances that don’t fall into any sides. Lastly, politics is based on an empirical epistemology and INTPs are often skeptical about this methodology especially when it’s based upon other people’s narratives; and for this reason they can’t stand people who take politics too seriously.Psychiatry. INTPs are often familiar with psychiatric topics. So no, not because they don’t know about it. But they don’t like to talk about it because they also know that psychiatry is a field that tends to over complicate the simple human natures that an INTP knows and knows naturally. They also dislike mind games and tricks and things like psychiatric drugs that only amplify the problems and destroy a natural balance. The over analysing and hair splitting etc. will bore INTPs before it even started. Sidetrack thought: I guess that’s also why Jung eventually left Freud who got stuck with his controversial discipline of psychoanalysis.Who’s right and who’s wrong. INTPs don’t care about who’s right and who’s wrong because to them it’s just another opinion. They might care a bit about what’s the actual dilemma or conflict of the situation, but that’s pretty much it. Besides, the INTPs way of dealing with rules are non transactional, meaning they simply work with their own rules or more often, no rules. Besides, they mostly work with thoughts but not judgements. So if you ask them to judge - and based on others’ established rules even - it will definitely bring an INTPs another good excuse to walk away from the party even quicker.Climate change. No, INTPs won’t want to discuss about climate change. It’s considered to be a swanky-hipster-kind of topic in an INTP’s eye; on top of which, the way how some people discuss about “climate change” is also quite unbearable for an INTP - because it basically reflects the properties relevant to the above three categories of topics. Side note: INTPs do think about climate, but they don’t work with threats or fears; and they don’t care that others misunderstand that they don’t care.Probably some deaths of some celebrities or stars and how awful it is. No, INTPs won’t think it’s that awful. But talk to them if you are saddened by the lost of your beloved pets. INTPs would care about a missing cat more than anyone else in the party.

Here’s how a silo structure looks like;  By looking at the above illustration, you can easily understand that Silos are basically a way to separate your blog’s content into various categories (WP Page in the above example and WP posts are sub categories or blog posts). So how to create a silo structure for your website? We've written a detailed guide around creating a Silo structure for SEO, where you can find all the details along with a ton of examples and best practices. But if you're looking for a quick synopsis of the post (I highly recommend you to go through the post to understand better). Find out main Silos of your website (or topics that you're already covering on your blog). For example, if you’re running a blog which mostly covers fitness, then your main Silo would be “fitness”. Now you need to define your categories under your main topic which is ""fitness"" and these categories can be further divided into; Fitness appsYoga practicesFitness equipmentFitness tips and so onOnce you've chosen your categories, you can further divide your categories into multiple subcategories and in that way you’re creating a deep Silo structure for your website. So whatever new blog post you publish on your website can go into one of those categories or subcategories. Are you getting it? That's how you can implement silo structure for your website. Creating a Silo structure usually includes the following things; Keyword research (you need to brainstorm keyword ideas to create several silos for your website)Organising your content hierarchically (based on your target keywords and topics)Properly siloing your website (by implementing categories, menus, breadcrumbs, internal linking URL structure etc)We’ve explained the above things in the Silo structure post on our website, so make sure to check it out for more details.

ASO consists of: The app title ASO should cover everything you do in the app store and it should start at the very beginning with choosing the title for your app. If it is a made-up name then you should aim to build a brand around it. Alternatively, based on the type of game you are creating, the title could be composed of strategic keywords (remember, SEO). Visual assets Browse and Search are the biggest source of mobile app installs in the App Store and visual optimization (icon, screenshots, and a preview video) plays a huge role in conversions for this group. At a glance, your app icon and screenshots should enable app store users to understand what your app is about and why it’s so great. Combined with attractive, bright annotations and calls to action, screenshots should showcase potential users what their experience with the app will be after they download it. Proper description The AppStore description doesn’t influence any keywords ranking but it affects downloads conversion rate as a user can read your description and decide whether he or she needs this app or game or not. But for Google Play it is critical meta-data put there - use all the keywords you want to rank for but make the text engaging. Test and Iterate ASO experts advise that A/B testing should be done strategically and regularly, focusing more on the quality of the tests than the quantity of them. Always keep your finger on the pulse of your app relevant keywords especially. Reviews on app stores Many app developers mistakenly believe that ASO is all about keywords and visual assets. In reality, ratings and reviews are another important factor influencing app store performance. 70% of users go to review section before downloading an app. Answer to all your app reviews, especially, at the first stage of promoting it, and analyse them to make your app better.

People may be attracted to the images, and then want to make a purchase. You may also provide updates about new releases or discounts via Instagram. Twitter and Snapchat are both good for distributing news about new releases, and Twitter is ideal for crowd engagement. People may “re-tweet” your news to share it, and can ask you questions publicly, which their followers will see, raising awareness. If you are selling in a university town, you can provide discounts for students, or talk to an organization about getting an advertisement in their newsletter. Some businesses have agreements with certain organizations to have “donor nights” where a percentage of the proceeds from a certain night go to a club, or they make an agreement to be a sole provider (Chess club will only provide Domino’s pizza at meetings, but they get a discount.) Offers like this can be arranged via social media, by contacting the FB or Insta page of a group. If you are trying to market a clothing or jewelry line, you can ask people, especially students, who are popular on social media to be “brand ambassadors.” This typically means that they will advertise your brand for you, in exchange for a small commission of sales, or discounted merchandise. It’s quite a popular option on the college scene. If you are selling a products or a service, it may also be a good idea to make a listing on craigslist. All of these mediums are good for marketing your product, just make sure to play to the strengths of each one.

I don’t think that’s necessarily intentional - it’s just one of those UXs that seems like a no-brainer on paper, but unravels once you start to design it. Essentially self-service tills apply e-commerce principles to a bricks & mortar store. This has an inherent dissonance because on-line e-commerce is a closed loop. You choose the products you wish to buy, and only once you pay for them are they despatched to you. To all intents an purposes the goods don’t actually exist until someone goes through the warehouse with a picking list and puts them in a box for you. They are objects in a digital system first which are then mapped to physical goods post-sale. Self-service tills are the opposite. You have the goods first and they need to be matched to objects in the store’s digital system. This apparently simple reversal creates a complex set of business rules in order to close loop between the contents of your basket and the store’s inventory. Consider multiple purchases. Suppose you have three of something in your basket. Obviously there’s no way for the system to know that you have three things, so once you scan the first, there needs to be a mechanism whereby you clearly complete that transaction before you start on the second. The way this is done in most cases is to not allow you to scan a second item until you place the first in the bagging area. The scales register the weight of the first so the system now knows that the second scan is a new item, not an accidental repeat of the first. This is counter-intuitive to the user but very hard to suggest alternative patterns for. You could allow the user to scan all three items and then place them in the bagging area in one go, but then you do allow for the possibility that the user could scan the same item twice? How do you recover if the user scans three items and only bags two? The journeys for that are hopelessly elaborate. That’s just one - there are many examples of how apparently simple user journeys become very complex as soon as you stray off the happy path. But the store is relying on the fact that you are motivated enough to complete the transaction, not least because you don’t want to appear stupid beside the other 8 people who are using them successfully and in front of the other 10 who are queueing and just want you to hurry the f*** up so they can get onto a till and get their shop done. Plus there is a strong likelihood that you will come back many times and over the course of those visits you’ll learn the eccentricities of their tills. That said there are some awful UX errors which contribute to the frustration further. In the UK, Sainsbury’s have recently redesigned the UX of their self-service tills and the results are just awful. They’re full of confusing iconography and hard-to-spot CTAs. I use them quite regularly and still haven’t got to the point where I can easily remember what to do. The sad thing is that they’ve probably followed reasonable user design principles. Large retailers seem to have something of a track record of not doing user testing well, or of doing it and then watering it down through endless phases of design by committee. So it’s possible that they tested them to death and just got it wrong. But you’re going to use them anyway and as long as the loss of revenue from abandoned transactions is less than the cost of employing staff to operate tills then what the hell?

The result… A chatbot that sounded, responded and felt like Roman. So - let’s put aside that its creepy. If only 2 years of texts can help create an eerily good Roman reincarnate… Let’s break down the stats real quick: On avg a US smart phone user sends 50 texts per day. Of course that’s to more than one person. So let’s guess that it’s 20 text to Roman. And we’re going to assume they talk 5 days per week. = 100 texts per week = approx 5200 texts Avg length of a text is 7 words. (interestingly the older you are the longer your avg text) =36400 words per year Total words to input for Roman: 72,800 vs. Plato Just one of Plato’s works (The Republic of Plato) is 158,720 words long Imagine if you could input all of Plato’s writings. The bot would use the same lingo as Plato. It would learn to respond as Plato would have. The bot would FEEL like Plato Long story short: Yes you can train a bot to sound like anyone as long as you have enough data to feed into the model. Now… The more interesting question is - Should you? Chatbots, AI and conversational designers are getting better by the second. We’ll keep pushing the boundaries of what can be done.

Would they want to talk to their dead son? Would they be mad or overjoyed? What would your reaction be?

Product designers job is to solve a certain problem in a product or come up with a new product according to the market demand (many factors are considered here)Designers are involved in brainstorming, market research, brand research and trends etc. Their main objective is to make product look appealing and functional at the same time without compromising on the aesthetics.They are involved in the creative part of making a product.I will put out this way, product designers start the race and design engineers end it. Both can't function without each other's input. Design is a field which lies between Art and engineering. A very thin line. If you go all aesthetics, in that case that product is just a show piece and if you go to the engineering side, then it's all about functionality. The emotional side of the product is dead in that case. A good product is a balance of both. Aesthetics and functionality.

Involve users early in the design process and evaluation of the artifact2.  Define quantifiable & measurable usability criteria3.  Iteration is inevitable Key characteristics of the interaction design process are explicit incorporation of user involvement, iteration and specific usability criteria. Before you can begin to establish requirements, you must understand who the users are and what their goals are in using the device. Looking at others' designs provides useful inspiration and encourages designers to consider alternative design solutions, which is key to effective design. Usability criteria, technical feasibility, and users' feedback on prototypes can all be used to choose among alternatives. Prototyping is a useful technique for facilitating user feedback on designs at all stages. Lifecycle models show how development activities relate to one another. The interaction design process is complementary to lifecycle models from other fields. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T10:40:11.906Z,"What is the Interaction Design process? ",Quora

To avoid having the tongue on a pair of sneakers from moving to the side, you needn’t buy any special tools, and you certainly don’t need any glue. Instead, just follow a simple procedure and your tongue sliding sneakers will be golden forever. When you tie the shoelaces on your sneakers, tie them twice by first using your normal bow knot, and then tie the knot a second time to make sure it doesn’t gradually come undone. Then (and this is the important part) after you tie your shoes, using your hands, pull the tongue up as far as it will go, straightening it at same time. This way the tongue is farther up than the knot, and the double-knot will keep it in place all day long. Also make sure that your laces are tight all the way up your shoe (unlike what you see in the photo I’ve posted above). Tongues tend to move because nothing is anchoring them correctly. I’ve just explained how to avoid that from happening, and it’s worked for me for years.",2021-03-06T10:41:02.593Z,"How can I design my own Converse shoes in the UK? ",Quora
