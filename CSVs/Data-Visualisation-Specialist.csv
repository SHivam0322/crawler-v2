Scientific accuracy, exploration and identification of interesting and valuable data is the focus. While they are researching data, I am researching users. Then we work together to define parameters of data fidelity, architectures and user needs. What can we remove without degrading accuracy while improving clarity? This is where prototyping can be extremely valuable. Sampling data, charting and getting user feedback is an effective iterative approach. While both fields are vast and bleed into one another it is not possible to say there is *one* way to work together effectively. Communication is key. As a designer it is important for me to know enough about data visualization to effectively communicate, addressing strategic and tactical design issues. Educating those I work with about UX design help identify common project goals. No one is an expert at all things but when you collaborate, understanding the big picture (both sides) is key. Having said all that, one difference might be in how each defines success: User Experience designer: efficiency, effectiveness; Data Visualization Expert: accuracy, novelty.

Too Much Color or Information While it has been established that using different colors help people interpret data visualizations quicker, too much color can confuse the viewer. It is important to choose a limited number of colors — 5 is a good upper limit Misrepresentation of Data The biggest crime in data visualization is leading the viewer to a wrong interpretation. Inconsistent Scales You can, of course, represent multiple variables in a single data visualization. However, it is always a good practice to represent them on a single scale to avoid confusion. There are many many additional factors that can be said about data visualization where it is not a good fit. No technology offers solutions across all levels. The best way to approach DataViz is to use it where it helps and avoid it where it doesn’t. As the technology matures more and more capabilities will surface and where data visualization is not a good fit, that doesn’t mean that this is a permanent condition.

Today I am going to tell of the major difference between R and Python. We know that R and Python both are open source programming languages. Both of these languages are having a large community. Both of these languages are having continuous development. That’s is the reason these languages add new libraries and tools in their catalog. The major purpose of using R is for statistical analysis, on the other hand Python provide the more general approach to data science. Both of the languages are state of the art programming language for data science. Python is one of the simplest programming languages in terms of its syntax. That’s why any beginner in a programming language can learn R without putting extra efforts. On the other hand, R is built by statisticians that are a little bit hard to learn. There are some reasons that will help us to find out why we should not use both R and Python. R R is one of the oldest programming language developed by academics and statisticians. R comes into existence in the year 1995. Now R is providing the richest ecosystem for data analysis. The R programming language is full of libraries. There are a couple of repositories also available with R. In fact, CRAN is having around 12000 packages. The rich variety of library makes it the first choice for statistical analysis and analytical work. Key features of R Consists of packages for almost any statistical application one can think of. CRAN currently hosts more than 10k packages.Comes equipped with excellent visualization libraries like ggplot2.Capable of standalone analysesPython On the other hand Python can do the same tasks as R programming language does. The major features of python are data wrangling, engineering, web scraping and so on. Python is also having the tools that help in implementing the machine learning at large scale. Python is one of the simplest languages to maintain and it is more robust than R. Now a day Python is having the cutting edge API. This API is quite helpful in machine learning and AI. Most of the data scientist uses only five Python libraries i.e Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn and Seaborn. It is quite handy to use Python over R. Key features of Python programming language:- Object-oriented languageGeneral PurposeHas a lot of extensions and incredible community supportSimple and easy to understand and learnpackages like pandas, numpy and scikit-learn, make Python an excellent choice for machine learning activities.R or Python Usage Python has developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python is the most popular programming language in the world. It has most powerful libraries for math, statistic, artificial intelligence and machine learning. But still python is not useful for econometrics and communication, and also for business analytics. On the other hand, R is developed by academics and scientist. It is specially designed for machine learning and data science. R is having the most powerful communication libraries that are quite helpful in data science. In addition, R is equipped with many packages that are used to perform the data mining and time series analysis. Why not use Both? Lots of people think that they can use both the programming languages at the same time. But we should prevent to use them at the same time. Majority of people are using only one of these programming languages. But they always want to have access to the capability of the language adversary. For example, if you use both the language at the same time that may face some of the problems. If you use R and you want to perform some object-oriented function than you can’t use it on R. On the other hand, Python is not suitable for statistical distributions. So that they should not use both the language at the same time, because there is a mismatch of their functions. But there are some ways that will help you to use both of these languages with one another. We will talk about them in our next blog. Let’s have a look at the comparison between R vs Python. R is more functional, Python is more object-oriented. R is more functional, it provides variety of functions to the data scientist i.e Im, predict and so on. Most of the work done by functions in R. On the other hand Python use classes to perform any task within the python. R has more data analysis built-in, Python relies on packages. R provides the build in data analysis for summary statistics, it is supported by summary built-in functions in R. But on the other hand we have to import the statsmodel packages in Python to use this function. In addition there is also a built in constructor in R i.e is dataframe. On the other hand we have to import it in Python. Python also helps to do linear regression, random forests with its scikit learn package. As mentioned above it also offers API for machine learning and AI. On the other hand R is having the greatest diversity of packages. R has more statistical support in general. R was created as a statistical language, and it shows . statsmodels in Python and other packages provide decent coverage for statistical methods, but the R ecosystem is far more large. It’s usually more straightforward to do non-statistical tasks in Python. With well-placed libraries like beautifulsoup and request, web scraping in Python is much easier than R. This applies to other tasks that we don’t see closely, such as saving the database, deploying the Web server, or running a complex selfie. There are many parallels between the data analysis workflow in both. R and Python are the clearest points of inspiration between the two (pandas were inspired by the Dataframe R Dataframe, the rvest package was inspired by the Sundersaute), and the two ecosystems are getting stronger. It may be noted that the syntax and approach for many common tasks in both languages are the same. Lets Sum Up R vs Python Now you have got a detailed comparison on R vs Python. Both of these languages are having their own strength and weakness. You can use either one for data analysis and data science. Both of these languages are having a similarity in terms of their syntax and approach. You can pick any one of them, no one will let you down. Now you may come to know the basic strengths of these languages over each other. Now you may be more confident to choose the best one as per your needs.

And 100 hours, damn, if you honestly, dutifully put in 100 hours in the next 10 days, that will cover 1% of becoming a world expert in the field. That's a lot in a very short time. Get ready. There will be plenty of time to learn all the internals of your libraries and algorithms, but you don't need them right now. I am going to give you an enormous task that will require all your focus and ideally you will get a very broad exposure to the main tools. Days One and Two Download StackExchange data: Stack Exchange Data Dump : Stack Exchange, Inc. : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive You will need an RDBMS to handle the data, so the first day would look like this: Install and configure MySQL. Import the dump into the databaseRead SQL basics. Spend some time doing simple exercises to get the hang of manipulating the data. Write a script that pulls, for example, set of questions about Python and SQL that have >3 answers and the best answer is written by someone who has >= 10 chose answers in either of those two topics. Observe performance issues.Read about indexes in SQL. Hashing, sorting etc. Speed up the query from the bullet 2 so that it run instantaneously.Write a class in Python that handles the queries for you. This will require you to learn about Python MySQL driver. As a result you need a tool that pulls required data from your database and presents it in a convenient format.I don't know about your background, but I think it's totally doable even for a beginner, all you need is some general experience with Python. For the second day, you will need to get familiar with reading data using pandas and manipulating numerical data with numpy. The documentation is quite voluminous, you don't need to read all of it, just be comfortable with importing CSV files, extracting and adding columns, merging two datasets and that's it. Day Three While on the actual job you will often run queries on the whole database, it's important to get the gist of how to work with small data and still get meaningful results. Play aroung with pulling random subsamples and compare the distributions of, say, scores, with the ground truth - the distribution of all scores. Let's move further. You have a whole SE database in front of you, but I'll stick to StackOverflow since it contains a lot of data I'm familiar with. One exercise off the top of my head - build a timeline of languages' popularity. Why is it so cool? How do you extract the questions about the languages and omit the ones related only to technology? (e. g. asking about Python syntax and not about how to mate Django with MongoDB)Lots of tags there, you need to visualize the results, so filter your sources wiselyYou get to learn at least one visualization frameworkLots of cool picsOf course, once you did that example, there are many more interesting properties of your data that you should explore. Asking the right questions is a key ability. Days Four and Five Data Scientist was named ""The sexiest job of 21st century"". You know what else is sexy? Graph theory. How are the tags connected? Is it possible to build a technology map using just SO answers? What metrics would you choose to calculate the proximity of two tags? How would you visualize the graph? Have you tried Gephi? Once you are done, the graph needs to be described. Thing is, the picture of a graph has poor value in terms of comprehensibility - you need to stare and stare at it before you know for sure what's going on. So, you will need to learn about clustering algorithms (at least k-means and DBSCAN), K nearest neighbors. If you go full von Neumann on this task, some graph metrics and algorithms won't hurt. I suggest you try networkx and some parts of scikit-learn for this, they make everything much easier. Why is it so cool? You learn about different formats of data. CSV, Gephi, list of edges, ets.K-means is very useful algorithm that will serve you well in the futureDiscovering the meaningful groups is one of the most important tasks when you explore the dataDistribute the workload as you prefer, I'd spend the first day tinkering with networkx and Gephi just because graphs, you know. The second day I'd give to clustering, because there are going to be some non-trivial things like ""how the hell do I get vector representations for each tag that would preserve the distances between them?!"" Day Six OK, now you have general understanding of what's going on in your database. But you haven't touched the texts yet - word counts don't count (terrible pun unintended). So, today you need to read briefly about text analysis. For this step good ol' Latent Semantic Indexing would be enough, everything you need you will find in scikit-learn, also you will need to work with SQL. General pipeline you want to see: Select the data you will work withBuild text features with special extractors in scikit (TF-IDF Vectorizer is the best)Assign the labels for the text. Let's say for example that you want to predict how many point will the answer get based only on the text. So, you take a score as a label and the feature vector is TF-IDFIt would be better to prepare several datasets in the numpy format, one for every hypothesis. I will give you a couple just to get you started: Predict the score of the answer.Classify the main topic of the answer (choose, say, 20 languages and sample answers about them).Be sure that your datasets are clean and you know what's inside. This description might seem easy, it's not. Day Seven, Eight, Nine Okay, so you have clean datasets from the previous day. I will assume that you have one dataset for classification and one for prediction (you should know the difference by the fifth day). On the fifth day you need to focus on regression models. Granted, scikit gives you a wide range of tools. You definitely want to try at least there methods: Linear model. There are tons of them, first compare how they perform, then read a bit about the best ones to know the difference better. Hint: take a good look at ElasticNet regression. If you are mathematically savvy, read a couple of chapters from Bishop's ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"", he gives a good explanation why it works. Skip this if you don't have enough timeRegression treesKNN regression. They usually perform quite well, never underestimate these methods.Ensemble models. Random Forests and AdaBoost.The whole idea is not to become an algorithm expert instantly, but to get it to work first, ask questions later. The same stands for classification task. Take your time to read and think about metrics of quality. Imagine that you are building a smart content platform that sorts the news - how would you evaluate the performance in that case? It's absolutely necessary to perform cross-validations for all of your models. Read about k-fold CV, find out how to do it with scikit and cross-validate the hell out of your models. Day Ten Since you are on your way to become a data scientist, this adventure wouldn't be complete without the most interesting part of your work. You will need to present it. The format is only your choice (you will rarely have this luxury again in the future). A semi-academic paper, presentation, blog post, app - whatever you like. Tell your story. Describe your findings in the dataset, tell about your hypotheses, give a couple of suggestions why they may be true of false, describe the algorithms, present the results of cross-validations in a clear format and, in the name of Sir Ronald Fisher, show more pics. As for this part, there's no way to overdo it. And I guarantee you, if you do make great presentation and show it to the right people, your entry-level offer will follow very soon.",2021-03-05T10:10:34.234Z,"What should I learn in data science in 100 hours?

If your audience is C-suite level or the board, you may want to present mostly high-level data with specific call outs and action items. Determining this will keep you focus on your message, and impactful. 3- Then comes the visual part: choose the right type of chart that will go the best to the data you have and let you tell the right story. Not every graph can convey the same message. Here you have a complete list of the many charts that exist, when and how to use them: How To Choose The Right Data Visualization Types It is pretty enlightening and very helpful when it comes to creating your own charts! I will provide shortly some examples here, but I encourage you to read the complete article above. 1) Gauge Charts  When to Use Gauge Charts Gauge charts are also known as dial charts or speedometer charts. These charts use needles and colors to show data similar to a reading on a dial/speedometer. These charts provide an easily digested visual. They are great for displaying a single value/measure within a quantitative context such as to the previous period or to a target value. What to Avoid Gauge charts are great for KPIs and single data points. After that they can get a bit messy. With only one data point you can’t easily compare different variables. You also can’t trend data using gauge charts. All of this makes taking actionable insight from a gauge chart difficult. Also, they take up a lot of space. You probably will get more bang for your buck using one chart to summarize multiple KPIs. 2) Pie Charts  When to Use Pie Charts Aaah, the infamous pie chart! That has had a bad couple of years.. In fact it has become pretty cliché to talk about how bad pie charts are. We understand the pie chart doesn’t do a lot. But it does do some things quite well. In general, pie charts are useful for when demonstrating the proportional composition of a particular variable, over a static timeframe. Your audience isn’t always going to be data scientists. Accordingly, your data presentation should be tailored to your particular audience. Which brings us to another pie chart strength: people are familiar with pie charts. Any audience member will feel comfortable interpreting what the pie chart is presenting. As a bonus, circles generate more positive emotions: our brains like to look at circles over sharp corners. In the end, a pie chart simplifies the data story and encourages the audience. What to Avoid Pie charts are also not the best data visualization type to make precise comparisons. This is especially true when there are multiple small pieces to the pie. If you need to see that one slice is 1% larger than another, it is better to go with a bar chart. Another thing about multiple pieces to your pie, you don’t want too many. Pie charts are most effective when just displaying two portions. They lose presentation value after 6 segments. After six it is hard for eyes to decipher what the slices proportion. It also become difficult to label the pie chart and valuable dashboard/reporting real estate is often wasted in the process. Which brings us to the last issue: circles take up space. If you are using multiple pie charts in a dashboard it is probably best to more effectively combine the data in one chart. We recommend checking out the stacked bar chart for these cases! You can also have a look at the different pie charts that are commonly used. 3) Maps  When to Use Maps Besides just being cool, maps are great at visualizing your geographically data by location. The data on a map is often displayed in a colored area map like above or a bubble map. Since maps are so effective at telling a story they are used by governments, media, NGOs, nonprofits, public health departments… Maps aren’t just for displaying data they direct action. What to Avoid Everyone loves maps. That doesn’t mean you always need to display one. Obviously if location isn’t a necessary part of your data story, you don’t need a map. They take up a lot of room so only use them when necessary. Also don’t just fill your maps with data points. So, to conclude: keep the text simple, use visualizations whenever possible, include video and animation when appropriate, and make your reports/presentations interactive to engage your audience!

I tried to revert the merge, but was unsuccessful because the Quora Content Bot had subsequently merged several other questions into this one.  First, you should become an expert in displaying data visually. Charts are only one form of data visualization. Excel is merely a tool for creating charts. You need to know which types of charts work for the data you have and the point(s) you want to make. Hint: Excel’s 3D and pie charts are seldom the right answer to the question. One resource for learning about displaying data visually is Stephen Few’s books and website Perceptual Edge Another widely recognized expert is Edward Tufte. He teaches workshops and has written four books on the visual display of quantitative information. The Work of Edward Tufte and Graphics Press If you now want to know how to create Excel charts, you may want to explore John Walkenbach’s book on charts. I have an older version of this one: Amazon.com: Excel 2007 Charts (9780470044001): John Walkenbach: Books Good websites on Excel charting include those run by Microsoft Excel MVPs Jon Peltier and Andy Pope. Jon Peltier earns his living through selling add-ins that make it easier to build chart types that Microsoft doesn’t include in Excel—and when an MIT PhD can earn a better living selling Excel add-ins than by doing metallurgical R&D, you know they are worth the price asked. Microsoft recently introduced a new feature at the right of the Home ribbon called Ideas. It’s available in the Office 365 subscription version of Excel 2016 (both Windows and Mac) and also on the free Excel Online. This tool applies artificial intelligence to your data analysis and suggests charts that show interesting things about your data, whether that be trends, outliers or the influence of product mix on profitability. I recommend that every change to the subscription version of Office because you are continually getting cool new features like Ideas. If you follow the above advice, you have become sensitized to the issue of how best to display data visually and how Excel can help you do that. So how do you become an expert in Excel charts? Build charts with Excel in your daily work. Extend Excel’s capabilities by referring to Mr. Pope or Peltier’s webpages. Research your questions on the internet. Teach yourself how to program chart features using VBA. You won’t become an Excel charting expert overnight—but you will be learning steadily.

Not only do we visualize what we want, but we also create our own symbols in line with our inner language, as well as adopt the common symbolism. This mechanism helped us survive as species and also developed our ingenuity. With time, we faced a new challenge – surviving what Richard Saul Wurman called the “tsunami” of bits of information that was “cresting the horizon”. He also introduced the concept of the “black hole between data and knowledge.” The more knowledge we discover, the wider the gap between what we know and what we think we should know. Alberto Cairo, a Spanish information designer, professor, and author of The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization uses the term “wisdom” as the final point of the transformation of reality into knowledge:  “We reach wisdom when we achieve a deep understanding of acquired knowledge, when we not only “get it,” but when new information blends with prior experience so completely that it makes us better at knowing what to do in other situations, even if they are only loosely related to the information from which our original knowledge came” – Alberto Cairo. To make this transformation, words are not enough. We have to rely on the effective visuals. What we recognize as effective and functional automatically becomes beautiful as well. This has brought us to a fine line between aesthetic value and actual problem-solving. On the forefront of the functional and truthful data visualization is a group of designers with science degrees. The principles they follow are as close to those of Guerry, Minard, and Snow. They visualize data to squeeze the signal out of the complicated matters. They are solving problems of human well-being. It is our visual nature that also sees beauty in the graphs they create. 13 years ago Manuel Lima founded A visual exploration on mapping complex networks, a resource space for anyone interested in the visualization of complex networks. Today, it indexes over 1000 projects depicting the diffusion of information regardless of the industry and the field of knowledge. What Lima managed to create is as fascinating as the discoveries he made about the principles of visualization. Manuel points out these visualization insights: Nature Using nature for inspiration to construct visuals of data can bring outstanding results.  On the left is a human eye. On the right is the circle visualizing a year of human life with healthy levels of blood sugar and insulin. “All art is but imitation of nature.” – Lucius Annaeus Seneca Genuine metaphors Most of the visualization techniques known today are a reinvented wheel. As Lima points out, the forgotten metaphors are on par with those that go back not decades but millenniums.  This is a visual analysis of member profiles of an Internet community, created by Felix Heinen.  This is a visualization of Music Theory by Monochord. From the 13th century. Networkism We not only find inspiration for data visualization in nature but give it back as an artform. Networkism is an artistic movement deriving from the principles of visualization. Because the connections are so natural, it’s easy to find correlations and understand visualization on a deeper level.

The common method is to test your algorithm on data it has never seen before, and check the difference between its predictions and the real values.

This information is eventually strongly correlated to the value you are trying to predict. You will then have an excellent cross-validation score  But it's all fake. These leakages can be very subtle and hard to detect. Wrong validation metric choice :When you do the cross-validation, you also have to choose a metric to measure your accuracy, whether it's RMSE for regression, ROC AUC for binary classification and so on... Rookie mistakes include for example validating a model on the number of right answers for an unbalanced problem : if your target contains 99% ones and 1% of zeros, predicting ones all the time is almost a perfect model according to accuracy...so what? The metric choice can impact strongly what is your business objective. Example of a good choice is looking at the lift metric when you are doing marketing campaigns. Overfitting :This topic has been widely discussed on quora included. The idea is that even if you do a cross-validation, you are still exposed to this phenomenon of not generalizing. Kaggle is a great example of this. Even if people cross-validate their results, we see big movements in the final leaderboard because some people mine variables that are not generalizing over the data, but just finding random correlations between the train set and the public leaderboard test set. Not comparing your model to a naive model:People saying their model is amazing with a 0.142 RMSE, then you try to predict the average of the target, and you get 0.141 RMSE. People doing time series forecasting saying their model is good, then you have a better model by just predicting the value of the next hour to be the same as now. You have many other biais like identifying a correlation between two time series though they both have a trend... (pure random series can have a strong correlation factor with any other one as long as they have the same trend, you have to remove the trends before doing the analysis). This is why data scientists should never work alone, and always challenge themselves really hard. Most of the complexity in datascience is about assessing your model quality, and insure it will get expected performance in production. What needs experience is also understanding and explaining your model to the business, and doing A/B testing over different solutions into production to compare the results.",2021-03-05T10:24:44.811Z,"What are the most common mistakes made by aspiring data scientists?

Data Visualization is the last leg of this complicated work flow of business intelligence that involves data integration, manipulation, modeling, calculation and distribution. The outcome of all those steps is what feeds into the visualization stage: telling a visual story from the outcome of data analysis process. It is such a tiny (but very crucial) part of business intelligence that the line between all these individual roles has become very thin. If you are still interested in just being a data visualization expert, some of the key skills you'll need are understanding of visual design concepts, effective presentation skills, dashboarding/charting skills and a bit of story telling skills. You'll also have to be skillful in the business area you want to work in and know what various data elements and business terms mean. You can get help learning some of these skills (technical ones mostly) from places like www.coursera.org and www.udacity.com. For the rest, you'll find plenty of help by searching for related terms on the Internet.

Wi-Fi data can be incredibly interesting if you have a business.

By monitoring the connection to the internet, you can capture the websites that the Mac Address visits (domain). Which gives you a pretty extensive list of their interests and potential future partners. If you have a social media login (social login) you can even monitor what they are saying about your brand online. Wi-Fi data analysis can tell you so much about your business. For example, by collecting postal codes, and plotting them on a map, you can see the areas where people come from to visit your locations. By comparing that to a map, you can find new locations where your stores should go. By clustering the websites that people visit by demographics, you can have a pretty clear understanding of the customer profile of people that visit your stores. By adding in your own data, you may even be able to figure out why people buy certain things. Companies like Soonsy AG, offer data collection, and analysis services for Wi-Fi access points. a.solms@soonsy.com is my address, send me an email if I can give you any more interesting insights into AP data collection.",2021-03-05T10:26:33.160Z,"How do I analyze data from WiFi access points?
