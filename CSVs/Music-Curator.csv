604239fbed76476feda206f8,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-music-curator-blogger?-,"Here’s what you can do :) You can purchase a domain, find a nice WordPress template, and start blogging. Or you can create a website using Wix. If you want to avoid that hassle, sign up on Medium. Here’s one of my music reviews: Noah Kahan: New Indie Artist On The Block – Sara Tilly – Medium Pick your topics, make a plan how often are you going to post (also, how much time it takes), what are you going to write about, who are you targeting with your posts and articles, are you going to write music reviews or what (?)… the list goes on and on. Once you’ve set up your website, you can promote your articles on social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Also, it might be a good idea to be active on various music forums, especially if you want to dig up some underground music that no one has even heard. You can start with Reddit. Now when it comes to becoming a music curator, you have to select a platform. For example, decide whether you’re going to be curating Youtube, Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music, SoundsGood playlists or some other platform. Here’s an example: Soundsgood How are you going to get your lists out there and gain a following? It’s a lot of work :) I can be done, but it takes time and patience to blog every other day, to come up with new playlists on a weekly basis (or even often), to nurture your social media following, etc. You need quality content. And of course, you also need time to listen to all that new music and to dig for new tracks. Then you need time to write about it. For example, I listen to at least 5 hours of music on weekdays, and on weekends it’s just music. That’s mostly all I do, and I still have a hard time pushing myself to stay consistent. As Greg Hluska said, “Hell, even finding time to listen to enough new music that you can promote to people is hard.” - This is true. This can be a hobby, sure. But you will only get results if you devote yourself to this project and give yourself enough time to succeed. It all boils down to what you want from this - to be a hobby or to make a living of it and do it professionally?",2021-03-05T14:02:35.451Z,"How can I become a music curator blogger? ",Quora

Do you have parents or some source of money that will keep you middle class throughout your life? There are very few curator positions that pay a living wage. I was offered a job as an assistant curator for a good-sized, well respected art/ antiques museum in the northeast US. My qualifications were good: a master's degree in American Studies, with an emphasis on fine art, classes taken with curators at smaller museums, and paid and unpaid experience as a docent/guide/etc. at several smaller house museums. I had excellent credentials. During this period I was a marketing manager, a job I learned to do while on the job, and then received promotions. While I didn't love it, it had a reasonably good salary, benefits, retirement and paid-for parking in a crappy parking lot, in which one of our cars would be broken into almost ever day. Once you learn to do this job, it gets VERY tedious. I interviewed twice at the museum. They were obviously delighted with me: good education (and expensive)good mannersexcellent references from people they knewexperience in putting together exhibits and using sophisticated displays.well spokentrustworthy (I would be escorting paintings from their collection around the world)appropriate dressed in conservative business style with jewelry that said ""artistic.""mature enough to be credible, young enough to be cute and energetic.I REALLY wanted to take this job. I'd never traveled much, and this would have given me a chance to go to Paris, Asia, all over the US. Unfortunately, the job paid less than 1/3 of what my marketing job paid. To compound that, there were no benefits. Not even paid holidays. No insurance, no flex spending, no retirement, no NOTHING. No parking, which would have been an extra $150/month, or approx. $100 for public transportation. We called back and forth several times. I think I even returned for an interview with higher ups to see if they could crack loose a little more more. Really, I would have taken it if it had paid 1/2 my old salary, with no benefits. Nothing. Nada. They couldn't get an extra dollar. I talked to several friends in the curatorial profession who had stayed in these jobs for a lot longer than they should have. Some received housing in exchange for some salary, but these were usually small apartments in historic houses that were targets for break-ins. Some were in tough neighborhoods. You could lose your housing if the administration had a contretemps / beef and you were seen as part of the ""other"" side. Essentially, you were nightwatchman for no pay. None made more than 1/3 of my marketing salary. Most got out before they were in their 40's and began to realize retirement was not never. Only a few went on to higher paid curatorial positions in nationally known museums. There's still low pay there. ONLY if you begin to trade in art and antiques, and know the field well enough to make money in this aspect, can you survive. One instructor was besieged at the annual art and antique show, with all the wealthiest men in our state trying to get his opinion on an investment. He also became an advisor, and got a percentage of an object he helped select. This meant you were sort of a poodle to the very rich, who weren't that interested in the objects, but in their investment value. So...a master's degree in a very specialized field is your first requirement,with a Ph.D. strongly advised. For that you'll be paid little, and not given much respect. You'll also need to keep current with prices and which objects become popular.",2021-03-05T14:04:32.865Z,"How do you jumpstart a new career path as a music curator? ",Quora

For some it's the love of the music and a desire to share that.  Even now, years after I've stopped playing professionally, whenever I hear a tune that makes me smile/dance/or triggers a myriad of other emotions I want to share it.  For others it's the technical challenge of mixing, the ability to seamlessly mix one song to another to keep a dance floor moving. To master the equipment and learn the craft.  And then there is the performance part, standing up in front of a crowd, to entertain. Whether it's to a small crowd and playing classics from way back when or in a packed club spinning cutting edge underground tracks, the feeling is the same. Nothing compares to working a crowd, building up a night to the point where they are literally under your spell and a two way trust is built and that's when the magic happens, you can throw in curve balls and forgotten gems and watch the place erupt.  For me it's all of the above, collecting music and sharing it with others and seeing them enjoy it too is incomparable and I hope that even though I don't play out now (family, work etc) I will still get the opportunity now and again to play to a crowd.",2021-03-05T14:10:43.152Z,"What are some of the influences that led to promoters becoming DJs versus curators of music?

You find in short supply in the USA. Some have no choice but to settle in Canada because for several reasons. American citizenship is very hard to get, and other avenues to get in the USA are not very user friendly.I had a chance to go to the UK/USA/Canada, Uk, and the USA; both wanted upfront proof of money, which was mission impossible for me. It seems like nothing in today’s value, but in the early 70 s, it was not possible for me.Canada was the only choice without many resources with me. And I came to Canada, my classmates who migrated to the USA did extremely well, better than me in the first round. However, my extremely hard work paid in the second round. What does not break you to pieces, it only makes you strong. And I was determined.Therefore, Canada, for most of us, was the second choice. All of us in that time frame wanted to go to the USA.People who are/were after science, technology engineering, medical sciences and wanted to touch the sky, and were extremely bright, super high achiever, went to the USA, in the late 60 s and early 70 s., they all had scholarships, and the USA was very selective. And the second cut came to Canada. In case you are a visible minority, in the early 70s it was next to impossible to find a half-decent job with a graduate degree, which means MSc or PhD. This country was full of hate for the brown people, now close to fifty years, still, the internal hate is the same but a method is very subtle. And the proof is in the pudding and eating. The second generation of these high achievers in the USA, most of them are super high achievers. Nikki Halley, Bobby Jindal, Preet Bharara. The list is very glorious and very long. The second list of super high achievers but went to American schools after coming to the USA. CEO of Microsoft CEO of Google CEO of Pepsi, The list is very long and glorious. In Canada, the stories are different, you only get what goes in, and apples do not fall far from the trees. Although exceptions are there, and proofs are in the pudding and eating. In the USA, when mom and dad were super achievers, mostly medical doctors from India, the results we can well imagine, Ivy league kids. It could unofficial but in the internal circles it is a known fact, after the blue blood Jewish people, offsprings of these high achievers from India hold a good position of power in the USA. My wife and I had a chance to meet a few super achiever second-generation Indian kids in one of the top schools in the USA. We happened and were very lucky to visit that institute to meet one of our own. The East Indian population is minuscule in the USA, but my guess is IVY Leagues may have a very high or let's say a significant population of second-generation Indian Americans. Most of the East Indians came to the USA, on very high merit, and they brought a huge name to their native lands and did extremely well for themselves, and second-generation took the baton from them. Once we met a few second-generation super high achievers, we realized two things are important, opportunities for the USA and super hard work. In Canada, when mom and dad were factory workers, results are very evident, of course, exceptions are there. Well, different strokes for different folks, we may compare a lot of other things, but my wife and I came ONLY for science/technology/math/science/because India is and was very behind. And we never lost our mission. Our mission was to make sure our next generation reaches the ultimate mission. We could not make it to the USA, Canada became our home. But never lost our ultimate mission, and thank God we achieved it. Our kids do not miss Ketchup chips, M and M, Harvey Hamburger, Tim Horton, because we did not train them to miss these things. They do miss Kennedy Space center because we took them there several times.",2021-03-05T14:12:08.402Z,"Who curates the music at the International Fountain at Seattle Center? ",Quora

For any graph density business you have to satisfy a minimum graph density for as many users as possible as quickly as possible. Graph density is a predictor of a user becoming engaged so if the flow fails to deliver upon a minimal quantity and quality of density, then it isn't doing its job. You can reasonably assume then that Facebook's flow is crushing it. 2. Twitter - similar to Facebook this flow has also been battle tested by hundreds of millions of users. In the last iteration we also focused on a product education component of the flow (while also wanting to satisfy users following a minimum quantity and quality set of accounts). I think it handles the qualitative (i.e. educational) and quantitative goals of a new user flow quite well. 3. Tumblr - their new user flow arguably starts with the logged out homepage. It's probably the most intelligent and elegant utilization of the homepage that I've seen in any major consumer technology product. It is optimized for increasing signup rates but clearly explains the value of the product to the user before they even register. The new user flow continues with the messaging that begins on the homepage. They are also battle tested in terms of volume of registrations that have gone through the flow.  If you're looking to improve your new user flow look at a few key metrics:  funnel view of completion rates by step and total completion ratesconversion rates of key steps (e.g. what % completed filling out their profile?)unique bounces in aggregate and per step (a good proxy for solving the ""why would I do this?"" part of the flow and instantly delivering relevance)conversion rate to active for cohorts of users 7 days, 30 days, 60 days after signup dateAnd some general rules of thumb for testing and optimizing your new user flow:  optimize for step rotation i.e. what you have as step 1 today may actually perform better when used as step 3 in the flow. Try shuffling the steps and looking at the outputkeep it focused on the core actions most predictive of the user becoming engaged (i.e. don't ask them for phone number simply because it gives you/your business value but instead freaks the user out and they decide to abandon the flow). Know when to ask for data like that. Asking for it immediately usually isn't the best choice.force the user to take actions e.g. don't allow them to click the logo in the header and ""escape out the flow"". It doesn't help them to skip the flow and it doesn't help your product/business either. You can also force actions by setting thresholds for completion (e.g. ""follow at least 'N' accounts!"" and then allow them to take the next step)if your flow is based on making recommendations to the user, then build underlying data services that make personalized recommendations. Personalization outperforms non-personalized recs. Think of signals you can aggregate at scale and use those services and algos to your advantage and to the user's benefit.consider extending the new user experience beyond just the new user flow. LinkedIn does a good job of this with their ""complete your profile"" module with a progress meter. It's game mechanics at its simplest/least cheesy but works very wellmake it fast. Google taught everyone this lesson. Don't forget it. A median page load for your product in the U.S. might be 1.5 seconds but it could be 4.5 seconds in Brazil. Latency kills conversion rates.Keep your calls to action above the foldThe list could go on, but those are some key points. 1.

The “pop” can be interpreted in many ways and in order to make it level, rock music or what we know as the music that originated from the rock sound is used as the control. Now that we’ve established the level, yes British music is superior to American music in several ways: Influence— British music which primarily generates from London and some of the other larger cities (Manchester, Liverpool, etc.) takes a great deal of influence from its urban factors, namely that many of these places hold various and rather significant demographics of multi-cultures, ethnicity and international flavors. While they may not be a direct source of inspiration for rock music the ingredients have contributed to the sound. Take the example of The Clash, whose guerrilla leftist political views were conveyed through the inflected genres of reggae, punk, disco, rap, Spanish and Asian influences. The Clash would have never formed in a country like the United States where cities don’t soak up and present the multiculturalism as they do in the UK. Not even New York which has churned out some great music has ever had a band that really represented the pluralistic side to the city.Band v. Artist— In the UK, the band trumps the artist and to no surprise UK bands have had a much more significant impact on pop culture than any American band. Bands in the UK don’t necessarily reflect the instrument as it does the members of the band. In other words, the sum is greater than the parts whereas in the United States it “appears” as if bands are showcased around a single element of attack. Classic guitarists such as Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Dave Navarro, Tom Morello, etc. are the crux to their band. Without them, the band does not exist. Conversely, many bands in the UK can have replacements and continue to progress forward with relative ease. A band like the Rolling Stones went through multiple lineup changes with 3 separate guitarists and continued to be successful although perhaps not at the same level. Likewise, bands like The Cure, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, have rotated a string of musicians in their careers. The music appears to be the end goal for these bands and no one musician is irreplaceable. Of course there are exceptions, i.e. The Beatles, The Police, The Smiths, Led Zeppelin. But by in large a UK band is about the music. American bands don’t seem to have the same conviction—and when they do it normally does not end well. There is too much emphasis on the vocals or instrumentation that gets in the way of the end deliverable. Guns N’ Roses, The Replacements, At The Drive-In, Sunny Day Real Estate, Jane’s Addiction— these bands split up as soon as acrimony was channeled by one person in the group. While that is NOT to say that it does not happen with British bands (The Verve are a great example) it does not happen as often as with their American counterparts barring examples of the death of a member in the band, i.e. Led Zeppelin and Joy Division.Melody Rules—English bands since the very beginning have had a strong tendency almost innate ability, to create melody which represents the band at its finest. And this goes back to The Beatles, who arguably created the need for the sweetness. Yes, melody is subjective and there is a certain amount of breadth one can provide when it comes to good sound compared to bad. But overall, the melody of ear-catching pop and/or structured chords that work outside of your typical chord progression is really what sets apart UK bands from their American counterparts. And it comes in many facets of compositions. The songs could be complex but still have excellent melody. Even older heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden who were scoffed for their theatrical macabre songs full of fight and despair, still managed to create some excellent melodic progression in their music. That same approach was used in 1st generation punk music in the UK. Yes, The Sex Pistols were loud and boorish. So were the Dammed and Gang of Four. But they still managed to apply hooks throughout their albums which made it much more appealing than other contemporaries.One Step Ahead of the Curve— UK rock bands for the most part have led the way in new cutting edge music. With the exception and respect to great American bands such as the Mothers of Invention (Frank Zappa), The Beach Boys, Hendrix, Pavement, Black Flag, The Velvet Underground, The Ramones, Nirvana and a short list of others, British bands tend to be trailblazer in new sounds. Think Cream, The Who, Pink Floyd, The Cure, Radiohead, The Beatles, David Bowie, Gorillaz, The Clash, Basement Jaxx, Black Sabbath. My control is that there are more genres in rock music which have been created by British bands compared to their American counterparts. They tend to lead and others follow.

Content curation has some cons that stop digital marketers from considering it in their content marketing strategy. Video curation solves some of these cons. For example, content curation makes you lose your traffic while video curation doesn't. How? With content curation, you aggregate articles from other people's websites. So when you share your curated content on your social media or other channels, you send your followers to a website that you don't own; this means you are losing your traffic. On the other hand, video curation allows you to embed a video into your website and then share it on your social media channels. For example, according to YouTube Policy, you can embed any YouTube video into your website as long as the video creator keeps it available for embedding. This way, you share the curated videos from your domain name, which means you send your followers to your website, where you can monetize your traffic. The idea that you can embed a video into your website and make a nice blog post out of that video without infringing copyrights makes video curation is much more beneficial to your business than content curation.

I can’t often rely on a friend passing on something they’ve discovered. I can’t as easily rely on radio listening (though I think with streaming this has become better.) One of the things I am doing now is following Bandcamp on Facebook, so that I see their recommendations. I don’t buy a lot of what I find there, but there has been more than enough to keep me happy when combined with what I am finding through other avenues. You need a certain level of curiosity about things that are different to maintain a long term interest in any form of art. A lot of what I listen to now I would have dismissed when I was young. It wasn’t what I considered worthwhile music (this covers electronic, folk, classical, and jazz, all of which I dismissed as boring or requiring no talent up until my early 20s or later.) Then there’s the fact that music changes. If your tastes don’t evolve along with it you won’t find yourself interested in what is different and new. There also has to be a willingness to let go of what you used to listen to. The longer you collect music, the less time you have to listen to *all* of it. When I was 20 it was much easier to listen through my entire collection on a regular basis. 26 years later it’s a lot more difficult and some things have necessarily fallen out of favor, not because I no longer like them (I do!) but because I’ve realized I need to spend enough time with the newer music to become familiar with it and I’ve listened to the older stuff so many times already. That’s not to say these artists never get listened to (well, a few just don’t) but they might get played 2 or 3 times (or less) in a year instead of (at least) 2 or 3 times in a week.

The curators pick the songs based on their imagination or intuition. They asked themselves how a particular song would sound like in a beautiful coffeehouse or what would make a customer go “Ohh, I like this song. Who is this?”.

Labels also generally have a Soundcloud or a Youtube Channel. Subscribe ! In deep house, I have been addicted to SMALLVILLE RECORDS (and their amazing artworks), and I recently discovered 100% Silk which is completely turning me on... 3) Youtube is awesome as a background radio but it's tough to discover new stuff and get out of the recommendation ""loop"". But their views count is a really good indicator of how ""underground"" is a track, and their matching algorithms are great at grouping things together, so hmm... The tough part is to get into the good Youtube part.  One way to go is to start on a track that has the feeling you want, that you know, like Pepe Bradock's Deep Burnt.   Typically you are already familiar with the tracks in the Youtube Mix. If not, well, congrats, you are going to discover lots of new stuff :)Assuming that you are, the trick is then to click on the least viewed video on the list on the what to what next panel. If it still is something interesting, repeat the process, if it sounds different from the mood you want to discover, go back and choose another one. Repeat the process until you are in in the level of undergroundness you like. I personally learn the most when I am under 2k views. You can also click on the people that uploaded the track you liked, they are usually music curators channels, and have specific tastes and collections. They can get you faster in the <10k part :) This deep house channel is really great callmeapineapple  4) Listen to DJ mixes and discover their tracklists. In disco/deep house, I don't believe there is a much better entry point than Boiler Room Move D B2B Optimo. Look for the first Youtube Comment.   5) There are many private facebook groups dedicated to music discovery in certain sub genres of House or Techno with specific rules regarding posting.

I have seen that growing online network of music platforms in the last decade have created striking data trends that indicate a resurgence in live performance and festivals.  Up-and-coming promoters create new festivals every year across the globe, either as new enterprises or as expansions of previously existing festivals. In the last twenty years, Insomniac Events, the largest electronic dance music (EDM) promoter in the world, has expanded its once one-day, L.A.-based Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) into a three-day extravaganza in Las Vegas that has since spread to five U.S. cities plus Puerto Rico, Mexico City, and London.  The Vegas EDC has demonstrated mass appeal in recent years; the 2012 festival attracted a sell-out audience of over 320,000 EDM lovers to share the experience.  Perhaps an even greater global force is Ultra Music Festival, a phenomenon first known as the Winter Music Conference that began in Miami in 1999 and has blossomed into an international festival on five continents in ten cities, including Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Ibiza, and Seoul.  We cannot discuss music festivals without mentioning Coachella Music and Arts Festival, a three-day, two-weekend excursion to the California desert that sells out nearly eleven months before the upcoming year’s festival, without even announcing its lineup.  Music lovers around the world prioritize seeing their favorite artists in concert, even at costs that range from $100 to $1000 per ticket.  How did live music become such a force?  When we analyze data, the answer becomes clear: recorded music does not sell like it used to.  It is intriguing seeing the impact that technology has had on how consumers chose, choose, and will choose to listen to music. While musicians still spend millions of dollars on studio time to record albums, those albums do not make as much in today’s market as they did only a few decades ago.  For the majority of the twentieth century, musicians made the lion’s share of their income off of selling records.  At the turn of the 21st century, however, the numbers show an enormous decline in record sales across the world.  Once the record sales hub of the globe, the United States has noticed trends indicating that music purchases have decreased dramatically over the last decade.  Of the approximate 100 albums to achieve the Recording Industry Association of America’s (RIAA) Diamond certification--those which have shipped over 10 million copies worldwide--a mere eleven have been released since the turn of the millenium in 2000.  Of these eleven albums, only six have been have been released in the 21st century in 2000, two by Eminem and one of which was 1, the compilation album of The Beatles, who released their last studio in 1970.  Of the ten top-selling albums of all time, the most recent, Garth Brooks’ Double Live, was released in 1998. Even at a global level, it is evident that albums do not sell like they used to.  Since album sales worldwide peaked at 785.1 million in 2000, sales have dropped consistently to an expected 271.5 million in 2014.  It should come as no surprise that the creation of Napster in 1999 coincided with the beginning of the end for physical album sales.  When websites could offer consumers access to free content, the choice of whether to buy or not buy was an easy one.  Other online platforms like Mediafire, The Pirate Bay, and Zippyshare are recent Napster substitutes that provide links to thousands of illegally-downloaded albums and songs, not to mention movies and TV shows.  Many contemporary artists get around piracy by offering free MP3 downloads for their fans for the price of a Facebook like or a share on Twitter.  Interestingly, the one exception to the decline in physical sales in that of vinyls, the sale of which increased in 2013 by 33.5%.  It must be that audiophiles would rather pay for high-quality music in LP form than pay for compressed CD files they could torrent for free.  Besides this exception, however, these trends indicate clearly that physical music sales, in CD and MP3 form, are on a steady downward trajectory. The overwhelmingly widespread practice of music piracy has led to shocking developments in income distribution amongst musicians.  A survey of 5,000 U.S. musicians showed that the average artist in America makes a mere 6 percent of his income off of record sales.  Among the other highest sources of earnings include 22 percent earnings off of teaching, 19 percent from playing in a professional ensemble, and 10 percent as a studio musician.  However, the highest source of income amongst these 5,000 musicians came from touring and live performance at 28 percent.  For musicians in the lowest income bracket, concerts and tours make up a whopping 40 percent of their annual income; making a living is nearly impossible in this income bracket without performing for a live audience.  The disparity in live and recorded music income is not limited just to the lowest-earning musicians.  Even amongst the top one percent of the highest-earning musicians in the world, record sales comprise only 25 percent of their income.  Despite the fact that artists like Coldplay and Adele’s albums reach platinum upon their release, they must promote these albums in performance and in marketing channels in order to get there and achieve the multi-million salaries they earn on an annual basis. These marketing channels can be traced directly to the rapidly rising availability of online streaming music.  YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, Rhapsody, and Grooveshark are a handful of reliable platforms on which artists make revenue off of people listen to their music via streaming or radio.  While these outlets do not pay the musicians much per stream, streaming music content has opened enormous channels for new listeners to enter the market.  “Despite shifts in how music is consumed, we see continued growth in overall music consumption,” says David Bukula, Senior Vice President of Industry Insights at Nielsen Entertainment.  This growth is evidenced by Nielsen and Billboard’s research, who found that online streaming grew 32% in 2013, reaching 118.1 billion music streams.  The booming live music industry is met at an ironic crossroads with the blowup of social media.  There are over 1 billion regular Facebook and 230 million Twitter users across the globe.  Over 20 percent of the world’s population can connect with millions of people on all seven continents with a button’s click.  While the Internet’s enormously popular use of illegal downloads has diminished digital and physical sales, it has also given thousands of musicians much-needed exposure. It should therefore not come as a surprise that concerts and festivals have become so popular across the world: the world itself is the largest platform for artists to expose their talents.  The growing festival atmosphere indicates the possibility that  music fans feel a sense of guilt for not buying their artists’ favorite music, and as a result have the urge to give money back to the artist by attending their shows.  I definitely fall into this category of fan.  While I find myself pirating a good amount of my favorite artists’ music, I feel it imperative that I go to at least two or three shows a month in the hopes of boosting the music industry in the most entertaining way possible: seeing my heroes perform live.  As a classical pianist, I have always loved the experience of performing for an audience.  While some find the live musical experience nerveracking, many musicians find it the truest form of communicating their emotions to their fans.  Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia once said: “We’re not performers; we are who we are for those moments we’re before the public...and that’s not always at the peak” (281).  The authenticity of live music counterbalances with the vast number of overproduced songs and albums we hear everyday on public radio everyday.  Getting back to our roots, to the times of only hearing Beethoven’s Ninth performed in a symphony hall, is essential to keeping the human spirit in music.  Noticing the expansions of festivals like EDC, Ultra, and Coachella, I believe the music world is on the right track to getting to that point once more.

This is my personal opinion and not necessarily that of my employer, Spotify.  First, two general clarifications to frame my argument.  1. People are different.  Some love music as part of a shared experience - the feeling of shared emotion, they clap, sing, & look at one another with a knowing smile. This can happen at gigs, watching TV Talent shows, or on the back of a bus with a mobile phone. Others love music as an insular emotion. The words are directly relevant to themselves only. At a gig, their blinkers come on and only they and the band exist. On the bus, their headphones are on LOUD, drowning out noise from the back seat.  2. How we share is key.  Music may be inherently social, but implementing that is not simple... ACTIVE sharing, when we deliberately take time and effort to share what we like, is an inherent human trait. It demands attention on both sides, and increases the content's value. PASSIVE sharing, an automated feed of things we're doing or engaging with, is not a human trait, its just annoying. It's white noise, shared without thought or consideration, that decreases the content's value. Why? Because music is not enjoyed when shared passively. Though some of us may blast music from our teenage bedrooms or pimped out cars, it is not appreciated by those on the receiving end. We want to scribble notes in CD's and lend to friends, carefully sequence a personal mixtape or playlist, and write about the songs we love for anyone who'll listen. Actively shared music arrives with context, and is therefore more valuable.   My Answer YES - some do care what their friends like, because for them music is a shared experience. Others do not, for them music is deeply personal.  But people can be both types at different times, and an audience sharing a gig or music event can be split between both types. Therefore, a music service must cater for both, all the time.  But more importantly, many do care what our friends like and what they're listening do WHEN THEY ACTIVELY SHARE IT.  The challenge for music services is to enable and encourage active sharing, whilst creating an eco-system where music can be enjoyed as a group and individually simultaneously.
