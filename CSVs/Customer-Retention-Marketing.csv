In terms of customer retention, not so sure about this, but obviously if we attract the right person in the right place then the chances of retention (stickiness) are higher. I believe in a strong onboarding sequence designed to get people fully up to speed on the product or services as quickly as possible. This will help with retention and should not be that intensive from a cost point of view. For example I send all my clients physical books & resources once they become a client, this has a cost to it but I find the my client love being so looked after in that first few days so the cost is well worth it in the long run for retention. These kinds of things will increase your retention, so measure your costs again the increase in retention and this should give you the value case/ROI.

Our answer would be customer retention. Those people, who consume your products, recommend your brand and services to friends and family are part of a primary structure that contributes directly to the success of any enterprise. If you usually buy something in the same store for two years and every time you make a new purchase but you get a different benefit. This makes you more than happy to continue shopping there. You are made to feel special, whether because of pricing, or quality , but the key is the offered customer experience. Retailers already know that betting on loyalty is a great way to retain customers, as well as having competitive prices and an efficient strategy that keeps track of customers who are most loyal to your business. The importance of loyalty The loyal customer represents 65% of a company’s turnover. Keeping those who already know your products and have a certain level of relationship with your brand is much cheaper than investing in new consumers. Here are some of the facts: By keeping a satisfied customer loyal your company adds more value to the business, creating brand authority at little extra cost.About 95% of unsatisfied customers will simply stop buying without giving a reason or a complaint. Attracting those customers who buy and do not return can bring more harm than profit in the long term.To win a new customer you will need to invest in marketing – that is something that is expensive. If your loyalty program is not implemented effectively, your business will not be able to retain consumers, who can opt for your competitor.3 Efforts to take into account when attracting new customers 1 More investment will be needed You will need to invest in marketing, training and ads to attract new customers. Within new customers there is no guarantee that any of them will return to your store without you implementing strategies and more investments. 2 There is a possibility of attracting the wrong customers If you do not plan a well-targeted campaign you risk attracting customers who will not add value to your business. Only a small part of the target audience will effectively convert more sales. 3 More effective care will be needed If you have not made a truly structured business plan, your business may not be able to respond to all requests you made. If you do not have a truly effective loyalty program within your company, the chances of the competition taking over your space will be much greater.

In one line I can answer your question. The answer is: At every part of the funnel, customer retention is included. But this is not so simple. Let me tell you a story. One fine day, Gautham was walking from his workplace to his house. He suddenly saw a board “Free dental check-up”. Since it was free, Gautham decides to visit the dentist for a free check-up. The dentist invites him with a smile and tells him to relax on a comfortable cosy dental chair in a chilled AC room. It was definitely a feel-good factor. “FREE” comforts. So the check-up was FREE The dental check-up; starts with a brief intro and Gautham already feels like he is at home. The doctor says that Gautham has very strong teeth. Gautham is happy. He then says Mr.Gautham, your teeth have a small cavity. However, it is in the initial stage. You may wish to wait but I do not recommend. Gautham is in his cosy mood, says let's do it. Not a problem. He fixes an appointment next week. Next week he visits the dentist and again a pleasant AC room and a comfy seat. As the filling process starts, the doctor says let us not take a risk of infection, we do a temporary filling. Gautham feels doc is so empathetic, and he agrees. Rs 500 is the bill. Next week, a second appointment was scheduled. Gautham will visit the same doctor because he trusts him as the doctor showed his empathy to Gautham. A permanent filling has been fixed. Rs 1000 is the bill. The doctor says all your teeth are completely healthy and you are good to go now. Then the doctor says, “Do you drink tea regularly”? Gautham says yes. The doctor says this is why your front teeth are brown. Seeds of fear have been generated. Gautham asks what now? I don't want these brown teeth. So the doctor says we are having a special “gentleman smile” offer, where we have a teeth whitening session for all the teeth including molar. Sounds good? Gautham agrees. Rs 2000 is the bill. Gautham is now happy with his white teeth. He thanks the doctor and steps out of his room. His assistant called Gautham and gave him a coupon. The coupon says, 10% discount for family members. From free check-up in the top of the funnel, Gautham pays 500 + 1000 + 2000 rupees. Not only that, as Gautham is now happy with his white teeth, but his wife will also now enter the funnel with the new discount coupon. Moral: Funnel has the potential to retain or throw out the customer at every stage. It can also bring more customers through referral at any stage given that you know how to sell your product/service",2021-03-05T08:52:18.596Z,"What part of the marketing funnel includes customer retention?

You can do it yourself or hire someone to help for less than a couple hundred dollars. And the results will blow your mind! Research at least 7 demographics and psychographics about your ideal prospect. You may end up having several groups of ideal prospects. Age, sex, marital status, income, own/rent, kids, grandkids, political party- all of the potential combinations for your product or service. Consider each group separately as you move to the next step. Research the compelling message you are crafting for each group. You can’t send them all the same message- it will turn everyone off. You want to target each group so they read your message and say ‘wow, that’s for me!’ And you can’t do that talking to a millennial guy, a professional single woman, and a boomer with the same discussion. Then research which media can deliver your compelling message. Every media is merely a delivery tool. FB might work for some, but not others. Instagram might work, while another group moves to action with snail mail or a postcard. By researching and targeting, you will stop sending 5,000 postcards with no results. Or spending $1000 on Facebook with zero conversions. Finally research which media can deliver your compelling message to your ideal prospect at a reasonable price.

We present you five strategies that can double customer engagement in 2019. Before reviewing your strategy, you need to understand that the digital world is constantly changing. So, it’s normal that your last year’s strategy won’t be as effective now. If you want to drive customer engagement, you need to know how and when to reach your customers. For example, Xenia-homes does an incredible job of engaging their customers from the moment that book with the vacation rental company.  xenia-homes You can start by leaving you multi-channel strategy behind and replacing it with an omnichannel marketing strategy. They might seem the same but they are quite different. Omni-channel Marketing is Critical Many business owners and marketers think that multi-channel marketing is an amazing strategy. After all, it allows you to push a message through different channels as many times as you want in order to reach as many people as possible. But how effective can that be? The omnichannel marketing strategy focuses on the customer’s journey and on delivering coordinated content. It’s all about creating a personalized experience to make sure the customer is engaged and ready to purchase. In fact, we’re currently working with Clementines to build a consistent omnichannel marketing strategy. This Pioneer square based shop sells one of the kind items for women. Our focus is to create personalized experiences for every single customer that makes a purchase.  Clementines However, this process requires different approaches. Every customer has different needs, which demand a customized approach. So, make sure to keep that in mind even if you have the best customer journey strategy in the world! Consistent Messaging Will Get Customers Attention There has never been as much content online as in 2019. You probably feel overwhelmed every time you get online. There are information and advertisement hosted by brands and organizations everywhere. Facebook murals, Youtube videos, even in your favorites games. It is true that certain marketing methods are not as effective as they used to be… But consistent messaging is still a great strategy to get your message out there. By being consistent, you are expressing how serious and dedicated you are about your brand.",2021-03-05T09:30:03.057Z,"How does one develop a good customer base and customer retention in retail when online is eroding the market by the day?

Also keep in mind this is based on a little 50 room hotel that is over 50 years old. Prior to our major renovation completed in June of this year, we put a small welcome basket with some snacks in each room, provided breakfast room service from our breakfast room, just to name a few. The breakfast room service was because our breakfast room was in a lower level that you could not get to without going down stairs (at the time no elevator) and it was to make it easier for guests who would have issues with the stairs.  After our extensive renovation where we literally gutted the hotel both inside and outside, we didn't have a need for the breakfast room service as the new breakfast room was on the main floor (plus we did add an elevator too) and we thought with all the improvements to the hotel, such as a fitness room, guest laundry, all new rooms, new bathrooms, etc. that the welcome basket might not be missed by our guests. Interesting to say the least that we've been reopened almost 5 months and only one guest has even commented about what happened to the welcome basket and free room service after they checked in (we did offer to bring them breakfast if they wanted). I was surprised by this. I expected a lot more feedback about it and was prepared to bring it back. I thought our surveys from guests would reflect it also. Contrary to expectations it didn't affect our survey scores, and actually our scores jumped through the roof on all categories after the renovation. So my conclusions are prior to all the new rooms & hotel we may have been below guests expectations and all the little extra's we did made up for that, then after our major investment in renovations where we blew people away with presenting a hotel far above their expectations that if they were a repeat guest didn't even notice or miss the couple of little things we no longer did. I would have expected a different conclusion but I was wrong. Needless to say, the couple of things that we no longer offered weren't missed by our guests but if it does get commented on in the future by repeat guests we can always easily add them back. Oh, I'd like to also mention that not only have our survey scores climbed through the roof, so has our revenue and occupancy, so the loss of what I mentioned had no effect on that either. So I guess I asked myself, as much as I travel too, do I remember hotels that do something extra special. Honestly, I remember the event like a housekeeper going and getting me a bottle of water, or a breakfast attendant giving me a bag of granola to snack on the flight home, but I'd be very hard pressed to tell you which hotel it was at. Just my observations and reflections. And we do impress our guests daily with our staff going above and beyond too...just like the other day a guest commented in their reservation they wanted two mints on their pillow upon arrival. Not something we do but our staff went and got mints just for this guest.

This is the same old adage being finally implemented: the customer is the most important thing. This is now becoming viral, and companies, retail and brick and mortar included, are understanding the importance of personalizing even the way you communicate with your customers. Now, automating everything that can help your company grow is THE way to go. Here are a few things on personalization and automation that you can keep handy: PERSONALIZATION IMPROVES CLARITY Your brand is made up of the small interactions that customers have with it, sort of like a mosaic. Though you, the artist, know how you want it to look, will all your customers, who can only see a tiny portion, understand what you’re trying to convey? If they don’t know what you’re selling, you’re not going to make any money. It’s imperative that brands have a consistent experience which links things together. With an authentic omni channel-integrated, personalized brand, a customer can understand it from any point of access. If someone started shopping on their laptop and want to finish the process on their phone, the experience needs to be the same. If it isn’t, that could mean one less sale. Additionally, you can’t disregard that data and pretend like it didn’t happen. The implicit data could mean that the user is showing your business to a friend or trying to use it in a new way, which could represent a new group of customers. Using Google as another example, someone might have been looking for vacuum cleaners while they were out on their iPhone. Google will remember that search, and then offer vacuum ads when they hop on their laptop. To not connect the dots or log the mobile search with their overall system is losing potential revenue for Google, which could have displayed new relevant ads to make more money. Tracking all aspects and interactions of customers with your brand will lead to a higher ROI. DIFFERENT CHANNELS A channel is any source of traffic coming to your business. Traditional digital channels include computer websites, mobile sites, social media presence, communities like Reddit or LinkedIn, ads, email marketing,apps, devices like beacons or Internet of Things (IoT). When marketing, it is important to have a comprehensive view of all channels. This channel fit doesn’t only matter to you; it matters more for your customers. If your target audience spends a lot of time on Instagram, it won’t make sense to spend your marketing budget for LinkedIn ads. Moving one step further with the Google example, understanding what channel people are choosing to interact with your brand is also crucial. Smart businesses never rely on one channel, as shifts beyond their control like Google changing their algorithm can completely devastate traffic. One way tracking channel data can lead to a higher ROI is by cross-pollination, or reaching new channels. Say you typically interact with a company solely through their website and emails. They should be tracking this data and using it to their advantage in their ongoing Facebook ad campaign. With this knowledge, they have the potential to show you content they know you’ll love, on a different channel. Since you like the brand and are a paying customer, you choose to watch one of their news feed videos, and maybe even share it. Bam. That share does something special. By sharing this video, you’re introducing the brand to all of your friends. Not only that, but you’ve recommended their content by liking and sharing it. This didn’t happen by mistake. Smart brands track data between channels to save on ad testing and deliver content that has already been proven to work. This is exactly how brands are getting more exposure, and in front of more customers. Knowing where customers hang out will increase your visibility to get you noticed on an untapped segment. If you know what your customers are doing on your site, it’s essential to send the right message to them to get them moving, and increase your bottom line. PERSONALIZATION + E-COMMERCE EXAMPLE = BEST FRIENDS If the last example of growing your brand by tracking email stats and then using them in ads may have seemed a little complicated, this e-commerce example will be a no-brainer.Any customer using an e-commerce site needs to log in to an account to put items in their shopping cart. This alone can give marketers a significant advantage for tracking data to be used for personalized content. Pairing this with the knowledge that 75% of online shopping carts are abandoned before checkout, you have an easy opportunity to make some additional sales. All those abandoned shopping carts may look like a digital ghost town; but, the truth is, there are lots of reasons for abandonment, and it usually isn’t because you’ve irritated them. Maybe they were running late, got distracted by their children, or other dinner was burning? As an e-commerce business owner, if you could stop this or get some of those lost carts to check out, would you? Of course. There’s no better or easier way to increase your ROI. Understanding your customers and using omni channel integration will make it easier than ever to bring those ghost carts back from the dead. It’s been proven time after time that sending personalized emails shortly after abandonment increases conversion anywhere from 8 – 20%. This is something as simple as showing what items were in the abandoned cart. This, the simplest of cross-platform integrations is a simple tactic can lead to great results. WHAT IT ALL MEANS It’s important to understand that the more you know about your customers, the better you can market to them. This means that integrating data from all of your different channels can help get a clear image and connect the dots of your brand mosaic. This ultimately allows you to make data driven decisions that will help your bottom line. Tracking multiple channels, on multiple platforms, analyzing the data and making informed decisions to increase ROI is a job for a full marketing team if you want to do it properly. Luckily, our team at NectarOM has had lots of experience with this. We’ve knocked it out of the park for industry leaders like Michael’s, Vitamin World and many more. Our track record speaks for itself. If your business is at the point where you have traffic and sales but know it can be brought up to the next level, consider getting in touch to see how we can help. If you take one thing away from this, it’s that personalization is one of the best ROIs out there, with a significant shift happening industry wide, pushing towards complete omni channel personalization.

It should however be stressed that the definition of what a cross-border worker exactly is may vary from one field to another (e.g. tax law, right of residence, welfare entitlements)[2] The last freedom is largely encapsulated in the Citizen’s Rights Directive 2004/38/EC, which is applicable to all EEA Citizens (including countries like Norway, Iceland, et al.) and the Treaty of Rome which sets the rules for the Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union principle. As such, being a member of any of these bodies (the Single Market, Customs Union, EEA) obliges the member to the Free Movement of Persons principle. Its an All or Nothing Proposition… That said, there is nothing preventing 3rd nations from establishing their own Custom’s Union arrangement with the EU. The Custom’s Union between Turkey and the EU is an oft cited example as it does not feature Freedom of Movement. However, this union did require Turkey to adjust tarrifs and Duties to match the EU and is recognized to have a net beneficial effect on Turkey’s GDP. For the UK to opt-out of Freedom of Movement, it would have to establish it’s own Trade Agreement/Custom’s Union with the EU. I imagine that the compromises the UK will have to make to meet this requirement could potentially evaporate any perceived advantages of freedom of Movement, as I am not aware of any special leverage the UK can use.

Before starting let me make it very clear that the price of various ingredients may vary according to availability but they are reasonable and accurate according to my knowledge. (Basically, there won’t be many variations) Let's look at the price at which packed roasted channa is being currently sold in the market 250 rs per kg. From basic math, we can make it that a kg of chana would cost around 250 rs per kg in retail prices. Price in wholesale would obviously be different but believe me, it won’t be less than rs 160–180 per kg.) Let us look at manufacturing cost:- The price of high-quality roasted channa per kg is approximately 75rs per kg.- here roasted channa means plain channa which we eat and this could be much cheaper if we buy in huge bulk quantities. Then afterward we can improvise it.  Cost of ingredients would be around a maximum of 20 rs. per kg- Mainly ingredients include Salt, Edible oil, Sugar, Onion powder, Preservatives, Garlic powder, etc other things according to your taste. Now I am not going to explain each and every ingredient according to the specified gram required and the cost I have estimated is roughly accurate and variation of 5 rs can come. Value-added services would cost you around 10–15 rs. per kg - Services such as labour cost, electricity, packaging, and storage come under these type of services and there might be some other cost which hardly matters. If I calculate the total cost of the above product assuming that the best quality ingredient and other all conditions are taken into account then it will cost 115rs/kg maximum. Calculating tax on the above item which is 5%(Reduced GST rate on Roasted Gram) so after paying tax also it will cost you around 121 rs per kg. So, it is being sold in the market for around 250 rs per kg and its manufacturing cost is just 121 rs kg, hence a profit of around 100%. Now, imagine if you could manufacture this channa on a very large scale this would certainly lower your manufacturing cost by 10–20% again a profitable situation. But here comes the challenge it is a little easy to acquire raw products and manufacture this but when it comes to marketing and selling its bit a lengthy process because the market of this product is too much fragmented and lot of work needs to be done in building a brand besides this you also can’t directly sell it to retailers you have to find wholesale dealers which is again a headache. So, we can conclude that an easily 50–60% return on investment can be made but one needs to work a lot to make his space in this market and sell his product.

A good sign !What most of the music players lack is a good UI, So these two things were my ways of getting downloads.# A good UI# A general purpose app During the days I was developing the app,I used to read blogs while in bed,before going to sleep.The articles were about Business,entrepreneurship, apps etc.I developed a habbit of never giving up on something ,if I BELIEVED it would work !  Since I was just a college student, I didn't have any money to advertise.However I managed some money for other things like screenshots ,video,website icon etc etc from  1. The selling point for my app was the UI/UX. And for me the presentation was everything. I knew I was short on budget,and I wanted to convert every click into a download (there is a high probability that if a person clicks on the link,he may not download it because of poor presentation )So good,professional looking screenshots were important so for that I needed a photoshop professional.I hired a guy from freelancing websites. Now I asked around the rates for an icon. It came out to be 20$.There are a limited number of repeations  a person would make for 20$I thought the best way to get as many ideas for the icon would be by holding a contest for 40$(double of the normal rates)the reason for the double price is,it seems like an opportunity to people that they can earn more than  usual  so they put in  extra effort. Because there is this chance to ""win"".I got about 60-80 ideas for the music player/ audio player ,I didn't like any of them.I awarded the contest to a good freelancer on a condition that he will be making more repitions for me. Here is the freelancer guy i hired for icon,screenshots etc etc[url]Page on freelancer.com I paid the guy 50$ for 5 screenshots. Now you can get even better rates for screenshots from Get everything you need starting at $5It is highly unlikely that you will get some one good, for the icon from fiverr,but get your screenshots done from fiverr,it will be cheaper. I then hired a guy for the video.If someone does't know the rates around,he  may end up paying 150-400$.There are websites from where  templates can be bought for a lot of things . http://Videohive.net is a website I got my template from. I purchased a 25$ template,hired a guy for 40$ to do the changes to it.(His fees was 20$)So the whole video was done for 65$Here is the guy i hired for the videohttps://www.facebook.com/edvinas.janusauskis?fref=ts[/url]  2 I got fake facebook likes(40,000 likes for 40$ people are real but they don't come to know when they liked the page,there are scripts for fake facebook likes) as I thought it can be used as an audience,but turns out it was a waste,as facebook has changed it algorithms,and a post's visibility only increases if it gets enough momentum(i.e comments and likes).And it is quite obvious that no one would be interested in a post from a page which they never liked themselves.The post never reached 40,000 people which was my intended target.	 3. I wrote the description,optimized for ASO.There are websites for SEO (or ASO ,app store optimization)like sensor tower which can be used for figuring out which keyword to use.Here are the general rules of ASO # A keyword should be 5 times in the description.# Put the keyword in the name# Put the keyword in the package name. 4. I Added 1000+ friends on facebook from my college before the launch5. I launched the app.6. I gave credit to my new facebook friends  on how they were so supportive and accepted my random friend requests ,after that I  sneaked in the download link with very proffesional  images. People like to take credits for no reason ,just like they want to feel good and superior and want to be a part of something, without any reason,I exploited it.7. The early downloads and reviews were quite important8. My friends  reviewed and downloaded.About 200-300 of them.9. Just after I launched it,I changed my schedule and started sleeping 9 hrs in 2 days .i.e 4.5 hrs a day,with 3 hrs of sleeping shifts.i searched for lists of websites which review android apps.Sent them a copy pasted message and often making intentional mistakes while typing the subject like ""Android 'ApP' Review"",to get their attention as you are not the only one sending them emails. we tried to make it look as professional as we could.But tried to keep the message friendly.I posted them 100 each day.Here is the list if incase anyone wants to use it.https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rskjnqn2ai70v4g/AACGfKZAqVsIu0vcMCnYPb7ca?dl=0 10. Posting on facebook groups.The post here doesn't have to be professional and the screenshots should not look professional,if they are ,(these screenshots were differnt from the ones one the app page) you will give an impression that your app comes from a company and it won't appear as a personal request but like an advertisement, which you don't want.I posted them 100 each day. Got about 2000 downloads from such posts.Telling stories was helpful. No one wants to listen about your organization,your culture etc but instead they  like stories ,Very little about the app, focusing more on how the app looks. 11. Sending messages to youtubers to review it. I used to click   their about page and I used to drop in a copy pasted  message.This is what i used to do,Target keywords like ""android apps"" ""android"" ""technology"" ""android app review"" ""best apps""Search the keywords on youtube and sort the results by channels and open their about page and drop a message.I didn't spare any channel.The  message shouldn't be longer than 4-5 lines.This used to be my content.""Hi would you be interested in making a review video for my app?This is the  app linkhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitsie.playmee.musicplayer.freeIt is a music player / audio player,and what's different about is the UI. It is something which you wouldn't have seen before.Regards,Ankit.management@playmee.org  Then posting on their new videos ,asking people to try it and asking the channel owner to review it. I posted them 100 each day or maybe more.I even posted on new videos of PEWDIEPIE etc etc so that people can see it.I targeted all the famous people's videos,becuase they get millions of videos.I knew if i get a few hundred upvotes,my app would get ten thousands of likes.I haven't yet come across a way to get likes on my comments. 12. Posting on reddit,forums, qoura etc.Got about 700 downloads from there  I did this for 20 days.Got about 15,000 downloads within the first 20 days.Even after trying so much,all i got was 15,000 installs within 20 days.(or 30,dont remember)  I was exhausted and i knew I needed a more sustainable way of getting downloads. I was getting 300-400 installs a day and I knew I won't reach my target with thatSo i started experimenting a lot. Like I used to spam on quora,and realized how it can improve the ranks.I started targeting good keywords and my main source of downloads has been ranking within top 10 for the keyword ""music player"" which helped me  achieved a rank in top  20's for all the main keywords like audio player,mp3 player,player etc etc These days the app gets 9000-12,000 downloads a day, all because of ASO (a new business which i have started).",2021-03-05T09:37:01.241Z,"How should I allocate my marketing budget in order to increase customer acquisition and retention?

Offer valuable product-focused content and information.First impression counts..., and so do all the ones that come afterwards. ;) Being able to find product information quickly is a huge time and effort saver for buyers. If you give them good product-related content (descriptions, technical data, images, videos, downloadable materials...). This content has to be well-optimized so that it is easy to find it in search engines and marketplaces; you will be gaining many points in a vital aspect that many brands still do not care about. Inspire confidence in the purchasing processIf you are selling through third-party channels, always choose marketplaces you trust yourself, and so do your users. If you also use your own sales channels, such as website and mobile app, offer excellent web security, easy payment gateways, and transparent delivery policy. Make your buyers feel informed and cared about so that they want to make repeat purchases. Take care of your brand image.Spreading and supporting a good brand image through your communication and digital content is essential for consumers to get a good idea of you. Because in many cases, the perceived image of your products becomes more important than the actual value of the products (which explains many examples of consumer fanaticism, such as loyal Apple customers). Create a loyalty programThis option depends on your business type, as it doesn’t fit all types of products or services (although you can always be creative). A loyalty program or club aims to bring together the most loyal customers, have them identified to create dedicated campaigns for them. All these efforts aim to encourage their purchases and retention through a system of points, special promotions, or partnerships with other companies to offer discounts and complimentary gift services. Customize retention extrasLoyal customers should be treated with care since they are a precious asset for any company. This means that it is better to apply customized strategies for each and every customer you want to keep. For example, one of the most powerful growth paths is to apply cross-selling and up-selling suggestions on products purchased most often by each customer. Those suggestions must always be tailored to each buyer to convince them in a suggestive way, not by imposing promotions far from their interest.

If not, it could be because an email marketing campaign can seem pretty intimidating from the outset. I’ll try and break it down for you as best I can. I always suggest running both an inbound and outbound campaign simultaneously. This will allow you to maximize your potential reach and, hopefully, improve your overall conversions. An inbound campaign is what you would send to people who have opted-in to receiving your marketing emails. They found you organically though your blog/content and signed up to receive your email newsletter. These people are obviously primed to hear from you and are likely to engage with your offerings, but building an organic list this way can be a slow process. An outbound (or cold) campaign goes out to a list of people who haven’t heard of you before that you likely purchased from a data provider. It takes a little more convincing with this audience to get them to engage, but the beauty of a cold email campaign is that you’ll be sending to a wide list of people in one shot. Some purchased lists can reach up to multiple thousands of contacts. An inbound campaign takes less watching over. Presumably, you’ll know what kind of content these contacts want to see because they’ve converted on a piece of content you’ve written. You’ll want to nurture them slowly until they’re ready to make a buying decision. Always guide them back to your website where you’ll have calls to action and internal links to guide them around. Check in on your inbound email list every now and again to ensure you aren’t sending to too many old email addresses, as too many bounces might trigger a spam filter. There are a few things to keep in mind with an outbound campaign. · Use the right tool for the job. Traditional ESPs are incapable of sending to a cold list of contacts, especially a large one. Clickback MAIL was designed from the ground up to carry out cold email campaigns, and does so using its own IPs so your sender score remains intact. · Keep your contact list clean. Always purchase your contact list from a reputable data provider. Still it’s worth it to clean your list before you send your campaign. Purchased lists can contain old email addresses, bad data, and spam traps which can land you on a blacklist. Being that these lists are often much larger than your average inbound list, it’ll be quite the task to stay on top of its cleanliness yourself. Clickback MAIL features a built-in email verifier that will clean your list before you send your campaign. · Don’t be spammy. This sounds obvious, but there are tons of words, phrases and design choices that can trigger spam filters and send you to the junk folder instead of the inbox. Clickback MAIL features a live spam checker that will remove any such practices for improved deliverability. Remember, just because you’re running a cold campaign, doesn’t mean you have to come across as cold. Just like you would with an inbound campaign, develop a buyer persona and target them with your email and landing page content. Never make the email about you or your sale…it’s always about the recipient and how you can solve an issue they might be having. Develop a cadence that’s going to work for your recipient as well. This will come as a result of much testing and experimentation. Don’t be scared, email marketing is just another tactic to have in your digital marketing arsenal.

The ‘ultimate’ (or any) strategy depends on the life cycle of the business. So much about ‘ultimate’, now to the question: Retention is a very good growth strategy for most established businesses, because it alone contributes to all (often conflicting) customer objectives. Which are they? There are only 3 things any business must do with its customers. Nothing more - just these three: Get customersKeep customersGrow customersTranslated from plain English into business-speak, these are Acquisition, Retention and Customer Development (value growth). Apart from the obvious cost difference (people blindly quote unchecked sources that differ from 5% to 5 times (!) cost difference - but whatever the numeric value, retention ‘per-capita’ is always cheaper) - Retention automatically generates advantages in the other 2 areas: It helps Acquisition because retained customers share their satisfaction and boost the brand reputation (indirect contribution), and often refer prospects form their personal networks (direct contribution). Those referred acquisitions do not need the high marketing and sales cost of others, who never heard about your company.It helps Value Growth (cynically called cross-sell and up-sell for ‘wallet share’) because long-term relationships provide better insight into customer needs, which you may profitably satisfy. At the same time, the relationship builds trust and increases the acceptance of your better targeted and needs-based offers.Do the Retention right, and you will experience better acquisition and customer development rates, organically and without extra effort or spend. = = = = = = = Caveat: nobody said that you always want to retain all your customers. Not equally, at least: If you correctly segment your existing customer base by lifetime value, there are customers you want to retain ‘at any cost’. Because the investment in providing a better experience, privileges and pampering, gift and surprises - is always worth it, considering the profitability of those customers (and the value loss, should they churn).Then there may be some which you don’t want to retain at all. In every multitude there is a ‘reverse Pareto’ - just like a minority contributes to the majority of your profits, another minority contributes to the majority of your losses (offsetting much of the others’ profit). Some companies deliberately try to get rid of them - or at least do not spend a penny on their retention.The bulk majority between the above is not homogeneous. It can further be segmented into additional levels of desirability and therefore - differentiated retention strategies…But here we go into the ocean of the broader Customer Relationship Management discipline (nothing to do with some software called CRM, btw ;) Happy to answer any questions triggered by the story so far.",2021-03-05T09:43:09.877Z,"Why is customer retention the ultimate growth strategy?

Keeping existing clients happy is vital for the success of any business, but it’s especially important in the SaaS industry. In fact, a study by Bain & Co shows that a 5% increase in customer retention leads to 75% higher profitability for a SaaS company. As such your marketing plan should focus on customer acquisition cost as a KPI for marketing, as well as customer lifetime value and churn as KPIs in customer relationship management.Know your customer.

First, on a related topic, I find the Cennydd Bowles ""User Experience Validation stack"" very helpful when it comes to making design decisions. The article is here: http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/winning-a-user-experience-debate/ In the article he describes the ideal way to make a design decision (and measure ROI):  The top tier shows your most powerful ally: data gleaned directly from users, such as usability testing or usage metrics. When you want to win a debate, see if user evidence supports your argument. Did the design test well? Do the figures show that people are using the site in the way you’d expect? If you ran usability tests before the design review, this extra information will give a good design a stronger chance to survive critique. He makes the point that you should only go to the other tiers (design principles and theoretical principles) if you don't have data.  So how do you define the right data for the project? I think that the first step is to show real cases where design has made an impact. A good case study is the $300 Million Button by Jared Spool: http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2009/01/14/uietips-300-million-button/. This can be used as an example to get your stakeholders to believe in the power of design, to give you a chance to prove that it works. When it comes to defining success metrics on a project by project basis, it is important to get the metric as close to revenue as possible. In some cases this might be easy (a redesign of the checkout process should directly result in increased revenue), and in other cases it will be harder (how do you measure the revenue impact of search or registration redesigns?). In the harder cases funnel conversion flows are often the way to go. For search, what is the conversion from the search result page to the detailed product page for your top 100 keywords? For registration, what is the drop-off from each page to the next? Even though this isn't a direct revenue metric, it is usually (1) easily measurable, and (2) closely related to revenue because increased conversions should result in additional revenue. Another way to think about this is that you make money by increasing the 3 A's: Acquisition - getting new users into the siteActivation - getting those new users to make their first purchaseActivity - getting those first-time buyers to come back for moreAs long as design decisions can be shown to increase at least one of the 3 A's, it should be reasonably easy to prove the ROI of design.

The CRM, essentially a database, stores all relevant information related to your customers. When you study and analyze these data, you’ll be able to see patterns and trends that can point you to the right business strategies. For instance, compiling data about your customers’ profiles can give you a better view of your market segmentation. That can give you ideas on how to tune your marketing strategies to reach your target customers. You can modify promos and your messaging to better suit the market segments you have. CRM data also aids in customer retention, as your CRM records transactions and keeps notes of these conversations. That means you can monitor the stage of the life cycle the customer is in and their sentiments about your product. If you have an advanced CRM that tracks social, you can even read comments they make about your brand on social media. That knowledge can alert you to the customer’s state of mind and will enable you to counter possible defections with other strategies. These are just some applications of CRM data.

You can benchmark retention in two ways: Against your company, meaning that you need to measure against your company’s performance week after week and month after month, which will help to reveal trends.Against your competitors, meaning you have to compare your performance against theirs, although such data is rarely publicly available. Still, it is possible to use various reports available on the web.For example, Mixpanel’s report which analyzed anonymous data by one billion users states that for most industries average eight-week retention is below 20%.

The barebones effort here is to put social buttons in your emails to customers to encourage them to share from there. If you want to get more advanced, though, try creating a social community around your brand. A few makeup brands do really well at this. They create an Instagram hashtag that they encourage customer to post their makeup looks to. The community interacts with each other within the hashtag, and the makeup brand rewards the posters by sharing the best looks (which gives the original poster a boost in followers).Give your customers educational information. Customers who know how to get the full use out of their purchases are the most satisfied. Include how-to videos, styling cards or other helpful information right into the receipt, or in follow-up emails.Send a thank you note. Customers love being appreciated. Whether you send a handwritten note in the box with the items, or set up an email track that sends a note, a thank you is a solid way to re-engage a customer.Send a replenishment reminder. If you’re selling items that eventually run out (like shampoo), create an email track that reminds customers to repurchase the item when its close to running out.Ask them to write a review!There are a few more tips in the post itself, but these 5 are the most important. I think its best to remind yourself that re-engaging customers is not about making another sale (at least, not immediately). Rather, you should be focused on adding value to your customer’s life.

My last three ventures have involved B2B business development into traditional industries. Full of heirarcy and process and conflicting internal incentives and politics. I controlled none of these factors and knew dwelling on them yielded nothing. What I did control was being in motion on an idea. And this breaks down to two practical activities: Making product and selling product. For the most part being in motion on making product is relatively straightforward. There are a few but not many external dependencies and for that reason product managers and engineers can get on with making. Creating momentum on sales is very different because of the vast external factors at play. At some point however the rate of sales needs to eclipse the rate of product development. Instead of focusing on the uncontrollable factors at my prospective customer organisations I formed a habit for mapping a web of connections (all sourced via LinkedIn and press releases) to understand how to forge a path to decision-makers. I treated getting a meeting with the decision maker (and I still do) as an intriguing mystery to be solved. I set myself (as I now do my teams) one week to map and engage with different parts of target organisations. We make it a priority to deliver value at each conversation and in return more intelligence is gained and we meet more potential future advocates of the brand we’re building. Framing BD as a detective exercise has accelerated the speed at which I find myself in meetings with people who decide on deals, the type of deals that change the growth trajectories of startups.

Clearly, any business that loses a large number of customers each year is simply throwing money away. That’s mostly because it is much easier to sell to existing customers than it is to continuously go after new ones. Did you know that the average value of a lost customer is $243? This means that every customer retained can increase the revenue of your business by $243, which is quite a large number if you think about it. 1. The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%, while the probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20%. The fact is that selling your products and services to existing customers is much easier than trying to sell to new customers; so it certainly seems strange that so many businesses choose to go after new customers all the time and practically ignore the ones they already have. If someone has bought from you before, they are already aware of your business and, providing the customer had a good experience, a degree of trust has been established between both parties. Just think about what happens when you go to buy a new product yourself and you have lots of brand choices in the market. If there is a brand available that you have bought from previously (and were completely satisfied with), you’ll tend to buy from that same brand again. 2. It costs at least 5 times more to acquire a new customer than retain an existing one. In order to acquire new customers, most companies spend a lot of money on different marketing strategies. Whether it’s content marketing, Facebook advertising, newspaper advertising or TV/radio ads, successfully marketing to new customers can work out be extremely expensive. By comparison, marketing to existing customers often requires much less time and money because you already have them in the door. In addition, you can gather useful information about your long-term customers and use it to manage marketing budgets and campaign-spend more efficiently. 3. A 5% increase in customer retention can increase a company's profitability by 25-100%. By boosting customer retention, you can significantly increase the profits of your business. When you factor in the lower costs involved with retaining customers vs. dishing out large amounts of money to acquire new ones, the difference can be an instant profit booster. If you want to improve the profitability of your business, you must concentrate on improving customer satisfaction and making your overall offering as good as it can possibly be. When a business is able to instill confidence in the customer’s mind about its brand, the outcome ultimately is an increase in revenue and profit earning capacity. If implemented in the right way, customer retention programs and initiatives can be of great benefit your business. 4. 80% of your company's future revenue will come from just 20% of your existing customers. This number is quite astonishing if you really think about it. A major chunk of a company’s revenue comes from existing customers. On average, loyal customers buy from you more often – and they also spend more money on purchases in the long run. Customer-centric marketing is the key today for the long-term survival of any business. Even if your business increases customer retention by even the smallest of margins, you can dramatically increase the revenue you generate. 5. For every customer who complains, there are 26 customers who don’t say anything. If someone has a complaint, the chances are that a lot of your customers feel just as dissatisfied about the same thing, but choose not to say anything to you. Not hearing a bunch of complaints may sound like a good thing, but this is not always the case. Therefore, even one small complaint can alert you to serious failings in your business that need to be addressed. If your business wants to boost customer retention and loyalty rates, you absolutely MUST take every complaint seriously and use it as an opportunity to improve your overall offering. Customer complaints provide you will valuable insights into how your business can improve your products and customer service. By finding these issues and solving them, a business not only builds up better relationships with customers but also sets itself apart from its competition. Ultimately, improving customer satisfaction will lead to increased loyalty, more revenue and better profitability. 6. 82% of customers have left a company because of a bad customer service experience. No business sets out to offer bad customer service, but many times, customers leave a brand in favor of something better. Bad customer service happens when a business loses sight of what’s important to providing a great overall customer experience. Bad service moments are unavoidable for any business, but this can be dealt with through good service recovery. If customer service is an issue in your business, you should carefully consider what is needed to improve things. You might shuffle responsibilities, or you might take on new staff to increase the number of people dedicated to providing customer care. 7. 91% of unhappy customers will not do business with you again. Statistics show that most businesses fall short of reaching customer expectations for a myriad of reasons. But it is critical that these reasons are found and addressed as soon as possible to cut down on the potential damage it could do to your bottom line. Given the fact that nearly every customer who is unhappy will not do business with you again (this is mostly true in situations where customers are not getting any help with their problems), your top priority has to be customer satisfaction. If your business falls short on providing a good level of basic customer care, it’s time to take action right now to turn that around. Furthermore, for those customers who choose to stick around even if they’re unhappy, it takes about 12 positive experiences to make up for one unresolved negative experience. 8. 47% of customers would take their business to a competitor within a day of experiencing poor customer service. If a business offers exceptional products and services, customers are bound to stay loyal to the brand. The problem nowadays is that retaining customers can be difficult thanks to a growing amount of competition in the market and a surge of better products coming up every single day. A single bad experience on your part could send your customers running to your competitors… never to return. The best way to ensure customer retention is to put your customers first at all times. Getting to know your customers on many different levels is key. Once you know who they are and what they like/dislike, you will be more equipped to satisfy them overall. 9. 67% of customer churn is preventable if the customer issue was resolved at the first engagement. It doesn’t matter how fantastic your service generally is, there are going to be times when something bad happens and the customer is less than 100% satisfied. While customer issues are sometimes unavoidable, the way that you then deal with the issue is actually the most critical part. If the issue is rectified quickly and the customer sees that you have gone ‘above and beyond’ in dealing with the problem, they are going to gain a positive impression of your company - and highly likely to stay loyal to your business. Contrast that with a business that provides a poor customer service experience and fails to solve the problem in an efficient manner. Clearly the customer is going to take their future business elsewhere. Keeping your customers at the forefront of your operations is critical. This includes addressing problems, responding to questions, and acting on feedback in a quick manner. 10. Consumers tell an average of 9 people about good experiences and tell 16 (nearly two times more) people about poor experiences.  A multiplier effect is very common in customer service experiences. What this means is that customers have a tendency to speak about their respective experiences with a brand, both good and bad – and they are likely to shout the loudest about bad experiences. 11. 80% of companies say they deliver ""superior"" customer service. Only 8% of people think these same companies deliver ""superior"" customer service. Going by the numbers provided in the above statistics, it was clearly concluded that most companies have no clue as to what the customers want. So not only are they drowning in assumptions about what their company’s customer service is like; they also have no knowledge of their customers’ expectations. There is clearly a huge gap here between perception and reality. The answer to this dilemma is quite simple. By focusing on the right kind of measurements and relying on actual data, the pathway to positive customer connections can be met. 12. Resolve a complaint in the customer's favor and they will do business with you again 70% of the time. This really goes back to the point we made earlier about how resolving customer issues quickly and efficiently creates a positive experience and can make a customer loyal to your brand, despite the fact they initially experienced an issue. Satisfying the needs of your customers is not an easy task, but it is one that every business needs to try and find a resolution for. Resolving a complaint in the customer’s favor will help to ensure that they do business with you again, and this is true 70% of the time. There are usually two aspects to complaints from consumers. One is rational and the second is emotional. Resolving complaints requires dealing with both of these aspects for the best results. 13. 77% of consumers like it when brands demonstrate their appreciation. It is a general human tendency to want to be appreciated, and this holds true in business scenarios as well. When your customers feel appreciated, they are more likely to continuously do business with you. The question is: how do you cultivate the sort of culture that brings back customers? A study by TD Bank polled more than 1,000 consumers in the US and found that most people think it’s best that companies convey direct interaction with them. Consumers across all age groups said that one way that appreciation should be conveyed is by simply saying “thanks” directly to them. 14. More than half of customers would consider increasing the amount of business they do with a company for a loyalty reward, and 46% already have. Loyalty programs are one of the best ways to boost customer retention and loyalty levels. By providing people with an incentive to stay loyal to your brand, they are much more likely to make repeat purchases and spend more money with your company. Customer loyalty programs let your customers know that you value their business. They are a great way to increase the relationship between your business and its customers; ultimately, this leads to more spending down the road. 15. 60% of mobile coupon users say they will “gladly switch brands to use a coupon.” Many consumers are highly price sensitive, meaning that they will gladly switch brands if a cheaper discounted offer comes along. A research paper by GfK MRI called The Survey of the American Consumer found that 60% of mobile coupon users would switch brands in order to use a coupon, which clearly shows that these people have little or no loyalty to the brands they buy. In a nutshell, coupons are a great way to boost sales and keep more customers coming back. The psychology behind them is extremely powerful, which has been proven over the decades. Therefore, consider adding mobile coupons to your customer retention strategy if it fits the mold of your business. 16. 80% of U.S. Gen Z consumers are willing to sign up for loyalty cards in exchange for deals/discounts. There is a big potential payoff for companies that are willing to cater to the high maintenance crowd in the 21st century. For Gen Z, loyalty programs today are not just about freebies but rather being part of a special community. Signing up for these programs automatically makes customers use their benefits and get exclusivity in services such as free shipping, exclusive perks, and big discounts. Companies love this trend since it creates a positive feedback loop that gets members spending more and makes it less likely for customers to take their business elsewhere. 17. 25% of employers have seen an increase in customer loyalty after increasing employee educational requirements. The value of higher education in the workplace has been on a steady rise. In recent years, many organizations have significantly increased their educational requirements for hiring new employees. Potential employers have now realized the need for educated and qualified individuals because they help serve customers better in their shopping experience. This directly leads to higher customer retention levels. More innovation and increased customer loyalty are the two main benefits of having highly-qualified individuals work for your company. So this is something that should be strongly considered if your employee-base has room for improvement. 18. 27% of small business owners estimate that 11-20% of first-time customers don’t return to their business. Every small business nowadays knows the importance of customer retention and the paradigm is finally changing towards applying marketing strategies to evolve with competition. A lack of resources still forces many small businesses to not operate on the scale of big businesses who have more resources at their disposal. Increasing the return rate of these first-time customers for small businesses would have a dramatic impact on their revenue, which is why customer loyalty programs are seeing an increase in popularity and adoption over the last few years. 19. 48% of consumers cited SMS as their preferred means of receiving loyalty messages, followed by email (22%) and app notifications (20%). It is definitely important to be aware of how consumers like to receive communications from your business these days so you can use the most effective channels. Despite this, many businesses continue to assume customer preferences and thus miss out on big opportunities. SMS stands for “Short Message Service,” which is also known as Text Message Marketing. It’s generally used when sending short message to mobile devices. Research has shown that while SMS is the preferred messaging channel for loyalty programs, only 21% of brand marketers were actually using it as a means of communicating with their customers. Therefore, you should definitely use this method if you are running a loyalty program. Not only does it instantly connect you with your customers, it’s a powerful way to send in a flood of sales without doing a lot of additional work or ad-spend. 20. 57% of brands indicate that they will increase loyalty program budgets going forward. Businesses are spending ever-increasing amounts of money on loyalty programs and retention initiatives. But while this is happening, many marketers are also still struggling to figure out exactly how this should fit into their overall marketing strategy. One thing is for sure; as more companies jump on the loyalty train, competition will stiffen for any company that is not doing anything to keep their existing customers happy and coming back.",2021-03-05T09:51:13.546Z,"Why is customer loyalty important?

I agree with you that this could be another reason.Depending on a customer's reason for wanting to return a product, Amazon may have agreements with the manufacturer whereby the manufacturer automatically credits Amazon for defective products etc. This is just a hypothesis, as I'm not a retail expert.As to your question whether this will breed dishonest behavior, I'm not sure it would... first, Amazon doesn't mention anything about not having to return a product and still getting a credit on your purchase on their website, which is the first step to prevent people from gaming the system. Second, it seems they're doing this on a case-by-case basis; it's not a blanket policy. Especially if case-by-case means mostly for VIP customers, these customers are probably unlikely going to game the system (or even if they do, it's considered a cost of doing business with a valuable/profitable customer). *** June 26, 2020 - Updating my answer from 8 years ago =) We actually started an e-commerce business since I wrote my initial answer, and I’m now aware of a few other reasons. If you’re purchasing a product from a 3rd party (3P) seller (a merchant that sells on Amazon but otherwise is not associated with Amazon any other way) and you reach out to them about a product issue, in many cases they’ll automatically refund you without asking for a return. One reason they’ll do this is because when you initiate a return request via Amazon’s platform, it could negatively impact the sellers customer return rate metrics (which can be detrimental to their Amazon selling account). It’s also easier to just refund you directly versus going through the hassle of figuring out shipping, explaining to the customer their refund is net of return shippings costs, etc. which could risk customer dissatisfaction and potentially getting a negative product review (really bad for a 3P seller). Finally, a returned product that’s opened/damaged etc. often can no longer be resold. In these situations the 3P seller actually has to pay Amazon to dispose/send it back to the merchant so it can could actually make more financial sense in some instances to just provide a refund and not have the customer return the item.

Fortunately, there are steps to take to reduce your customer churn rate and boost your customer retention. Identify the Problem When your car starts making a strange noise, you don’t just pop open up the hood and start taking things apart hoping to fix the issue. First, you figure out what the issue is exactly and then devise a plan to repair it. The same goes for reducing your SaaS customer churn. You want to first identify the problem customers are experiencing before you know where to improve. Customer churn is usually an indication of a much larger problem at hand. The faster you are able to pinpoint the exact reason why your SaaS customers are canceling or failing to renew their subscription, the sooner you can get to solving the problem. Improve your Customer Service In 2020, the most important aspect of any marketing strategy is customer experience. Today, more than ever, customers have the ability to share their experience with your business instantly, so it’s critical that they have only wonderful things to say about it. For this reason, the next essential step to reducing customer churn is ensuring that you are offering quality service throughout the entire buyer’s journey. This means responding to customer questions, following up in a timely manner, providing helpful and informative content, and acknowledging complaints and feedback. Find out why your customers are deciding to discontinue using your services. Social media is an excellent way to connect with customers and hear their questions or concerns and is one of the most common ways that customers reach out in 2020. It is crucial to maintain an active presence and keep up with the needs of your customers on the platforms that work best for your business. Offer Customer Incentives Once you understand the reasons why your customers are leaving, you can develop a strategy to change their minds. One of the ways to do so is to offer SaaS customer incentives for them to stay. With that said, keep in mind that all the promotions in the world will not matter if customers are having a poor experience on your platform and a poor experience interacting with your team. An example of an incentive for an existing SaaS customer might be an upgrade to the next package for free or at a discounted price. Improve Onboarding Although offering free services doesn’t contribute to your monthly revenues, it can help improve your onboarding rates. The goal of offering a free trial or another form of content is to entice the customer and then convey the benefits of using your product or service. A free trial works as an initial demonstration of the long-term advantages of what you have to offer. This early ‘win’ for the customer will make them more likely to become permanent customers and then active evangelists of your brand. Trials are not effective at maintaining paying customers over time without a handoff from sales to customer success. It is all about helping your customers find success with your product or service early on in their experience. The following is a list of ways to enhance your onboarding flow: Decide on a single workflow that displays your product or service’s core value and create an onboarding process that guides new users through that workflow.Be sure to keep it simple. Avoid overwhelming your users with too many unnecessary details before they are ready for them.Utilize tooltips and hotspots to help users find key actions.Optimize your UX copy and brand messaging to effectively convey the value and beneficial factors of your product.If a customer does not discover the value and benefit of using your product or service right off the bat, they are likely to ditch it and begin working with a different business altogether. Shortening the time in which a customer finds that value will directly affect your churn rates. Develop a Strong Support Strategy Many SaaS companies hire a support team to take care of customers’ calls with inquiries and concerns. However, if you’re relying on only a few members of your team to handle queries, you won’t get a handle on lowering your SaaS customer churn rate. Each member of your sales and marketing and sales team should be focused on providing excellent support to your customers. This comes with ensuring that your entire team is aligned in your customers’ pain points, needs and goals. This focus on customer retention ensures you are producing measurable revenue impact, not just tactical execution. It is also imperative that you enable your team with the tools and content that they need to engage with customers and be able to not only answer their questions, but supply them with compelling blogs, how-to guides, and other forms of content. By encouraging an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ environment and empowering your sales and marketing professionals to focus on delighting the customers, you can greatly improve the timeliness and efficiency of handling customer requests and keeping your customers happy and satisfied.

The rising competition has made them aware of the fact that if they do not live up to the expectations of their customers and do not provide them with good services, customers have many other options to choose from. In order to retain these customers, businesses come out with various offers to attract and engage their customers. Apart from these offers, they devise proper strategies on how to reduce customer churn. Although companies are putting in a lot of effort to retain customers, many top companies are still unable to retain a huge part of their customers. One of the reasons this may be happening is that although many companies are implementing customer-centric policies and offers, they are not getting the word about them to their customers. If your customer does not know you care about them, why would they stay with you? So how exactly can businesses reduce customer churn? Below I am going to share so steps companies can follow that might help them with reducing customer churn. Find Right Call Center Partners When you outsource inbound call center services in India, you need to find an outsourcing company that shares the same customer-centric values as your organization does. A call center is the representing voice of your company when your customers try to approach you with any concern and query. If they are treated with care and respect over that initial call, it will go a long way towards ensuring a long relationship between your company and the customer. Proactive Customer Service Customers love it when their favorite brands offer them proactive support. This is why the customer service departments of many companies are implementing proactive support as a part of their strategy. They do not wait for the customers to approach them but proactively reach out to their customers when they suspect that they may be facing some difficulties using their products or services. It is a great way for making your customers feel that you are a company that pays them attention and actually cares. Keep in Touch with Customers Most of the businesses that are struggling to reduce their customer churn are the ones that have for long ignored the importance of keeping in touch with their customers regularly. Your customers may have valuable inputs on how to improve customer experience but unless you get in touch with them, you will never know. Many companies are using outbound call center services in India for making survey calls to customers to understand what they like or dislike about their services. The suggestions they get are the implemented to improve customer experience. Give Attractive Schemes This strategy is proving to be successful for many businesses. When companies realize that their customers are loyal to them, they reward them for their loyalty by offering many attractive schemes and offers that give benefits to their customers and incentivize them to stick with the company for the long run. Be Available Where Your Customers Are I cannot emphasize enough on the importance of providing your customers support on every channel possible. Your customers don’t just call you anymore. They are available on social media, they want to chat with you on their website, and they want you to reply to their emails even. You need to provide them multi-channel customer service that caters to their needs on all these various channels like voice, chat, email and social media. Synopsys: By following these simple yet important strategies, your business can really make an impact on its customers and reduce their company’s customer churn by a huge margin. This will ensure a long-term relationship between your business and its existing customers. Retaining customers is one of the top priorities for companies these days.

Obviously, neglecting some constituent parts of a business activity can have subtle consequences in a short-term perspective. However, if you care and strive to be prosperous within a prolonged period, each detail of your activity matters. The importance of customer retention is discernible from the point of view of customer satisfaction. The latter is a prerequisite for a high rate of loyalty. Put it plainly, if you do not like something, you leave and refuse to choose this service or company in the future. On the contrary, if you are satisfied, there is no need to search for anything else. The following ways are a blend of solutions offered by Inside CRM, Ravi Kumar from Entrepreneur and miscellaneous experienced specialists. Perhaps, some of these prompts will be of use for your demands. #1 Your CRM tool can be connected with a marketing automation service. As a result, individual contacts will receive personalized messages (news, offers, events, media content etc.) according to their preferences. Their responses can be assessed via click analysis and email opens to make a behavior pattern. #2 By virtue of target marketing implemented via the metrics available through a CRM tool, companies are able to monitor clients that can benefit from contact with expert sales reps. Based on this data, customer satisfaction can be increased and business opportunities can be enhanced. #3 It is advised to use personalized emails stuffed with a dynamic content corresponding to customer’s preferences. This activity can be fully carried out using the Personalized Mass Mailing in NetHunt CRM. E.g., a customer’s location together with its order history evidence the possible interest in a certain event. #4  Providing solutions to clients is much simpler if you know their needs and preferences. You can stay in touch with clients’ demands using a CRM system. E.g., this can be done by offering a new way of communication including social capabilities, self-service options, web portals and others with your company to customers. #5 The database of your CRM contains a plenty of useful information that can be scheduled for the automated email sending. #6 Some companies undervalue a web channel and give preference to old-fashioned ways of delivering messages to clients. Still, today, a web presence is a driving element of sales. Nevertheless, it does not mean to refuse from proven ways of communication. The balance among customer channels is what a contemporary business needs. #7 A CRM tool can be used as an event planner and task manager to invite clients, sending reminders and post-event follow-ups, as well as to perform other relevant functions. #8 It is a common practice that a company is successful but it is not aware of its success. Due to versatile metrics available in CRM systems, companies can avoid such scenario and monitor actual values of their activities. Such measurement is essential for building a proper marketing campaign and proper distribution of investments. #9 Tracking demographics and essential background details regarding a certain client can be performed in a single interface of your CRM. Such solution is beneficial for a quick response to client’s requests. #10 It may happen that an implemented marketing campaign fell short of expectations. A CRM tool is a way to see what works and what doesn’t and make timely adjustments. Otherwise speaking, tracking marketing campaigns can provide a clear understanding of customers’ preferences. #11 Most CRM systems allow capturing clients feedback scores. Based on this information received via email alerts and feedback reports, you can assess performance and take corrective actions if necessary. #12  Some clients can bring more profit compared to others. On this account, with a CRM tool, it is possible to focus efforts on a separate customer and make the most of this relationship. #13 Automation of certain processes is a great way to save versatile resources. E.g., if a service case is updated or closed/opened, an automated email reminder is your magic wand. #14 Being flexible in offerings is a slogan of any successful company. You can identify the possibility to increase customer retention rate by means of value-added products and services using CRM systems. Thus, the priority of undesirable and less popular merchandise/services can be reduced. #15 In general, operating costs are reduced when using CRM tools. Such software solution can implement versatile functions in one place and cost-effective manner. Thus, companies can redistribute investments to lagging activities and demands.

Customer segmentation helps you build a more loyal & profitable customer base by enabling you to identify your most profitable customers and then determine how best to communicate with them—creating a better customer experience to ultimately minimize churn, generate growth, and encourage referrals. To get the most value out of your customer segmentation, you want it to be both descriptive and predictive.

The resulting segmentation insights can inform customer retention tactics including message optimization, cross-sell/up-sell, and product/service bundling—and be applied for more accurate modeling of response probability, churn, referral revenue, and customer value.   You also want your segmentation to be actionable—meaning you can directly identify and target each of your segments across all marketing touchpoints and media channels.
