It all depends on your comfort which platform you like to use and then the type of work you do. Im not doing very complicated animations or tons and tons of small fragments within one animation. So my Macbook is more than enough. Secondly i also Graphic Designing and photo editing which works best on Macbook for me. So a Macbook is the best tool for me for my professional work. Now i saw many Motion graphics designer and Editor who use windows for their work because of high end specs and this is what suits them. So it all comes down to what you are comfortable using and then the kind of work you are doing. ProTip: When rendering a complicated long animation, try to render certain parts of the animation (It could be certain duration or certain layers together) with Alpha Channel and then use a new comp for final render and use those Alpha Channel renders on top of each other depending on your layers. This is how you will save alot of time rendering straight out of your main animation comp.",2021-03-05T09:32:06.711Z,"Is MacBook suitable for someone who does motion graphic design for a job? ",Quora

The standard and most effective number of words per 30-60 seconds should be a maximum of 65 words. To craft the story effectively, one should ask themselves who they are trying to reach, what they want them to learn, remember, and do. Also, one should consider how they want their audience to feel after they watch the motion graphic. To become highly effective, one should be direct but not too literal. Additionally, to get the message across effectively, one should consider kinetic text and a unique voice over. These features make sure that the animated video is memorable and the message is put across adequately. Kinetic texts grab the full attention of the audience. Studies have shown that people tend to pay more attention to animated videos when they have to read the story line. Step 2: Storyboard as you Brainstorm the Visual Treatment This storyboard phase combines the script and the visuals. The design and production team combine their ideas to come up with the best motion graphic. This step is important because it brings together the scriptwriter and the designer. Through the storyboard, frames are drawn out on whiteboard. Additionally, the final script is reviewed in this step before the actual creation of the motion graphic starts. Then, ideas are sketched to bring the desired script into live motion. Step 3: Take the Storyboards into Design Color and style are important in the creation of motion graphics. Simple choices make a huge impact on the audience. Therefore, the color and style need to be chosen wisely to make sure that they communicate effectively to the audience. After obtaining the sketches on the storyboard, translation into actual design should begin. All the ideas and information gathered at this stage are used in the final stages. Thus, this step should be completed with precision to assist the storyboard sketcher and the designer. The final visual notes are used by the designers to come up with the final motion graphic. Step 4: Animation of the final designs This is the stage when the real animation process begins. During the process, all steps have built upon each other and everybody involved in the creation of the animated video is well conversant with what needs to be done. The animation style, timing, music and sound effects are ideally incorporated into the motion graphic. By the end of this process, the animated video is ready to be launched for the targeted audience to view.With these steps followed to the letter, the resultant motion graphic is guaranteed to be of excellent quality.",2021-03-05T09:56:24.888Z,"How do I use motion graphics in web design?

FIND TRAINING ONLINE. No amount of school can prepare you for what's next in motion graphics. The basics are easily learned from others who have come before you. There are enough free learning materials online for motion graphics to get you up and running. Look for tutorials from people who are well known and produce great work. DO YOUR BEST: Strive to be as good as the people you are learning from. Strive to be better. Look at the motion graphics work of others that is appealing to you and others - openly appreciate it - and learn the steps to produce at those levels. Exceed those levels in your own work. TOOLS ARE SECONDARY: After Effects is a good starting tool, and more accessible to the beginner than Nuke at this point in time. But always remember, the tools are not as important as telling the story. Work with what you have access to, and use it to tell a great story. Focus on the message, the communication. The tools are just a means to produce the visuals - focus on what you want to show and don't worry about if your tools allow you to do it or not. There's always a way to show what's needed and you can search for others who've figured it out or develop a way yourself. CONTINUALLY LEARN: Learn on a project to project basis. Don't be afraid to take on projects you don't fully know how to produce. Get yourself to the level of confidence where you can take on jobs you've never done and figure out what it will take to learn and produce an effect. BE HONEST: Never lie to a client about your ability or promise that you'll have something done by a certain time until you KNOW.Just admit you've never done it before - but you know it's possible - and you will figure out the best way to go about it and get back to them on a time you can deliver. If they want someone more experienced, fine. Drop them. Move on. All you can do is be honest and do your best. Chances are, the next designer they find has never done it either, and they are going to be looking for a while. All the really really experienced designers are too busy to help them. :) YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IT ALL: New tools are released and improved on almost daily. You constantly need to be looking on a project to project basis for the new and better way of doing things. If you have a better idea of how to do something, check and see if it exists and is being used in the form of software or plugin and learn it and adopt it in your workflow. IMPROVE. ALWAYS IMPROVE: Continually improve your skill set with various tool sets and see what others are using to accomplish the work you are doing. Make your own personal projects when you can and try new things. If you discover a great combination of tools to get something done, share it openly with your peers to help them develop their skills too. You will become well known and respected in your field and get more work as a result. THE KEY INGREDIENT - BE HELPFUL: Above all, be helpful to customers and peers. Never look down on people starting out or view your peers as competition. They're not out to take your customers. They're your friends and family. You can learn from them and they can learn from you. I often send extra work to my peers and view several of them as superior to myself in skill. I look up to them and strive to be as good or better. Others ask me for help - which I always do my best to deliver on. You will truly be a self-made pro motion graphics success when you are at the point of being able to help others with your skills. People need professional motion graphics to communicate their ideas. They need someone who can help them communicate a concept to an audience. Be that person. Make it interesting and keep the audiences attention while brilliantly getting the message across in a way they can totally relate to. You will be beyond successful when you can (and do) train others to be successful in your craft. People who help others become successful have no choice but to be successful themselves. It's a law of the universe. The more people you can reach and help the more successful you will be. Money is just a measure of how many people you are helping. Look at anyone who is well known and successful in motion graphics and you'll see this to be a common denominator among them. They are all super helpful. You can only help a limited number of people with one on one hourly service. This will sustain you for several years and if you are doing a great job, you will make a name for yourself and people will seek you out for jobs and help learning what you do. With years of experience and knowledge in your craft behind you, also leave the knowledge you obtained in the form of a book or tutorial series to help people following behind you to get to your level. Don't wait till you retire to do this. Do this while you are still producing and share the knowledge of your journey with others. When you stop working, new methods will emerge and your books and videos will become outdated with time. Update the older ones as new methods replace the old. By writing a book or recording videos you can reach everyone who's looking for your solutions and help more people than you can imagine in your lifetime. And if your books and videos are good, they'll grow in popularity and help others that much more. So, in summary: Find Training Online.Do your best in all your work.The Tools You Use are Secondary to Telling the Story.Never Stop Learning and continually improve your skills.Help your customers, peers and newcomers.The more people you help, the more successful you'll be.

A: Starting your journey into learning motion design with previous training as an artist or graphic designer will certainly help. If you are coming from some other background, with no experience as an artist or a designer in some other field aside from motion/animation, you will have some catching up to do. In order to “get good at” motion design, there’s no way around it: You’re going to have to learn the basic principles taught in design school, such as color theory, composition, typography, and design thinking. Motion design adds to the skill set of a graphic designer by adding the dimension of time, and this is where the principles of animation also come into play. It’s the animation part that is the biggest learning curve for a lot of graphic designers entering the motion design field.",2021-03-05T10:14:07.439Z,"Do you have to be an artist or graphic designer to learn and get good at motion design?

In professional terms, a Graphic Designer is a visual problem solver; their job is to creatively solve various communication challenges via the combination of typography, graphics, imagery, and in some fields, sound (e.g. motion and web). Designers are facilitating a visual conversation between a business and their consumers. Whether that's a magazine, an online company, or a broadcast company, their job is to visually connect the two. Some examples of Graphic Designers are: Web Designers, Print Designers, Packaging Designers, Motion Graphic Designers, UI Designers, etc. A Digital Artist is someone that creates art via digital media. While all art is at it's essence communication, the term Digital Artist covers a very wide range of people and is less a title than a description of how they achieve what they're doing. Examples are: Concept Artists, Matte Painters, Storyboard Artists, 3D Artists, and some of the fine art fields like Painting, and Illustration (though obviously their work would be entirely digital). The biggest difference is in what they're communicating, not how they achieve it. The part that makes the distinction difficult is that the two fields often intersect. If I use a digital artists painting in a poster to advertise a movie, is it Graphic Design or Digital Art? I'd say the end product and it's intention make it Graphic Design, but it's Digital Art at the same time. As murky as the distinction can be in this situation, using the Digital Artist's work doesn't make me a Digital Artist anymore than it makes the artist a Graphic Designer.

It also includes design of posters, brochures, annual reports, and any other kind of print collateral.Motion graphics and design for film and video.Design for web and electronic media, including responsive website design that can adapt to mobile and desktop platforms, electronic books and apps.Packaging and point of sale graphics and graphics applied to products such as clothing, sporting goods, vehicles and aircraft, equipment, etc.Wayfinding and architectural signage.My advice is to expose yourself to as many forms of graphic design as possible to see which areas you are drawn to most. You may be drawn to a particular kind of graphic design, such as website design, or you may be drawn to a particular market, such as sporting goods for example. In any case it helps to know as much about what kind of work you want to do once you decide to pursue it. Get a subscription to Communication Arts Magazine or Print Magazine, or Graphis Magazine. Each of these magazine feature works by the best people in the industry. Keep a scrapbook (or Pinterest account) where you can collect as much work that inspires you as possible. After a while you'll start seeing work that makes you want to create yourself. Most forms of graphic design will use the same computer applications for basic design work, such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Almost every design job will require a working knowledge of those programs. You'll also need to know other applications specific to each area. For example most print designers routinely use Adobe InDesign. Most motion graphics artists will need to know After Effects Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. Designers who apply their designs to products or architectural signage may need to learn 3D applications like 3D Studio Max or AutoCAD. And a web designer will need to learn HTML, programing and scripting languages, as well as applications like Sketch3 and Dreamweaver which are designed to aid in the development of websites.  Regardless of whatever path you follow, a good designer should know how to sketch, with pencil and paper, well enough to communicate visual concepts. You should definitely learn and understand what typography is, including terminology and the theory behind it. It also helps to have a good grasp of the history of graphic design which can illuminate concepts to you that have worked over centuries and help you to avoid common mistakes.  And to that I would add that a broad appreciation of culture and how different regions influence each other is helpful. The best designers are the ones who are exposed to everything and absorb as much as they can. Like a good vocabulary helps to make a good writer, an extensive knowledge of art, architecture and cultural influences can help a good designer to rise to the top of his field.",2021-03-05T10:20:53.552Z,"What should I learn to become a graphics designer?

Moving an image from one point in space and time to another is just a matter of setting 2 keyframes (markers in a digital timeline with values set for an object's position, scale, opacity, etc), but why and how it moves, naturally or unnaturally, makes an image appear alive or to have character and personality. These are all things you can learn, but you have to practice new thinking. So much in design is focused on a single page or for a specific device screen, but these are just moments in ""spacetime."" Motion graphic design is about creating everything in between these momentary states, the transitions from one to the next, telling a compelling story ... creating an experience. Ok, enough of the philosophy, here's a plan. I'm sure others will share some great ideas, too.  Discover what area of motion graphics interests you the most - character animation, visual FX, 3D modeling/animation, HTML5 or CSS3 for web, etc. It all requires work and discipline, but if you're inspired and fascinated, it can be loads of fun (that's really important). Just search online for ""motion graphics inspiration"" and dig into who made what and how. Build a library for yourself by bookmarking sites.You'll need to get access to some software tools. I recommend Adobe After Effects ($26/mo with Adobe Creative Cloud) for video and web, Tumult Hype ($49.95 Mac OS only) for HTML5, and Blender (FREE 3D modeling/animation for Windows, Mac, and Linux). After Effects is an industry standard with a bazillion great 3rd-party plugins (free and paid) for creating amazing effects. There are other cool apps out there, but you can literally create a six-figure income by mastering After Effects alone. I did.Learn. Practice. Learn some more. There are several online learning opportunities for motion graphics. Here are just a few of my favorites: http://www.lynda.com https://www.udemy.com http://www.skillshare.com http://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/ http://creativedojo.net/ Again, get moving. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Your first attempts will probably look like crap. That's ok. Keep practicing. Learn a few, basic principles in Physics. Study the business and the industries that hire motion designers. Get to know your clients and learn how to solve their problems with motion graphics. There's a lot of work out there for good designers. Most important, observe the world around you and watch how things move. Even in chaos there's a secret order to motion. When you see it, you'll notice it in everything. Everything moves. Get moving. If you've had any experience in visual design or illustration, then you probably already have a few fundamentals down.

The best part is, if you love this type of work, it doesn’t feel like a grind, its a hobby that slowly becomes your greatest asset, you’ll have a blast (with some headaches here and there): I’ll split the training into essentially two major pieces: 1) Practicum 2) Theory Most people would explain that theory is going to be your best bet to begin learning. This is a great mentality but I know many beginners are itching to start creating, and the theory might not satisfy this urge right away. So I propose beginning with Practicum and then as you progress with hands on skills, you embrace theory and utilize it to fine tune your own work. Tutorials, tutorials, tutorials. Find a course listing somewhere online (google After Effects Course Outline) to get a rough outline out the steps you should take as you utilize tutorials.Take these steps and begin searching for tutorials per each section. Whether its YouTube, SkillShare, AETuts, or any other resource, you’re going to find great lessons.Following along with each tutorial, engage with them, pause the video, move over and do what they did, get a feel for the interface, the shortcuts, the intricacies, the workflow, etc.. Once you get this down, take each section and begin working on your own ideas. Be ambitious, but nothing crazy, build up your skill and taste and most importantly, your confidence.As you get a hold of your abilities in After Effects, begin to take in some theory, the internet has an unbelievable amount of resources for free, but a few pieces of literature I would suggest would be: The Illusion of Life, Le Mystère Tex Avery (Yes it sounds pompous, but a great read), and Animation in Context: A Practical Guide to Theory and Making. There are many many others too.As you develop your taste, your eye, your style, and your voice, continue to learn your way through the software. Take the experience as a two sided face, yin and yang. Both are essential and useless without the other. Have fun with it and watch yourself grow.In short, practicing through tutorials and references is the only way to get to where you want to be as an artist. Learn as much as you can, create things that inspire you, and create work that matters to you. Have fun and best of luck!

As long as you can extract the right amount of information from it later, it serves it's intended purpose. Rather, spend the time polishing your final production. Storyboards for motion graphics are not that different than storyboards for film/animation. You would probably see more footnotes and movement arrows in motion design storyboards to communicate how things are moving in and out of frame or their general movement. I personally never storyboard for my smaller motion, 3D and film projects. I find it to be unnesecary and extracts time away from the final production. However, for something like a full feature film, I wouldn't dream of not storyboarding/shot listing because there's no way I'd be able to remember all those shots/beats without it. Even as obsessive as I am about such things. Most motion designs tend to be very short, my 3D stuff is more exploratory and non destructive, so I find I'm storyboarding predominately for film. Also, in film you're working with a lot more people so it's valueable (if not critical) to have a way to communicate your vision, visually.",2021-03-05T10:34:18.794Z,"How do you storyboard for motion graphics?

This is a topic that certainly intrigues us and we would love to contribute our bit to the discussion! Motion graphic design is an exciting discipline within the expansive field of design and involves bringing graphic elements to life. Artists use basic graphic design principles in filmmaking, video production or similar evolving visual media to create kinetic designs that connect with the viewer or desired audience. Motion graphic designers or artists are professionals who posses graphic design and traditional art skills (sketching) and those who have mastered the art of integrating myriad design tools and elements to create a final visually engaging product. Such artists possess exceptional understanding of typography, colour theory and animation and leverage this while executing a client’s brief. It is a well established fact that though ‘interpersonal skills’ is not a prerequisite for designers per se, but possessing the ability to clearly articulate one’s ideas across the table has more advantages than one. With technology changing at a rather rapid pace, it is also beneficial for artists in the field to be fluent in the latest computer software so that they can hit the ground running on bagging a project. Motion graphic designers or motion designers create artwork that can be used for the digital world (web), television and films. To put it plainly, they design graphics that are in motion and the applications of which are endless! Motion graphics unlike print is all about movement and therefore, the strength of a good motion design solely depends on sound storytelling ability. This is a highly creative domain and requires one to be adept at coming up with exciting and innovative ways of communicating an idea or a message to the intended audience.

Most Graphic Designers aren’t REAL! Of the entire population of people who claim to be Graphic Artists in this whole wide world, only a fraction can prove to be CREATIVE. These few creative ones create the trends that the majority of NON-CREATIVE-DESIGNERS (NCDs) copy. A typical NCD may not be able to come up with a design concept without getting some inspiration from Pinterest or Behance and also may start off a design without clarity nor a sketch. Ultimately, the NCD gambles through the entire design process, inputting ideas borrowed from other designs seen online. There’s nothing too wrong with borrowing an idea once in a while. There’s even nothing too bad being an NCD. Every artist was at some point one. But there is everything wrong with being there for too long. A Graphic Designer is an artist and not some unimaginative, non-original crafts-man that churns out half-baked ideas here and there.

Publication graphic designPublications are long-form pieces that communicate with an audience through public distribution. They have traditionally been a print medium.Graphic designers that specialize in publications work with editors and publishers to create layouts with carefully selected typography and accompanying artwork, which includes photography, graphics and illustrations. Publication designers may work as freelancers, as creative agency members or in-house as part of a publishing company.Examples of publication graphic designBooksNewspapersNewslettersDirectoriesAnnual reportsMagazinesCatalogsPackaging graphic designMost products require some form of packaging to protect and prepare them for storage, distribution, and sale. But packeging design can also communicate directly to consumers, which makes it an extremely valuable marketing tool. Every box, bottle and bag, every can, container, or canister is a chance tell the story of a brand.Packaging designers create concepts, develop mockups and create the print-ready files for a product. This requires expert knowledge of print processes and a keen understanding of industrial design and manufacturing. Because packaging design touches so many disciplines, it’s not uncommon for designers to find themselves creating other assets for a product such as photography, illustrations and visual identity.Motion graphic designSimply put, motion graphics are graphics that are in motion. This can include animation, audio, typography, imagery, video and other effects that are used in online media, television and film. The medium’s popularity has skyrocketed in recent years as technology improved and video content became king.“Motion graphics designer” is a somewhat new specialty for designers. Formally reserved for TV and film, technological advances have reduced production time and costs, making the art form more accessible and affordable. Now, motion graphics can be found across all digital platforms, which has created all sorts of new areas and opportunities.Examples of motion graphic designTitle sequences and end creditsAdvertisementsAnimated logosTrailersPresentationsPromotional videosTutorial videosWebsitesAppsVideo gamesBannersGIFsVisual identity graphic designA brand is a relationship between a business or organization and its audience. A brand identity is how the organization communicates its personality, tone and essence, as well as memories, emotions and experiences. Visual identity graphic design is exactly that: the visual elements of brand identity that act as the face of a brand to communicate those intangible qualities through images, shapes and color.Designers that specialize in visual identity graphic design collaborate with brand stakeholders to create assets like logos, typography, color palettes and image libraries that represent a brand’s personality. In addition to the standard business cards and corporate stationary, designers often develop a set of visual brand guidelines (style guides) that describe best practices and provide examples of visual branding applied across various media. These guidelines help to ensure brand consistency throughout future applications.Marketing & advertising graphic designWhen most people think of graphic design, they think of designs created for marketing and advertising.Companies depend on successful marketing efforts to tap into their target audience’s decision-making process. Great marketing engages people based on the wants, needs, awareness and satisfaction they have about a product, service or brand. Since people will always find visual content more engaging, graphic design helps organizations promote and communicate more effectively.Examples of marketing graphic designPostcards and flyersMagazine and newspaper adsPosters, banners and billboardsInfographicsBrochures (print and digital)Vehicle wrapsSignage and trade show displaysEmail marketing templatesPowerPoint presentationsMenusSocial media ads, banners and graphicsBanner and retargeting adsImages for websites and blogsIf you're interested in learning digital marketing, I'd recommend IIDE (Indian Institute Of Digital Education) with their 6 Month Graphic Designing Course in Mumbai.

This issue has resulted in an ongoing debate in many professional communities as to what to call ourselves. (Graphic Designer vs. Communication Designer and User Experience Designer vs. Interaction Designer etc).  The IXDA (Interaction Design Association)IXDA advocates Interaction Design as its label of choice though at their Interaction Conference in Vancouver in 2009 there was considerable debate about this.  ICOGRADA (the professional body for ***** design for the world) ICOGRADA has a foot in both camps as ICOGRADA is still an acronym for ""International Council of Graphic Design Associations"" has taken the step to adopt Communication Designer and it describes itself as the body for professional communication design. (hence my asterisks earlier in this headline) AIGA AIGA used to be an acronym for ""The American Institute of Graphic Arts"" (Graphic Arts being one of the many pre-graphic design terms used) but recently moved away from AIGA being an acronym and simple a stand alone word not meaning 'Graphic Arts'. (note I believe Icograda is in the process of doing the same thing if they haven't already).  The AIGA has opted to go simply with ""design"" without an additional adjective and describes itself as such: ""The AIGA represents a variety of professions under the umbrella of communication design, ranging from book and type design to interactive design and experience design."" The Society of Graphic Designers (GDC) in CanadaThe GDC recently renamed its professional certification to ""Certified Graphic Designer"" and is generally an advocate of using the term Graphic Designer to encompass all aspects of the field (brand strategy, web design etc). If you're interested more in the Communication vs. Graphic designer conversation check out http://www.beyondgraphic.org I'm pretty sick of the conversation over what to call ourselves having been involved as a board member for the GDC in Canada for the last 4 years and voted in the recent decision to adopt ""Certified Graphic Designer"" (though was not in favour of it). The self promotional part of me wants to throw up my hands and say that it doesn't matter.  But it does matter. We can talk about how we need a unified title that will help our industry again appreciation and understanding in both the eyes of the public and business (draw comparison to Certified General Account here) however I don't think that even within our industry there is consensus about terms and what they mean.  Interactive Designer and Interaction Designer are perceived as two different things and in my experience one can get you an interview while one may lose you the opportunity to get an interview.  There are those who will argue that Graphic Designers are antiquated hold overs from a generation ago when our industry survived on media buys, annual reports and the web wasn't even born yet and others will argue that a Graphic Designer does everything from Brand Analysis, Brochure Design, Mobile strategy, motion graphics, web development and more.  My bottom line? Just do good work in whatever medium you want. I hate starting answers with ""it depends"".... but this depends on the definition of Graphic Design.

That being said, my studio uses Blender and Natron for the light lifting, Maya exclusively for the heavy 3D stuff (and some 2D), and Nuke for the heaviest of shots with real deal composites. We have one guy on After effects because it is what he knows, and he is very fast on it, so that is what we bought for him. As for AE being important, I would say its a great tool for some shot cleanup and finishing work as it is pretty capable for its price point, but overall many free solutions can fit the bill (and do). For trailer work, it is good because we can slap a quick set of shots together and grade quickly and test out shots requiring rapid changes or grading stuff, and our pipeline has very nice nuke integration from After Effects. AE is also good in that it has a lot of nice tools built in that allow for rapid texture animation, and the Foundry (who owns Nuke), has been nice enough to have developed a lot of great plugins. As other have said, lower end shops pretty much rely on AE, and it is important that they can get great work done with it without shelling out thousands for the McKlaren of vfx tools. At the end of the day, all these packages are just tools along the pathway to great VFX, and if you get there the hard way because a tool limits you, it is time to use another one.

The art director also has a clear idea of how to produce a design, how to turn it into reality: if special inks or finishings are needed; if a photo must be produced, how, budget, etc.; if the copy needs twists, improvements or changes, and so on. You can acquire the skills by looking at design problems or creative briefs in a broader way. Not just from the start of the design to the end of it, but from the client to the bief to the design to the production of that design. Having that overall view of the process will give you hints at better resolving the problem through design. You must be much more critical and make more judgements, not just design. Artistic-wise, art directors should also be able to keep a coherent line of work that goes with the brand they're working for. They are able to see not just the present but some years back and some years ahead, and understand that the things they do must not depend on the mood they are that day or that week but on a brand timeline that needs to be taken into account and respected through a unified and functional design.

I spent a lot of time playing games on that and developed a love for those blocky graphics  Some classic “Speccy” graphics Further down the road I studied graphic design at University. I graduated back in 2004 - Motion design wasn't so much of a thing back then so although I had experimented with After Effects and animation a bit, I had no idea if there would be a job in it for me. About a year later I was introduced through a friend to someone starting a small motion/graphic design studio. He didn’t have a lot of paid work to offer but he let me hang out and use one of his computers. He gave me some tips and guidance and (perhaps most importantly at that time) encouragement. I then took my small portfolio of animation work to a local motion design studio in my home town (Liverpool) and landed a full time job. I got to learn After Effects pretty well, working on it every day. After about a year I was starting to feel I needed a new challenge so I quit and went to Japan to teach english for a year. It did nothing for my After Effects skills but it gave me a heap of valuable life experience. After travelling and taking occasional freelance motion jobs for a couple more years I applied for an internship at a studio in Copenhagen called Frame. After a 6 month unpaid internship I was offered a full time job. I stayed there for 8 years and soaked up as much knowledge as I could teaching myself Maya and then C4D in the process. I was gradually given more responsibility and worked my way up to a directing role. In 2017 I went freelance and I've since been directing jobs with high-end studios like Trizz and Tendril I still feel like a noob in many ways, the field is always expanding and shifting but I wouldn’t change that for anything. Key takeaways: You don’t need a University degree - Although I got a university education I think I could have easily done without it. I learned more in my first couple of months working at a studio than 3 years at University. Don’t be a lone wolf - Feedback and encouragement goes a long way when you are starting out. If you’re not ready to take an internship, find a community online or in person and share as much as you can. Focus on the process - My interest in practicing the craft was stronger than my desire to “make it” as a motion designer. Keep challenging yourself - I moved on when I felt myself stagnating It’s not the be-all-end-all - I took plenty of time away from motion design to explore other aspects of life (ie. travel, teaching english) Be prepared for trade offs early in your career - I wasn't afraid to work for no money when I knew I was receiving value in a different form ie. experience (I'm not saying it's always good to work for free, it should always feel like a fair exchange) Forget what other people are doing - Trust your instincts and focus on what inspires you. If you can stay focused on the process you will be making waves before you know it.

Motion Graphics is another animal all together and there’s a lot of elements to balance. You have all the major components of design like composition, hierarchy, color, scale, balance and unity…. plus movement, timing, and all the 12 principles of animation. Learn to design with Illustrator before you jump into all of that. Some of those skills (like bezier paths and the pen tool) will translate to After Effects if you decide that’s the route you want to go. After Effects is a complex beast and it takes months to figure out the basics, and years to master. It is also very hardware intensive. It’s recommended to buy the fastest single threaded performance CPU, but also you need some cores for rendering. Currently the fastest 4core is Intel Core i7-7700K , but 6–8 cores is ideal. So arguably the Intel Core i7-6850K @ 3.60GHz might be a better choice. Your trading scrubbing/ viewport performance for rendering power. There’s 421 point difference between the two CPUs for single-threaded performance. You might be able to overclock the 6850K and get back 100 points or so. Also After Effects is a RAM hog. Bare minimum is 16 GBs these days, but if you can afford it, max it out. The 7700K will limit you to 64GBs and the 6850K, I believe is 128GB. Graphic Cards are less of impact than you might think, but you might need a more high-end one if you get into C4D and especially if you want to use Octane Render. Look at the After Effects website and see what is supported and then go to a site like GPU boss to compare and contrast. New ones like GTX 1080 & 1070 can be problematic to work w/ Mercury Transmit on the newest versions AE (2015.3 & 2017). They still work, just transmit doesn’t work with it, which can be an issue if you are doing professional grading with it. Titan X is currently the fastest fully supported and most economical (but still expensive) before jumping into the ultra-expensive Quadros. More important than GPUs is an SSD drive. It’s recommended to have a SSD for your system and a separate one for a cache drive. If you can afford another one for your project drive and yet another one to render to.
