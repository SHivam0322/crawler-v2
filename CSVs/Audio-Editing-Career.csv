Bear in mind the cost to the employer in terms of training you to perform the role - both in terms of courses and significant amounts of time spent with onntje job training. Once you are trained up and competent, you are worth more in the marketplace and they are investing in you.If you are already in a job and are looking for a raise, again research either within your firm or across the marketplace, with regard to your level of competence and performance, will help you benchmark yourself against the marketplace in terms of salary and benefits, to enable you to have a meaningful conversation about how you are placed and what your prospects are for salary progression in what specific timeframe.I would say that your question lacked any form of specifics or detail and any pitch you make for a salary or a raise would benefit from having more structure and factual information, combined with a logical reason for the package you are proposing.

6042358eed76476feda20347,https://www.quora.com/Is-John-Ford-really-the-king-of-Western-Films?-,"John Ford was an extraordinary film maker, and one of my favorites. In a career of more than 50 years, Ford directed more than 140 films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of his generation. He made frequent use of location shooting and long shots, in which his characters were framed against a vast, harsh, and rugged natural terrain. Ford had elaborate sets built in California, a film location ranch most closely associated with serials and B-Westerns, which would become, along with Monument Valley, one of the director's preferred backdrops and a site to which Ford would return in the next few years for Stagecoach, The Grapes of Wrath, and his John Wayne cavalry trilogy. Stagecoach was the first of many Westerns that John Ford shot in black and white using Monument Valley in the American southwest as a location and background. Many of Ford’s later films would be in color. No director of the sound era made as many great films more quickly than Ford did when he followed Stagecoach with three nominations and two Oscars for directing before the end of World War II. The film has a fair claim to be the most influential Western ever made. The 1939 version of Stagecoach was deemed culturally and historically significant by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in its National Film Registry. Seen today, Stagecoach may not seem very original. That's because it influenced countless later Western movies and remakes in which a mixed bag of characters are thrown together by chance and forced to survive an ordeal. The genre, known as an “ensemble movie” at times plays like an anthology of timeless clichés, yet the personal interaction of real people in the Old West often brought together such groups with diverse backgrounds and diametrically opposed goals.  Incident near Square Butte — Russell Ford consciously attempted to duplicate on film the artwork of Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell. From the great settlement era and the end of the Indian wars in the West of the 1880s until Remington’s death in 1909, and Russell’s in 1926, the artists’ paintings, sculptures and illustrations captured the soul of the changing frontier.  Arresting a Deserter — Remington Except Remington and Russell, no other artist had greater influence on Western film director John Ford than Charles Schreyvogel, who in the 1890s and 1900s painted some of the most popular, realistic action paintings of the American Indian wars.  Breaking through the Line — Schreyvogel, Russell actually spent a great deal of time in Southern California and became a close friend of many Hollywood producers, directors and actors, including Ford, Will Rogers and Harry Carey Sr., who built the Montana artist an adobe cabin at his Los Angeles-area ranch. Ford, who became a friend of Russell’s through Carey, was greatly inspired by the art of Russell, Remington and Charles Schreyvogel, as were many others in Hollywood. Western artists strongly influenced film directors and their production designers, from the earliest silent horse-operas to the most recent big-budget Western films and television series.

To view it as something more would be a fatal error. Liberalism: In the Classical Tradition | Ludwig von Mises 1927 At the time this was written, 1927, Fascism was Mussolini's ad-hoc patchwork of programs. It was not yet Nazi military dictatorship. “Liberalism” was also NOT A BOOK ABOUT FASCISM. If you want Mises’ opinion on Fascism, read his book about fascism: Omnipotent Government: The Rise of the Total State and Total War | Ludwig von Mises To paraphrase Mises, to look only at one sentence would be a fatal error, an error the person asking this question is making. Mises wrote in a pattern of “example” followed by “refutation”. It’s not a pattern often seen in other’s writings, or for that matter most writing in English. As such, if you tried hard enough, you would find plenty of times Mises presents the case “for” something which he then refutes. Today, this is called “Iron Man” argumentation, or “Steel-manning”.

The first thing you’ll need is a demo voiceover reel and the usual actors catch 22 applies: you need a reel to get work and you need to get work to get a reel together. Well, there’s two ways around this, one requires some financial investment, the other requires a certain natural ability and a bit of hustle. The financial investment one is more straightforward but not accessible to all; you’ll need to pay a recording studio to produce a demo reel for you. This can be expensive but do some research, talk to sound engineers and if possible, find a voiceover coaching class which will offer you not just the best training you can hope for (breathing techniques, sight reading etc) but many of them will offer to cut a reel from your best work during the course. In Ireland for example, one of the best known and respected courses is run but Tommy Ellis at ‘The Velvet Voice’, another popular course is run by ‘Piehole’ which has the added benefit of being a voiceover agency also, so once you’ve taken their course, you may be asked to join their books as a voiceover artist. Research similar courses in your city on the internet and go out and meet some recording studio technicians and sound engineers, these are the people who will be very helpful to you in creating a killer VO reel which will get you noticed by the industry. The second option is to self produce a demo reel by learning a bit about audio editing software and bartering your talents for studio time. There’s no point trying to record your reel at home unless you have thousands of dollars worth of equipment and a properly soundproofed environment. But you know where has all of the things you need but which spends a good deal of time vacant? Radio stations! All radio stations (even smaller, regional ones) have a production studio where sound engineers cut promos, the news team can record ‘drop ins’ if there’s breaking news before a bulletin, DJ’s can pre-record shows (yes, not all radio is live and they don’t always tell you when it’s not) and the sound engineers can record the ads for smaller businesses which aren’t being supplied directly by the ad agencies. In some stations, these can be busy places but more often than not, they are predominantly empty, certainly after normal business hours when there’s only one presenter and a couple of news staff still around. To gain access to the studio and a bit of help from the sound engineer, you’ll have to offer them something in return, so this is the part which requires some talent and/or a bit of hustle. Offer to barter your voice talent in exchange for some downtime use of the production studio. Most small independent stations will have their DJ’s record the ads for all the smaller, ‘direct sales’ businesses and although that might be fine, listeners can sometimes get bored listening to the same voices over and over. A new, exciting (and best of all, free!) voice on their ads may be just what they need. You have to have enough natural talent and self belief to be able to essentially audition on the spot for them. If they ask you to provide them with a demo, be honest, tell them that’s what you need the studio for, but offer to read some scripts for them there and then. You can put a bit of excitement into the read or perhaps throw in an accent (if you’re good at these, I’m assuming you are), then you may just be able to convince them to do a trade. if you’re not confident of being able to do this or they say there wouldn’t be enough work for you to do, offer your time to do anything they want, making coffee, filing, cleaning around the office, anything, so long as you get some access to their production studio during their downtime. If you do manage to swing this, understand that you will have to be ready to vacate the studio at short notice if it is suddenly used. The sound engineer should be able to help you with the audio editing and lroviding scripts and music beds (the background audio of the ads) for your demo reel. Once you have a killer demo reel in your hands, get emailing, posting it out to people, talk to voiceover agencies, creatives in advertising agencies, audio producers, sound engineers etc, send it out to radio stations, audio book publishers, anyone you can think of. Start slow rather than group mailing the industry, try to get a bit of feedback from the people you send it to. Make sure there’s nothing wrong with ‘the product’ (you and your demo) before you start sending it out to the wider world. I’d try a targeted approach by sending it to a smaller number of places each week and then you can follow up and track your progress more appropriately. I hope this was helpful, good luck!!

I could cite a lot of statistics, I have them, or post a bunch of examples but I don’t need to. Three examples will suffice: Colin Powell, Barak Obama along with his very popular wife, and last and least Trump. Colin Powell prosecuted our war with Iraq as a four star General, the highest rank at the time. He served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of State. He also outed the Republican Party as being a highly racist organization. He could have run as president had he wanted and was so popular he had a good chance of winning, I would have voted for him. His autobiography, My American Journey, was a best seller He had a successful career speaking both across America and abroad. He has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Citizens Medal, the Congressional Gold Medal and many other awards. He has a BS and an MBA. He holds honorary degrees from a number of schools and schools have been named after him. Colin Powell is black. This could be dismissed as an anomaly except we have also elected a black president, Barak Obama, twice. What other first world country can say that? Obama was not only elected twice but he also finished his administration with historically high poll numbers. His wife has been voted America’s most admired woman. Her book Becoming is a best seller. Michelle Obama 'most admired woman in US' How could either Obama or Powell have had such successful careers in America if we were the highly racist country America haters like to claim that we are? They couldn’t have. Obama’s successful career as president was followed by Trump, an unapologetic and vulgar racist. His poll numbers are among the lowest ever and his presence has created unprecedented polarization in the country. How can you create polarization unless there are two opposing sides? One side represents hate and racism, the other does not. We have racists in this country. They are a dark, crude, and ugly presence but they are also a minority. Because of a constitutional quirk their man, Trump, who lost the popular vote against a very unpopular candidate by a substantial margin, managed to get in. Most of us are dismayed and can’t wait to show him the exit. We think he’s repulsive and his poll numbers reflect this opinion.

So, drop any ideas of flunking your business degree to become a “music producer”. It’s something you need to get quite good at first before you will even have the confidence to call yourself one, let alone for other people to call you one and actually pay you for doing it. In all honesty, it sounds like you are more interested in the concept of being a “music producer” than of actually “producing music”. Most people with that interest will at least have dabbled in music or recording at a young age and gotten a little bit of an understanding of what it takes. Music Producers, in the more traditional sense of the term don’t really make music but assist others in making it. They are the bridge between the artists and the technical people (engineers/mixers) and also the business people (the record labels) so have a good understanding of all these aspects. You are really talking about being a composer or songwriter. For some reason people didn’t like this label so decided to call themselves “producers” making the whole thing rather confusing. Nowadays a Producer could either be a songwriter / composer / beat maker or actually a producer. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not trying to discourage you, just making you aware of the process. Go ahead and do it. Make music. Get a DAW (there are even free ones), record some beats, sing some tunes over them. If you do it enough you will get good at it, and other people will want to work with you. Boom! You “Broke Into” producing music (gradually over the course of 4 years, because you were actually quite good at it and did it quicker than most people do!). But don’t leave college to do this! It should be something you do as a hobby until people start asking you to work with them. Continue Reading",2021-03-05T13:55:06.467Z,"How can I break into producing music? ",Quora

Here's my definition: I am an intellectual. By that, I don't mean I'm smarter than the average person. I mean that I live a life of the mind.  Maybe my ideas are right; maybe they are wrong. The point is that I'm constantly in my head. I'm constantly cramming new things in my head. I'm constantly pushing around symbols inside my head. I'm devoted to learning. I actually feel something akin to an orgasm when I learn.  Pseudo-intellectualism is a social stance. A pseudo-intellectual wants other people to think he's smart. He will work towards that goal in the most economical way possible.  An intellectual will read a whole book, because his goal is to understand the book. A pseudo-intellectual will read the Cliff Notes, because his goal is to convince people that he's read the book. And you don't need to read a whole book in order to make most people think you have. Cliff Notes are more efficient. An intellectual always wants to know why. His whys are bottomless. Why is it raining? Because there are clouds in the sky. Why are there clouds? Because water condensed. Why did water condense? Etc. He will never tire of this. If you ask him why he wants to know, he'll stare at you blankly. Because, to him, knowledge itself is the goal. He gets a dopamine rush from knowledge. He doesn't understand phrases like ""Why does it matter?"" ""What's the point?"" or ""What's the practical application?""  A pseudo-intellectual doesn't ask why? why? why? He only asks about things that signal he's one of the smart set. In fact, he rarely asks. He tells. An intellectual doesn't care about ""smart topics."" Depending on the time period and culture, there are certain things ""one should know."" Nowadays, the main signifier is politics. ""Smart people"" are ""well informed"" about politics. An intellectual might happen to be interested in politics. But if he's more interested in pasta, he'll study that instead. He follows his brain wherever it leads him. A pseudo-intellectual will always be on the lookout for ""smart topics."" He's very concerned with what books one should read, what movies one should see, and what facts one should know.   If you say to an intellectual, ""I'm going to tell you the answer to a question, but you can't share the answer with anyone else, and you can't even tell anyone you know the answer,"" he'll say, ""Okay. Tell me.""  If you say the same thing to a pseudo-intellectual, he'll say, ""Don't bother."" A pseudo-intellectual, on Quora, will look at certain questions and say, ""That's a stupid question"" or ""You're clearly trolling."" He is concerned with ranking intelligence. He is concerned with motivations for asking questions.  An intellectual on Quora is concerned with whether or not a question is answerable -- at least in theory. He doesn't much care about why the question was asked. He cares about the question itself.

Why you should learn to DJ before you learn to produce In house music, tracks are produced so that they can be mixed: There is an intro and outro portion to each song that typically exists for mixing purposes - not because producers think plain ""oonz, oonz, oonz, oonz"" with no melodies sounds good.Songs are produced in ""phases"" that mostly follow patterns of 16 and 32 measures. This allows DJs to bring in a new song when both songs are about to start a new phase.There are sounds before the end of each phase that prepare the audience for a phase change... and also prepare the DJ to mix (i.e. a fading out sound, a whooshing sound, a short silence)Ok now, on to learning to DJ... Spend 1 hour with a friend who knows how to DJ I think the best thing you can do is spend an hour with a friend who can teach you the basics of DJing. After that, you will know enough to be able to practice alone. With enough repetition and practice, you can get good enough to fool 90% of EDM crowds that you are the Swedish House Mafia - with no additional coaching. Outside of marketing, being a world famous DJ is 95% about what you produce in the studio and 5% about your live DJ skills... but that's a whole different topic. What you will learn in that 1 hour lesson  The layout of a basic DJ mixer: Some DJ mixers are fancier than others but almost all will have the basic components (i.e. 2 decks, crossfader, EQ levels, tempo sliders, jog wheels, deck volume levels, sync button for software based controllers)Match the BPM: In order for your mix to sound good when two songs are playing simultaneously, both tracks will need to be playing at the same Beats Per Minute. You can use your tempo slider or sync button to match your two songs. To make your life easier, most house music is produced at 128 BPM. Other sub genres vary: Trance is typically close to 140 BPM and Moombahton is typically close to 110 BPM.Find the down beat: You can count out ""1, 2, 3, 4"" when a song is playing. The ""1"" (often the first beat in a song, or the one that seems to start off each repetitive pattern) is the down beat. When you press play on the second deck to begin the second track, make sure track 1 arrives at a down beat at the same time that track 2 begins on a down beat. This isn't always necessary but most DJs do this and it's easier for beginners.Notice the phase: In patterns of 16 and 32, normally, you'll notice major changes in the song. Try to match up the beginning of a phase on the two tracks that you're playing simultaneously so that major changes in each track occur at the same time. If you use DJ software it's easy to see phase changes visually by looking at the places in a waveform where there is an abrupt difference in the thickness and/or pattern.Once you pick that up, you should get yourself a mixer and get to practicing. It takes a while to learn to repeat the mixing process without making mistakes, but you'll get it after repetition. Obviously DJing can get more complex and there are some amazing live performers out there. All I'm saying is that a 1 hour lesson with a DJ, followed by practice on your own, is sufficient to learn the techniques you will need to know to become a competent performing DJ.

Don’t assume anything and do not focus on your negative thoughts. In addition, try to read something uplifting that will make you feel better. 4. Take it day by day. Do not worry about what may happen next week or next month. Things change all the time and it is all most impossible to predict what may or may not happen. Do the best you can today and hope for the best. 5. If you have trouble managing your anxiety of being unemployed, then talking to a counselor can be of some help.

A serious professional editor will employ all sorts of sound effects and intricate segments of audio to provide the desired effect. The editor also makes a great deal of the decisions about the music edit, particularly in TV, but even in feature films for which a composer is crafting many of the cues. During the making of my current edit - a PBS / BBC science series - I have added enormous amounts of effects. I have pitch-shifted and beat-matched music, I have made many timelines full of multi-layered sound effects, which are then exported as a flattened file, to avoid their being ruined by a careless engineer later. I have even recorded many instances of my own voice, for whooshing sounds, breaking sounds, noises on radios in the background, robots speaking, radio chatter, radar and sonar. I’m the editor. Not someone else later on. However, the question actually talks about ensuring quality. Well often the location / sound stage audio that finds its way to the sound engineer will have quite a lot of problems; low signal to noise ratio, humming, unwanted rustling, or hundreds of other problems. This kind of plethora of issues can be dealt with either fine use of audio repair suites, or in many cases in drama, by re-recording sections of dialogue. (Nearly everyone in movies refers to just about all the speaking as dialogue, even when it actually is just one or two people talking). This is called revoicing, ADR or dubbing. Some of the sound effects used by the editor may have defects or do not sit well in the mix. The sound effects could even do with being replaced with higher quality effects, possibly recorded with multiple surround-sound channels. For many feature films, the foley department will endeavour to lovingly recreate some of the sounds. The music editors and composers also have multitudes of brilliant people working tirelessly to deliver the fabulous quality we hear in the final productions, particularly in feature films. It’s worth bearing in mind that in TV, it would be extremely rare for an offline editor, not to have added all the final music into precisely the final locations. Thus the editorial last-word is with the editor. Conversely, in feature films, by which I mean almost exclusively drama, the editor probably will not control the final, fine-tuning of the placement of music. There are often several people whose roles will have to somewhat overrule the state of various elements of the film, after the editor has waved goodbye. The skill and attention to detail of many people in these fields is extraordinary, so it stands to reason that they add quality. But please don’t think that the actual editor does not have a pronounced affect on the sound mix. Much of their work will make it to the final film. There can be no doubt that they have by far and away the most impact on what you hear during a film. That’s their job. They edited the film. Editing is only partially visual and anyone who seems to be trying to convince you that it’s a purely visual discipline does not really know about the reality of film production. In the end, editing films is really 50% visual and 50% auditory. If that is not what an editor experiences, then I honestly pity them, as it is why I edit.",2021-03-05T13:57:15.654Z,"Can film editors adjust and edit sound to ensure quality film audio for viewers?

There is a need but it’s such a daunting and competitive area because those who fill entertainment roles are fed by top film schools and their internment programs. The corporate community is shrinking fast as video editing tools are increasingly being simplified and the production that used to be viable is now being done in house by content creators in the social media departments. With thousands of amateur YouTube and the like, the expectation level has been lowered to simply good enough because that stream demands ongoing uploads that fill the space that used to be contracted to corporate communication companies. Enter the new normal of webcam communications through Zoom and other video conference platforms and now the bar is lowered even further. What I did 10 years ago is ancient history. From the 80s through the early 2000s, there was ample opportunities that have decreased yearly as broadband allowed heavy files to be transferred and coded into HTML language. Camera companies act as if they create higher resolution images translate into a revenue producing opportunity. It’s simply not true and it’s far easier to shoot 4K than it is to edit it, so like high MP cameras, you end up leaving all that resolution to make it manageable for finishing. With most videos watched on phones it’s a total con as you never get to enjoy the full resolution you upload as it is streamed. If your passion and talent is so outstanding you may find an in road somewhere but compared to STEM graduates, the ratio is simply not worth the cost if the education. It’s ironic that there are more channels and uploads than ever but the profession is shrinking at an astounding rate. Others can disagree but take a hard look and sign up for talent hiring sites in production and discover how many job opportunities are actually out there and then calculate how many people who want them. A dirty secret is most are already filled but simply waiting for the posting to expire to make it official. It’s a tight knit community that hires their own through the people who are already established. Hope this helps.",2021-03-05T14:02:41.597Z,"Is there a market for video editors? ",Quora

In Pranayama, these are called ‘Mudras’.  Source: Facebook Pranayama is a deep breathing practice under Yoga. When our hands are in a particular Mudra, it helps the air we breathe in reach particular body parts. The blood circulates in that body part more. Each Mudra had its own benefits for our body and mind. This Mudra is called Chin Mudra. It helps the air we breathe and subsequently, blood and energy (Prana) reach the lower abdomen and lower back. The primary advantages of this Mudra are: Increases energy and stamina in the body. Boosts our immunity.Improves digestion and metabolismAlleviates lower backache.Relieving stress and any unnecessary tension in the body.Relaxes the body and improves sleep.This particular Mudra can be practiced anywhere and anytime. Superstar might be suffering from issues that come with old age like lack of proper sleep, troubled digestion, reduced immunity, tension (due to his political ambitions), and back problems with increased physical activity. He is 70 year old. Bu, whenever Superstar does this Mudra, everytime he subconsciously breathes in, the oxygen and energy works to give him a lengthier life and keeps him healthier.

Other people look upon men’s suffering, and don’t see it; or if they do see it, they don’t care. They don’t mean to be malicious; it’s subconscious mental conditioning; they don’t realize they’re doing it. When those same people look upon women’s suffering, they notice and care, and feel outrage, and try to do something about it. But when they look upon men’s suffering, they don’t even notice. It leads to all sorts of privileges for women, and disadvantages for men. For example, 97% of wartime deaths are men, 93% of workplace deaths are men, 93% of the victims of violent crime are men, 80% of suicides are men, 75% of the homeless are men, and men are given triple (2.8x) the sentence as women for the same crime. Yet, we generalize about service “people”; we celebrate women’s freedom of choice to undertake dangerous careers (even though very few of them do, denying the fact that the vast majority are men); we focus on women as the primary victims of violence (when they certainly are not); we focus upon women’s suicide attempts (which amount to a cry for help) instead of men’s actual suicides; most homeless outreach services target the minority of females; we continue to sentence men to much harsher penalties for the same crime (while extending forgiveness toward female perpetrators); and we like to blame men exclusively. Men are so accustomed to this that even men don’t notice, or notice but take pride in laughing off (minimizing) their suffering as nothing (see “board shorts”). This is learned bravado. Women don’t learn bravado. Women learn to call for rescue. Women tend to magnify their relatively-trivial suffering, and regularly cry for help and demand justice, even though women’s suffering is already dramatically less than men’s (never realizing how dramatically less it is). Feminists don’t realize that their whole paradigm is demanding rescue. They claim they are equals and deny they need rescue from anyone, yet do nothing but demand rescue, still playing the role of “damsel in distress”. Perhaps women aren’t capable of any other role. If they were really equals, they would laugh off (or take pride in) their suffering—as men do. This selectivity of notice makes it appear that men don’t suffer, and that “it’s a man’s world”. When you take all factors into account, however, a different picture emerges.  Mental conditioning like this was historically necessary. Men had to be the protectors who faced the predator and bandit in order to protect their communities. Everyone had to learn not to care about men’s suffering, for the sake of the community. Otherwise, the whole community would die. Over time, it became subconscious. Today, the mental conditioning persists, and men still have to set aside their needs and comforts (whether or not they are called upon to actually face predators and bandits, they are still brought up ready to do so, which means denying their comforts and feelings). This is a sacrifice for women and children; but men no longer receive respect for it. In fact, men’s sacrifice is actively denied and covered up, thanks to feminism. Feminism amplifies the problem by denying men’s sacrifice and contribution, framing men as oppressors, painting men as villains responsible for all the world’s ills, hating men, brainwashing the world to hate men, and leaving no social context in which men can earn respect. This causes many men to give up on intimate partnerships and even give up on their communities. Can our communities survive without men being incentivized to contribute constructively? Doubtful. Amazon.com: Men on Strike: Why Men Are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood, and the American Dream - and Why It Matters (Audible Audio Edition): Helen Smith PhD, Susan Boyce, LLC Dreamscape Media: Audible Audiobooks____ Feminists sometimes claim that women are disadvantaged in a variety of ways; for example, underrepresented in the ranks of top-level politicians. However, that is another example of female privilege, for those top-level male politicians are serving primarily the interests of women—another example of how men do women’s bidding. Feminists see a majority of men as top-level politicians as unjust only because they can’t wrap their head around men acting as agents of women. Therefore, they can’t wrap their head around human nature. It’s not the sex of the agent, it’s whose interests they are representing. If men did not primarily represent female interests, they would not get elected. Women prefer to have men do their bidding than to do for themselves. (Female politicians, on the other hand, do not represent men’s interests.) Systemic anti-female sexism is a myth resulting from selective vision and selective empathy.

I don’t have it on my LinkedIn profile, but I did Mr Science presentations for about a decade for kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grades at the school where my wife was kindergarten teacher, and volunteered for a year at the Tacoma Urban League Academy, mostly involved in repairing and maintaining the student’s computers. I’m currently building an electronics bench at OlyMEGA Makerspace and rebuilding the electronics bench in my own lab, part of which is designing newer test equipment. I started building my own test equipment when I was a teenager. As for my amateur radio license… I’m microphone shy, barely been on the air. Yet I passed all three tests in one sitting. It is the social stuff that I find very difficult. I have come to realize that it isn’t that I cannot read people, it is more like I can see through the mask of what they want to share and see sadness or anger or other emotions that they may wish to hide. And when I react to that, they may be angry at being embarrassed by this. Job interviews are a real trial. Everyone seems to have their own specific criteria. What seems to be an appropriate amount of eye contact for one person, another may find intimidating. I could write a book about handshaking! One person expects a strong handshake with a few hard pumps, the next expects a short clasping of the hands with a quick break. Another will grab your hand with both of theirs and stare directly into your eyes for what I find an uncomfortably long time. If you get it wrong, you are an asshole or a wimp.",2021-03-05T14:06:28.762Z,"What job do people with Asperger Syndrome on Quora have? ",Quora

God knows why, this embarrassing thing happened to me twice, a decade apart, in a college class: A woman in the class verbally abused me, following, a class presentation. In the first instance, I was 19, and I had chosen to present a study on love as a literary theme. I can't recall anything else about the presentation because of what happened afterward. The professor called for feedback from the class. Several hands went up, and he chose a young woman who stood out as she was beautiful, haughty and outspoken. She was in several of my classes, but we'd never spoken. Her feedback went something like this: ""That was the most boring thing I've ever had to sit through. It was just really stupid. I mean, she didn't even make one interesting point. Her whole presentation was just a boring recitation of literary references. Wasn't she supposed to make me care about what she was talking about? Because I didn't care at all. I just wanted it to be over."" I say it went something like that because it's hard to listen when you are incinerating in flames. I flashed back on this, several times, over the next decade, and I came to feel that she was almost certainly more embarrassed than I to recall this low moment in her young life. Obviously, she'd been very immature at the time. Flash forward to 1983, and I am finishing my degree at Bard College in upstate New York, through the Adult Continuing Studies Program. I am 31. To fulfill a social science requirement, I am taking a sociology class called ""The Sociology of Aging."" There are only about 8 of us in the class. There is a woman in the class who has made me her special project. She is a 49-year-old nurse. She is gratuitously mean and she reminds me of that girl of a decade earlier. I am a senior in the Studio Arts program, and I arrive for the evening class, in painter's clothes. The nurse laughs about the paint on my clothes as if this is a ridiculous thing to see on a college campus. For everything I say, in our round table discussions, she has an insult. When I joke that I received an AARP card in the mail, she says, ""Well, you must be close to 55. That's why you received it."" No one could have mistaken me for 55. The kids in my art classes didn't even notice I was older. This is a photo of me taken around this time:  The thing that she rags on endlessly is my scratching my nose. I have developed allergies, a precursor to becoming ill with an autoimmune disorder. I am allergic to the turpentine fumes which permeate my small studio. I paint with oils at the time. For a period of several years, which encompasses this time, my nose itches constantly. The nurse leaps on this embarrassing issue and declares me ""nervous."" I tell her it's an allergy. ""No, it's a nervous tic,"" she corrects, and she titters. She's happy because she thinks she's making me nervous with her habitual picking, and that it's making me scratch my nose. This hellish routine reaches its climax on the day I give my oral presentation to the class. Again, I have no idea what the fuck my presentation was about. All I recall is the nurse tittering, every time I scratch my nose, giggling, ""Look at how nervous she is. She keeps scratching her nose."" Afterward, we go around the table, giving feedback. All the nurse talks about, when it’s her turn, is how much I scratched my nose, how nervous I was, and how distracting this was. Nothing about my paper. Another thing I don't recall about that class is whether we covered the relative maturity of aging adults as opposed to young adults. Thirty years separated the Mean Girl of my youth and this witch, but no measure of maturity separated them at all. What is the most embarrassing thing that happened to you in a college class?

The best approach is through some variation of networking; we tend to accept the recommendation of someone we have some reason to trust over that of a number of (untested) credentials and a brief interview. And, in any case, this approach is likely to bypass those initial screeners. (Moreover, if you can reach the hiring manager, you can be assured that s/he is more interested in hiring someone, thus ending a painful process, than in rejecting, like those initial screeners). The recommendation acts as a form of guarantee; while no one expects every such to work out, everyone recognizes that the recommender loses somewhat in his/her standing if the one recommended does not work out, i.e., the recommender is investing a portion of his/her reputation in the recommendation. For interviewing, I suggest you work out several possible scenarios and rehearse them (which is why the more actual experience you have in interviewing, the better). Try to imagine all possible variations and quirks on the part of the interviewers; such preparation can be more than half the battle. Also, it is much better to admit ignorance of the answer to a question, than to try to wing it; even better is if you can say where you would go to look for an answer— so you need to be up on all likely (technical) information sources . In order to relax, go into the interview assuming that you will not get the job— so you really have little to lose, but you can gain some valuable (interviewing) experience. Remember, rejection is to be expected, so don’t take it too personally; but do try to get the interviewer to evaluate your presentation (and ask for suggestions for improvement). Finally, do not be excessively passive; recognize that the interviewer should need to sell his/her position about as eagerly as you are to prove you are more than qualified for it. Have a list of questions about the job, how performance is evaluated, and the likely career path if you do well. What are the company’s long term objectives (beyond just making money!) You may be asked where you expect to see yourself in 10 years— have a well thought out— not glib— answer. But then ask, where does the company see itself in 10 years? There are hundreds of books in print and thousands of (mostly free) articles online on every aspect and stage of the hiring process— consult as many as possible. But be forewarned, much of the advice is contradictory, so take it all in with a large grain of salt— what works for one may not work for another. Look for the meaty threads which are common throughout and try to develop a style/ approach which is comfortable for you. Above all, be humble, and be open to learning; the hiring process is a job in itself and one in which everyone has little experience or aptitude at the outset. Fortunately, the hirer is likely to have only a little more experience in his/her role; so, if you bear down and concentrate on doing an outstanding job of selling yourself, you are likely to come out ahead.

60423b46ed76476feda20883,https://www.quora.com/What-tactics-did-Julius-Caesar-use-to-gain-victory-at-the-Battle-of-Bibracte?-,"The following comes from my Book on the Roman Legions (see below): “The Helvetii occupied the territory between the Alps and the Jura Mountains, corresponding roughly to the western part of modern Switzerland. In the first century BC, the Helvetii, under pressure from various Teutonic tribes, planned to migrate from the Alps to the western part of Gaul. Caesar opposed the idea of the migration. Several other tribes joined the Helvetii, making the entire force among the largest and most powerful in all of Gaul. Caesar puts the number at nearly 370,000 tribesmen of which about 260,000 were women and children. In 58 BC, near the Aedui capital of Bibracte, the Helvetii attacked six Roman legions. The Aedui were a tribe of two minds with respect to Roman. A pro-Roman faction under Dividiacus had given way to the anti-Roman faction under his brother Dumnorix when Rome had failed to support the tribe against local invaders in 71 BC. This severely damaged the reputation of Rome among all the tribes of Gaul. Dumnorix, an Aedui chieftain opposed to the Romans, had been delaying supplies from reaching Caesar's army. Having turned from his pursuit of the tribe in order to renew his stock of grain, Caesar formed a camp at the top of a hill. Herein he placed his two newly recruited legions (Legio XI Claudia and XII Fulminata) with his more veteran troops in three lines about halfway down the slope (Legio VII Claudia, Legio VIII Augusta, Legio IX Hispana, and Legio X Equestris) organized in Roman fashion triplex acies, or triple battle order. He sent his cavalry to delay the attack. Caesar says little about the sequence of events in the battle beyond ordering his own horse and those of his officers to the camp so that he and his commanders might share the threats of the battlefield with the men. The position on a hillside probably offset the subsequent loss of observation, oversight, and mobility among his officers in the battle. For this reason, some historians rate Caesar as only an average field commander at this stage in his career, more interested in self-serving bravado than prudent military protocol. The Boii, Tulingi, and other tribes arrived with fifteen to twenty thousand fighting men to assist the seventy to seventy-five thousand Helvetii warriors, flanking the Romans on one side. Caesar reforming his third line to resist them. According to Caesar, his hillside battle line easily threw back the Helvetii onslaught by using pila (javelins). The battle lasted many hours into the night until the Romans finally took the Helvetic baggage train, capturing both a daughter and son of Orgetorix, an ambassador on behalf of the Helvetians to the other Gallic tribes. Nearly 60 percent of the tribe was killed and another 20 percent captured or surrendered as slaves. Caesar estimated that 130,000 men, women and children escaped. Yet the legions were unable to make a pursuit for three days as they tended their wounds and buried their dead. Some 10,000 Helvetii later joined Vercingetorix. The Romans founded the province of Helvetia in current Switzerland in 15 BC.” Further reading: Philip Sabin, Lost Battles, Reconstructing the Great Clashes of the Ancient World. 2007.

But you should know that, if you want to succeed anywhere, you must struggle. Even the successful you tubers have struggled in their early lives in YouTube to stand in a better place today. So, if you want to start a YouTube channel, you must follow the points to grow up: 1. Reason of Starting the Channel: First you should make up your mind clear about the reason of opening the channel. If the one and only reason is that you are opening the channel because many people and your friends have done so, you should not come to this platform. But, if you can think that, ‘I can handle it better and I will share my knowledge all over the world by this platform’, you are welcome and can be sure that the platform is made for you. Soon your channel will be growing up.  2. Not to Pay much Attention: If you think that you just have to be a YouTuber, make a lot of money and need not to do anything else like study, job, etc, it’s a completely wrong idea. You should not leave your study or job. Take the YouTubing as a part time job and do this at the ‘end of the week’/’daily morning and evening’/’at your own free time’. Never get so caught up in it that you forget the rest of your life. Take it just as you are testing this in the beginning and examine this to see how the result you get. Later you can take the decision. If you compromise your study/job for YouTube and if it seems at the end that you can handle none of these, you will fall in trouble.  3. Channel Category: Most of people think that, “In which category I can earn more – Tech, comedy, cooking, blogging? /In which day I will be get paid? /when will my monetization be on?” – Get these thoughts out of your mind. Just think that YouTube has given to you a power, by which you can show your videos to every people in the internet. That’s the diameter. You have to think that the money is a bonus point. The money should not be kept in front as the main thing. If you do so, you will become much more dissatisfied thinking that you are working but it takes more time to receive money. So, forgetting about the money, just focus on that, you will be going to give an interesting and amazing creativity to all the viewers. Don’t switch the channel category towards the money. Only do what you can with your heart and you have interest in it. May be someone has Tech/Comedy/Blogging Channel, but don’t follow him and bring some new creativity from yourself so that people know you.  4. Gear: There comes many questions to mind about the gear that – Which laptop? / Which lens? / Which camera? / Which tripod? And most of people think that “at first I have to build up a studio and then I will start to make video”. Please try to understand that you are just making this as your hobby and nowadays you can get a better camera on your own smart phone and good microphones are also available cheaply in the market. You can make a video just with a selfie-stick or a cheap tripod. So don’t focus on the gear but on the content of the video. If you make the content strong, then people will definitely watch your video. No one will look at your camera quality/microphone quality/other such things. You can start the You-tubing with a very little investment (Rs.1000/Rs.2000). You can shoot your videos indoor/outdoor and it requires no light system. Just show your creativity to the viewers. Don’t think that, you should come to this platform after investing a lot. If you think so, then at last you will be dull when there will be no many viewers on your channel.  5. Video Frequency: There is an important point that – In which frequency will you upload your videos? – Every day?/every week? etc. It doesn’t matter that you have to upload 100/200 videos a week. Just look at it, so that you can maintain the frequency right. The matter is like that, if it is committed to the viewers that they will get your videos 2 days in a week, you have to do so. You should maintain the specific frequency, which is easy to you.  6. Video Idea: Most of people come to this field just with a category idea like – ‘I will open a Tech channel/comedy channel/cooking channel’ etc and that’s all for them. But that’s not the diameter. You must do brainstorming about the video ideas before starting the YouTube. You should have a stock of minimum 10 – 20 video ideas to come to the day-1. It’s not like “I made a video because I had a good idea, now I have become blank because there is no idea, what will I make now?” Hence, your channel will become to freeze with blank ideas. So please think of the video ideas as advanced. You can choose the video category about what is trending or what people search more. Nowadays most countries specially India is limited to just a few categories – Tech, Comedy, Cooking, Music, Entertainment and finished. But friends, there are many variety of categories in the world. So, you have to point out some interesting and unique categories. What do you do a different so that people know you for? Start the branding from the day-1. Keep a single user name to all of your social media accounts like YouTube, Twitter, Face book, Instagram etc, so that people know you as the one and only name.  7. Earning Money: You can earn a lot of money from the YouTube but it depends on your views and subscribers. And you can only increase your views and subscribers when you work hard, there is no shortcut. Just continuously you have to make videos and automatically the views will be increased, may be a video go viral. Just you have to put effort and it can be only done when you really like it. Hence, even if you get just 100 views, you can be happy with that.  Conclusion: So friends, I am repeating again and again on the every point that, come to this platform if you really like it, work with consistency and don’t think for the money. If you can give effort, then you of course will be successful. There are many YouTubers in India, who grew up very early. Many good creators have come out of them. They came up with many unique ideas. In fact there are more other ideas. Do something different that other people are not doing, so that people know you and like your Videos. So, these are the basic tips and the others are, you need a good thumbnail - i.e. known to all, a good Video title – also known to all, good description, key words, these all are the basics. Video editing and the other such things can be done just with a mobile phone. This is not, that it requires a laptop or an editing machine. Hence, just take a phone and come on. If you ever have a question like “Why am I doing YouTube” or “What is this”, then the YouTube is not for you and you should not do this. YouTube is not the only way to earn money. There are other thousand ways to income. Who knows where your talent is? So, just think with a cool mind and then you can come to the YouTube. Give a big jump. I have full confidence in you that you will break all records and go far ahead in your life.  Follow my space- Work From Home Tricks -for more answers :) Thank you and wish for good luck!

Though they have printed an edited version.  Please find below a detailed and unedited take on a similar question. A simple answer would be Yes. Right from Charles Darwin to Vera Wang and from Boman Irani to Nawazuddin Siddqui there are plenty of stories of unparalleled success after 40. However it might have been even tougher for them to achieve this success as it must have involved a lot of unlearning and relearning. Breaking away from the conditioning and moving out of the cozy comfort zone is where most give up. Motivation to do something more challenging or restless craving to realise one's potential is not enough but it also requires unrelenting commitment and zealous conviction. However the situation you are going through is not as simple. The first step would be get out of denial and don't let anybody tell you that you have no right to be unhappy with your life. However try to understand what is the reason for unhappiness or dissatisfaction or restless cravings. So answer the first question why are you in this state? Next is the answer to the question, what will make you happy? Find what you feel you should have achieved by this time in life? The next couple of questions are where do you want to actually reach and when? If the goals are realistic and are hence set, then meticulously plan on how are you going to achieve it? Put monitoring and check points to the plan and religiously review your plans. If the review dictates the plan to be revived, so be it. Lastly, I would like to add that materialistic goals are never ending and at times do not sustain longer. 'The desires can never be saturated by the consumption of the desired objects. Like the offerings made in the fire, (never put it off but) blow it all the more.' [ Mahabharata 1.1.3]. The highest level of happiness is intellectual happiness. Hence, to understand and experience this type of happiness, the individual has to comprehend the source of happiness at both the cognitive and experiential levels. This last part comes from teaching of my economics faculty Prof. Sakhalkar. I hope you find your answers and ways. All the best!",2021-03-05T14:10:07.590Z,"Is forty too old to change careers? ",Quora

You need to start… While I don’t think most people want to take my long path, here’s what worked for me and how you can do that in a shorter timeline. However, I made many mistakes early on and had some challenges that slowed me down. Find resources: VoiceoverXtra is a great website with lots of resources. It’s probably an overwhelming amount for anyone new to this world. And that’s just one place. However, go there and start exploring. Everyone there is in the voice over and voice acting world, is very knowledgeable, will provide you good advice and will link to other great resources. Make mistakes: Record yourself. Put yourself, and your voice, out there before you’re ready and then learn from it. Practice. Read aloud every day. Record yourself reading. Listen back to yourself. Then do it again. Try to remove all the punctuation and do it again. Put the punctuation where it needs to be to make this sound right for you, where it works for breathing and to make the copy sound real. Get thick skin. Get used to hearing yourself, and that you sound quite different from outside your head. I recorded my first work when I was like 17, PSA’s and sponsorship scripts for a college radio station. I had to listen to those horrible readings for several months before I had the opportunity to record them again. In that time I learned a lot about how to do it better. Get some training: My training started, completely by accident, shortly before my voice dropped. I had a lisp (called siblance in our world) plus the added benefit of stuttering and stammering. As a result, I mumbled. A lot. Speech therapy allowed me to make my mistakes in front of another person’s ears, hear how I could properly explore the different parts of my mouth, deliver words with more energy & presence, how to strengthen my lips, tongue and vocal cords. I learned and practiced several tongue twisters I still use to warm up. Don’t have the issues I encountered? Find your local community college, community theater group or comedy group and take an acting or improvisational class. Don’t want a class, or have a class nearby, look for a Meetup group for acting, improv or theater in the area. Start one if one doesn’t exist. For me… part of training is you, alone, learning how to be comfortable being uncomfortable while sounding comfortable. Oh, and get good exercise. Lung capacity is important. This will all prepare you for the next step… Get Coaching: The best thing you can do is have a professional in the field who helps you, to sound more like the best version of you, by giving you positive feedback and a positive path to grow and develop. I learned the best from a friend who was a very skilled producer/director and she helped me get so much better over several years of working together. We’d play back a reading, dissect how to do it better, then try again. I used this and would record my coaching sessions with my students. I’d ask my voiceover students to tell me about something great or exciting that happened to them. Later, I’d ask them to read a script. The next session I would have those recordings ready to play. I’d let them compare the sound of telling me a story and then reading me a story. Then we would work on getting the sound of reading a script more like them telling me a story. Proper coaching prepares you for proper mic position and technique and working with future producers, directors and clients too. If you skip it - you’ll regret it. There are coaches out there for all lines of voiceover and voice acting. They should all be positive, have a goal in mind (that you both develop for you together) and come to a point where they can no longer teach you more in a worthwhile manner. Once you have coaching under your belt, even if you don’t feel completely done, but you’ve started nailing your reads, gaining confidence and know how to avoid siblance, plosives, can change your energy from serious to ecstatic (with the same copy) without complaint, or many missteps, the next step is… Make your demo(s): You and your coach should agree that you’re now ready to make your demo(s). This isn’t something you should, in my opinion, schedule on day one. It also isn’t something that should takes years to be ready for. It can be weeks of work, if you have some natural skills and talents, or it can be months if you really need to develop your instincts and skills. The more prepared you are and the more willing you are to do the work to challenge yourself, the better this will be. Work with a demo producer who knows what they’re doing. Get recommendations. Many people at this stage are actually landing some work. Perhaps you’ve volunteered for a local friend or no profit to do a commercial, video, their phone system, or even get paid. You’ll need to work with the demo producer to get more coaching (mainly to select scripts and for them to learn your range) or you’ll work with your present coach to do this and the demo producer will record you before editing and mixing your demo. Please don’t make your own demo. Unless you’re a producer yourself it’s nearly impossible and, even if you are, it will take you far longer than it should to make it. Get equipment: Many people pick up the equipment along the way. You need a computer and then a low quality mixer (Behringer UM2 is as low as about $30), something like a Shure SM58 (about $90 or less, used is usually fine), an low quality XLR cable ($10 from a local music shop), some semi decent headphones (Audio Technica ATH M30X for about $60 or Sony MDR7506 for closer to $99) and software (Audacity is free and ‘good enough’ for awhile). These can be upgraded as needed with a proper mixer, a microphone that’s better suited to your voice and these headphones can be in your ‘road kit’ as you upgrade). You can land low paying jobs doing fan based work that will pay $5 - $20 for cartoons, game expansion packs and other work at places like ‘Casting Call Club’ and online groups. Once you have professional quality equipment you’re ready for the next steps… Marketing yourself and getting clients, managers or agents: You will need to tell people about who you are. You’ll need to have a niche (don’t be the person who claims ‘I can voice anything’) You’ll need business cards and a website where you can post your demos. You’ll need to network. This will give you clients. Clients give you cash flow and credibility. Cash flow and credibility establish you as a professional. You then become bookable. Bookable people who can do good work for clients, and can represent themselves well, can get representation from an agent or manager. You shouldn’t pay a manager money up front. For anything. Some will want more demos for a niche you don’t have represented well. Some will even pay for these to be made as an investment in your business and theirs. Overnight success?: As you can see - this might not be something you can do overnight. But, maybe you can. Start this as a hobby. Learn as you go. Build on what you do. Start making money. It’s a great problem to look at your full time job and feel like it’s holding you back from making what you should be making. Many people aren’t prepared to work on their own and many successful voice talents I know keep a part time job.

As my friend, writer, producer, director, and actress is continually fond of saying, “If it were easy, there wouldn’t be an academy award for it.” The fact that you find it easy indicates 2 things to me: 1. It is something you enjoy. 2. You’re just getting started. I can’t tell from your question exactly how or why you began editing. I also can’t really discern what your software or experience is. But I would ask you to look at the world of media as it exists today in all its glory: music, movies, commercials, documentaries, tutorials, television shows. All of them use video editing to some extent. Yes, even music. (think of your favorite piece, now think of the music video that goes with it) These are the outlets that use/need video editors. Now to your question: Filmmaking is the standard course structure you’ll be taking at whatever institution you choose. Why not just editing? Glad you asked. Editing is the final process in the complicated post-production world. Editing can include cutting the film together, speed grading the film (aka colorizing), designing and inserting the audio, designing and inserting titles, designing and inserting the credit roll. The larger the budget, the more people can be contracted to which any or all of these tasks can be delegated. Sometimes the production schedule is such that an episode has to be completed in an absurdly small amount of time and a number of editors are used and given parameters for the style of the editing. Each editor gets put in charge of a scene and they stitch them together in the end. And remember that editing is only the POST-production part. The pre-production and actual production (when it is shot) must be done with editing in mind and a clear vision (usually the director’s) of how the end piece should look. That means the Producer, Writer, Director, DP, and Composer, must work together with the editor to produce that vision. So, cooperation and collaboration is imperative with each step of the process, with each person doing his/her job to the best of their ability so that everyone else gets what they need to produce that vision. I’m only guessing here, but are you using Final Cut Pro 10? Editing with FCX can make editing seem easy because it comes with a lot of presets and 3rd party plug-ins abound (bells and whistles). It has become the AOL of editing programs. That’s the good news. The bad news is that almost nobody in the pro-industry is using it anymore. They lost a lot devotees when they upgraded from v7 to v10 and launched themselves into the prosumer category. When the interface started to look like iMovie a lot of us jumped ship. If you’re serious about being an editor (a very crowded field), you’ll want to explore other softwares. I am partial to Adobe Premiere and the supporting apps found in their Creative Cloud subscription suite. But Autodesk’s Smoke and Sony’s Smoke are 2 others that bear consideration. This is not the time or place for an editing tutorial, but try approaching your next project with this parameter in mind: use only fade-ups, cuts, dissolves, and fade-outs as transitions between scenes and shots. Remember that storytelling involves different usage from documentaries or commercials. While study this, include the use of J-cuts and L-cuts in your work and see what that does to your progress of story. Editor IS the job. Chances are really good that if you have seen video on any screen anywhere, there was an editor involved. Think about the number of screens, channels, movies, videos, tv shows, music videos working in the world around you and you can get a rough idea about how much editors are needed and how many are working. It is a highly competitive field with lots of positions. Easy? There is a mighty good chance that you simply aren’t paying attention to the details involved. Before you sign up for a $30K education, take a look at all the resources available online. Simply Googling “video editing how to” produces about 6,650,000 results. And yes, I copied that number straight from the search. Next, watch a major film (Game of Thrones comes to mind) and don’t consume the story; watch the editing and remember the hours and hours of footage that goes into getting one episode exactly right. Ask yourself some hard questions: do you know the basics of composition? Do you know how to edit to story? Do you know about formats, CODECS, resolution? How much time should you schedule for a 30 sec spot to be edited? A 30 minute TV show? Anyone who has been staring down the barrel of the final steps of editing with a deadline looming on the other side of dawn would never say that editing is easy. As an editor, you are one of the major forces of a group of people that come together to create a visual and aural world. This could explain why film people have that slightly stunned look all the time, since during production they are always working when not sleeping. It is a consuming art form. Many of us do little else besides work, eat, and sleep (with that last item being the one that is usually in short supply). Welcome to editing. I sincerely hope your research doesn’t scare you off from taking up a skill that is obviously to your liking. Good Luck.",2021-03-05T14:12:51.817Z,"What are some majors or careers related to video editing? ",Quora

When I first started out as a YouTuber, I was poor. And I mean really poor. I was a new college student and I didn’t have a job. I probably had like $100 to my name. I did however have a crappy laptop and a PS3. Unfortunately, my crappy laptop was only able to record games in ~360p tops with heavy frame drops. It was really bad. I really wanted to be a YouTuber, but I couldn’t bear to make these horrible videos that took 4–5 hours to render. So, since my laptop couldn’t record in any decent quality, I turned to my trusty PS3. Now, the PS3 (like any other console) is made for gaming. Not recording. So, there was no easy way to record footage without the help of an external device called a capture card. These little things cost anywhere from $10 - $300 depending on the quality you want to be able to get. Since I had no money, I sprang for a $10 one. I was so excited when it arrived and I was ready to record some awesome videos! That was until I did a couple of test recordings… The video quality was max 480p and the audio quality was unbearable! I could not stand for this! For Christmas, my dad got me one of the higher end ‘Elgato’ Capture Cards ($120). This one could to 1080p and the audio was spot on! Everything was looking good for me and my future career in YouTube! But apparently, the PS3 (and PS4) has something called HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) that makes it so that the capture card cannot record using HDMI. This means that I could do a max of 720p. Still good, but not the best. Not to fear, there was a way around HDCP! I had to go buy a HDMI Splitter to bypass the HDCP and allow the Capture Card to record. Ok, now everything was good, right? Wrong. Another problem arose. I wanted to be able to record my voice from my headset, but the Capture Card was not able to do that (since the headset was an input to the PS4 and did not output). This was fine for if I wanted to do a single player Let’s Play because I could simply plug the headset into the laptop and record my audio through Audacity and merge everything in editing, but what if I wanted to play with my friends?!? This is where things get interesting. There was no easy way to split my audio to send it to both the PS4 AND the PC for recording, so I had to buy a SECOND MIC. This mic would be used to record my voice to input into the PS4, and my headset would be used to record my voice on the PC. A little bit annoying to have to talk into two mics, but I can deal with it. Everything set? No. So now I had a problem where the audio output from the PS4 was only outputting to the Capture Card and the TV through the HDMI cables. I wanted to be able to hear the sound in my headset. If I played with the sound through the TV, I would get an echo in my voice audio because the headset and the other mic would pick it up. This was a problem. I bought an Auxiliary cable and an adapter from aux to red-white component cables. From there, I was able to connect another adapter that came with the headset to wire the sound to the headset. Then I set up the PS3 to output to both HDMI (for the recording) and the AUX (for my headset). After many hours of watching tutorials, buying stuff, setting things up, and testing, I could finally record a game of Battlefield 4 with my friends. Everything went smoothly, except that I had a really bad laptop and so half of the Elgato recordings would go corrupt, and it would take forever to edit, but everything was 100x better than before. The Summer after that, I got a job and built a computer. Day 2 of having it, I met up with my friends. Wanna record something? Yeah! Shadowplay (free) for gameplay footage set up? Yep. Audacity (free) for audio set up? Yep. Check one, check two. Go! So why do most YouTubers use PC to record games? It’s soooo much easier! No need to spend hours upon hours figuring out and setting up some crazy hardware for recording when you can just get some amazing free software that does everything with the click of a button. Consoles are just too difficult to record with! Now, I will say that things are getting better for console YouTubers. The PS4 (and maybe the XBone?) allows recording and even editing straight from the console. It is however nowhere near as flexible as recording and editing on PC. It’s a start though. In conclusion (and I know that is a very generic way to end an answer), the reason most YouTubers use PC and not console to record is because it is just so much easier. There are also some things like higher FPS on better PCs and also better graphics. And there are more games on PC. PC is overall just the better way to go when doing YouTube.

She gave and delivered a kickass commencement speech at Wellesley College in 1969.  Not yet a Clinton — she didn't meet Bill until the next fall, at Yale Law School — Hillary Rodham delivered a remarkable address during commencement festivities for Wellesley's Class of 1969. Rodham was sharp, witty and forceful, displaying some of the chops she's carried onto much larger stages. She closed by reading a poem written by friends, its final lines offering an instructive glimpse into the pragmatism that has characterized her political career: She said, And you and I must be free Not to save the world in a glorious crusade Not to kill ourselves with a nameless gnawing pain But to practice with all the skill of our being The art of making possible. And with that, Hillary Rodham set off for New Haven, Connecticut. 2. She was one of 27 women who graduated from Yale Law School in 1973, out of a class of 235.  Rodham arrived at Yale in the summer of 1969. She graduated with honors, and was one of only 27 female students in a class of 235 in 1973. She spent the next year doing postgrad work at the Yale Child Study Center, before heading back to Washington, D.C., where she had spent a summer on Capitol Hill working for Sen. Walter Mondale (D-Minn.), to join a select group of attorneys charged with deciding whether to impeach President Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal. 3. She was the only woman on the Nixon impeachment investigation team. The year before she married Bill Clinton, Rodham became the lone female counsel on the congressional team investigating Nixon's role in an attempted burglary at the Democratic National Committee's offices and the subsequent cover-up. Hers was a brief stint, and there's some debate about the terms of her departure from the team. 4. She cofounded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families advocacy group.  Hillary and Bill were married on Oct. 11, 1975. By 1978, Bill was serving his first term as governor. Hillary, though, wasn't just hanging around while her new husband ascended the political ladder: shejoined the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, then helped create the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families organization, which is still up and running today. Clinton helped author its original mission, which, according to the group's website, calls for it to serve as an ""independent force to provide information and education to parents and citizens about our state's policies toward children and families. She broke the mold for first ladies with her speech at the 1995 United Nations Women's Conference in China.  Source: Getty Images Clinton traveled to China in September 1995 for the fourth-ever U.N. Women's Conference. ""We are to find common ground,"" she told the conference at the beginning of her nearly 20-minutespeech, ""so that we may help to bring new dignity and respect to women and girls all over the world."" For Clinton, it was just the latest chapter in what was by then a long career advocating for just those things. But as the diplomatic face of the U.S., China was the site of her now-celebrated debut performance. It was only the beginning. She won a Grammy for the audio edition of her book, It Takes a Village.  Source: Associated Press In January 1996, Simon and Schuster published her book, It Takes a Village. It quickly became a bestseller and, a year later, Clinton won a Grammy for the audio version. ""I didn't even know that Grammys were given to tone-deaf singers like me,"" she said, collecting her award, ""but I'm very grateful for this."" 7. She worked with Ted Kennedy to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program.  Source: Getty Images The late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D.-Mass) credited Clinton, then the first lady, with applying the necessary pressure to get her husband's White House to support the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or S-CHIP. ""The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" Kennedy told theAssociated Press in 2007. An aide to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield,told the New York Times in 2000 that Clinton had been ""a one-woman army inside the White House to get this done."" She won the most votes of any female presidential candidate in history.  Source: Ron Edmonds/AP In narrowly losing out on the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination to Sen. Barack Obama,RealClearPolitics estimates that Clinton collected 18,046,007 votes, the most ever accrued by a female candidate for president. As she suspended her campaign that spring, after months of pitched political battle with Obama, Clintoncounted each one as a crack in ""that highest, hardest glass ceiling."" ""And the light is shining through like never before,"" she told her supporters, ""filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time."" 9. She set the stage for Obamacare by pushing health care reform in the '90s and during the 2008 campaign. Though the 1993 plan often referred to as ""Hillarycare"" turned into a political mess for Bill Clinton's White House, it did set into motion a chain of events that led to the writing and passage of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. In an ironic twist, Senate Republicans responded to the Clintons' initial plan with one of their own, one that Politifact sayslooked ""strikingly similar"" to what we now call Obamacare. Additionally, it was Clinton who, during her 2008 debates with Obama, insisted that an individual mandate would be necessary to fund a health care overhaul. Though Obama denied it then, it became an important and controversial part of his signature domestic policy achievement. 10. She became the most-traveled U.S. secretary of state ever.  Source: Getty Images As she prepared to leave office in January 2013, the Atlantic did the final calculations. During her four years as secretary of state, a post she accepted at Obama's request soon after he was elected to his first term, Clinton traveled a record total of 956,733 miles. That meant more than 2,000 hours in the air and on the road. In all, she visited a record 112 countries over four years as America's chief diplomat. 11. She set into motion the first American talks with Iran since the 1979 revolution. Clinton also managed to do a few things during all that time on the move. Most notably, she dispatched a young aide named Jake Sullivan on a mission many Americans believed impossible — to begin what the Associated Pressdescribes as ""secret talks with Iran that led to the start of the international negotiations over the country's nuclear ambitions."" The jury's still out even as those initial efforts have now yielded the framework for a potentially historic deal. But if the sides can come to a formal, multilateral agreement by the June 30 deadline, this might go down as Clinton's most remarkable achievement, whether she wins the presidency or not.

It is a product of the common belief among white Europe at one time that the white man is superior to all other “races” and to our long relationship with slavery. There is a common belief that America is a highly racist society. Compare to some other countries our racism is somewhere in the middle with India, Finland, and Japan being among the most racist. I could cite a lot of statistics, I have them, or post a bunch of examples but I don’t need to. Three examples will suffice. Colin Powell prosecuted our war with Iraq as a four star General, the highest rank at the time. He served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of State. He also outed the Republican Party as being a highly racist organization. He could have run as president had he wanted and was so popular he had a good chance of winning, I would have voted for him. His autobiography, My American Journey, was a best seller He had a successful career speaking both across America and abroad. He has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Citizens Medal, the Congressional Gold Medal and many other awards. He has a BS and an MBA. He holds honorary degrees from a number of schools and schools have been named after him. Colin Powell is black. This could be dismissed as an anomaly except we have also elected a black president, Barak Obama, twice. What other first world country can say that? Obama was not only elected twice but he also finished his administration with historically high poll numbers. His wife has been voted America’s most admired woman. Her book Becoming was a best seller. Michelle Obama 'most admired woman in US' How could either Obama or Powell have had such successful careers in America if we were the highly racist country America haters like to claim that we are? They couldn’t have. Obama’s successful career as president was followed by Trump, an unapologetic and vulgar racist. His poll numbers are among the lowest ever and his presence has created unprecedented polarization in the country. For most of us he is an embarrassment. How can you create polarization unless there are two opposing sides? One side represents hate and racism, the other does not. We have racists in this country. They are a dark, crude, and ugly presence but they are also a minority. Because of a constitutional quirk their man, Trump, who lost the popular vote against an unpopular candidate by a substantial margin, managed to get in. Most of us are dismayed and can’t wait to show him the exit. We think he’s repulsive and his poll numbers reflect this opinion. If we are the racist society our haters accuse us of why isn’t he riding high in the polls? Why do so many people gag on his name? The fact is that while we definitely have racism in this country it’s not most of what we are. It’s just that they’re so noisy.

To find these men, increase your search net – turn to online dating for starters, and join social groups where you’d want to find a quality partner (volunteer clubs, outdoor athletics, church groups, large-scale work events are examples.) These are where many of my friends met their future spouses. Modern Romance,[2] a sociology book co-written by Aziz Anzari, talks about how people used to find their dating partners in the 1930s and 1940s, how people find their spouses now, and cultural differences that can influence the hunt. NYC and LA with their big city vibe and large pools of fresh fish have no problem using Tinder to find a date, for example. But rural Pakistan or small-town Iowa might have a problem with that. What, did you just get matched with your cousin? Or your second grade classmate? Some more creative dating strategies might be needed in such areas. The Southern United States is more quick to couple-up, for instance. So finding a single guy might mean altering that definition to include finding a “newly-divorced dad of a 5 year old.” A single man is a single man, even if he got married at 21, divorced at 28, and is on the dating market at 30. In Washington D.C. on the other hand, where marriages take longer to happen, people aren’t expected to get married until 31 anyway, so finding a single & unmarried guy at 34 isn’t considered that late in the game. Utah, with its Mormon influence, has the earliest marriage rates in the country, with women marrying at 23.8 years of age and men marrying at 25.9 years of age. Like I said, in such an area, a divorce support group or a dad’s play group may be a part of the plan. Or an advertisement of your glorious singlehood, a positive message of: “Yes, I’m the rare bird who’s not yet married, yet I am radiant and proud of who I am” might flock the guy in the same situation (the one gem in a beach full of pebbles) to hunt you out, go on dates with you, and eventually put that ring on your finger. Maybe I’m mixing my metaphors here… I’ve already spoken at length about the need to market yourself and attract potential guys. The only other piece of advice is to improve yourself, for your own sake, so that when Mr. Right comes along you’ll be in the best internal state you can be in. Don’t wait around to grow and improve yourself - learn to fix a toilet, learn to cook, mediate your temper, advance your career, learn to dress sharply, etc. Become the best you that you can be. Grow every day to be the perfect woman (eyeroll, I know…) so that you can attract your perfect man. Also, ask a guy out. Are you letting “gender roles” prevent you from taking a chance on any great potential men who pass by? Your future husband will tell stories about how you were so confident that you walked up to him and asked him out, and how irresistible that was, and how it caused him to marry you. Nice story, worth the risk… Ask guys out. P.S. While your date nights still consist of you watching Netflix by yourself, also pick up the funny and nerdy book Data, A Love Story, by Amy Webb. It is her memoir about dating, as a neurotic woman in her 30s who was feeling unlucky in love. The short and sweet TED Talk version is here: How I hacked online dating In the TED Talk, she discusses how she was wasting her time doing first dates with ‘losers’ because that was the strategy her family suggested: “Amy, you just aren’t trying hard enough. Give these men a second chance.” Instead, she ditched that strategy, and she got laser-like focus finding the perfect guy for her, a very specific set of credentials including age, height, outdoorsiness, nerdiness, music preferences, and being Jewish. After searching for guys meeting this criteria, she met her match and now they are married and have children together. Her silly testing for strategies in the online dating world means you can copy her tactics without having her level of data crunching. You can spend less of your time wasted on ‘losers’ whom you know from the start aren’t a match for you. (They’re perfectly great guys, if you love the Mets, or vegan cooking, or mullets, or want to meet a man who has stockbroker discussions for 80-hours a week, someone who works as a ‘family values’ farmer with 30 rifles, or if you’d want an outdoorsy Jewish man now in his 40s [Perfect for Amy!]. Don’t waste your time on these guys fit for someone else, you need the guy of your dreams.) He’s out there somewhere. What are you doing to recruit him? What are you doing to find his location in your are? When you do find him, will you be brave enough to ask him out?

They both live under the brutal thumb of their oppressors, and their oppressors are best buddies. From the day the US invaded PR, her people were treated poorly. Day one brought an order to fire all public school teachers. Those teachers were replaced by monolingual English speaking teachers. When children were unable to learn in a language that they did not speak, they were branded lazy & stupid. The only US city straffed by the US military? Utuado, PR! The longest held political prisoners in the history of the US? Puerto Rican Indepentistas. Grateful for your bug spray. Unknowing Puerto Rican’s died so that you could have less mosquitoes on your patio. Birth control pills important to you? PR women (who thought they were taking vitamins) bled to death so that you would not. That safe X-ray count on? It’s safe in part due to the PR political prisoners who were exposed to torturous amounts of radiation so that would not be. Despite the fact that there is no substantive home rule in PR. Puerto Ricans vote! We voted not to become US citizens, not to become cannon fodder for WWI. Every 10/20 years there is a non-binding plebiscite that asks island residents whether they favor US statehood, independence, or maintaining the status quo of “Commonwealth” status. Do you know what a non-binding plebiscite is? It means that the question is asked in the clear understanding that the answer does not matter. The past, present, and future of Puerto Rico’s residents lays solely in the hands of the US Congress. PR has one congressperson. He/she does not have a vote! My father was career US military, having served honorably in WWII and Korea. When he retired, and went home, he was unable to vote for his commander-in-chief. Thanks to that non-voting congressperson, he has absolutely no say in the welfare of his home. While PR is called a “Commonwealth” every single court case with regard to her health and welfare has been decided along colonial lines (Look up Insular Cases). When the US imposed the Jones Act, it imposed what is functionally a 40% tax on every single thing that is imported to PR. With the destruction of our ecology by US manufacturing, PR has intentionally been deprived of any hope of self-sufficiency, meaning that more & more is imported. In the wake of Hurricanes Irma and María, I hear people saying that PR has had a bad 5/10 years. Puerto Rico has had a bad 120 years. To be clear, although I am obviously an Indepentista, I advocate for home rule because that is what is right and just. Functionally, legally, Puerto Rico is a colony. The US is our toxic overlord. Her people are treated as less & other. Puerto Rico needs more than paper towels and broken promises. Because we cannot, we need you to vote for home rule and a just recovery. As for Palestine, ut has been my experience that those who support a #FreePuertoRico also support a #FreePalestine. We support each other because history has shown us that if we don’t, no one else will. There is nothing here that cannot be verified with minimal research.

Then you will get bored of it. So choose something that you will never feel bored of. If it’s cooking ! Be it, Go on , become a chef. When it comes to introvert point of view, If you go for a software job or govt job or any other such jobs , there are huge chances you need to speak up , mingle with your colleagues and team mates. Trust me buddy, if you are working on your own without speaking with anyone else, be it shyness or some other thing, they will name it with something else. We can’t expect anyone to understand us. So basically you need to choose jobs in which either you work alone or jobs with minimal social interaction. Here i’m listing some of such jobs Freelancer (logo Designer, Writer, anything) : being a freelancer , you can always work alone on your own and for smaller tasks like logo designing , article writing, data entry and many more freelancing jobs you don’t have to interact with anyone else except with your client.Social Media Manager : To be a social media manager, you need to extremely active across social media , but it’s not real world interaction or socialization.Geo scientist : who works outside most of the time (sometimes with teams ) and in front of the desktop for the rest of the time.Writer : Become a writer, write novels, books. Unleash your creativity.Blogger : Become a blogger. Choose the niche that you love, start a blog, start writing content. You can always work alone unless you need to expand your website and blogging to a large scale. In my personal experience if you love blogging, you will never get bored of it.Some other jobs i’m mentioning as a listPhotographerAstronomergraphic designerNight watchmanTruck driverBook keeperLibrarianAccountantArtistElectricianLab technicianScientistAnimal care takerSome might find some of the listed jobs as funny.

The first thing I need to tell you is that you need a strategy to follow your dream to be a sound engineer. You’re already one step ahead of the other students, because you already know what you want to do and then can prepare well to be a happy and competent engineer. So, the next step is college. (I know you can skip college to be a sound engineer, but that is not my advice) I know that there exists some courses really specialized for Sound/Audio Engineers but what I recommend for you is to enroll in Electrical Engineering. All the mathematical foundation from Sound/Audio Engineering is in the EE course. You will be able to learn important mathematical concepts like Fourier transforms, DSP algorithms and programming that will be really valuable for his career. In parallel, because you already know what you want to do you can follow your passion to be a sound engineer studying, enrolling in online courses and practicing the concepts as a hobby (you learn a lot when practicing as a hobby because you do not have all that pressure you have for the college classes). I would also encourage you to search for an internship in laboratories and audio companies after the 4th semester as a huge opportunity to show up your passion and grow your talents as a professional (good for your CV too). Also,you will have the opportunity to work with other audio engineers and learn from them. Now, after your graduation as an Eletrical Engineer I encourage you to pursue a Masters course specialized in Audio/Sound. After that you will be really confident about your skills and will be able to work with bands if you want the crazy Audio Engineering life (trips and tours), or as a researcher if you enjoy the search for new algorithms and strategies in the field or you will be able to work to a company/studio if you desire this path.

In truth, there are really no career paths open to you if you do not have any other skills (soft skills or otherwise) or qualifications to go with your knowledge of languages. There are a number of very, veeeery limited things you can do with your languages if you have few employable skills (note: I didn’t say no skills at all). These are: Internet polyglotteryPretty much the most basic thing you can do. All you really need as capital is a working internet connection and a webcam. This career path usually involves polyglots setting up a YouTube account where they talk about learning different languages, alongside a blog of some sort where they elaborate on their thoughts, reach out to their followers and come up with new marketable ideas. An example:  Successful internet polyglots can create an entire career out of their own brand name alone. The clearest example of that would be Benny Lewis with his extremely successful Fluentin3months blog. In fact, his blog was absolutely monumental in galvanising a new generation of polyglots. Even if it isn’t strictly through brand marketing, other successful internet polyglots go on to do a lot of incredible things: Richard Simcott and Alex Rawlings started organising polyglot conferences a few years ago, connecting polyglots from all over the world (mostly from Europe and North America) and providing interesting networking opportunities and new business connections. I got to talk to the founder of iTalki for example. Brian Kwong has launched a pretty successful Facebook-based language-learning business called the Add1Challenge, and David Mansaray has a series of extremely interesting podcasts as well. Conor Clyne has kick-started an advertising requests for additional revenue. Polyglots also create courses: Judith Meyer has created a top-notch website called LearnYu; Olly Richards has come up with his own really cool courses as well; Dima Gurbatov has created Spanish podcasts and audio courses; I’ve just helped Vladimir Skultety edit his ebook on Chinese characters; as well as Jan van der Aa with his VocaBooster courses. But here’s the thing. To really succeed in this career path you have to have a lot of valuable soft skills. You need to have an entrepreneurial, self-starter attitude. You need to be able to communicate and network. You need to be personable and memorable. You need to be disciplined. You may also need to have other skills such as coding, web design and marketing. Languages alone don’t cut it. Even so, very few of these polyglots live off their blog/YouTube/course revenues alone. Many of them have other jobs as their main source of income with their polyglottery serving as additional revenue. I believe Richard works as an ambassador at a company and Olly worked at the British Council. Conor is a lawyer and so was Dima. It can be extremely difficult to sustain a decent quality of life on just internet revenue alone. It can be done, but it is not a stable career path by any means. Oh, and if you want to embark on this career path, you’d better get right on it. The market is getting more and more saturated every day. Tour guidesThis may seem like a natural route for multilingual speakers, but it also isn’t really as simple as it looks. Without any form of certification you won’t be employed. And even if you do end up working as a tour guide, you need to have incredible communication and organisational skills, be an engaging and outgoing public speaker, and be prepared to be on your feet a lot. Ad-hoc translationI know a few polyglot friends doing this right now, basically accepting translation requests from friends and acquaintances. This can be fairly well-paid … provided you have enough friends and acquaintances to provide you with work. It can be a pretty hard to sustain without getting some form of certification that would provide greater legitimacy to your translation work — particularly when it comes to more specific areas such as technical translation. WritingBenny Lewis has arguably forged this path for all polyglots looking to rely solely on polyglottery as a career path. Writing best-selling books can be an excellent way to gain income. Again … being a writer is far from easy, language learning is a limited market and Benny is arguably an anomaly, as one of the main reasons why his book was so successful was because of how much traction his blog and his brand gets. Writing a book can be incredibly arduous and demotivating work — just ask anyone who’s ever had to do it :)     ESL teaching and online tutoringAgain, ESL (or any other second language teaching if you speak a ‘major’ language like French or Spanish) teaching is probably the most stable career path out of all the ones I’ve listed above. However, you will need a CELTA or TEFL certificate and those can get quite expensive. The world of ESL teaching can also be rather cruel in certain parts of the world, especially if you are an English speaker who does not conform to a certain Anglo-Saxon aesthetic. But it can be well-paid, you get opportunities to travel, you get set hours, a set salary and the opportunity to use your languages. Online tutoring is slightly more tenuous, but it can be a great way to supplement your income. I would recommend signing up as a tutor on iTalki. This is mainly for retired folk, students looking for extra income or stay-at-home husbands or wives looking for something to do. But it can be well-paid especially if you offer help with exam prep.  As for slightly more viable career paths that you need specific skills for in addition to your language skills: Professional translation and interpretingDon’t bother applying for professional translation jobs in places like the UN/EU, major translation companies etc if you don’t have any formal certification and years of experience. They won’t be amused. Again, very difficult work, but it can be rewarding. Make sure you get certified, else you won’t be able to find much to do. Also, specialised interpreting (medical interpreting, court interpreting) can be well-paid. But it is very difficult work, you have exams to sit for and a clientele to build. If you are interested in the translation/interpreting path, I would suggest you go to Facebook groups and start reading, connecting and learning. Log into Facebook | Facebook Log into Facebook | Facebook Log into Facebook | Facebook Linguistics/academiaOkay, you technically don’t have to be multilingual to be a linguist, but it does tend to help. This is a very academic route though. Plenty of polyglots who are research-inclined, like André Müller, find this an attractive route to pursue. This is hard work. You have to slog through your Bachelor’s, then your Master’s, then your PhD, get research grants, teach, do fieldwork and/or produce original research. And attend conferences and network with other academics, should that be necessary. You need to be extremely disciplined and have a huge love for language. And have excellent critical thinking, analytical and written/oral communication skills. Also, depending on where you are, this can be very poorly-paid, as humanities and social science disciplines don’t tend to be well-funded outside of the West. Which is a shame, but academia can be a thankless job in itself… Regional/international organisationsWe’re talking about UN and EU bodies here, as well as other international NGOs and charities. The good news is that they often value (and often require) multilingual speakers. I don’t believe that it is possible to get a job in any EU or UN organisation unless you are fluent in at least two official languages. Also, this is a very desired career path because of its stability and (where possible) international opportunities. The bad news is that … you’ll need other skills. A lot of other skills. They won’t hire you willy-nilly. Be prepared to have at the very least a postgraduate degree and several years of relevant experience in that specific sector (development, human rights, cultural preservation, economics etc.) to apply, and then some. If you are interested in this route, have a look at these websites below and prepare accordingly: Jobs at Unicef UK - Unicef UK Careers UN Careers Other professional/vocational trades: medicine, law, journalism etc.This may not be what you want to hear, but multilingual skills will probably be most useful as a supplement to other more traditional career paths. Knowing multiple languages can be very helpful when working as an analyst or lawyer in international corporations, for instance. Or as a doctor in multilingual societies. Or as a journalist covering important global events. I don’t want to sound like a broken record by saying this, but it goes without saying that if you want to embark on these particular career paths, you’ll need to have the education and experience to show for it. Your languages here would serve as an added bonus, the additional seasoning on the plate, but it won’t be the main dish.  In conclusion, the paths open to you just for being a polyglot are pretty much zero. Even for paths with very low barriers to entry (ie. internet polyglottery) you will need to rely on and develop a range of soft-skills — from networking to entrepreneurial skills — to be truly successful. Good luck, and I hope this has helped somewhat. Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:20:39.414Z,"What are the career options for a polyglot? ",Quora

There are several online businesses that can be started without a team and require little to no over overhead. The most obvious business is that of an online writer, blogger, or content creator. These titles are related but can have slight variations. Online Writer: As an online writer you can become a daily or weekly contributor to several online media outlets. You can offer your services for a fee or free to the outlets in hopes of wide spread distribution which in turn acts as a way to market your brand and build your online credibility.  Blogger: A person by definition that writes a singular message to a specific market or community. Bloggers have come into great popularity over the years and have spawned a whole new subset of careers and/or passions. Bloggers place posts on a Blog or site that displays content in reverse chronological order (the most recent post appears first). There are several variations of blogs and bloggers. Here are a few:1. Personal Blogs2. Group or Collaborative Blogs3. Microblogging 4. Corporate or Organizational Blogging5. Vlogs: Video Blogs (My personal favorite) Content Creator: As a content creator your job is to create content that you can distribute yourself or sell to other distributors. 1.Video:  Entrepreneur magazine listed video as one of the top trends of 2015. I believe that every entrepreneur, regardless of their profession, should invest in creating video content to be distributed online. As technology progresses it allows for everyday content creators to create high quality video from their mobile phones. I heard a story a few months ago of a young man that created a movie on his IPhone that was acquired later by Netflix. Use what you have until you can do better. Just get going with something.  2. Audio: Audio content in my opinion is the easiest form of content for an individual to consume. I listen to audio content (Audiobooks) coming and going from my office, to meetings, vacations, etc. I usually listen to business books. I call it my Road University. Smart phones has also made it very easy to record content from your phone. There are free and low cost audio editing software available online to edit your content before distribution. Once again don't wait until you have the perfect budget, time or energies. Just do it. ""The Farmer that waits for the perfect time to plant will never harvest."" 3. Written content: This is the most obvious form of content creation but has sagged in popularity in comparison to video. In the age of instant gratification the written word still plays a vital role in content consumption(Quora) and will always have a place in the hearts of consumers. Suggestion: Write about something you like or have a vast knowledge of. Your readers will know if you are just writing or truly delivering value with your message.  Follow my three P's of writing: Write with passion, proficiency, and purpose.  Extra Bonus: White Label ProductsThere are many products that can be labeled under your brand or business name. The white label market has grown over the years  expanding into various markets and or industries. You can private label vitamins, drinks food, articles, programs, etc. Most of the grocery store brands that you see as Kroger or Walmart brands were not produced by those companies but only labeled and marketed as their brands. This is a great way for manufacturers to focus on market research and delivering the best possible product while others can focus on product distribution. Find a white label product that you believe in and get going today. Here is a quick 3 step process 1. Find a product that you love.2. Create a Brand3. Market, Market, Market Extra Bonus #2: Become an Online Marketer for Offline businesses There are many offline businesses that have not quite figured out how to pull it together online. Online marketing is not rocket science but it is just something that has to be done and done right. You can help these traditional brick and mortar companies by helping them to develop their online presence. You can help to educate them on using social media outlets to create a following online for their business that they run offline. 3 steps 1. Help them set up a Facebook page, Twitter Account, and YouTube channel2. Help them to add posts, get new likes, and create content.3. Research what online presence currently exists and use common sense to help make it better. (For example: They have an online directory listing with old information listed. Help them correct the data. Sounds simple but most businesses do not focus or take the time to make these things right.) Before you get started: 1. Get Incorporated: Make sure that you have protected yourself from outside threats to you or your enterprise. (Consult with a business consultant, accountant, or lawyer when making the decision on which entity to choose.) 2. Create a simple business plan: I am not telling you to go out and create a 30 page plan (But it might help) but I am saying to place your vision on paper. Take the time to write out how you will conduct your affairs as an enterprise. *Financials are the most important part of any plan* Make sure you know how you will make money. I use this simple approach: How much money do you plan on generating in a year. Divide that by months and then by weeks and days. This will show you what needs to be generated on a daily basis to complete your goal. For example: If I am writer that charges $100 per article and I want to at least make $60,000/Year. Take $60,000 and divide it by 12 months which is $5,000/Month. There are four weeks in a month so you divide $5,000/ 4 weeks = $1,250/Week. Take $1,250 and divide it by how many days you are willing to work in week let's say 5. $1,250/5 = $250/Day. $250 = 2.5 Articles. Therefore it would take you 2.5 Articles a Day at $100/Article 5 Days a Week, 4 weeks a month, 12 months of the year to make your goal of $60,000. Pretty simple. 3. Create a brand: Go out and get a domain name for your business. Pay for a simple logo or just use plain black text with a cool font. Create a simple one page splash page. Get some simple cards from a print store.  Last Thoughts: There are several other online businesses that you can pursue but this is a good start. As soon as you can fit it in your budget to get an online virtual assistant that can help you with some of your tasks. You can probably find the budget  for an assistant in your regular spending cycle by eliminating certain luxuries like Starbucks(Sorry Starbucks), or by picking up one extra client a month. Figure out a way to work smarter. Get going and have fun on your new journey. Good luck. Warmest Regards, J.R. McNair Past Solopreneur Cash is usually king but in today's world Information reigns.

Every component was Avid branded. Making changes to the system cost a lot of money. The introduction of DV and Final Cut Pro truly put digital on the map. It also spelled the death of the high end editing suite. Not so much for high end professional work. But it allowed companies to install their own video departments for a fraction of the money.

I once worked as a Software product development head with a CEO who really did not have an idea what the differences between exe, DLL and such components were. Once he asked my programming team to explain what are ‘exe’ and ‘DLL’ files and what is meant by version mismatch and configuration management, after one year of exposure as a software company CEO. He was a great Sales and Marketing person, with prior 10 years of Sales and Marketing experience selling PC’s and mid-range computers to large organizations, and had joined as the CEO of this software products company, based on this sales strength. He was successful in sales, and later on he started his own business focusing on software services. Thus, business management and entrepreneurship in software, like putting together a product idea at a higher level (I am not talking about writing an app and getting 1 million downloads or a few million in venture capital funding, but rather an idea like a food-delivery service app, and using other programmers to build the actual software products for it ) also may not require hardcore mathematical, programming oriented skills, competency or even exposure.

More importantly though, is whether this is a casual flirtation with editing, or something that you wish to take up seriously. There are essentially two target audiences of potential users. The casual and the non-casual user. The casual user is someone who just wants to manage their videos with a minimum amount of learning. They don’t want to know about split edits, color correction, frame rates, etc. They want to string a few things together and be done with it. The non-casual user is someone who is genuinely invested in their project and is willing to learn how the various tools work, and while they may not be able to afford it in the beginning, they are someone who knows that eventually they may purchase a “full version” of the software. The idea is similar to someone who buys a “no frills” point and shoot camera, and someone who buys a DSLR with all sorts of parameter controls. The ability to adjust these things may not be important when you are first starting out, but you know you will eventually grow your knowledge to the point that you understand and appreciate the ability to manipulate these settings. While there are no “free” cameras (not including the one in your cell phone), there are a lot of free-ware packages with varying degrees of success. As someone who has trained hundreds of editors, each and every one of them tends to fall in love with the first one they use. Same for computers: If you learned on a Mac, you tend to stick with it, if your first computer was a PC, same thing for PC users. If you are aiming for a career oriented app, Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro are a few of the top of the line that may or may not have free versions. Lightworks is another product that is free, however it’s somewhat limited. They have additional modules that you can purchase as needed. Lightworks was a serious competitor to Avid for many years but eventually lost it’s corporate backing. I would also caution that it is not for the faint of heart, as it’s very “engineer” oriented. One of the few that I know of that I’ve gotten great feedback on is Black Magic’s DaVinci Resolve, although I have not used it personally yet. The only difference between their paid version and their free version is the ability to network between 2 or more editing stations. This is most likely not a concern for most home users. But it is a fully functional system, with no hindrances like watermarks or timeouts or limitations on what resolution you can output at. It is a serious, high quality, full and complete app and also has magnificent color correction software affiliated with it. Black Magic is busy coming up with ways to disrupt the marketplace, and they are doing a good job of it. Their color correction software used to be very expensive, but they give it away now so that you will be inclined to buy their GUI, which goes for around thirty grand. Things like Imovie and Windows Moviemaker product are useless crap. Why?, you might ask? Because they are not fully functional. You cannot trim at the frame level on a lot of these low end products such as Imovie. You don’t have full and absolute control of your audio or video, to the degree you will eventually need. And if you don’t have absolute control, you cannot properly edit, and in fact will learn “the wrong way”. Furthermore, if you aspire to a career as an editor, you will not find any serious post production environment that uses IMovie or MovieMaker. I like Adobe Premiere very much, but the idea of a subscription for software galls me. Most people will never edit enough to justify a fifty dollar or more monthly subscription. You need to consider what you are editing and where it will eventually land: Is this for posting videos to YouTube, or are you planning a project with special effects or elaborate audio bound for the big screen? How good is the Chroma Key Module? How good are the graphics/titling? Another element. to consider is just how good the product is or isn’t. Again the Apple and PC “training wheels” apps like Imovie and MovieMaker aren’t designed for the “professional” market. If you are going to do anything more then stringing together home movies, you need fully functional software. You may not need chroma key or comprehensive graphics or even sophisticated audio manipulation to begin with, but as you grow into your editing skills, the last thing you want to discover is that Chroma key is an option or that the app does not address audio to any great degree. The idea is that you have invested a lot of time and effort into learning that product. Outgrowing the app and not having the means to step up can be very frustrating. Something else to consider is your computer and peripherals. For any editing you will need a 2nd hard drive. Putting your raw elements on the :C drive along with you operating system will eventually burn out the HDD, as it will be constantly trying to do two things at once. Make sure your second drive has fast enough throughput to sustain a constant stream of audio and video. You’ll also need a boatload of RAM. You will need to upgrade your video/graphics card. You may want to consider color-coded key cap keyboards and shuttle knobs or track balls to further your editing efforts. If you are constantly on the computer, carpal tunnel syndrome can be a threat. At the very least, get wrist pads and don’t scrimp on things that contribute to your physical well being while editing. The thought here is that as you grow as an editor, the cost of something to be added in to your system will become less important than how it enhances your ability to edit. As you become more familiar with editing your audio, you are going to want a better audio setup, typically a small mixer and better speakers and amplification. You may want to output to DVD or Blu-Ray. You will need decent DVD/Blu-Ray Burner, and solid authoring tools. Most editing software that has a section devoted to authoring can sometimes be a hit or miss proposition. My personal favorite for authoring discs is Sony’s DVD Architect. Like their CD Architect, it is a very solid and well written program that is dedicated solely to the business of authoring a DVD, which is a whole world beyond just editing that comes into play I apologize if I appear to be rambling or vague, it’s just that there are so many questions to consider when picking a software package, and so much more to consider as you do more and more editing. You should do research suited to your needs. And as long as it’s free, don’t be afraid to make mistakes. As your knowledge grows, you will be able to make more of these decision on your own, rather then relying on old curmudgeons such as myself. Picking an editing software package can be a personal thing. You will find one that really agrees with you, the trick being to find it early on.

His excellent films ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" effectively inaugurated the independent film movement of the 90's when it became a surprise hit. Having achieved this prominence early, he has since become one of the most experimental and risk taking known directors, rarely repeating himself - this alone earns him the position of being ""great"". Soderbergh could have easily graduated into directing blockbusters full time and has instead opted to continue to push himself with films that range from oddball to straightforward genre stories.  Taste is subjective, and if you do not find his films appealing no book, quora answer or list of ""great directors"" should change your mind. But try to separate content (the story, what the film is about) from technique to get a truer appreciation of what Soderbergh brings to the table.  To get a true appreciation of his work I would also go beyond the box office numbers and search out his supposed failures (""Kafka"", ""King of the hill"", ""Schizopolis""). The story on Soderbergh is that he made a great debut with ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"", then a string of poor films then had to stage a comeback, but I disagree - the films of this period are often his most experimental and surprising works, although they are not the easiest to get into. In terms of what makes Soderbergh such a great director: - His mastery of editing: Soderbergh brought back into vogue and updated the 70's style of editing, more impressionistic and disjointed, where one cut doesn't necessarily follow chronologically from the next but is dictated more by mood and how a character feels. The often quoted seduction scene in ""Out of Sight"" is a good example of this. Or watch ""The Limey"", a later movie, to get a sense of his great editing instincts and the way Soderbergh can build mood and story purely through cutting, without need for dialogue. Then listen to the very funny ""The Limey"" audio commentary, where Soderbergh and his writer go at it (respectfully, but still with some strong exchanges) for the entire length of the film. His writer was not very happy at how much of the script Soderbergh dispensed with. Soderbergh is almost always listed as one of the editors of his films, and is sure to have a strong hand in the editing even if he works with another editor.  - He is his own DOP, and he's a very good one: Early in his career, Soderbergh worked mainly with Walter Lloyd, but since ""Schizopolis"" has been more often than not his own cinematographer. ""Traffic""'s over saturated, high contrast look became hugely influential on TV shows in the 2000's and was Soderbergh's own creation. But look also at the use of sickly sodium yellow tones in ""The Informant!"". Or the composed camerawork and desaturated colours of ""Contagion"". Soderbergh never repeats the way his movies look and feel, and shows mastery of another of the key roles of film.  - He's a pretty good writer, too: Soderbergh rarely writes his movies, particularly as he has progressed in his career, but ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" has to be considered one of the most original and tight scripts of the 90's, that any writer would be happy to have on their list of credits. ""Schizopolis"", which he purportedly wrote day by day and as such didn't have as script as such, is a wild film about scientology and modern society, which if you latch on to its tone I think is one of his best films. - He takes wild risks that most other directors wouldn't attempt: Soderbergh followed on from his first hit with a biopic in black and white about Kafka, that is not truly like any biopic you've ever heard of. ""Schizopolis"" has to rank as one of the most original films ever made (its audio commentary, were Soderbergh interviews himself and asks some very uncomfortable questions is also part of that package). It was shot with no script to start with, generally considered poor filmmaking practice. ""The Informant!"" is a film that has most of its value in its use of voice over, another supposed no no in filmmaking. Generally, if a filmmaking book tells you not to do something, a Soderbergh movie has done it. - He has a breadth of imagination as a storyteller: Consider all the places that a Soderbergh film takes you to - the modern drug war, a Vegas caper, the world of male strip clubs, 1940's Germany, the spread of a fictional pandemic, a future expedition to a sentient planet, revolutionary Cuba... just for that, it's worth going through the Soderbergh catalogue alone. His characters also rarely face the same predicament, he doesn't simply tell the same story in a new locale.  - He can also play within the system: Soderbergh has also shown he can take an adaptation, and join up with a cinematographer, editor and writer in the studio system to produce a solid hit. ""Out of Sight"" was just such a film, and gets right what so many other films can't get at, mixing comedy and romance in a non-schmaltzy way.  If you believe, with Kubrick, that one man writes a novel, one man writes a symphony and one man directs a film, Soderbergh has proved he can handle all the main skills of making a film to produce challenging work. But he can also stay within his job as a director and produce hits in the factory style of filmmaking. He's as versatile and interesting a director as there are out there. Steven Soderbergh is probably one of the most influential directors of his generation, largely due to circumstantial reasons.

Firstly sound cards can all record at certain rates - the rate the sound card is capable of will affect the quality of the microphone recording. If you’re using a USB mic then at the end that plugs into the computer is a small USB sound card built into the cable, this is how a USB mic works, and the quality of that sound card will affect what quality you can record at. If you’re using a mic with a 3.5mm jack on it then it’ll be the sound card in your computer that you plug it in to (even if you’re using a laptop with the jacks built in or the jacks on the motherboard of your computer these are all going through a sound card, they’re just soldered to the board rather than an actual separate sound card). If you look in the manual for your device it should give you some information about the recording quality and most importantly it’s DAC rate. The DAC is a Digital to Analogue convertor. What this does is it takes the sound your are trying to record which is an analogue waveform and converts it to a digital waveform. Both digital and analogue waveforms have their advantages - you may have heard people say that vinyl records produce a much better sound than a CD, but in some cases CDs can produce a much better sound than vinyl - this is because vinyl records audio as an analogue waveform, where as CD records audio as a digital wave form. Each of these waveforms has it’s own unique advantages - if you’re recording a natural sound like music from a live band or someone singing then vinyl would produce a far better reproduction of the sound than CD - with vinyl being analogue it is able to reproduce the entire waveform from the lowest bass note to the highest treble note (even up to frequencies that only your dog can hear) - provided the device the speaker and amp can handle these frequencies as well. But on a CD there is a thing called a bit-rate - CDs are 16-bit audio recorded at a 44,100Hz sample rate. The sample rate gives a maximum frequency of about half the sample rate (so 44,100Hz sample rate would give max frequency of 22kHz - the human ear hears at max 20kHz so 44,100Hz is good), also the bit rate determines the clarity of the audio. CD audio or digital audio does have an advantage to vinyl in the fact that it can strip out audio that is not wanted easier - defects in the recording media like scratches can be ignored because they are not part of the digital audio make up, but also with this audio that is not within the specific 20kHz frequency is also ignored and depending on the bit rate the gap between each possible frequency can differ - let’s say for example you’re recording a trombone and the trombonist uses the valve slide to play from C4 (middle C) down to B3 if you were listening to the trombonist playing that live you would hear all frequencies from 261hz down to 246hz in succession - if you recorded that onto a vinyl record you would hear a reproduction of the same thing… however if you recorded that digitally you might only hear 261hz, 256hz, 251hz, 246hz if you recorded it at a low bit rate… or if you lowered the bit rate even further you might only hear 261hz, 253.5hz, 246hz (these would be extremely low bit rates that you’d probably never record at but more to show an example of how the bit rate affects the quality). So the higher the bit rate the more detail there is in each second of recording (the amplitude is broken up into smaller and smaller blocks - like resolution in a picture - a 4K video has smaller blocks than a 1080p video - the blocks are still there but the smaller it gets the harder it is to notice) - but it’s still never as good as the original or the vinyl recording - but if you had a scratch in the vinyl recording the needle would not know to not play the scratch as well in the audio, where as the digital audio would know that it doesn’t follow the digital pattern and so would ignore it. Sound cards themselves also have different levels of bit rates - let’s look at a few sound cards and their differences then… so let’s take a look at the Soundblaster G3 - simple cheap basic good quality sound card - these are it’s specs…. Recording Resolution Mic-in: 16-bit, 48.0, 96.0 kHzMic-in: 24-bit, 48.0, 96.0 kHz So we can see that on the G3 it’s capable of recording in either 16 or 24-bit with a 48,000Hz or 96,000Hz sample rate. Then let’s look at Soundblaster AE-9 which is the extremely high-end Sound Blaster Mic-in: 16-bit - 44.1, 48.0, 88.2, 96.0 kHz, 24-bit - 44.1, 48.0, 88.2, 96.0 kHz, 32-bit - 44.1, 48.0, 88.2, 96.0 kHz So this one will sample all the way up to 32-bit producing a much more clearer audio. Then there is also the Soundblaster X7 Recording Resolution Mic-in: 16-bit, 48.0, 96.0, 192 kHzMic-in: 24-bit, 48.0, 96.0, 192 kHz It can’t do the same bit rates as the AE-9 but it does support a much higher frequency range.

The relevance of the tutorials and examples presented isn’t clear, and it seems like everybody is wasting your time. I’ll let you in on a secret. It seems that way, because they fucking really are wasting your goddamn time. Heinously. Nobody’s wasting your time quite like people who are telling you that you need to “start small” or going “why not try a simple mobile game instead?” That’s bullshit. The skills necessary to build an RPG don’t magically grow out of creating unrelated products. The systems they use also do not have that much overlap with other genres of games, save maybe action-adventure or straight-up point-and-click adventure games — and even then to a limited degree. On the technical side of things, it’s also worth noting that most tutorials are designed to cover a basic topic within the editor or on how to write code syntax, or the basics of object-oriented programming. Lots of “programming 101” and “Unity 101” topics for beginners. Not much in the way of concrete information about what really makes up the guts of a majority of games. Programming language tutorials are out there, but in terms of the actual problem-solving and engineering skills and design patterns that are helpful in constructing a game larger than a one-screen tutorial, that information is very thin. What this adds up to is that if you stick to that coursework, you will never, ever be prepared to build an RPG. To echo Victor Volkov, the one and only reliable way you can learn to make RPGs is by actually making RPGs. Forget the tutorials, bust open the Unity script reference page — which by the way is the very best documentation in the entire game industry — and start building an RPG. I’ll give you a few tips to get started with your bullshit-free learning. One consistent key to the process that I’m going to outline, though, is recognizing that your goal is to learn and experiment, not to produce a saleable product. As long as you keep that readily in hand and don’t attach too much of your ego to what you build, you can go far. I’ll be blunt, though — this could definitely take you a year or two.  Find a Team that’s Making Something Better than What You’re Making I cannot stress this one simple thing more. You will benefit the most from being involved with an experienced group that is already developing a project along similar lines to what you want. When you see how pros do things, have them there to answer questions or explain how something works, and can explore their code and their prefabs for yourself, a lot more things will click for you very, very quickly compared to trying to build the entire world on a solo project. This one simple thing, provided you’re able to dive into code and actively contribute, makes more difference than any other single tip I can give you. To be very, very clear — it has to be a project more technically demanding than what you can build yourself. Bigger, more ambitious, yet attainable relative to the group and its talents.  Explore One System At a Time Dice up the systems you know you need to build into the smallest, most granular collection of pieces you possibly can, and explore how to build one of them at a time. Off the top of my head, you need the following: Save Data — How to save your game data to the disc.STICK TO SERIALIZABLE DATA. IE - if you use Dictionaries a lot, make sure to translate them to a format that can actually be saved to disc.Game State Management — How to port information in-between areas of a game and make it persist. What quests you’ve done, your characters’ current stats, health, what’s in your inventory, what events you’ve completed, what puzzles you’ve completed and so on. Gets saved to Save Data. Gets a lot easier to wrap your head around if you’ve made at least one adventure game in your career.GUIDs and Hash Tables are your friend.Movement — How to move a character around the overworld. Could be split up into sub-topics depending on what kind of rules you want movement to follow.AI and Navigation — Learn to use the Nav Mesh system and that saves a lot of trouble in creating NPC AI in the overworld. Then you’ve just gotta learn to make them actually move around and do stuff. State machines and behavior trees.Cutscene Scripting — The means by which you’ll make cinematic events, dialogue trees, or cutscenes happen. Basically, a system that can put the normal gameplay and controls on hold for a little bit while the cutscene system moves the characters about like sock puppets.Interaction System — The means by which you walk up to and use items in your world, or pick up objects, or interact with puzzles, etc. etc. etc.Puzzle System — The means by which you define what a puzzle is, how to interact with it, and when it’s in a “solved” state. Ties directly into game states.Battle System — All the stats that make the meat and potatoes of your game work. Depending on the style of gameplay this can entail tons of sub-systems.InventoryStatsBattle FlowDeathetc.Menus — It pays to think a little bit ahead and try to create a menu management system that makes creating menus with lists of options fast and easy. Doing everything manually through Unity GUI is an option, but with as many menus as an RPG needs this gets tedious.Includes any ingame text display you need to do. A Text Display System unto itself could be considered a separate item.Localization — A localization table system is your very very best friend. You need to be able to obtain text in any number of languages via a key-value system. This will permit you to do quite a lot of useful things with text.Camera — The mechanisms by which you can control the camera. Ties in with cinematics, as well as some other systems.Sound — How will you play sound, and in fact how do you manage the memory overhead of sound?Content — What defines a weapon? What defines an item? What defines a character, a monster? Somewhere in all of this, all of the above ideas need to come together to create actual ingame objects. Each of them is its own puzzle, and you sometimes need to re-cut the puzzle pieces to force them to fit together.Animation systems and visual effects are not unusually a vital part.As you can probably observe, no single one of these concepts is trivial. Each individual one of them is detailed enough for you to spend a month or two getting the principal work done on just that system alone, after which you’ll spend the rest of development time maintaining it as you build the other systems. Integrating them all together smoothly is in itself a skill and a full-time job, as is creating tools with which people can build content using these systems. As a technical designer those two things are the bulk of what I do on a game development team. It is absolutely a full-time job, such that you can spend an entire project building and maintaining nothing but these systems and never have a hand in creating ingame content. More to the point, though, it is possible to learn how to work with any given one of the above systems by itself, as a single project. Make little projects in which you can craft a camera system, a save data system, and so on, and use them as a testbed in which to puzzle out how these ideas work. If you get stuck, make a list of the things that has to happen in order for that system to complete a desired task. At that point you should be able to look up something in either MSDN’s C# reference or the Unity script reference page to figure out how a task works. “How do I save a data file to a specific directory?” is a good one. Follow that with, “how do I load a data file from a directory?” After that you’re mainly interested in the contents of that file and the way in which it’s displayed in your UI, which is a problem you can solve later. Note that the projects you build in order to test and learn each of these are not for any purpose other than just that. Go nuts with debug keys and debug commands and stubbed/hard-coded data. Nobody cares, you’re just trying to teach yourself how to make a save system and prove to yourself that it works. This is all just experimentation. One after another you’ll start to de-mystify some of these systems for yourself — and eventually you’ll be able to build them in a couple of days rather than a month or two. Most of what follows is the specific details of how all these things are presented to the player in your specific game, which is inevitably the most time-consuming part of your job. Specific visual effects, menu animations, and the means by which a battle operates are prone to being very fiddly.  Read the Documentation If you get a new tool, read the documentation for it. There’ll be a manual or a scripting reference, and you should acquaint yourself with it. When you’re programming, google C# classes you don’t know how to work with and read the MSDN C# reference page. I refer back there for Delegates all the time. Do the same for Unity components. The script reference page is nothing more or less than a big list of all the actions that can be done with any given component inside of Unity. When you aren’t sure how to accomplish a specific task, check the Unity answers page to see if someone else asked the same question. You will find a wealth of people trying to solve the same problems you are, and you can benefit from the fruits of their knowledge. These sources are your best friends. Always be ready to have them on hand.  Create a Throwaway RPG Project For your first RPG, you should make something that you absolutely can afford to throw away rather than something you think you’re going to get attached to. Forget the magnum opus — you need to build an RPG purely for the sake of learning how all of the above systems, even highly simplified versions of them, fit together. It’s going to suck, it’s going to have bugs, or it’s going to have limitations you hope you don’t have to live with — but it’ll be a functional RPG. Your goal should be, in that situation, to satisfy a certain checklist of requirements: Has a Main MenuCan Quit to DesktopCan Quit Back to Main Menu from IngameCan Start a New GameCan Move Around an EnvironmentCharacter animates appropriatelyCan Solve a Simple PuzzlePuzzle complete status is conveyed to the player in a clear fashionCan Fight a Simple BattleVictory and death are both accounted forCan continue from checkpoint in the event of deathCan move between multiple rooms or scenes and keep current status/character data/itemsCan Acquire and Use ItemsCan Talk to a CharacterCan Display Text Messages to the PlayerCan Save Data to DiscCan Load Previous Game and Resume ProgressCan complete an objective and Display Credits… And then Go Back to Main MenuFeel free to compromise on one or another of these, but your goal should be to make these things happen more so than to make them presentable or even worry about making it fun. Battle doesn’t have to mean anything other than hitting attack and watching the player do damage. Then, hand the controller over to your best friend and ask him to play like a jackass. Record him and watch the bugs happen. Fix the bugs. The goal is, in no uncertain terms, to satisfy the barest minimum of something that could be recognizable as a completable game on a technical level only. This is a learning experience, not a product. Every game you ever make will have to satisfy some version or another of these criteria and possibly a couple more items that I’m not quite remembering. An important part of all this, though, is to commit. Don’t stop and tear down a project even when it seems like it’s going badly, see this throwaway project through until you have fully satisfied the above list of tasks. At a certain point in practicing this, after working on a fistful of live projects, these fundamentals and the means to integrate them together will become rote. You will know to establish this ground early, and then shape the details around it — like an artist massing out clay before creating a real sculpture. What will then happen is that, at a certain point, you’ll cut the time down on building and integrating all of the component systems of a game to something like a month or two.  Stop Reinventing the Wheel Wanna know a secret? Some version or another of a huge amount of the sub-systems that I outlined above are all available in the Unity Asset Store. You can save years on creating a viable project if you get certain packages and understand when and where to apply their use. Here’s a few that I like. NodeCanvas - A visual scripting tool specifically for creating state machines, behavior trees, and dialogue trees. Solves your overworld AI almost completely and, provided you’re making a game with a kind of oldschool feel, gives you a means to control scripted events and dialogue options.DOTween - A tweening library for Unity. If what you’re making is an oldschool Final Fantasy-esque battle system it can handle a lot of the in-battle “hop over there, hop back here” kind of stuff. For any project at all it has countless applications, especially in UI.Master Audio - An audio management system that makes organizing and playing sound files for your games almost effortless. Dynamic Sound Groups permit per-scene and per-object sounds to be managed easily. Has a playlist system just for music, which makes fade transitions and other such things very easy to deal with.ProCamera2D - A 2D camera system I use in every 2D project. Tons of options for cinematic camera moves, tracking of multiple characters at a time Smash Bros.-style, rubber-banding the camera (if applicable), and so on. You’d spend three months programming a camera that would be its equal in being fully-featured.Ootii Message Dispatcher - Instead of direct calls, make different objects subscribe to a specific message. Then with one call you can send out that message and have them all fire off that event at once. RPGs have enough inter-mingling objects to make this kind of thing invaluable.ProBuilder - Build test environments inside Unity with simple mesh modeling tools.Text Mesh Pro - When you need text to be just a little prettier and more sophisticated than Unity’s default GUI text classes.More tools exist out there for things like material editing, creation of splines, save data systems, and more. There is some wisdom to checking the asset store to see if it has an equivalent tool available to what you’re looking for. You can’t always be guaranteed that they’ll do everything you need for your specific games, but very often you can be assured you’ll be 90% of the way there. I often create a class that serves as an abstraction for specific systems while using an asset store tool to handle the nitty-gritty. I’ll have Master Audio, for instance, which is doing the bulk of managing my sound for me — but then I’ll have a Sound Manager I script for myself which is what I actually make calls to in my game’s code, because very often I’ll have a specific way I want all of one type of sound or another to play or a very specific way I want music to fade in and out during transitions, and I don’t need to configure those details every single time I make the call. It also gives me the means by which I control and save sound volume data as the user would see it, whereas Master Audio is more for the audio technicians themselves to work with. I still end up coding a huge amount of stuff for my game from scratch — but realistically these tools are all getting better quality control than I could give them if I had to program them myself. Even the expensive ones, the ones costing $90-ish USD, ultimately end up saving me money — the effort it’d take for me to build Master Audio myself could amount to over $12,000 of payroll time as a programmer. That adds up to a savings even if you had to buy a hundred licenses. So if you’re serious, definitely don’t hesitate to invest the money!  Try Reinventing the Wheel Anyway Just For Kicks However, something that I’ll freely admit is that I mainly have the judgment of when and how to employ these partly because I have programmed and maintained some equivalent tool or another to a lot of these systems by myself, including the visual scripter. That experience helps you connect with the intended use, the problems that these solutions were all seeking, in a way that just unboxing and using them doesn’t. People often take for granted that tools like NodeCanvas or PlayMaker, for example, are replacements for code — they aren’t. They are more accurately supplements that help you organize functionality, and do their best work when you program custom Actions and Conditions that are specific to your game. But you won’t fully understand that unless you try to program a state machine for yourself. Similarly, before I fully understood the intended workflow of Master Audio, I needed to program a custom sound system myself and recognize that what I was building, eventually, would turn into Master Audio if I brought it to a full and reasonable conclusion. I had to solve the problem of how to deal with an object pool of sound sources, then realize that was what Master Audio was doing with its Voice management system. I had to realize that different “classes” of sounds, like environment-based sounds, ambient sounds, and battle sounds, needed to have sound settings that were specific to those at a high-level — which led me to realize that was what the Audio Bus system was for. Don’t get me started on the finer points of gapless music loops. So — don’t take the above to mean that you shouldn’t try to figure out how to build systems that someone else has already built. By all means, do it… for the benefit of yourself as a learning experience. On a live project, definitely think more about saving the time and money. Just be ready to get your fingers dirty. You’ll use any system better when you know what it’s doing under the hood.  Just Do It If I had to come up with one, last, final tip… just build the damn thing. Don’t get scared by what you don’t know, don’t think you need permission to start building a certain kind of system, and don’t hesitate thinking you’ve got the wrong idea about how to build something. Go ahead and build it the wrong way! The worst that can happen is that you’ll get a clearer idea about why it’s wrong, which’ll let you do better the next time. If you do very very VERY very very well you’ll create a functioning RPG. Food for thought, players don’t see the awkward or flawed implementation all that often — many of those details are your eyes only. Games absolutely get shipped with band-aids and jury rigs. In any case, though, you will never begin to learn to make the type of game you want to make, whether it’s an RPG or a fighting game or anything else, until you start doing this. No two games have so much overlap between them that they’ll all have the same requirements in technical skills. No two games share any of the same details regarding the ways in which they present information and provide satisfying feedback, which we haven’t begun to discuss. To be an engineer is to look at those unknowable things that need to be given function, and decipher a way to make it all happen. For as many answers as I can give you, keep that in mind — your goal is not in having me answer questions for you, but in finding the way to answer questions for yourself!",2021-03-05T14:34:47.290Z,"What do I really need to learn to make an RPG in Unity 3D?

The military itself was organized like a Greek style phalanx with spear-men fighting in tight formations. At this time Rome was engage in combat against ethnically Greek city states, Etruscan peoples in the north, and invading Gallic forces and this phalanx style army was effective against these enemies.  ==============The first big change============================ As Rome spread over the Italian countryside their enemies changed. They found themselves fighting on rough terrain and against tribal armies more and more. Their phalanx system was not longer so effective and they needed to transition the army to something more malleable. They came up with the manipal system to replace their phalanx and it was inventive to say the least. The basic makeup of the army was fundamentally altered. The main infantry were called the Hastati. A Hastati was armored with a chest piece, shin guards, a helmet, and a large shield. They would wield a spear or a sword and fight as a lose unit. Every Roman citizen was expected to do their duty and protect the state. Young men would pay for their own equipment and volunteer in the army. This core of citizen soldiers was the backbone of the Roman state and allowed them to field massive armies. When fighting they would form a lose square formation and move quickly. These soldiers were really flexible and could fight on any terrain. The next type of solider were the Triarii. The Triarii fought like the Phalanx of old and served as the reserve forces in battle. The Triarii were the most experienced warriors in the army. Only veterans were permitted to join the Triarii and their discipline was legendary. If reinforcements were needed on the battle line or a flanking attack needed to be halted the Triarii would be called on to engage the enemy force. Rome had this funny saying “It’s come to the Triarii” which sorta means “all is nearly lost so the real adults are stepping in” or “time for the experts to take over”. The last type of infantry were the Principes- basically they were vetern Hastati with better armor and weapons. They served the same function and would usually relieve tired Hastati units on the front lines. Then there were equite. Equite were rich Romans that could afford horses and spears and served as the cavalry. Modern depictions of ancient battles tend to feature massive cavalry charges and while this looks cool it is inaccurate. Without stirrups or anything keeping them on the horse a strong wind could be enough to blow a man off a horse. These cavalry units were used to attack exposed positions, skirmish with enemy forces, chase down routing armies, or scout enemy positions. =============The Marian Reforms============================= In 107 BC Gaius Marian once again reformed the army. Rome had expanded to encompass far off lands in Spain, Greece, Africa, France, and the Middle East. Rome needed a large army to protect their territories and they needed an army that could remain in the field for years at a time. With the current army being made up of volunteering citizens they would be unwilling to remain away from their farms and families for two long and Rome would often have to disband their armies to avoid revolt. Giaus Marius would change this by implementing the Cohort system in 107. The most drastic change was now allowing everyone in the army. Where previously troops had to meet wealth and class requirements to join now any person could join. In addition the state would provide weapons and armor for the army as well as a pay for their services. This was exactly what Rome needed at the time as it allowed them greatly expand the army in a short time and field these armies for however long was needed. While it saved a battered Roman Republic it would later be the downfall of the Roman Empire. This transition made the army a serious expense and later emperors would get in the bad habit of raising the armies pay to gain their favor. Eventually the pay expected by the legionnaires was far more than the state could afford and instability would abound as a result. Besides changing the requirements to join it also changed the overall structure. There were no more Hastati, Triarii, or Principes- there were just legionaries. Everyone had the same armor and weapons. This standardization meant that supple became far easier. Everyone legionnaire had a short sword, throwing spears, a large shield, and chain-mail/leather armor. These guys were heavy infantry being better armed than their numerous foes. This equipment advantage combined with training, years on the job, and strict discipline lead to an army that was near unbeatable. ===============The Imperial armies=========================== Not much changed in the empire believe it or not. The armor would become better overtime and the overall trend of standardization continued but besides that everything remained the same. If Rome needed a strong cavalry corp or some well trained archers they would look to conquered peoples to provide them. Rome would make use of auxiliary units that fought differently than the average legionnaire to make up for any shortcomings in the army. This ability to incorporate a number of different types of soldiers allowed the army to remain the most feared fighting force of the time. While the overalls structure and tactics remained the same the make up changes quite a bit. During the late Republic and Early Empire the army was staffed by Italians. Eventually Italians stopped joining the legions and the make up of the army was nearly 100% provincial poor people. The officer corp was still made up of Italians and Romans but the average grunt was not. This created a disconnect between the officers and their men and frequently lead to armies killing their commanders and revolting. ===============The Later Empire============================= Rome eventually would nose dive and nearly collapse during the 3rd century. In this time the Empire devolved in chaos and 2/3s of the empire revolted and declared independence. Rome would survive this thanks to some savvy emperors. The most important of these was Diocletian who totally reformed the army into something new. He made the legions smaller and then added more legions- enabling Rome to logistically deploy forces better. At this time the imperial army was still largely the same as the early Empire though. The armor was better but overall the basic structure was the same. Rome’s army featured mostly heavy infantry with auxiliary cavalry and archers. Although the average solider and armies make up was the same there were some key differences. A key difference is that the overall quality of th legions began to decline. The years of warfare in the 4rd century robbed Rome of their experienced legions. Where once the legions were made up of disciplined well trained soldiers now most of the men were poorly trained raw recruits. Previously the make up of the army had changed when the Italians stopped joining and the ranks began to swell with poor provincial peasants- but the officer corp were still true Roman Italians. Now though the Romans wouldn’t even join as officers and before too long the entire make up of the legions were provincials who had little loyalty to Rome. This decline continued and pretty soon not even the poor provincials would join the army. This came right around the time when the Germans started to invade again. The Goths, and Vandals began to migrate in mass into Roman territory and the weakened Roman legions lacked the ability to push them back as they had in the past. The Romans decided to accept this migrating Germans and granted them land in exchange for military service. Before too long the entire Roman military was made up of Germanic mercenaries who had literally no love for Rome. There were still some harden legionaries around but overall the military was now 90% Germanic warriors under the command of Germanic generals. In the face of further invasions the military would be unable to defend Rome and soon this would be one of the many reason the Roman Empire collapsed in the West. ===============The Early Byzantines=========================== Where the Western Roman Empire fell the Eastern Roman Empire stuck around. Unlike the West they were able to maintain a powerful standing army and resist the encroachment of hostile tribes. The Byzantine military would evolve to be far different than the Roman army of old. The primary cause of this change was the enemies of the Byzantines. Heavy infantry was great and all but against the Persian and Bulgarian armies heavy cavalry was better. This new Roman army was centered around heavy cavalry. These men were highly trained riders with tough armor, strong spears, and long swords. They would crash into the enemy formations and route them with ease or engage with hostile cavalry and wipe them out. Often these men were recruited from among the citizens of the Byzantine Empire but the ranks would often be filled from elsewhere as well. The Romans were fond of recruiting Hun horse archers into their ranks and the Romans utilized them to great effect. They would recruit Persian cavalry, Bulgarian cavalry, and Numidian cavalry. You may wonder why Rome was recruiting foreign soldiers to join their army. Well the reason they did this was that they had no other choice. After years of warfare and a diminished population (no more Rome after all) the ranks began to thin quite a bit. To augment their armies the Byzantines would hire foreign soldiers or even prisoners to join their ranks. Often an enemy army bested on the field would be sparred if the men agreed to join the Byzantine military. These prisoners would then be shipped back to Constantinople, trained, and then sent out to fight. Rome had a very hard time affording a large army early on. When Justinian invaded Italy in the hopes to retaking Rome he was only able to muster 10,000 men. Where once the Roman army could field a force some 75,000 strong now a mere 20,000 man army was rare. This above described process is where much of the Byzantine heavy infantry came from. There were native born recruits to be sure but often each company of men would have a number of ethnically different men. You could find Bulgarians, Greeks, Anatolian, Persians, Syrians, Egyptians, Italians, Vandals, Africans, and more serving in a single unit. In addition to the overall cultural make up of the army the basic structure wildly changed. Gone were the standard legions of old and they were replaced by large standing armies. There would be 1 army of the East and another Army of the West for instance. Each of these would be massive 20,000 man armies with about 25% cavalry and 75% infantry. These men would be spread out into small groups to defend the entire boarder and then could be called together when a large army was needed. ================Later Byzantine Empire======================== As the Byzantine Empire went along they would continue to slowly die. Every decade more territory was lost and the recruitment base declined. The Byzantines now struggled to fill their ranks at all and could not raise the armies of the past. When Egypt and Syria was lost a huge chunk of population was gone forever- not to mention the wealthiest portions of the empire. After the loss of their Eastern provinces the Empire relied heavily on the highly populated Anatolian region for recruitment. Eventually Anatolia would also fall to Islamic invaders and the Empire would never recover from this. Lacking the wealth and manpower to staff large armies the Byzantine military became a city guard and little more. The infantry was similar to the infantry of France and England at the time although the Byzantine infantry was more standardized and professional that their Western counterparts. Men would have chain mail or leather armor and would wield a shield and spear or sword. Heavy cavalry was still a crucial aspect of the military but again- this was a small military. If an army needed to be deployed they would raise an army of 6–10k, not nearly enough to hold back the hordes of Islam. Fortunately for the Byzantines the first 3 crusades and the Augean sea would serve to protect their Greek provinces for centuries longer. However once Anatolia was lost the Byzantine Empire and the Byzantine military would never again be a power to contend with.

Becoming a film editor involves a long path of study, hours of internship, apprenticeship, and volunteer work. Working for free early on is typically necessary in order to secure the right connections and to develop a keen eye for style, pace, and timing. Most film editors spend years in different jobs until they finally get a break. In addition to talent, skill, and hard work, you'll need perseverance in order to find a position as a film editor. Gaining the Necessary Skills :-Study how movies are edited. Watch produced movies and analyze the timing and pacing of scenes. Pay attention to how long each scene lasts, how much action or tension there is during a scene, and how each scene fades seamlessly into the next. Look for visual or sound cues that enhance dramatic rhythm. Go to your local or school library and check their database for books on film history and film analysis.Familiarize yourself with the nature of film, primarily by watching everything you can get your hands on. Get a feel for specific directors or editors and what makes their work distinct.For each television or film production you watch, look online for major newspaper reviews, such as the New York or Los Angeles Times. Reading professional critiques will help you develop your own critical eye.Choose the best program:-  Apply to and enroll in a college film editing program. Your choices include a specialized film school, a four year college or university, or a local community college. Decide what's best for you in terms of affordability and location, and research options that match your needs.A four year program offers the best preparation for a career in film editing. Check out the list of available majors at your state university system's colleges.[1]If you want to get away from your hometown, look for out-of-state programs. A film school or four year degree from a California- or New York-based school could help you secure better internships and apprenticeships.Schools near these industry centers can help you develop a stronger network and allow you to be closer to more work opportunities.A university program will also help you access professional development resources, like publications and calls for entry.A key perk to film school is access to equipment. Renting equipment can be expensive, but it can be cheaper if you’re a student, especially if you rent through your university program. When you're researching programs, ask about their available equipment and rental procedures.Choose the best courses:- Your coursework will include basic editing and commercial editing, film history, storytelling, and screenwriting. In addition, you will learn how to use photo and film editing software programs like Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro (FCP). FCP is the Hollywood standard for film editing, and you'll need to take software-heavy courses that'll allow you to master it.[2] Go for a course load heavy in technology and software training. Film editors don't manually cut film anymore, so it's important to have a strong foundation in both established and emerging tech and programs.[3]Even after you've graduated, it's common for editors to continue their education by occasionally taking formal courses. This helps to stay up to date with the industry's technological changes.[4]Make productive relationships at school:-Hone your skills when you’re just starting out or in school by editing smaller projects. Work with your friends or with peers at university. Start out with independent editing projects to put your education into practice, and edit as many short films as possible.[5] Use your university years as an opportunity to start growing your network by working with your peers and seeking out mentors among your professors.Collaborative amateur projects are important when you're starting out, especially in today's industry environment. Working with others is a highly prized skill, so collaborating early on will help you further down the road.[6]Even making silly videos, putting projects on Youtube, and other small spare-time endeavors will help you exercise your editing muscles and put theoretical knowledge into practice.Building Experience :- Volunteer your services on student productions or local productions. While a film school education can give you a knowledge base and technical foundation, it’s essential to build concrete experience. The more tangible experience you have, the better your chances of getting your foot in the door in the world of film editing. Start out small by looking for smaller, local productions or by continuing to collaborate with peers you’ve met along the way.You can look online for local production job and gig listings[7]Word of mouth is key for getting gigs, whether paid or unpaid, and at both amateur and professional levels.Get an apprenticeship or internship. In addition to volunteering your time on local productions, you’ll likely have to continue paying your dues and working for free for a considerable portion of your early career. Networking is key throughout the process, and you’ll have to rely on your growing network to land an apprenticeship with a major production company. Even though it’s free labor, apprenticing or interning will help you demonstrate that you possess actual skills and a solid work ethic.[8] Consult your professors and try to access their networks while you’re in school. This will help you to land good internships or apprenticeships, both while you’re in college and when you’re breaking into the field after graduating.You might have to take several apprentice jobs before you actually start to make a modest income.Treat every job as if you’re getting a million-dollar income. Prove that you have a great work ethic and are a pleasure to work with.Land an entry level job in a film studio. Those with whom you’ve apprenticed or interned will be essential for getting a paying job, whether they connect you with one or offer you a strong recommendation. You're unlikely to land a job in editing right away, even if you have strong apprentice gigs under your belt.[9] Take any job that comes along, whether it's as a tour guide on a studio lot, a personal assistant to somebody on a film crew, a secretary at the office, or a runner for a production.Build a strong network. Be polite to everybody you meet and promote yourself. Hand out business cards with links to your website and reel. Make it known that you're looking as a job as a film editor. Building your network of connections this way can lead to unexpected chances, like becoming a film editor on a short that later wins an award at a festival.[10] If you meet people who work in the editing room, ask if you may occasionally join them to observe and learn.It might take up to ten years before you’ve built a robust enough network and record of on the job training to land a job with a reasonable income, so be persistent.[11]Breaking into the Field:-Start your own editing business or service. One of the easiest and most effective ways to build your body of work is to create your own business. Invest in cards and other marketing materials to make yourself professional and competitive. Starting an editing service with a skilled peer is also wise in the current market, as collaborative skills are desirable in the industry nowadays.[12] When you're starting out, you find it necessary to branch out beyond your specialized field in order to build clientele.Consider getting in touch with local or emerging musicians about producing music videos for them. Be open to trade and bartering for compensation.[13]Wedding or graduation videos, commercial marketing for restaurants and other local businesses, and producing corporate training videos are other examples of some avenues to take when you're starting your own business.[14]Get a listing on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). Be strategic about how you build your body of work. Put your best effort into making each production you work on more legitimate than the last, and be sure to make long-lasting contacts with every job. Even shorts and low budget movies can get a listing on the IMDB, as long as the productions were released. Potential employers will refer to it before hiring you.[15]The IMBD staff updates its listing regularly and selects films, television series and specials, commercials, music videos, and local or public access television shows for inclusion in its database.Register on the IMBD website and submit your individual credit or project's title to verify or correct its listing.[16]3Craft a competitive portfolio. Once you’ve built up your body of work, design a winning portfolio to market yourself successfully. You’ll find that the applicant pool for editing jobs is intensely competitive, so you have to make yourself stand out. Send out your resume, along with a reel of your best work, to studio executives, directors, and other film editors. [17]Make sure the materials you submit in applications are concise and show off only your best work.Submit design reels that are relevant for specific projects. You don't have to include everything you've ever done with every job application.If you're going for a gig as an assistant editor on a television program, don't submit graduation or wedding videos you've cut. If you don't have any relevant materials, television cuts in this case, music video or short film scenes would do.Ask people with whom you’ve worked in the past to look over your materials and offer feedback.Create a website that offers a more substantial selection of your work.4Advance your career. Once you’ve demonstrated the quality of your work in independent productions and as an assistant editor, look for opportunities to take the helm. You must constantly build new connections in order to advance to the position of full editor. Make people want to work with you by always demonstrating a strong work ethic and likeable attitude.[18]Start out by applying to be an assistant editor on a production.Consider joining a union for faster career advancement.Keep yourself informed about new technologies and software, taking courses in or teaching yourself new programs or devices.(source by wiki) Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:38:55.183Z,"How do you become a film editor in Bolllywood?

If you would like to do radio and tv commercials, look for agencies and studios who advertise themselves as professional commercial studios. Ask if they are looking for new talents and ask if you can come to do an audition or send your demo. Probably, you can at least send your demo. Do not leave it there. Remember to contact them again after a week or so. Ask for feedback! Even if your demo will not lead to a gig, you can get valuable feedback from the professionals and hone your skills.

This is a method of John Williams, who always wants to base his ideas on visual material rather than written text. Also, since it very much depends on the composer-director relationship, I suppose Zimmer has also worked this way at least a few times throughout his career, since it is considered the ""default"" scoring approach in Hollywood.After the composition there is a recording session, which can either be a swift and smooth process, with minor adjustments in the score to accomodate the director's wishes, or a back-and-forth nightmare of rewrites and additional sessions. Zimmer seems to work a bit differently, because he is not a classicaly trained musician and his process is much more fluid and intuitive, than that of Williams for example. He often simultaneously composes and records solo parts, mocking up the orchestra with computer samples. The difference is that while Zimmer can experiment and try a lot of different things in his studio, Williams usually knows exactly what he wants, writes it all out on paper by the piano and then goes on to record it as it is. After this the method of integrating the music with the picture largly depends on the method used at the beginning: If the music was composed, or sketched before the finished filming/editing of the film, they can:edit the scenes to fit the recorded music (the rarest approach, due to the technical difficulties it poses)compose the music to the actual scenes (much like in method #2) based on a pre-composed musical material - which makes the process fasterIf the music was ""fitted"" to already finished scenes, it simply has to be edited into the audio track. If there were some changes in the video edit (and there usually are), they may alter the recorded score in editing to fit the changed scene. In case of extreme changes they may need to call in an extra recording session and re-record some stuff.",2021-03-05T14:40:27.818Z,"How does Hans Zimmer compose a soundtrack? ",Quora

During this time you can't maintain a relationship (no time) and you have no money at all for nice things, or holidays. And you live in a rented shared house. Not that that matters, you'll never be there anyway. It's just a bed really to you.  And you have to deal with musicians. You can say ""we start at 10am, and I like to be done by 8pm"" as much as you like, but they won't start until mid day, even though you have to be there by 9am to do the editing, and just in case they do turn up on time for once. And you'll no doubt be there until 10pm or even later most of the time. Assume 12 hours works a day at least, 15 hours is pretty normal as well. Probably 7 days a week. Certainly 6.  Let's say all this actually sounds pretty sweet to you so you do it anyway. You manage to do it for 10 years with a moderate level of success, but you never get that breakthrough album that propels you into the big time. You'd really like to have a bit of money to buy your own house and go on holiday occasionally so you have a career change.  You decide to sell everything in the studio. The second hand value of audio gear is awful these days. All that money you invested in the studio is now worth enough to maybe buy a 5 year old second hand car.  So you quietly slip away into obscurity and some dull office job, just like everyone else who spent a decade trying to get a studio career going.  If you REALLY have the drive and passion for it, none of this will put you off. If you question whether you are willing to sacrifice so much for what is at the end of the day just a job, then good luck. You're going to need it. Absolutely don't do it unless you are willing to risk everything for the sake of this dream.  To get there it means working hours so long you will have no life at all outside your job, and having no money at all.   Let's assume that first of all you know what you are doing and have the skills (this alone takes years by the way).  You upen a small studio. (You need a LOT of money to make something better than musicians have themselves at home, so are willing to pay to come in) You get a few bands come to record.

I was a college intern at NPR the summer of 2006, then spent about a year working there (2007-2008) after I graduated.  I worked in the old 635 Massachusetts Ave HQ  before they moved to the new building. NPR was a great place to work.  Being heavily focused on news, it was an exciting place to work and you always felt like you are among the first to know something, even if you didn’t work directly on a news program.  It was very common to see newsmakers in the building and VIPs getting tours of the facilities.   One of my favorite “perks” was the employee invitations to provide an audience for certain interviews/shows. This was especially common for musicians. If a band was coming to do a piece talking about their new album, for example, they’d often allow employees to sit and watch as they performed one or two tracks.  In the old HQ this was easy because Studio 4A was a magnificent space, large enough for an orchestra, or a band and probably 100 chairs for an audience.  It was one of the nicest studios I’ve ever been in, with attention paid to even the smallest detail to get the perfect sound.  I haven’t been to the new HQ, but I suspect this is one space most NPR old-timers miss most. This space was representative of another great aspect of NPR – an amazing dedication to producing the best possible audio. I’m not referring to the content of the broadcast, though they certainly work very hard on that as well. I mean maintaining the “NPR Sound.” For someone like me who built his own recording studio, who worked at a college radio station, and who is a bit of an audiophile, it was like being a car enthusiast who was given access to a private track and a parking garage filled with classic and Formula 1 cars. Not only did I have access to the best equipment, but I was surrounded by people who appreciated it as much as I did. Finally, there is a strong sense of mission and urgency to much of the work there. Knowing that your work is helping to bring news from around the world to millions of people 24/7/365 gives you a sense of purpose that you don’t get in many office jobs. It made for far less office politics than other organizations, more team work, and creative solutions to difficult problems.  Ultimately I left because Microsoft made me a more lucrative offer, and it seemed Microsoft would have more career options for me given my college degree. It had nothing to do with the work, my team, or the culture at NPR (in fact, they made the decision to leave very hard.)

Like electromechanical work which is closely tied to power electronics and electromagnetism. Instrumentation is a very generic term which could be things like oscilloscopes or precision analog circuits for measuring plasma properties. Optical stuff could fit in analog, communications, or instrumentation, but it deserves its own division. Communications could definitely fit with digital design or analog/RF but with all the specialty knowledge of physical layer protocol design I put it on its own. Power distribution gets its own as well, for being so different from power and controls circuitry. Edit: In which field should one major? Great question. They will all make you lay your head on your desk in confusion and frustration. But as well, the problems in each will definitely provide a really great problem-solving job environment. They all have their unique topics and unsolved problems, and are a lot of fun to work with. Every electrical engineer will dabble in all of them throughout his career, in all likelihood, so pick the one you see as most interesting right now, or most profitable, or wherever your priorities are. The choice is simple: you won’t regret any of them, so there is no wrong answer. Me, personally? I love analog design for its precision applications. Both RF and instrumentation, as audio isn’t quite as interesting. It’s really fun working with high-voltage, but it can be stressful seeing as your working with high-voltage! Embedded design is very practical and microcontrollers can be used for so many things that it is a very good thing to work with. Electromechanics requires both electrical, power, magnetic and electromagnetic, and mechanical design knowledge, which makes it particularly interesting. Mixed-signal design is amazing with its high precision and speed, and mix of analog and digital work (hence “mixed”). Developing communications protocols which power the modern world is also fascinating. I find optics to be as interesting as anything else, with the use of radiation and physics in electronics. Making integrated circuits, which are incredibly complex, is very rewarding in VLSI and ASIC design. Designing computers (which are like a combination of microprocessors and their associated components like memory and peripherals etc) yields awesome results, full of computing power. Needless to say, all topics are awesome.",2021-03-05T14:44:43.198Z,"What are the sub divisions of electrical electronics engineering? ",Quora

Earlier there were only gramophones that could play the music but now we have stereophonic sound effects, Dolby digital and surround sound effects etc which were not possible earlier and all this is possible because of Audio Engineering. Audio Engineering is a very good career option for all the music lover and for those who wish to pursue in the field of music. Audio Engineering deals with capturing sound, recording, copying, editing, mixing and reproducing sound. The field is called Audio Engineering and the person who is disciple of this field is called an Audio Engineer who primarily should be equipped with the knowledge of production and manipulation of sound. Sometimes the terms recording engineers, sound engineers and audio engineers are used interchangeable but there is a difference between all of them. Recording and sound engineers are basically those people who are responsible for designing and developing new equipments for the audio engineers. Eligibility: There is no defined educational qualification for becoming and audio engineer but to be successful in this field one should have a degree or diploma in audiography, sound recording, sound engineering and audio engineering. However to pursue post graduate courses, an under graduate degree or diploma is must. Since sound is basically physics so a basic knowledge of physics along with mathematics and electronics are much appreciated. To become a successful audio engineer one should have analytical bent of mind who can interpret audio and digital wave pattern along with the ability to work continuously for long hours. Job Prospects There is a huge probability of getting job in this field because the scope is very wide and one can be employed with movies, television, advertising and broad casting, live concerts, multimedia organizations, CD production and many other fields. However any audio engineer wishes to go in the field of music industry. To begin with one can work as an assistant and then later on with experience and personal skills one can broaden the horizons. Career Options Audio engineering is a huge domain which can be further classified into the following career options.• Studio Engineer• Sound Recordist• Broadcast Engineer• Sound Editor• Re- recording mixer• Dialogue editor• Music editor• Sound effects editor• Mastering Engineer• Location sound Engineer• Mix Engineer• Foley Recordist• Recording Engineer• Sound Designer• Pro tools operator• Studio manager• Programmer Salary The fresher’s package is very much same in every industry and that ranges between Rs. 10,000 to 15,000 but later on as you progress, one can easily make around 50,000 or even more as you gain more recognition. If you are thinking of this career abroad, then money will never be a constraint, there are some handsome packages waiting for you.

A successful podcast will not only hold the attention of the listeners, but also compel them to listen through until the very end and understand the crux of it. Some basic tips to record a clear, well-done podcast, especially for individual productions: Ensure that your content is not too bulky. Break it down into smaller chunks and keep it natural-sounding. Complexities are difficult to catch for the ear.When recording, make sure that your microphone is not directly in front of your mouth. This can cause breath on the mic. Keep it off to the side.Always test your microphone before recording the story/lines. Make sure that the mic levels are loud enough but not so loud that the sound distorts (you might have to turn your boost up too).Practice reading the content before you record so that you are comfortable with it. This will make your voice sound more at ease and it will sound natural.Read at a steady and consistent pace. Only speed up or slow down if it enhances the piece.Speak clearly, enunciate well and keep your speech volume level throughout. Imagine that you are reading aloud to someone else in the room so that you don’t whisper or shout. Some people find that they speak more slowly at the beginning and pick up the pace as they get further into the story. A way to make sure your pace is consistent is to immediately begin the story again when you reach the end and record the whole thing again.Try and bring your content to life. For instance, if it’s a story, make the listener see the story through your words. Put emotion into your voice and make it flow with the story. This will come easier if you have practiced a few times beforehand.If you make a mistake, start the sentence or paragraph again rather than continuing from the word you went wrong on. This makes it easier to edit out at the end.Turn off anything that is/could make a noise in the background. This could be anything from your phone to kitchen appliances. It is best to record in a silent room with the windows shut to block outside noise from being in the recording, if you don’t have a proper audio-recording studio.If you do hear something in the background, even if you are not sure if the microphone picked it up, start the section again just in case. Going back and re-recording one small section afterwards can sometimes make the story not sound as fluid.Keep a glass of water next to you when recording.Hope that helps!

I’m sure that seems like an odd thing to say: Shouldn’t money and time help a film become better? In a perfect world, sure. But we don’t live in a perfect world. Additionally, every individual involved in the film has an opinion. No one can say whose opinion is right or wrong, but if they all get weighed and added to the film, that can produce problems. Let me elaborate. First, on the money side. “Well-funded” films need to earn a buttload of money to be profitable, because the studio doesn’t keep all of the gross receipts — movie theaters, producers, actors, and other people keep part of the money. Studios also spend a lot of money on prints and advertising. In order to maximize advertising, the studio likes to have a lot of visual eye candy they can use for the ads. If the script doesn’t already have those things, sometimes they are added. “If we’re spending $100 million, we need some pretty pictures and visual effects we can use to sell ads.” The rising budgets in Hollywood tend to sap the creativity of the story. Studios opt for simple, straight forward, cookie-cutter storylines that they believe will maximize profits. They instead pour all the creativity into the visual effects and other visuals. Focus on eye candy! Sometimes that’s the only way to recoup the massive budget and prints-and-ad fees. So that’s one way that “well-funded” can be a bad thing. Now, on to the time element. There are two ways this can bite you in the butt: Rushing the film into production. Nowadays a lot of “well-funded” films have release dates scheduled before the script is written. This means that the script is rushed and not given the proper development time. Once again, this means that the writers will often opt for cookie-cutter storylines, because they simply don’t have time to develop a better storyline. The budget is part of the problem here, too, because it’s usually only those big-budget “well-funded” films which set concrete release dates before scripts are written. And the studio wants to recoup those costs often at the expense of the story.Going through development hell for years and years before releasing your film. Sometimes, some expensive movies (Superman Returns for instance) have been in development for years and years. This means that the budget is inflated because of the many stops and starts over the years (e.g., Tim Burton was going to make a Superman film, and the money he spent went onto the balance sheet of Superman Returns). Once again, with that much money on the line, studios opt for a simpler story rather than something challenging, because they need to recoup their costs. But additionally, when a story has been in development for years and years, there are dozens of people’s fingerprints on it. Each person has a few things that they demand must be part of the film. With all those competing demands, the writers end up writing around those people’s demands, rather than writing around the story and characters. Imagine if one guy insists you have a bicycle scene, and another guys insists you have a spaceship scene, and another guy insists you have a love triangle — and then the writers have to somehow throw all of that into their Superman movie. The eventual outcome is usually not a very pretty picture.",2021-03-05T14:48:19.096Z,"What prevents well-funded films from having better scripts? ",Quora

Other posters stated all the obvious items like checking all the fluid conditions, so I will not touch on those. Some cars will be easy, some very hard, if not impossible to tell if someone drove it hard. The first place I look is the owner. I fully interview the seller of a car while I am checking out the car. Most of the time they do not even know I am interrogating them. I am looking for clues he/she abused or neglected the car. Any owner who properly cares for their car will keep some receipts, either for the parts if he is a DIY guy or the repairs. No receipts, red flag. (Neglect is as hard on a car as hard driving, if not worse). Next I look at the entire car. I am looking for clues. Non factory OEM parts: If I see any ebay add on crap, I walk. Cold air intakes, exhaust, lights, cheap carbon fiber, fake carbon, off brand suspension components, strut bars, etc., (Cheap mufflers to make them loud is a BIG red flag)Is the wear and tear on suspension components on par for the miles on the car? Sorry, but unless you are familiar with the car brand and have many years experience working on them, this one will be hard for you to just see.Look for wear on the pedals, shift knob (if a manual), shifter linkage, etc., in comparison to it’s age/miles.“race” stickersPerformance oriented tires on a non performance car.Higher end components placed on car that has no reason to have them, like coil over shocks on a Honda Civic.Finally, you should always get a pre-purchase inspection on ANY car you buy from a reputable, qualified mechanic and you should be willing to pay $100–200 for that inspection. Higher end cars like Porsche and BMW can be hooked to factory dealer level computers and give you a read out of how many times it has been driven hard while still cold, over rev counts, etc.You are a detective and looking for clues. Do not let the emotions of wanting the car cloud your vision in seeing red flags. There are many honest people out there selling their cars and will tell you what you want to know without digging. When I sold my last Porsche I was honest with the person who bought it. Yes, it had a lot of miles on it, but I took anal care of it. I had receipts, I showed her the services done. I told her how I did auto-x it a handful of times as well as ran a few hill climbs in it (Even showed her photos and the trophies). She was an educated buyer and understood a Porsche was designed to be driven. Sure, I raced it a couple dozen times, but the service records showed I was not only diligent, but proactive on replacing parts before they failed with OEM parts. She willingly paid my price. 10 years later she still sends me photos occasionally of her enjoying the car on road trips.

For example, I love learning languages--but I hate practicing pronunciation. I love my side-endeavor of creating Chinese courses--but I hate editing audio files for them. My sister is passionate about violin--but she encounters plenty of frustrations when practicing and teaching it. You don't have to love everything about a career in order for it to be a true interest or passion. The question is only to the degree to which you dislike the things you don't like--if they are intolerable, then obviously you need another career--if they are irritations, but worth the sacrifice for the benefit of working with logic, algorithms, and code--then you're in a good place.

We were married for three years before my then-wife-now-ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce. I remember, very vividly, her reasons for wanting a divorce. She said she wanted someone who was more “fire”, a man who was more rough around the edges, who would make grand romantic gestures, who could utter romantic lines at the drop of a hat, who would buy her gifts, who was more “dangerous” and tough and rough, someone who strove for power and social influence, someone who made things happen. In contrast, she said I was like “water”, too placid and calm, too moral and upright, too gentle and polite. She thought I was wasting too much of my time chatting with cashiers, the cleaners, waiters and waitresses, cab drivers, etc. when I should be using that time to focus on other more important things instead, like earning more money and being “somebody”. According to her, I was not a go-getter, I was too boring. I’m the first to admit that I have many flaws. But listening to your partner spew out a long list of every area you fall short in… well, I’ve never had someone stab me in the guts with a knife and then proceed to twist and turn, but I think that must be what it feels like. She suggested going for marriage counselling and I was only too happy to do so, as I genuinely believed we could work it out. But after the third session, she decided that she didn’t want to do it anymore, so we stopped and never went down that route again. Instead, she told me we would be having an open marriage from that point on. She wanted adventure, she wanted mystery, she wanted fiery excitement. Things she said I couldn’t provide. Now, I’m quite open-minded about a lot of things, but I already knew an open marriage wasn’t for me. For me, marriage is about two people, and two people only. But when I told her my thoughts about an open marriage, she said I was trying to control her life, that I was too old-fashioned and that I should adapt to the times. I seriously don’t know what possessed me, but at that point in time, I was very desperate to try and repair our marriage, so I very reluctantly acquiesced to her, well, not request, really, as she was going to do it anyway, even without my permission. More like went along with her demands, hoping that what she was proposing would help mend our marriage. She started going on Tinder and accepting dates with a lot of men. I remember the first time this happened. I was preparing dinner for the two of us at home, when she sent me a text message telling me that she wasn’t coming home for dinner and that she won’t be back for the night as she was out on a date with a man and would be staying at his place. I texted her back, to tell me where she was, but she never replied. How do you sleep when the woman you love is out with another man and is staying over at his place? And probably sleeping with him. How do you get rid of that image that pops up in your mind every few seconds? I know I didn’t get any sleep that night. Or for many nights after that. She didn’t even try to hide it. The flowers from the men she was going out with. The gifts. The soft toys. In fact, I was the one who had to get rid of those flowers when they were starting to wilt. I still did all that I could to try and be a good husband. I cooked for her, all her favorite dishes, did her laundry, and anytime she felt sick or had cramps, I went to the store to get medicine and made soup and congee for her, did both the cooking and cleaning up after dinner so that she didn’t need to do housework, tucked her in so she could sleep early and so that she could recover more quickly. Actually, I had already been doing all of that since our marriage. She had wanted to do her MBA, and I too had wanted to do a Masters in Tech. But I put my plans on the back-burner so she could do her MBA first, and so I could pick up the slack around the home. My reasoning was that she could do her MBA first, and then I’ll do my Masters later. So I became very good at cooking for her, packing her lunch so that she had home-cooked meals during her lunch in school, made sure to keep the house neat and tidy so she could study in a clean environment. That was fine until she graduated and got a job at a big, well-known company.It was a couple of months after she started working that she told me she wanted the divorce. So after several months of the open-marriage thing, with her going on dates with other men and staying over at their places, we went on a trip to LA. She had already booked a trip for the both of us before she had mentioned wanting a divorce, but we both flew to LA anyway. In my heart, I hoped that the trip would help us reconcile, if even a tiny step in that direction. No such luck. Once again, I was treated to a recitation of that long list of why I wasn’t good enough for her. Too much like “water”. Too gentle and too damn polite, too moral, too much time spent caring about people who don’t matter, too calm and placid, no fire in my belly, not a go-getter, etc etc etc. Throughout the trip, the expression that was constantly plastered on her face told me she would rather be with anyone else other than me. I’ll never forget the moment when we were at the Santa Monica Pier, the hustle and the bustle of the children enjoying the Ferris wheel and the various rides reduced to a low hum in the background, and she just gave out this long sigh, and her face slowly turned toward the overcast sky, the one shaft of sunlight that had somehow managed to pierce through the clouds falling onto the long-suffering look etched into her features. If there’s ever a look that says “I’d rather be with anyone else”… Several months down the line, and more of the same, she starts to talk about divorce again, and this time, I agreed. It was because a week or so ago, on those rare mornings when she was actually at home and not at some other man’s house, I told her I still loved her, and that I would take a bullet for her and sacrifice my life for hers should a situation ever arise where it was either her life or my own that would be sacrificed for the other. Yes, I know it might be overly dramatic.But that was the writer in me talking. I wasn’t expecting much, to be honest.Probably a cold nod of acknowledgement, a snort, a wry laugh, or something along those lines. But her reply was a thousand times icier than I expected. “That’s the right thing to do because my life is worth much more than yours.” I asked her why she thought that. She said it was because she was younger, she now had her MBA, and she was working at a big, well-known company and earning more than me. That’s when I decided that perhaps a divorce wouldn’t be such a bad thing after all.If the woman you’ve loved and cared for all this while says that to you, it’s probably a good sign that your relationship is over and that you should just move on. As I packed up my stuff - thankfully, I didn’t have much, most of the stuff in the house was hers, everything I owned I could fit into one suitcase and a backpack - a small part of me walked through that long list of hers that went into great detail on why I didn’t measure up. I had always thought that people got divorces because one of them was a bad person. A womanizer. An abuser. An addict. Dismissive of other people. Arrogant. Cruel. Unkind. A cheater. An adulterer. I had never expected that being like “water” and being too calm and gentle and placid and boring would lead to a divorce. At that point, I felt really bad about myself. In my mind I was thinking that I must be REALLY boring and the world’s “water”-est man if that’s the reason why she wanted me out of her life. I even thought I might feel better about the whole thing if she had wanted a divorce because I had done something wrong instead, like if I had cheated on her or something similar. But what felt even worse than that was the cold, hard realization that I had given up my own principles - about the sanctity of marriage and that marriage is only for two people - just because I had so desperately wanted to make our marriage work. The latter shook me to my core far more than the former. I finished packing up my one suitcase, strapped my backpack on, slipped into my shoes and quietly walked out of the house before the sun rose on that thundering grey morning. And that was that. When I heard her reply to my saying that I’d take a bullet for her and sacrifice my life for hers should a situation ever arise where it was either her life or my own that would be sacrificed for the other.  We were married for three years before my then-wife-now-ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce. I remember, very vividly, her reasons for wanting a divorce. She said she wanted someone who was more “fire”, a man who was more rough around the edges, who would make grand romantic gestures, who could utter romantic lines at the drop of a hat, who would buy her gifts, who was more “dangerous” and to Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:52:58.752Z,"What made you realize that it was finally time to get a divorce?

It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature.

Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Going over this book in an audiobook edition as an adult made me realize how truly beautiful and wonderful it is. It will forever be one of my favorites. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story is of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his new love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted ""gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,"" it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s. ""The Great Gatsby"" is often described as a paean to the Great American Dream. It contains a promise of upward social mobility, a reward that will be ours if we work hard enough, We all have an equal opportunity to transcend our current circumstances. Fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the American ideals and persona, and he did it in the guise of a love story. There is no better description of the indefatigable American spirit than the last page of this novel. It is literary perfection. Dracula by Bram Stoker The tale begins with Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified English solicitor, visiting Count Dracula in the Carpathian Mountains on the border of Transylvania, Bukovina, and Moldavia, to provide legal support for a real estate transaction overseen by Harker's employer. At first enticed by Dracula's gracious manners, Harker soon realizes that he is Dracula's prisoner. Wandering the Count's castle against Dracula's admonition, Harker encounters three female vampires, called 'the sisters,' from whom he is rescued by Dracula. After the preparations are made, Dracula leaves Transylvania and abandons Harker to the sisters. Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life. Heidi by Johanna Spyri Little orphan Heidi goes to live high in the Alps with her gruff grandfather and brings happiness to all who know her on the mountain. When Heidi goes to Frankfurt to work in a wealthy household, she dreams of returning to the mountains and meadows, her friend Peter, and her beloved grandfather. The most feel-good story of all time? Possibly. Heidi’s infectious pleasantness carries easily over the Swiss alps and into my life, nearly 140 years later. Despite a plot of idealized happiness, the cast of characters are not without flaw. The moments of conflict, though never described in severe terms, are the kind of dilemmas that transcend time and place. And the mountain, the healing mountain, is the perfect setting to mend.

Please handle with patience. So, like every established private engineering college in West Bengal, the messiah of placements viz, TCS came to our campus just a day before the Durga Puja and the entire process was a 2-day affair. Many of us dreamed of pandal hopping with our loved ones boasting about a job and earning some pride that was completely lost around 4 years back. The preparation was in full swing and then comes the D-day. The morning I reached our college auditorium and we were made to wait for the TCS people to come. Around 10 am, I saw almost a dozen of white XUVs to rush into our campus with 60–65 good looking pretty faced raiders bumping into the auditorium as armada of anti-hero in movies rush to capture the heroine(those who are fans of south Indian action movies can surely relate to the scenario, take me one for your team. They are damn entertaining!!!). Now, the HR gave a well directed and scripted presentation citing examples of how does it feel to be a part of the parallel government in the nation. I along with our breed of 300 hungry job seekers was deeply convinced. This is it! If some good exists in this world, that has to be those glass buildings in the video! Then began the interview process. The first day had aptitude round and email writing round followed by a personal and HR interview on the next day. Being one of the toppers, I was exempted from the aptitude round and had to write an email. As I was about to head towards the venue, I heard the voice of our TPO “Hey Kaushik, what are you wearing?” I was confused. “Am I wearing anything wrong?”, I tried to remember my image in front of the lone hostel mirror some 3 hours back. “You will go with brown shoes and black pants for the interview?”, she shouted. “I have nothing else to wear. I will manage if required from someone who gets rejected today”, I calmly reverted(just see the confidence !!) Luckily, I cleared the email round. Next day, it was the personal interview. I was introduced to two panelists say P1 and P2. P1 was busy with his laptop(utilizing free wi-fi to the fullest) and P2 was busy with his smartphone. After a formal introduction and trying to sell me like any other random commodity, P1: So, I think you are from CSE background. Let’s discuss C++. Me: Sir, I would like to let you know that I am from EE background and I don’t know C++. However, I know C and JAVA. P2(not taking eyes off his phone): What? You don’t know C++ and you are into an IT interview. Ok, tell me is the AC an ac or dc? Me: It runs on AC supply sir and spoke all gibberish to keep them back on my track. P1(after a dramatic pause): So Kaushik…., I think you may leave. You should know C++ I think. Me(attempting a futile effort to impress): If given a chance I will learn in these few months. P2: Please leave(Facepalm…) I came out shattered and only got some comfort hearing other’s experiences. To my surprise, I was asked to wait and around 4 pm, I was again called for an interview, not sure if he was HR(all were so well groomed I say!!!).Let’s assume HR only. HR: So, Kaushik. I heard that you don’t know C++ but willing to learn. Me: Yes sir. I will learn for sure.(Back in my mind are my answers that famous??) HR: Do you know how to cook? Me: No sir. HR: You couldn’t learn cooking. How will you learn C++? Me: Again some gibberish about online courses, books etc HR: You must have learned. Anyways nice to meet you. Any questions? Me: Which one to learn? HR: I guess you need to know both to thrive. Bye. Results came a bit late that night and that’s my story…. And finally, Verdict: Oh!! Come on. Please see my credentials. I was too good to be selected. That night while many were busy planning pandal hopping, I took the last possible train from one of the most desolate places I have ever been, thought about my bag of dreams and moved on… P.S: Now, it’s easy to recollect these memories. But 3 years back it was a learning experience. I took that night seriously. Now I am a good cook and know C++ as well(with 2 years work-ex on both).

It is a thankless, exhausting, stressful job that sucks the breath out of your life. Regardless of how fast your speed is, regardless of how many speed tests you pass, you will ALWAYS encounter witnesses who interrupt attorneys regardless of how many times they are instructed to wait until a question is asked before answering. You encounter people with accents, and it slows down your speed. The job requires you to process information in a fraction of a second and have it come out your fingers. When you are unable to understand what someone is saying because of how they speak or expert witnesses who are testifying in their professional capacity, your speed slows down and the job becomes even more laborious. Then, there is administration who thinks they can always replace reporters with tape recorders or other recording devices because they really don’t understand what reporting entails. You are required to buy your own equipment, which is costly, with the never ending threat of job loss because somewhere someone gets sold propaganda about recording devices. There is also jealousy among court personnel, especially court clerks who work along side of you in the courtroom, who think they should be paid as much as reporters. You can spend your lunch time or after hours looking for things in your notes to complete their docket because they couldn’t write fast enough to get a complete order a judge made. Instead of appreciating you, they resent you because they have to ask you to look up something they failed to write down. Attorneys want you to rush their transcript, but not pay more for it, because they think their case is more important or should be completed before any other attorney’s transcript, regardless of order or they sincerely have a legitimate reason for requesting a transcript to be prepared right away, but they don’t feel they should pay any more for it. A courtroom is not a controlled environment. You have voices coming at you from various directions at various speeds. You have people coughing or sneezing or even a book dropping which can completely obliterate what someone is saying. You have judges who are supposed to adhere to a schedule, but they forget and are on the record longer than they should or they have their own agenda and want to work through lunch or after court hours with little or no regard for court staff. There is always going to be some witness who didn’t finish testifying and can’t return in the afternoon and the judge will go into the lunch hour or after hours to finish. Attorneys can be more considerate than the judges, but they, too, will always have “just one more question, your Honor,” but it is never one more question but a series of questions which leads to one more series of questions from the other attorney. I really could go on further, but just remembering all the stress and aggravation inherent with the job is depressing.

I am an experienced digital marketer so that I can guide you well and will try to save your hard-earned penny. Digital marketing institutes just teaches you the basic concepts. I think those resources are easily available on the internet which you will pay to the institute. Now few will say Institute provides tricks and tips which is hidden in online resources. No tricks work longer in digital marketing. You have to develop it on your own. Your tricks will be unique to you which makes you a popular digital marketer. So, develop it by working on it more and more. Understand self that which trick is working and which are not working. Now coming to another aspect. You are done with your digital course with the institute, now what next. For any digital job, companies ask for experience, and for that, you have to work as an intern. Sometimes they pay little and sometimes they pay nothing for that. Post internship you kick start your career. Here I am giving you a few tips, follow it and I bet you will never regret it. Assuming you are about to build a career in digital marketing. Start learning basic concepts available on youtube. Mind it you have to learn basics not tips. Thousands of digital marketers make videos to share tips in order to get views. Don’t watch those videos. Watch tutorial videos which explain concepts and how it works. (7 days)There are 3 main modules in digital marketing SEO(Search engine optimization), SEM(Search engine marketing), SMM(Social media marketing). Take one topic for example SEO. Start exploring on the internet. Learn basic concepts. Once you are done with basic concepts of one topic start working on it. (30 days)Start reading blogs related to digital marketing which shares insights. You will be able to develop strategies.Now go for any online certification at first.Start an internship with any good agency. Maybe they will not pay you. But In the long-run brand tag is necessary. (6 months to 1 year).Now you have learned a lot, practically implemented it in an internship. Learned new things from companies. Start applying for jobs. Trust me if you are skilled and know your work. Getting a job after an internship is easy.Here you have to make the decision you have to build your own agency, Become freelancer, or continue your job. Job is mandatory for a few years as you will learn how business is done in agencies. How they get clients, how they retain clients. How they charge their client and much more stuff. Then Do whatever you want to do.For the above steps you don't have to spend any money, yes certification may cost you little but that is affordable and 100 times cheaper which you will pay to institutes. I have learned this with experience and will suggest you follow this and trust me you will never regret it. Now moving ahead what top digital marketers do? The top digital marketer first understands the client's business. Build strategies on how to go about and then they deliver the results. They try to expand the client's business. They customize plans for clients, which will work which will not. This is the mantra always remembers. I have seen fraud digital marketer whenever they get client, They start churning out money from them without any strategy. They simply start to google ad campaigns and social media postings without any customized solutions. Don't be just a digital marketer, be a good digital marketer. Bring a digital solution for your client. Drive their business growth. You will not lose the client for life. I will request not to spend money on institutes. If you are so much interested to go for a degree course from good colleges, don't go for these certification courses. The best digital marketing course is nothing but yes best digital marketer exists. The best is what, which suits you great. An expense which you will bear, if you learn it on your own. Buy a domain and hosting which will cost you around 2k for 1 year. Don't go for free hosting. Spend a few bucks here.Google certification for free from Google skill shop.If you have more inclination towards social media optimization then you can go for Facebook blueprint certification which costs around Rs 5700 with tax. This is not mandatory. You can upskill yourself from tutorials and apply it to your social media pages and accounts. Ultimately growth matters and that's what employers care about.Now whatever you will learn from tutorials apply it to your domain. Then you will start learning what works and whatnot. With these steps, one fine day you will become a great digital marketer. I know you have many other queries to be resolved. You can comment below so that I can address those and guide you so that you can always save money. I am giving you one best example. ISRO reached Mars at a cost of Rs 400 crores and NASA did the same for Rs 6000 crores. Which one do you think did a great job. Of course, ISRO who saved money for the country, which might be utilized for some other noble cause or in some other projects. One more thing which I would like to share it from one of my trainee students. Sir, whatever you teach, I always apply it to my live projects. Honestly, your trick works but when it comes to developing some of my own tricks and tips, I have to indulge myself with experiments that I do it for own, sometimes I got to fail but definitely develop some pro tips for the same. I hope you got my point. You have to do experiments. I and other trainers can teach you how to set campaigns on Facebook or Google ads and up to extent a few tips so that you must not lose your money with blunt mistakes. Post that you have to experiment, you have to dive in the ocean and bring more pro tips for yourself which will make you great digital professional. Digital marketing is more of marketing rather than technical. You have to write attractive ad copies in google ads and you need to play with keywords set which will actually differentiate you. For Facebook ads you have to identify the right audience. This can not be taught anywhere. You have to be a wise marketer. This is all that I wanted to address to all newbie/amateur who wants to join this field. I have shared real insights above my profession. Being into this industry I want every newbie to be guided well so that we can produce quality professionals. Follow me here, upvote If you liked it Please share it with one whom you know is about to join Digital marketing. I just tried to save your hard-earned money with my experience which I have earned it. I hope this detailed answer will help you a lot. I wish all aspirants a successful career ahead.

I had done my MBA and had worked for more than 4 years in India before moving here. People who worked with me would know how ambitious and hardworking I was in my previous jobs. I had a pretty hectic work life and was simultaneously going through some struggles on personal front as well. I was in love with my childhood friend, who was working in US and had a hard time convincing my parents for that marriage for many years. Finally when things worked out and my parents agreed, I was on top of world. Everything happened so fast that I didn’t have time to think about anything. Gave up my job, gave up my life with my best friends and moved here without any thoughts or plans about my future. First year was amazing. It felt like after ages I was able to breath and relax. I was truly happy. We went on long trips almost every 15 days. It felt like a dream life. Although I didn’t make any new friends in the first year (didn’t feel the need to), we partied a lot with my husband’s friends circle and had a good time. Staying in a place where its cold most part of the year, made me stay at home all the time, watching TV or surfing internet. I tried to cultivate some hobbies but was just not getting that interest. I started becoming lazier by the day. I loved traveling and adventures like trekking, hiking,etc., so only that kept me active. By second year we were thinking of maybe applying at some decent University for some relevant course which could help me in getting a job later. I had already done MBA in marketing, which meant I had limited options w.r.t courses I could do. I did not have a technical background and regretted it as, based on my observation, most of the job opportunities here are for IT grads/experience for outsiders. Around same time, my husband’s green card process was initiated by his company, which meant within a year and a half or so, I would get H4 EAD and will be able to work. We discussed and decided not to go ahead with the course because that also meant avoiding additional loans. Since it may take almost the same amount of time for the course to be completed and for the EAD to come, we decided on waiting for EAD. Maybe it was a mistake. In the second year I also went through miscarriage. We went through some difficult months emotionally. I tried doing some volunteer work at some NGOs for few months. I still felt empty and didn’t feel like I’m doing anything valuable. By third year we had bought a lovely small house. Things were going good but there was a delay in green card for many months, which meant delay in EAD. I had started losing hope of getting back on track with my career. But my husband kept assuring me and tried his best to support me in whatever ways possible. I am in my fourth year now. With Trump in power, everyone is confident that the H4 EAD rule will be removed and I have almost lost whatever little hope I had for my career life again. I get depressed for days together when I think of past life, my lost ambitions. I feel useless most of the days. Sometimes I cry endlessly. I keep wondering is this my life now? Cooking, cleaning, stupid kitty parties? No offense to other housewives. If they chose to do that in their life and they are happy its great. But I did not directly choose this life. I chose my husband. And this life came with it. I should have realized it before coming here. Maybe there could have been a way to have both. I have seriously started working on options to move to other country and apply for jobs there. But given that I have literally lost 4 years without doing anything productive in my life, I am not sure about my chances of getting a good job in any country. Not even India. My parents feel disappointed too. They provided me with all the education and encouraged me to excel all my life and now all they see is me being just a housewife. They keep asking me when I will be able to work and that it is such a waste of my talents, education and experience. I am out of words and feel kind of ashamed whenever this topic comes. If I had to put my experience in pointers it would be the following : Pros : Its a beautiful country, and you get to travel very often to dream locations than you could, staying in IndiaYou have a lot of free time, so you can catch up on all those movies and series which you wanted to watchYou get to learn about different cultures and meet different people from various countriesNo shortage of water, power or internet in almost all of US (excluding remote places)Relatively safer to travel, even alone as a women, compared to other places in the worldYou get to spend a lot of time with your husband (and kids) without any interference of relatives (some Indians may understand what I mean)You will become a good cook (even if you hate cooking to the core)Relatively less house work than India (I’m not talking for the people who are used to having maids do their work for them in India)You get a chance to explore new hobbies and passionsCons : You will be bored with your life here sooner or later, if you are career focusedYou loose financial independence. Unless you are totally ok with spending your husband’s money without any questionsYou miss your family and friends and cannot travel to India as often as you would want toShopping is not the same like it is in India. If you enjoy roadside shopping US is not the place.You have to do all the work by yourself (People cant afford servants on regular basis. Labour is very costly)The food here in most restaurants does not taste the same like it is in India and is expensive. Roadside Indian snacks is one big thing you will miss here(if you are a foodie).Last but not the least no career lifeEdit : In many states in the US you may not be eligible to get a valid ID (state) or even a drivers license. In some states they do provide temporary driving license (which in most cases cannot be used as an ID). You may end up carrying your passport everywhere, which is riskyOverall, for me atleast except for my career part, all other aspects have been good and although I do enjoy, there is this feeling of emptiness which I am yet to fulfill. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to move here on H4 or even H1B holders who want to get their spouses here on H4 Visa, please think through and take right decisions. If the person is ambitious consider all aspects before sacrificing his/her career life. Edit : I revisited this answer after a long time and was surprised to see new comments. Thank you for all the encouragement and suggestions. However I was even more surprised to see a negative comment from someone. I think the person completely misunderstood my answer. She mentioned that I was “whining” and complained about H4EAD. The whole answer is about my experience on H4 visa and not H4 EAD. That’s a completely different topic. I never mentioned that I received EAD and I’m frustrated because I am not able to find a job. At that point of my life after spending 4 years on just H4 visa, waiting for EAD and after trying all possible avenues to get a job or do something that gives personal satisfaction, if a person is not frustrated I don’t think that’s normal for any ambitious person. At that point there was lot of speculation about the EAD being removed and that worried me even more. I’m glad things worked out for that person sooner than many other people, but the frustration of waiting for EAD itself is a real and very common issue. I have spoken to so many people about this who have being going through the same frustration of waiting for EAD. The more we talk and discuss about this, maybe people will know what they are getting into before coming to US and existing people might get better ideas on how to deal with such a situation. P.S.- Going anonymous because I have a lot of friends and old colleagues who follow me, with whom I don’t want to share this part of my life.

All you need to do is get into a market that has a positive slope. You’ll get to a million sooner or later. MonetizationBusinesses become profitable when they operate in two ways: one when they sell a lot of inexpensive product, two when they sell high priced items to a limited list of buyers. Neither way is the perfect one. But, when you know what your business plan is, you don’t spend time wasting on how you should be pricing your product and designing them accordingly. Time is precious. Be the bestOkay. When you enter a profitable market, there are competitors. But, this does not signify that all companies are producing products in the same level of quantity and quality. There are always mediocre players who are not interested in going to the top. If you plan accordingly, the chances are you’ll be the first one to make millions of dollars. That too, only in the first year in business. If you want to hit the numbers, create some buzz, wow your audience. It’s just some more work to do.

I make a living developing enterprise software for Linux, Windows, macOS, etc on a daily basis. I've done the overwhelming majority of my professional work - especially later in my career while earning much more money - on Macs. But I use them for lots of other things like encoding HD video, editing AV media, graphics work, running virtual machines and Docker containers, and so on. I can tell you the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro is a huge upgrade from previous models! For all of the hype about keyboard issues in previous models, Apple’s return to the scissor-switch keyboard is of course great, and the Touch Bar includes a physical Escape key as well. But the truth is those keyboard problems affected a relatively small number of people, and there are much bigger improvements than that. In terms of processing power, RAM, and storage, you can configure it all the way up to a 2.4GHz 8-core 9th-generation Intel Core i9 processor (Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz), an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, 64GB of 2666MHz DDR4 memory, and 8TB of 3.2GB/s SSD storage. The thermal cooling system is redesigned and much more efficient. It’s so efficient, in fact, that thermal throttling is truly a thing of the past. The screen outputs 500 nits of brightness and has automatic True Tone color shifting with a consistent P3 wide color gamut. It’s just plain gorgeous. The sound system is a completely redesigned six-speaker setup that has way more bass and much less distortion than any model before it. Stereo separation is remarkable, mids are clear, and the bass is better than I’ve heard on any laptop before. It sounds amazing. And they redesigned the microphones into a three-mic array which really improves audio recordings too. I own the beefiest 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro with the 2.4GHz 8-core 9th-generation Intel Core i9 processor (Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz), the AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, 32GB of DDR4 memory, and 2TB of SSD storage. And I've been putting it through different work loads since I got it. And I'm pleased to report my MacBook Pro happily encodes HD video (one of the most demanding tasks I do on a regular basis) with all cores maxed out for literal hours, at a sustained speed of somewhere above 3GHz, without any CPU throttling, and the temperatures hovering in the 83-95° C range. The fans while this is going on are surprisingly quiet. The bottom of the case (which often feels like a heat sink in older models) doesn't even feel very warm to the touch compared with older models. It’s downright speedy. The display is gorgeous and bright. The keyboard is really nice and responsive. The trackpad, like Apple's others, is the best in the industry. It's a beast in a really thin, fairly lightweight, relatively small package. I'm loving it!™ It's worth every single penny.",2021-03-05T14:57:55.250Z,"What are your thoughts on the 16-inch Apple Macbook Pro? ",Quora

This starts with education. And I’m not talking about the education you get from a school. I’m talking about the education that happens when you hit the real world and what you do with your time after hours. Here are three ways to maximize your real-world learning opportunities: Seek out educational content: Rather than watching hours of funny videos on Facebook, spend time consuming content that will elevate your career. From marketing podcasts to industry blog posts, there are plenty of resources you can take advantage of to grow your skills and talents.Find a manager who pushes you: You want to be challenged. You don’t want your first job to be an easy gig where you coast from paycheck to paycheck. One of my first managers pushed me to gain skills and talents that would shape my career. I was tasked with giving presentations with little preparation, working on insane timelines…while it was painful at the time, looking back it’s clear that these situations gave me resilience and the ability to stay calm in the middle of chaos.Join a company committed to your growth: At Foundation, we give every new employee three books that I believe are important to being successful in the company. We also give our team members an unlimited budget for buying books on Amazon that could help their career. It’s important to look for a company that wants to invest in your growth, as that will be a huge help down the road.While everyone’s situation is different, I strongly recommend that in the first few years, you prioritize learning over comfort. If at a fast-paced, low-paying startup you can learn in two years what someone at a larger company learns in eight years, that could become your competitive advantage. Don’t Be Idle—Build While You Wait It’s never been a better time to be a maker. You can create a blog in the matter of hours. You can launch a podcast in less than a week. You can start a Shopify store in the matter of days. And you can start selling services on a website like Upwork or Fiverr by the time you’re done reading this post. It’s easier than ever to create something new. And while sustaining growth and driving profits is a challenge, it’s a challenge that will give you an advantage. Most people don’t ship anything. They get excited about ideas but never take the steps to turn those ideas into reality.4 If you want to stand out from most people, actually build something, whether it’s a travel blog or a Etsy shop. Beyond a marketing advantage, building something will help you learn more about your own strengths and about the skills needed for this other job—things that you won’t learn if you spend your evenings watching Netflix and eating Doritos. Find 10 People And Build Real Relationships When Drake sang, “No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new,” he had already made it. And he certainly had an impressive rolodex of industry friends. If you think you can build a career in marketing without making new relationships, you’re wrong. You need to meet new people, and these relationships will offer you support, advice, opportunities and friendship that can change your life. Take the time to identify 10 people in the marketing world whom you respect or simply want to get to know. Then go above and beyond to deliver them value by retweeting their content, commenting on their articles, emailing them with quick fixes (typos/broken links) on their site, etc. Put in the effort to build a relationship, and you’ll reap the benefits for potentially years to come.
