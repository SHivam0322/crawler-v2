So to officially answer the question: it really depends on whether or not you are working for someone, or you have your own business. For example I have seen companies offer $18 per/hr to their drone pilots who conduct roof inspections. On the other hand some drone entrepreneurs can make $500 per/shoot routinely, and for just a few hours of work. A key to getting your foot in the door is to get certified as a FAA licensed remote pilot.

I got slowed down by delayed retirement to help out my old boss, but will be adding the Part 107 commercial remote pilot rating to my commercial pilot certificate along with instruments, multi-engine, centerline thrust, and instructor’s ratings. Practicing in parks and school yards I’ve been approached by park managers a couple times, have been able to show them the maps and 3d models I’ve done with DroneDeploy and fly throughs done with Litchi. Both of them have given me their card and asked to call when I’m getting the 107 cert. One, while I was out in his park after twilight trying to get a good demo with a thermal camera, told me about a new park they’re developing and that he’d love to see it mapped, so I’ll head out there, as a hobby pilot, and do it, appreciate the opportunity. I believe, in this ‘gig economy’ that there will be plenty of gigs if I can walk out the door with the drones to do the jobs. I’m not trying to make a full living off it, only trying to supplement a pension and social security. A buddy of mine has a beautiful house with a little peninsula about 100 yards out into a creek off one of our rivers. The neighbors got together for a dredging project and hired a drone pilot to map the creek. They paid him $700 to show up for a couple hours with a crew of two to keep the drone in sight and a DJI Inspire to map the 80+ acres. I think the only special equipment he had was a polarizing filter and the only complication was waiting for the sun to get right so he could get the bottom of the creek. He did a beautiful job. The rate was similar to what a landscaper might get, good money if you can do it several times a week. This is what I’ve seen lately, and I’m encouraged to keep at it, maybe make enough to pay for these drones. Meanwhile, I like the work, enjoy getting out and getting the imagery and coming back and doing the post-flight work to get photos, maps, 3d models, or thermals out for my portfolio. I’ll enjoy it more if I’m paid for it, will likely get the 107 test done later this spring when school’s out…",2021-03-06T10:30:02.456Z,"Is there a career in becoming a drone pilot? ",Quora

What would YOU think? Your buddy...  You...  =========================Satisfied?  STOP HERE & move along. Dissatisfied?  Keep reading...*NOTE*: Satisfaction not guaranteed... TL;DRfrom Merriam-Webster Online:pilot | a person who flies an airplane, helicopter, etc.also: | a person who steers or guides a ship into and out of a port or in dangerous watersand: | a single television show that is made as a test to see if a television series based on the show would be popular and successful Conclusion: Not all ""pilots"" are identical. ...and now, the Extended Version... Framing the DiscussionRealize that this is simply my personal opinion, which is obviously the only kind of opinion I can realistically give.  It is also colored by a military combat pilot perspective re: combat drones.  I'm not talking about the hobbyist who slaps a GoPro on a quadcopter to get a cool shot of her kids on the Slip-n-Slide.  (If that's what we're talking about, we might as well ask Mario Andretti what he thinks about my kid's remote controlled race car.) And... my experience is getting more aged every day.  So, when I was in and dealing with RPA folks, they all went through pilot training before RPA was even a word.  They all expected to have air under their seat.  I'm not talking about folks who go through a ""drone only"" training.  Different situation, and different animal.  Maybe more on that farther down. What goes through my mind...Okay, enough waffling, and on to the crux of the question.  Let's delve a little deeper, and I'll be a little more explicit and less nuanced. First, a few assumptions:1. The RPA pilot went through the same pilot training as a conventional pilot.2. The RPA pilot could have gone on to fly a conventional aircraft, had there not been a need to fill an RPA slot.3. The RPA pilot didn't enter pilot training with the intent to fly a drone. Of course there are exceptions to these assumptions.  However, I'm not going for a PhD in pilot comparisons, so we're not going to delve into those here. So... to be clear, as I tried to express in my response, my general thought about pilots who (1) go through pilot training, (2) planning to fly something with air under their seat, and (3) getting assigned to fly a drone instead is... ""Dude, that sucks."" This is as opposed to: ""Dude, you suck."" When I read the question, that is what I gathered as the underlying question: Do conventional pilots see RPA pilots as fortunate or unfortunate, qualified or unqualified, capable or incapable? So, I see them as having gone through the exact same training, done the exact same things, and crossed the exact same finish line, only to get assigned to something that I, personally, wouldn't find as exciting. However, it is a vital need.  They fill a critically necessary mission.  Someone has to do it.  And, in a case where the option is drone or nothing, I'd pick drones all day.  But, again, I see that as an exception, not the general rule. Still, if the only reason the drone pilot wasn't flying a conventional aircraft was because of a limitation beyond their control that keept them from being ""pilot qualified,"" and they still had all of the training to be airborne, it would still generate the ""Dude, that sucks"" response. Believe me, I have personal experience with that one.  I haven't thrown this one out on Quora before, but I was medically DQ'd for aural migraines. (I'd get huge blind spots and fuzzy vision.  Kinda hard to fly in that condition.)  My response to myself was ""Dude, that sucks.""  So, I spent the rest of my time flying a desk (not even an RPA), and riding around in a Humvee as an ALO. Still, it was fun while it lasted.Events occur.Life goes on.*shrug* Tactics, Techniques, and ProceduresPiloting a drone is not the same as piloting an aircraft.  It just isn't. When I was teaching at the Joint Firepower Course at Nellis AFB, NV, I was part of a team that went out to Indian Springs (now Creech Air Force Base) to evaluate and give feedback on their close air support training curriculum.  Their curriculum was great.  Their capability wasn't. This is in no way a reflection on the quality of the pilots.  They are professionals and take their job very seriously.  They have my utmost respect for that.  No, the problem was the limit of the drone itself. The biggest limitation was in situational awareness.  In a fighter with a bubble canopy (remember that corner office with the killer view?), you can simply look outside and see what's going on.  Your field of view is pretty much limited only by how far you can twist in your seat.  With a drone, it's like looking at the world through a soda straw. This is when someone usually chimes in with ""but what about improving the sensors?"" or ""what about full motion wrap-around visual pods?""Yup.  Great idea.  Maybe someday.  Let's talk about those when we have 'em, k?  We're not there yet. Plus, those suckers have some other limitations, payload and durability among them.  Rather than run down that whole list, I'll simply link to this: Lynn Taylor's answer to Are Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft like the A-10 and Su-25 obsolete? Okay, back to the pilots...If we're talking about someone who has sat in the driver's seat of a tin can hurtling through the air, where making the wrong error at the wrong time can kill you... then we're talking about a PILOT. If we're talking about someone who sits at zero feet and zero knots moving a joystick to change the picture on the TV... then we're talking about a ""pilot."" As Tim Hibbetts put it, the former has ""skin in the game.""  And it can be a very deadly game.  [Hey, Tim... sorry, bud.  Try CTRL+F next time.] Again... I feel I must make a clear distinction here...**People who professionally pilot RPAs with a sense of duty and responsibility have my utmost respect.**  Similarly, folks who unprofessionally pilot manned aircraft have my utmost derision... usually posthumously. I'm specifically pointing out that the term ""pilot"" does not mean the same thing in all cases, just because it is spelled the same, pronounced the same, and is used in the sense that there is a control mechanism that directs something that flies. Case in point, from Merriam-Webster Online:pilot | a person who flies an airplane, helicopter, etc.also: | a person who steers or guides a ship into and out of a port or in dangerous watersand: | a single television show that is made as a test to see if a television series based on the show would be popular and successful So... ""flying a drone"" is not the same as ""flying an aircraft"" is not the same as ""steering a ship."" They are all useful, and they are all different. There's no emotional attachment to the fact. It simply... is. Thus endeth the lesson.",2021-03-06T10:31:52.641Z,"What do conventional military pilots think of drone pilots? ",Quora

The reason joining the military is the easiest way is because there is a surplus of manned aircraft pilots and a shortage of unmanned aircraft pilots. Companies looking to hire UAV operators/pilots seek ex-military people because they have require less training. On average, it's more expensive to teach you to fly a UAV than it is to pay for all of your licenses in a manned aircraft. There are high costs with all of the equipment involved and the coordination of different agencies in learning to fly UAVs that are not present in manned aircraft. You won't be stuck doing military operations if that's where you get your training, but you're going to have to search out different companies who specialize in different fields. I believe there are also some colleges with programs specializing in UAVs that may be of interest. At least one college in North Dakota I know of has curriculum for them. This doesn't hold true anymore if you want to fly quadcopter or something like that. This advice is for large UAVs (600lbs to thousands of pounds). If you want to fly cameras on a quadcopter or something like that, I guess go to a toy store and make some cool YouTube videos; hope to be found by an interested party. *I flew UAVs for 10 years",2021-03-06T10:33:32.787Z,"How do you become a military drone pilot?

The drone pilot can drive to work from home in the morning, fly his drone for several hours and then return home again. This constant switching between a domestic and combat environment takes its toll, especially as there are no people at home that you can share details of your work with (all classified!) Also, drones are used a lot for intelligence gathering, often spending days if not weeks over a certain area observing peoples routines. During that time, one starts to recognise the same people and this leads to a more “intimate” knowledge of them. They become “real people” so to speak. So then one day your task is to do bomb damage assessment of that place following a strike, you sort of ‘'know’' the people that got hit. And that’s very different from the jet pilot who drops a bomb from 10.000 feet and never sees the result of that action. As the officer told me, the mental health of the drone pilot was of particular concern. The air force never had to deal with mental issues in people who worked that far removed from the actual combat zone.

Once you understand what a pre-flight checklist is and the several aerial manoeuvres such as take-off, hovering, turning, and flying at different altitudes, then your next step is applying for a license. When applying for a drone piloting certificate, you need to be at least 16 years old. If you are, you can now then take the Aeronautical Knowledge Test. This will test your skills in flying a drone and you obviously need to pass this one to proceed to the next stage. You can take the test at an FAA-approved testing centre. Once done, you need to secure a Remote Pilot Certificate. Your background will also be checked by the Transportation Security Administration to make sure you have no history of anything illegal in which you will use this particular skill. Another condition for the certificate is that you need to report any drone-related accidents you get involved with that resulted in damages of not lower than $500. The certificate will be valid for 2 years and will cost you around $150. After 2 years, you'd need to renew your license. Although all commercial drone pilots are required to obtain a certificate, those who were previously manned helicopter or plane pilots are an exception to the rule. You just have to present a manned pilot certificate and have completed a flight review within 24 months.

It is perhaps a little harder in Australia in that you must attend training with an approved training provider and also complete the practical flying assessment unlike in the other countries but by and large the standard of technical or theoretical knowledge is the same or close to it.

This is not a full list of what you’re required to know but it is a good start and gives you an idea. Generally speaking in Australia to get a remote pilots license is considered to take approximately 40 hours of study and as somebody else has mentioned is roughly equivalent to a private pilot’s license and requires roughly a similar level of theoretical knowledge, indeed in Australia a commercial drone license or remote pilots license is considered to be a pilot’s license in every sense with the same responsibilities. I would think that if you have no previous aviation experience that that 40 hours projection is pretty realistic in all of these countries. You shouldn’t be overwhelmed by the thought of doing this, I passed my commercial drone license when I was over 50 and haven’t done any formal study in over 20 years. I had a reasonable level of aviation knowledge to start with and went into the exam with about 15 hours study and achieved a good pass. The exam format varies from country to country but generally is a multiple-choice question, here of around 80 questions. In Australia you’re given an hour and a pass mark of 80% is required. I completed the remote pilots exam and the aeronautical radio operators certificate required to fly and controlled airspace which is another 50 questions in a total of 21 minutes with 97% and 100% pass mark’s respectively, If I can do it then I am sure you can.

Read this full :  IID Drone Training Programs are approved by DGCA through FTOHow much does it cost to be a drone pilot It takes about a month to master the craft drone flying, according to Livingstone. But of course continued practice will make you perfect. The course duration and fees vary with the kind of drone in question. The multirotor drone pilot course is seven days and the fixed wing drone pilot course is ten days. As you can tell it’s a bit more difficult to handle a fixed wing drone. Multirotors have a vertical take-off, fixed wing drones have a horizontal take off. The latter require a runway similar to an airplane and runway flying needs to be precise skills controlling the aircraft during landing and take-off. Livingstone says they charge corporates, individuals and students a customized price depending on each category’s ability to pay. “We are sensitive to the fact that drone training should be affordable and accessible to everybody. There have been drone enthusiasts who say this is their future but can’t afford to pay for it. And there have been instances where we provide free training.” The industry average for learning to pilot a multirotor drone is around 25,000 rupees for an entire course, and for fixed wing drones, it’s typically 2000 to 3000 rupees a hour. “Our rates can beat the rates of anybody in the world,” Livingstone firmly says of the Indian Institute of Drones. Indian Institute of Drones, with Government registered Regn No. 4/1267/159/206/67 specialized in training Professional Pilots and aerospace engineers who have the willingness to learn the art of flying drones to carryout UAV piloting, operations with great emphasis on safety and security issues. Our specialised staff have many years experience in the full size aviation industry and also in the drone industry primarily from the the defence background with certifications from the Ministry of Defence through their respective wing (Army Navy or Air Force). This experience is now being extended to the rapidly growing UAV (Drone) market in the civilian sector. ​ Indian Institute of Drones is affiliated with Consortium of Unmanned Vehicle Systems(CUVSI) India under the ageis of International Foundation for Aviation and Development(IFFAAD) . It is our intention and aim to offer the skill set requirements that tick the DGCA boxes as well as delivering courses that are insightful, fun and above all extend the superior safety and security record that the Indian Aviation Industry enjoys. ​ Indian Institute of Drones is co-located with Johnnette Technologies Pvt Ltd. in sector 70 of NOIDA which has a very good connectivity from all over Delhi. This unique positioning provides access to India’s leading commercial pilots, repair centre, online store and other UAV support services. ​ India has a very few qualified UAV operators who are from the military background (Indian Air Force, Indian Army and The Indian Navy). These are the only operators who have the current certifications from the Ministry of Defence through their respective services. ​ ​ The training at the institute will be carried out by such highly qualified professionals who not only have unmanned flying experience but also have manned flying experience giving the learners an indepth knowledge of both manned and unmanned flying and how the two are to be safely merged together as per the mandate circulated by DGCA.

A nephew-in-law who’s an engineer for a power and pipeline company used to hire a drone pilot to travel with him. He showed up at a family gathering with a brand-new Phantom his employer got for him, unboxed it, figured out how to fly it, and got wonderful pictures of the family, 14 grand-kids, and a lot of relations. Within a month he’d gotten his 107 Certificate, and now he sports about the Eastern seaboard with an SUV and a couple of Phantoms with RTK, a GPS ground station, and a dozen intelligent ground reference points. He doesn’t need to hire the pilot any more. I guess there are some pilots making a good living with their drones but for the rest it’s chicken one day and feathers on many.

Drones generally use the same technology to guide weapons that has been used by aircraft since the Vietnam War, that is, laser guidance. This tech is old, yet has remained more or less unchanged due to its reliability in accurately hitting targets both moving and stationary, although it does fall whim to atmospheric conditions such as weather and/or dust and smoke. Essentially, the drone has a laser designator (laser pointer) which is bore sighted to its targeting camera. The targeting sensor used on the MQ-9 reaper is the AN/DAS-1 MTS-B Multi-Spectral targeting system.  This sensor is comprised of multiple different high resolution cameras, as well as a laser designator. The cameras are each intended to view in different electromagnetic wavelengths, hence the camera being Multi-Spectral. One of the cameras would be viewing visible light, and others viewing in the infrared spectrum. The sensor would produce a high resolution video image with information and targeting overlays to the operator, similar to that seen below,  Sniper Targeting pod capture The laser designator is sighted to the cross indicated on the targeting sensor overlay. Because these sensors operate in infrared wavelengths they are able to maintain pristine imagery both day and night, and are sensitive to infrared emissions created by the heat generated by vehicles, people or any other heat source. When the intended target has been positively identified by the targeting sensor, the laser designator illuminates the target with a high power infrared laser. This laser provides accurate range to the target, as well as a targeting point for the weapons used by the aircraft. The MQ-9 utilizes both the AGM-114 Hellfire and the GBU-12 laser guided weapons. The hellfire is a missile with higher maneuverability and a smaller warhead, whilst the GBU-12 is a laser guided free-fall bomb with a larger warhead but less maneuverability, particularly being dropped from a slow platform like a drone.  MQ-9 carrying GBU-12’s on the inboard wing pylons and AGM-114’s on the outboard wing pylons. Both of these weapons essentially use the same guidance principle. The seekers in the nose of the weapons are essentially very low resolution infrared cameras themselves, they pick up the bright reflection that is created by the laser being emitted from the drone’s targeting sensor hitting an object. In the same way that your cat so easily tracks the laser dot reflected from the floor when you shine a laser at it, these weapons track the laser ‘dot’ reflected by whatever the drone is looking at when it shines its infrared laser. Then, similarly to your cat, the sensors guide the weapon straight onto the laser dot with precision accuracy, even if that dot is moving. If you want to know what that looks like, below is a collection of footage taken from F-15E strikes using their targeting pods. Most of the footage is quite old and significantly compressed but it gives you a rough idea of the environment.  Modern targeting systems are only higher resolution and more precise. Here is CCTV footage of the actual strike on Qassem Soleimani,  EDIT: Apparently youtube sharing links are having some issues, hopefully this is fixed soon. Jay Thompson’s asnwer to this question goes into great detail on the more precise mechanisms of laser guidance.",2021-03-06T10:56:28.731Z,"How much discretion do drone pilots have in targeting and firing drones?

Additionally, most of the contractor flying jobs will want you to have all your ratings—that’s not an issue for anyone that went thru Air Force or Navy pilot training, but it is a limiting factor for Army MQ-1 guys and other RPA only pilots that didn’t go thru a traditional (manned) military flight training program. Beyond actually flying the aircraft in a contractor or civilian role, most of the other job opportunities are in the defense industry focused on the various intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities out there, or systems integration. “ISR” is a buzzword in the DoD, so if you’re a military officer with experience in that field and a security clearance there are always going to be options with a salary commensurate to what you could make on active duty.

Drones offer you the chance to capture stunning aerial shots and help improve your portfolio, get started can be a challenge. That’s why if you want to start your own drone photography business, you should follow these steps if you want to push ahead of the competition and be a success. 1. Learn the Basics This may seem obvious, but learning the basics about drones with cameras before starting your business can be helpful. Drones can be expensive. Investing a lot of money into something that may not work the way you expect it to may not be the best idea. 2. Experiment with Different Drone Genres to Find Your Favourite(s) This is one of the most important steps of your business plan. As mentioned before, drone photography comes with a lot of sub-genres. Here are just a few categories that drone photographers can get into: - Real estate - Surveillance - Agriculture - Weddings 3. Create a Checklist to Ensure a Smooth Operation Before you make your business official, you can make a list of everything you’d like to focus on. This can be a to-do list or simply a list of questions. The more prepared you are, the easier you’ll find it to keep your business strong, no matter what you experience. 4. Update Yourself on the Laws There are many places that have strict rules regarding drones, their flight patterns, and the types of images they can capture. This is especially true if you are near any private property, federal buildings, schools, or airports. 5. Build a Strong Portfolio to Highlight Your Skills Without an outstanding style, drone photos all look the same. You can naturally develop your style by taking lots of photos by drone photography.

604361bced76476feda298f6,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-drone-pilot-test-hard?-,"In the USA the test for an FAA Part 107 certificate for a commercial remote sUAS pilot is similar to the test a commercial pilot for a plane or a helicopter takes. Except for questions about planes and helicopters, it covers similar knowledge. It’s got sectional chart reading, navigation, safety, classes of airspace, operations in controlled airspace, weather, and other topics that aren’t ‘common knowledge’. I’m adding a remote pilot endorsement to my ancient commercial pilot’s certificate along with airplanes single and multi-engine, instruments, and single pilot ops under Part 135. I got 55% on the first ‘sample test’ I took without studying, found I was rusty about classes of airspace and other picky stuff. After some study I got 85% on the 2nd, then 95% on the third. I’ve waited a while to go take the test since I didn’t retire from my teaching job when I expected to and am enjoying double-dipping into my retirement and buying drones with no commercial activity yet. I’ll probably run thru another on-line course and practice again before sitting for the exam. The test for commercial drones pilots is hard, IMHO, and it should be. Recreational pilots can easily choose places to fly where airplanes and helicopters don’t and without other restrictions. Commercial pilots are likely to get calls to fly in and around restricted airspace and piloted aircraft and need to know how to seek authorization and operate safely around airports. Just today there was an announcement at dronedj..com about a new test the FAA is cooking up for recreational pilots. For the time-being, recreational pilots flying drones that weigh more than 250 grams are only required to check off a list of several safety rules, promise to obey them, pay $5, and download a certificate. In the near future, the regulations will require passing a more rigorous on-line course. The FAA is working with a dozen or more providers of training materials for pilots and on-line tests to come up with the test and the system to administer it. There are more than a million and a half registered recreational pilots and more than 100,000 commercial. Of the commercial certificates that have been issued long enough to expire, only about a quarter of them have been renewed. I think that means not only that the commercial drone pilot test is hard, but it’s tough to make a living at it. My nephew-in-law, a field engineer for an energy giant, showed up at a family gathering in the boonies of Pennsylvania last year with a brand-new Phantom his work had given him. He registered himself as a recreational pilot so he could practice. He pulled the Phantom out of the box and got wonderful photos and videos of the big reunion, with something like 14 grandkids and dozens of relatives. Within a couple weeks he’d studied for and passed the Part 107 test, and now he sports about the eastern US with a fleet of Phantoms including the RTK-Real Time Kinetic update with GPS ground station and a trunk full of intelligent ground reference points and works with surveyors and inspectors. He made the test look easy, no prior experience in aviation, but he’s one very smart guy, can do anything that attracts his interest… 1",2021-03-06T11:04:28.406Z,"Is the drone pilot test hard?

Drones are now used in most of the movies to get the camera angles which are only possible by helicopters other than drones. Since drones are really easy to use, cheap and portable, they are used mostly to save the time and money. Agriculture drones are helpful to check the health of the crops and find if there is any bug or insect is there in the crop. Proper measures can be taken if these things will be known to a farmer in advance. There are a lot other uses of drones in agriculture besides surveying drones.

So I decided to spend some money and see how it’s done in the US. Most of the currently employed Pilot’s are from “Riverside Flight Centre” in Tulsa Oklahoma. Though this can’t be a measure that everyone from RFS got a Job in some Airline. I could not visit this school despite having good reviews but I decided to visit PEA Flight School, Airline Pilot Training in Florida, USA - Phoenix East Aviation in Daytona Beach FL. School is good and decent instructors. Bob was really nice to show me around and let me had a good conversation with one of the Instructors. I met an Indian girl from Punjab working as an Instructor for over 5 years. School has fleet of Cessna 152 and 172 and few more little aged Aircrafts. But what differentiates this school from RFC or any other school is the Location .Florida is the Sun state and its really congruent for flying. Though most of the flying schools are in FL but this one has good reputation. Fee is little higher than RFC but it’s the practical flying that counts. Apart from this I like NZ for flying for it’s quality of training and School. There aren’t many Students per instructor. And most importantly students who just complete the training aren’t hired as an Instructor which is very common in the US across most flying school. There isn’t much real life experience involved, it’s just the bookish knowledge. NZ’s flying conditions are challenging which is very good for someone who really wants to learn the most out of training. But living is also expensive in NZ. Conclusion:- US Pro-Decent fee($60k+), Good Flying Conditions, Lifestyle is Good if you want to stay there after training (Working as an Instructor) Cons:- Not many experienced Instructors, Less number of Flying hours, Visa maybe a tricky process now. NZ Pro:- Great weather, Location, Excellent quality of training, Peaceful Country to live in. Cons:- Living cost is high and so is the fee but I think it’s worth it if can be afforded.

I got slowed down by delayed retirement to help out my old boss, but will be adding the Part 107 commercial remote pilot rating to my commercial pilot certificate along with instruments, multi-engine, centerline thrust, and instructor’s ratings. Practicing in parks and school yards I’ve been approached by park managers a couple times, have been able to show them the maps and 3d models I’ve done with DroneDeploy and fly throughs done with Litchi. Both of them have given me their card and asked to call when I’m getting the 107 cert. One, while I was out in his park after twilight trying to get a good demo with a thermal camera, told me about a new park they’re developing and that he’d love to see it mapped, so I’ll head out there, as a hobby pilot, and do it, appreciate the opportunity. I believe, in this ‘gig economy’ that there will be plenty of gigs if I can walk out the door with the drones to do the jobs. I’m not trying to make a full living off it, only trying to supplement a pension and social security. A buddy of mine has a beautiful house with a little peninsula about 100 yards out into a creek off one of our rivers. The neighbors got together for a dredging project and hired a drone pilot to map the creek. They paid him $700 to show up for a couple hours with a crew of two to keep the drone in sight and a DJI Inspire to map the 80+ acres. I think the only special equipment he had was a polarizing filter and the only complication was waiting for the sun to get right so he could get the bottom of the creek. He did a beautiful job. The rate was similar to what a landscaper might get, good money if you can do it several times a week. This is what I’ve seen lately, and I’m encouraged to keep at it, maybe make enough to pay for these drones. Meanwhile, I like the work, enjoy getting out and getting the imagery and coming back and doing the post-flight work to get photos, maps, 3d models, or thermals out for my portfolio. I’ll enjoy it more if I’m paid for it, will likely get the 107 test done later this spring when school’s out…",2021-03-06T11:12:07.989Z,"What training do you need to become a professional drone pilot?

They were all pretty easy, all of my tests I scored above 90% except the part 107 recurrent test I only scored 88% but that’s partially because there are only 40 questions on that test as opposed to 60 on the others and partially because I forgot some regulations in 2 years. By far the part 107 required very little knowledge compared to the other test I’ve taken. Study the material, learn to read the VFR sectional chart, and you’ll be fine. The part 107 test is very different now than when I took it. From what I understand, you don’t have to know what density altitude is and how that affects performance anymore, I think load factors are not required anymore. My recurrent Test just asked some basic regulations questions then asked me to identify some types of airspace on a sectional chart which I’m sure is going to be removed from the tests soon since the new Laanc maps make that pointless. There are a number of companys that offer part 107 training for a fee. The FAA publishes a study guide that’s free. I did the free study guide, but make sure when the study guide says something like “refer to the U.S. chart supplement” or something to that effect you better make sure you refer to that document and know how to read it. Also learn how to decode METARs and TAFs. When you go take the test they will give you a book that has a bunch of figures and images you’ll need to refer to during the test, I think this is the same book given to people taking the Private Pilot Test, the FAA allows you to download this book for free to look at before hand. Unless this has changed they also publish the list of questions on the test. There is a pool of 300 questions but you only get asked 60 of them, which questions will get asked you won’t know till you take the test. They also offer a practice test in the back of the study guide. I wouldn’t take the real test until you pass the practice test with a 90% or better. There are also some free practice tests online I’m sure. The FAA makes this test really difficult to fail. Just study and know the material. And please for the love of god, be responsible with your drone around airports. It’s a real problem for us manned aircraft pilots. If your within a mile from the airport just don’t fly!

Just to be clear we are talking about the same drones (Called UAS or Unmanned Aerial Systems) You are talking about these right? (The infamous MQ-9 ‘Reaper’)  (The RQ-4 ‘Global Hawk’   You can see how massive these aircraft are. Yes, they do fly commercially available UAS and Quad Rotors from companies like DJI, the drones you see the USAF fly are generally not this small;  Now we have gotten size out of the way, the pilots that fly these UAS, are fully trained USAF pilots. Some are straight out of flight school, and some are almost fully retired. I believe the USAF has a program set up that even if you have a medical issue that would ground you from flying (for example you have ejected one too many times), instead of discharging you, they can retain you as an operator.  They will fly it just like a regular aircraft, when required talk to Air Traffic control (usually military of course) and fly their aircraft accordingly in populated airspace. The only difference is they may not even be in the same hemisphere as the aircraft. The aircraft may not have taken off from the same airport, and they may not even be at an airport at all. The control system allows them to be portable, with a system that can be deployed in the form of a shipping container, or even inside equipped aircraft. Control of the aircraft can be easily handed over between these control systems, with early tests of the platforms usually taken off with pilots on base, and handed over to remote operators. The remote operators can do everything but start up the systems, which do require the ground crews to do so. The pilots will work in shifts, with some of them able to go home, sleep and return to finish the mission with the same aircraft. (If the aircraft is refuelled in-flight.). With a smaller drone, usually operated by the Army, or one operated off of a US navy ship (small ones, not carrier launched aircraft) will be operated by licensed UAS operators.

He suggested tracing the lines in a parking lot as a simple exercise. He wanted to see a website with samples of my work. He cautioned me about doing anything that appeared ‘commercial’ in any way until I was certified, that even giving free video I had to a paving company for advertisement might not be a good idea. I’m getting good videos together, and when I’m certified and insured will put up a demo website I’m plugging at. I think it’s important to have honest, semantic markup, with an <h1> that says something like ‘Drone Pilot in River City, Virgilina’ is important along with <h2>s that say and show what I can do like real estate, mapping, inspections, scanning facades, and thermal. I’ve got enough drones to walk out the door and do a job, and don’t believe anybody that only has one will get very far. I’ve practiced a lot in the last year and a half, and have had zero crashes in recent months and am left with 4 Inspires, 2 of them V2 with X5s and the other two with X3s; 2 Mavic 2 Zooms; a Platinum; and a pair of Typhoon Hs with CGO-ET. I’ve got TinyHawks, BabyHawks, and Fat Shark goggles but they’re toys, are still wicked hard to fly, but I figure some good FPV video might be good to show off if I can do it. I’m lucky to have friends with good-looking properties to fly and walk around and through. One is on a salt-water creek that makes a spectacular video tour, another has really fantastic home and gardens on a wooded lot. I try to get out and map a large site every couple of weeks, got a demo through DroneDeploy that made a beautiful 8 foot X 3 foot. I’ve got six months of fly-overs of a beautiful park run through Litchi. A neighbor spent 6 months renovating their yard for a wedding, let me cover it with my drones, building fences, decks, and a fire pit, lots of work with BobCats and diggers, a month of putting down and nursing a half acre of new sod, put up a 40 X 60 foot tent for the feast, and finally the wedding bash with lots of kids and friends giving thumbs-up at the drone. That’s making a good website exhibit and a couple of videos, will put one in a digital frame and give it as a Christmas gift. A few other neighbors have asked if I’ll do their houses, too, which I will. I’ve got a year of DroneDeploy ‘plant health’ reports of a sports complex to show off, where the park manager suggested it’s empty except for scheduled events. He’s offered me a job with our County park system and I hope it’s still there when I get certified. That’s what I’m doing and expect to do, can’t say how it’ll work out yet, promised my Boss I’d stay on another year at school and don’t have enough free time to commit to any kind of deadlines for drone work. I’m an old guy, semi-retired, and if I can make a living off of my drones and drop dead doing what I enjoy, I’d be delighted but I’m not depending on it, would settle for enough to pay for a drone or two. I’ve got my pension and social security. I can’t fly planes anymore, can’t get a medical certificate, but drones. Of the 107 certificates that have been issued long enough to expire, only about 1/4 of them have been renewed. I wouldn’t advise anybody to give up their day job, go in debt to get a drone fleet, and expect to make a living at it. My buddy at the river asked if I could come along and map his creek for the neighborhood association’s dredging project, which he’s been anticipating for about ten years so he has access to his dock at all but the lowest tides. I had to say No. They got a certified and insured drone pilot from a town 40 miles away that showed up with a truck full of drones and crew. They spent a couple hours mapping the creek and getting photos of the docks where the channel was going, flew several drones, got really useful imagery, got $900 for the job, sounded fair for both parties to me. I flew planes commercially from 1968 through 1999 and I hope to fly drones til I drop, hope to get gigs, hope to make a buck. That’s what I’m doing, can’t say how effective it’ll be. Thanks for the question, which gave me a chance to think and write about drones, my favorite subject these days.

A ground team take the drone from a hanger, operate it to take off by line of sight (and likewise land the drone after the mission is completed). Once in the air another team many miles away (perhaps thousands) in a “ground control station” take over. The pilot flies it beyond line of sight. by first person view until the mission is complete. At the destination a second person, the operator, controls the camera etc whilst the pilot is flying. A third member of the team acts in an intelligence role and communicates with the chain of command. 2 UAVs at sea I have not seen a detailed account of US Navy tanker drones but I suppose the on-board control station and deck crew act in a similar manner. 3 High altitude pseudo-satellite UAVs Some drones, eg the RAF’s Zephyr can fly for weeks/months. Again I have not seen a detailed account but piloting is probably by GPS with set way points. However, I speculate to suggest the take-off and landing is a) by land crew using line of sight, b) ground station crew, if necessary, and c) finally by GPS.",2021-03-06T11:31:52.511Z,"Do military drone pilots land the large drones manually?

There are plenty of people who will argue either way. It’s probably best to go with a mini-drone or a tiny Whoop class that only weighs a few ounces so you can fly it indoors without tearing up the house until you’ve got the hang of it. I believe it’s easiest to learn from repeated success than it is from repeated crashes, so I recommend a DJI/Ryze Tello with a nice GameSir bluetooth controller and a smartphone. You _can_ fly the Tello with only a smartphone and the Tello app, but the controller working in ‘mode 2’, not ‘headless’, makes it easier to control the drone precisely than rubbing your thumbs on the phone’s smooth surface. The little Tello has a good gyro and altimeter, plus it’s got ‘downward vision’ sensors so it will hover in place if there’s enough light for it to perceive texture or objects under the drone. If you want to move on to camera drones, there’s none better than a $399 Mavic Mini, or if you’ve got plenty of money, get a Mavic Platinum or Mavic 2. These are all GPS and vision stabilized, easy to fly, so you can focus on the camera and get video or photos. If you want to move on to FPV racing drones, get nice FatShark goggles, a small & almost indestructible beginner model like an EMAX TinyHawk II, and a good controller like a Taranis QX7. Take care to get advice and choose a controller that will let you move up to a larger racer when you’re ready to move outdoors, like an EMAX BabyHawk or full-sized Hawk if you’re brave. A TinyHawk weighs a couple of ounces and has ducted props so it can crash lots without damage. The larger racing drones things are crazy powerful, can be lethal flying off at 70mph from a bounce or any klutz, and they’re wicked hard to fly. All this makes them entirely immersive and very satisfying to fly. With a racing drone there’s no time to focus on a camera except the FPV from the drone. The goggles can record video from the trainer or racer that’s very entertaining, but nothing like the high-quality you get from a camera drone. It’s not legal to fly a racing drone with FPV goggles off your property without an observer, so that can be limiting if you’re not in a group or don’t have a buddy who’ll keep the drone in sight. Camera drones can be flown anywhere that’s not restricted so you can go fly on your own. Drones weighing more than 250 grams need to be registered before you fly them off your property. The Mavic Mini weighs in at 249 grams so doesn’t require registration. For the time-being, it’s easy to register for recreational use. You check off a list of safety regulations, pay $5, and download a certificate of registration with a number to put on your drones. Soon, any day now, the FAA will require passing a tougher test to certify recreational pilots, so you might want to register sooner than later to avoid the test. Whatever you fly you’ve got to follow the regulations, be aware of restricted airspace, and keep your drone in sight. Check out the FAA Drone Zone for more: FAADroneZone. Drone regulations and the FAA’s air traffic control systems are changing to accommodate ‘delivery drones’ and other autonomous drone operations beyond visual line of sight. Part of this is ‘positive id’ and after the new systems are phased in over a three year period, drones that aren’t equipped to fly with the new systems will be restricted to flying within a few hundred feet of the operator.

I won’t be trying to make a living at it, but would be happy to earn what I can. It looks like a lot of drone pilots are older geeks like me with lots of drones, and a some of them are younger, have a drone, enjoy it, and want to make a living at it. I think it’s tough to find enough work with a drone to make a good living, and I sure wouldn’t recommend going into debt to get a fleet big enough so you can go out and work a day and sign up for a commercial liability policy as soon as you get your 107 certificate. Of the commercial certificates that have been issued since the regulation went into effect a few years ago, only about 20% have been renewed. That might be a good indicator of how hard it is to find contract work? My nephew-in-law was a well-paid engineer with an energy company. He was traveling around with a contract drone pilot and surveyors mapping and inspecting pipe and power lines and surveying. One day he showed up at a family gathering with a brand-new Phantom his work had given him. He pulled it out of the box, charged it up, read the instructions, and by dinner time he’d figured out how to fly it and got spectacular videos with the 14 latest grandkids, 4 generations of family. Within a couple weeks, he’d boned up on the 107 test, passed it the first time, and now he’s got a fleet of Phantoms including the RTK version and a GPS system. Now, he’s better paid and loves flying his Phantoms, is wanting to get an Inspire that can loft a gas cloud detector… He still travels around the eastern US, but now there’s no need for the commercial drone pilot so he goes with surveyors if he’s making a ‘map’, but by hisself most of the time. I think a lot of companies are doing this, getting their employees certified and giving them drones to go along with their jobs. Skydio and others are putting together systems that will launch from a construction trailer and fly an inspection autonomously, as often as he wants, cutting out the contract drone pilot that used to show up a time or two a week and get progress videos and maps. There’s a special path for certification of government workers, first-responders, engineers, and park supervisors. The park manager who first offered me a job after he suggested I go map a new 80-acre park under construction, and I did it, now has the certificate and travels with a Mavic 2 in his truck, doesn’t need me or a contractor. To answer your question, I think it’s like anything else that requires some technical skills. If you can find the right situation or develop good clientele it’s good.

It’s included as part of the re-fitting of our ancient Air Traffic Control systems for enroute, approach, tower, and departure. Some of the components are actually first-generation systems that have been in place since the 40s and 50s. They were built to be redundant and reliable, they were, and the ARTCC is the world’s largest user of vacuum tubes. The radar sail in the middle of our fair city’s international flying field is the same one I taxied past with my father in his Bonanza in the late ‘50s… Some of the articles I’ve seen say that the new traffic control system will be able to handle piloted aircraft, autonomous delivery and survey drones, and commercial space ports. So, if somebody’s got the budget to launch some kind of drone into orbit, my bet is the FAA will be there to facilitate it and certify it if it’s safe. The FAA has already rolled out the LAANC Low Altitude Authorization and Notification system for commercial and serious recreational pilots get clearance into controlled airspace around airports. As soon as the tech and protocols are decided for drone traffic management, we’ll see them built into drones, then we’ll see where it works best or not at all.

As I’ve never operated predators, global hawks or other military drones I can’t be totally sure but the fact that they are operated from half a world away from their actual locations suggests to me that due to latency and other issues they may not always be flown “hands on” and the flight may be somewhat automated with the operator entering in commands but an on-board flight computer handling the control surface inputs. I am open to being corrected here. Flying civilian / commercial drones is somewhat different as it’s done in real time and hands on. I need to point out that the majority of drones are multirotors and the flight experience will not translate to manned aircraft. There are however fixed wing drones and the flight mechanics are pretty well the same. I’ve been an FAI certified radio controlled instructor for about 30 years with fixed wing and space (rocketry) endorsement and I am also a C.A.S.A. certified remote pilot for both multirotor and fixed wing. I have thousands of hours flying radio controlled fixed wing models, some almost up to the size of actual aircraft although not of the same weight. I can fly all modes, and Mode 2 which I fly by preference is the same control input as on a manned aircraft for the most part. Rudder is on the left stick instead of on the floor but otherwise identical. While there are some experiences of manned flight that are missing when flying aero models there are also some skills needed that manned pilots do not generally need, in particular because of the unique perspective you get from being on the ground controlling an aircraft aloft, if that aircraft is flying towards you, or worse still, inverted and towards you then you soon learn to instinctively respond to the requirements for reversed, flipped or unusual control inputs. So, as a Aero modeller I learned control inputs and controlled flight. and I’ve been doing that for decades. As a commercial drone pilot with an aeronautical radio operators certification I learned everything a private pilot will learn in the way of procedures, aviation law. flight mechanics, holding and approach patterns, meteorology, risk assessment, threat and error management etc. The reason I had to learn the whole pilot theory thing is that at my level of drone licence (about as high as you go) I can and do fly within the movement area of aerodromes, military aviation areas etc. I need to have a knowledge of what the manned pilots can, will or might do to be able to safely share the airspace and know how to talk with them and ATC. So, now to the point. I have a personal friend of many years who shall remain unnamed to protect the guilty who has been upgrading to extra endorsements on his licence over the years. Apart from the theory and courses he must complete, sometimes what is required is simply extra logged flight hours with certain configurations. Often he has invited me out with him because he knows I just love anything flight related. We share the hire cost of the aircraft and from my second flight with him onwards after being taught the binnacle layout and where the instruments and controls where I have performed many many takeoffs, landing and a lot of flight time on the controls when he and I are alone. He gives me input on trim, flaps, rotation and landing speeds and other variables as needed of course. Essentially he tells me what’s needed on that airframe and under the conditions in play if I don’t know it already. Before anyone gets too upset, learners usually get hands on controls on their first flight and pilots often give family members some tuition. It’s not that rare and if I have the slightest doubt (or he does) I relinquish control immediately. I haven’t pranged us yet or even come close to it and it was not hard. That’s the long answer The short answer is, I have no idea with military drones but with certified civilian drone pilots past a certain point yes, the experience does translate to some degree.

If you poke around Rupprecht Drones there’s enough on-line for free to study for the exam, or he’s got good courses if you want it spoon-fed to you. Gold Seal gets good reviews: Remote Pilot Ground School You need a fleet of drones suitable for what you’ll be doing. Both the commercial pilots I’ve seen show up for work, one to survey about 80 acres of wetlands for a dredging project and the other for a wedding, had what looked like $10,000++ of kit to work with and that’s the kind of investment I’ve got in my fleet. It’s not something you can make any money at with one drone and a few batteries. I’ve got Mavic Pro Platinums, Mavic 2s, Inspires, a couple of Typhoons I keep for their cheap thermal sensors, and Mavic Minis and FPV drones to play with. If I was starting today, I think I’d have the Mavic 2s and wouldn’t need anything else for work. I like the Inspires because they’re big and badass looking and sounding, but their battery life is short, and the Mavic 2s can do everything they can do except loft a ZenMuse X5, which is a really nice camera with big optics and sensor, but I don’t need the really nice camera much. You’ll probably want an account with DroneDeploy or UgCS, or put together a server for OpenDroneMap, since lots of jobs will involve inspections or surveys. DroneDeploy does a good Roof Report, UgCS will scan a facade or tower for you. Mission planning/piloting software like Litchi is good to become familiar with. I wouldn’t suggest going into debt to buy a fleet and quitting your regular job expecting to get rich. Of all the commercial remote pilots certificates issued long enough ago to expire, only something less than 20% have been renewed. It looks like to me that lots of commercial drone pilots are like me, semi-retired, and maybe added the remote pilot endorsement to an ancient commercial pilot certificate — mine was issued in 1968. And, lots of companies are getting their employees certified and giving them a fleet of drones. My nephew is a field engineer/surveyor who used to hire drone pilots to meet him wherever he was headed. Last year he showed up at a family reunion with a brand-new Phantom 4 Pro, unboxed it, and got good drone shots of the clan.

I’m an elder geek, a commercial pilot who’s been following aviation regulations for much of my life. My opinion is that the regulations for drones and where they can be flown as reasonable and key to safely sharing the skies with piloted aircraft. The most violent responses I’ve gotten in person or on-line have been when pointing out the regulations to some drone pilot who doesn’t share my opinion of the regulations and who’s bent on ignoring them. Drone pilots have differing opinions of DJI, who for the time-being is the #1 manufacturer of drones. DJI’s drones do ‘geofencing’ so that they need an authorization from the FAA to fly in restricted airspace. My opinion is that this is a good idea and if I need to use LAANC or other means to gain authorization I’ll do it as part of the prep to go fly. A lot of other drone pilots don’t share this opinion. One of the most-asked questions on DJI and other drone forums, Quora, or Redditt is ‘I want to fly in this restricted airspace, how do I turn geofencing off?’ One of the most expressed opinions is that DJI is crap because of geofencing and that’s probably why Autel EVO has any market share at all. My opinion is all in favor of the Positive ID features that are being rolled out and will be built into more and more camera drones. I don’t care if somebody can see my drones Id on their smartphone with a DJI app and I see where these capabilities will let authorities quickly sort out good and evil drones in an area. Other pilots disagree with Positive ID and vow to defeat it. I agree that a recent $20,000 fine was just punishment for some idiot who flew his drone off a balcony of his hotel room in Las Vegas, lost control of it, and it drifted for 20 minutes or so until it landed next to a Jet at the nearby airport. Everything about his flight was illegal from the second he left the balcony near the top of his hotel.

Things are changing but I think a Yuneec Typhoon H at $700 + a CGO-ET camera for it at $1700 might be the lowest-priced for decent, low-resolution thermal images plus a HD low-light camera. It puts out a video file with two ‘tracks’ so you can lay the thermal image over the low-light. And, it lets you choose from a few color models for the thermal image and lock them down. It can pick out dogs and their walkers in the woods from 200 feet, and catch them at when they come out of the woods across a couple soccer fields. It might have some role in search and rescue… Parrot makes a cheap thermal solution. They take a $400 Bebop 2, stick a cheap $300 FLIR on the back end, and sell it for $1500. When you want to get thermal imagery, the FreeFlight Thermal app flips the Bebop around 180 degrees and switches to the FLIR. You can’t get visual and thermal images at the same time. I don’t recommend it to anybody, sold mine on eBay in a bundle with a Bebop, batteries, and controller, with a disclaimer that the Bebop Thermal was a Mickey Mouse rig, and it got bid up to $1100 for the whole kit. Mavic 2 Dual, at something like $2,700 looks promising, and I might be saving up for one if I need a better thermal solution. It looks like anything with more resolution or the kind of features that engineers need to see is kinda $5,000 + for the thermal sensor and a couple or few thousand for the drone that hefts it into the sky. A few times in the past year I’ve seen articles about the lowering prices on ‘multi spectral’ sensors that help with crop analysis, mining, or other solutions. LIDAR sensors have been tens of thousands of $, but recently there are some articles that look like they’ll be an option for 3d mapping at lower cost in a year or two. Light’s only one thing drones can sense. If you want to do thermal, get a thermal sensor.

This information packet will include a unique pilot identifier, speed, altitude, the drone's GPS location, and the location of the pilot on the ground. Depending on whether the FAA mandates a broadcast or a network model (or perhaps allows both,) there will be a historical record of this information - originally proposed to be kept for six months. A network model would be based on a cellular connection from the ground station to the local cell network. A broadcast model would be based on a Bluetooth and WiFi squawk from the aircraft that could be monitored in real-time by local law enforcement and any civilian with the right app for their phone. It is a very complex issue with any number of controversial components - when the FAA issued their Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in December 2019, they received over 53,000 comments on various aspects of the rule. In the original NPRM, the proposal was that all of the flight data would be monitored in near real-time.

The short answer is that both are happening. To me at least, there are three basic factors that normally will go into deciding how to support a given type of business activity with small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS, AKA “drones”): How often the need for sUAS is likely to arise in the course of normal day-to-day operations. There’s a fairly healthy part of the unmanned sector that serves limited-duration or occasional customers of aerial photography and similar services, such as real estate agents, business developers, insurance adjusters and the like. They rent out their services, fly where they’re asked (or explain why they aren’t allowed to in certain areas), do their job, and invoice the work on a per-operation basis.How far away the day-to-day work of a given business enterprise is from aviation activity that might support it. For example, many law enforcement agencies have had (manned) aviation operations for years, while many others - especially those with large, predominantly rural jurisdictions to cover but limited funds with which to do so - have craved them. sUAS has been a game-changer for the latter, and the simplest and best model for them seems to be having sworn law enforcement and other public safety officers train up as drone pilots. (See Home for a discussion of these types of operations.)The extent to which company-specific flying operations might require full-time versus contracted-out pilots to meet the commercial need. Often, it is knowledgeable employees who develop the business case for their employers showing the likely benefits to business, paths to making a good return on investment, etc. Those are the folks who truly understand the linkage between the main thrust of the business and how a drone or drones might enhance its success, and often are the best ones to do the actual flying.There are a couple of associated considerations that come into the mix as well, including: Insurance costs;Training, licensing, procurement and maintenance costs; and,The cost of having someone on the payroll who does something different from everyone else, or who can’t contribute the same level of work as they used to in their primary area of expertise if they have to take a chunk of time out of their normal work day to fly a drone around.So, it’s really almost impossible to say which businesses might use outsiders versus employees. As a rule of thumb, I suspect that the smaller a business, the less likely they might be to operate their own drone, at least for the time being, but I’m not familiar with any non-proprietary studies or surveys that might support (or refute) that opinion.",2021-03-06T12:41:51.999Z,"Do most companies hire or outsource drone pilots for commercial drone applications or just figure it out among their current employees?

I’m an elder geek, a commercial pilot who’s been following aviation regulations for much of my life. My opinion is that the regulations for drones and where they can be flown as reasonable and key to safely sharing the skies with piloted aircraft. The most violent responses I’ve gotten in person or on-line have been when pointing out the regulations to some drone pilot who doesn’t share my opinion of the regulations and who’s bent on ignoring them. Drone pilots have differing opinions of DJI, who for the time-being is the #1 manufacturer of drones. DJI’s drones do ‘geofencing’ so that they need an authorization from the FAA to fly in restricted airspace. My opinion is that this is a good idea and if I need to use LAANC or other means to gain authorization I’ll do it as part of the prep to go fly. A lot of other drone pilots don’t share this opinion. One of the most-asked questions on DJI and other drone forums, Quora, or Redditt is ‘I want to fly in this restricted airspace, how do I turn geofencing off?’ One of the most expressed opinions is that DJI is crap because of geofencing and that’s probably why Autel EVO has any market share at all. My opinion is all in favor of the Positive ID features that are being rolled out and will be built into more and more camera drones. I don’t care if somebody can see my drones Id on their smartphone with a DJI app and I see where these capabilities will let authorities quickly sort out good and evil drones in an area. Other pilots disagree with Positive ID and vow to defeat it. I agree that a recent $20,000 fine was just punishment for some idiot who flew his drone off a balcony of his hotel room in Las Vegas, lost control of it, and it drifted for 20 minutes or so until it landed next to a Jet at the nearby airport. Everything about his flight was illegal from the second he left the balcony near the top of his hotel. Others disagree, with the opinion that the pilot ‘made a mistake’, where my opinion is that he wontonly broke the rules and he and his ilk make it difficult for rule-abiding drone pilots… Lots of people have the opinion that it’s fine to shoot a drone from the sky. My opinion is that a duck-hunter who shot down a properly registered and lawfully operated Inspire 2 with a Zenmuse X7 got off easy with a big fine and something like $17,000 restitution to the drone pilot for his lost rig and revenue…",2021-03-06T12:42:17.877Z,"Do drone pilots feel as if they are making a difference?

It’s true that in last 20 years, there have been significant developments and we can see the result today. Drones are very crucial especially for today’s asymmetric warfare and will be increasing in the future. They’ve enormous benefits - long range surveillance & targeting. Some of the missions they perform can’t be effectively done so by manned aircraft and they’re also economical. In terms of fighter aircraft, the biggest problem of a human pilot is that he can sustain only a limited G Force (~9 G). The airframe can often sustain a lot more but is restricted with software control. This means that the aircraft can perform much hard manoeuvres if there wasn’t a human pilot inside. In Air Combat, this obviously has big advantage. So will drones replace fighter aircraft/pilots ? No. Drones will be increasing in the future but they will never be replacing fighter aircraft or the pilots (atleast not any time soon). One simple reason is lag. If you build an unmanned fighter aircraft - it still needs to be controlled by a human pilot if you want it for Air Combat. The signal transmission (data) from a drone to a pilot (sitting thousands of miles away) via satellites take some amount of time and in response the transmission from that pilot to the drone takes some time. Thus, there is a time lag (no matter how small). Such a time lag is fatal in Air Combat, when you need to make both decisions & actions in seconds. Apart from this, there are all kinds of signal availability issue. With the increased in EW, the enemy can simply jam the signal transmission making the drone incapable of performing the mission. This is not something that requires huge infrastructure - with decent knowledge & moderate equipment anyone can do so. Using AI in Combat is limited, they can be used (rather are being used) but there is a limit. It’s technically & ethically not possible to completely remove a human pilot - irrespective of whether you’re launching a hell fire missile on a ground target or a AMRAAM on an aircraft. So don’t worry, you can easily become a pilot if you want to. Human pilots will never be outdated - rather they’ll be constantly updated to integrate with technology for simplifying their missions. :) The future is a broad term.

A lot has already been said regarding the strengths and weaknesses of drones, both in concept and in our current reality, and plenty of opinions have been given on whether manned or unmanned planes have an edge. Instead, let’s look at what could help improve the capabilities of a remotely piloted drone (what I will from now on call an RPD) and how one may want to deploy it. This is an answer looking at the wider picture of modern air-to-air combat, and what roles drones can or might be effective in during an air campaign. A bit tangental, but I think it helps put other answers here in a wider context, and may help you appreciate the environment modern (and near-future) fighters operate in. The era of mono-e-mono air combat is slowly fading, as air superiority campaigns are becoming much more complex. First, this question is about a drone that is piloted remotely, NOT a fully autonomous UAV. Many people in the answers are either talking about the latter or conflating the two, which is a bit confusing, and that isn’t the question. So I want to make it explicitly clear that when I’m talking about RPDs, I’m not talking fully-autonomous drones, but rather planes piloted by humans who are not in the aircraft. In real life, UAVs are piloted drones and are not fully autonomous, but for the sake of avoiding the conflation of the term “UAV” with “fully-autonomous drone”, I am going to refer to this pilot-drone system as a Remotely Piloted Drone (RPD). Now that that horse is properly tenderized, let’s run down a quick pro-con list for RPDs: Pros: -No squishy human means no need to cater to squishy human needs, like avoiding high-G maneuvers, cabin pressurization and oxygen, ejector seat, safety gear, etc. This gives the added benefit of potentially reduced size (or an increased weapons/fuel capacity), and that putting a place for the pilot won’t be factored in when considering aerodynamic design. -No squishy human means no squishy human family is sad when their fellow squishy human gets shot down. Additionally, lack of squishy human death means that the military does not need to train up another one, and that a pilot can learn from otherwise fatal errors. -Lack of squishy human death allows for drones and RPDs to be deployed into higher-risk situations. Cons: -Potential lack of situational awareness. Certainly nowadays the situational awareness of any RPD pilot is deficient for a close-in dogfighting situation, and to a lesser (but still important) extent in Beyond Visual Range (BVR). This lack of situational awareness could also potentially result in higher rates of friendly fire during Within Visual Range (WVR) combat, as identifying aircraft may or may not be more difficult to do. -Having to operate the craft wirelessly. Not only does this result in lag as many people pointed out, but the signal could also be jammed or otherwise interfered with. Wireless drones can also be hacked and control usurped from the pilot. These last two, of course, depend on the technical capabilities of the enemy in question. -Psychology. I’m surprised that no one I saw commented on this, but the psychology of flying a warplane remotely is quite different to flying a manned warplane. Many RPD pilots today have serious mental health issues, as they are often stationed here in the US and can commute from home every day. This leads to them having a serious, surreal disconnect between their active participation in warfare during the day and quiet civilian life during the night. This often takes a serious mental toll on RPD pilots. Others see their job in a very disconnected way, likening their profession to playing video games all day. This, of course, has serious implications in warfare, especially if air-to-air combat becomes primarily drone-based, which kind of segues into my next point: RPD pilots are not in a real life-or-death situation, which may make them more careless and likely to make mistakes. A “fatal” error isn’t here, and so the imperative to perform to your best in combat is reduced in that regard. So, with all of this said, let’s think about a hypothetical scenario where RPDs are now active in air-to-air combat. What might this future look like? Simulated cockpits: For true and pure air-superiority fighters like the F-22 Raptor, there really is nothing comparable to actually being there in the cockpit when it comes to situational awareness, response time, and activating your fight-or-flight response. Currently, RPDs are piloted from computer stations like this one:  This isn’t even close to the real thing, and wouldn’t be sufficient for a BVR encounter, much less a dogfight. In order to reach performance closer to in-person pilots, the military may turn to technology similar to their current air combat training simulators, albeit with major design overhauls.  First, I think that the computer graphics would be supplanted by camera systems on-board the drone that would live-feed back to the pilot’s simulation. Other changes could include employment of virtual or augmented reality helmets for full immersion and HUD features, haptic feedback to simulate modest G-forces, and possibly full gyroscopic motion for the simulator to allow it to turn completely upside-down. All of this would increase the immersion and situational awareness of the pilot, as well as help counteract the cognitive dissonance that comes with simulation (like if your eyes are telling you that you are upside-down, but your body feels right-side-up). It wouldn’t be perfect, but it is certainly a step up from current technology. It would also speed up and smooth out the training/retraining process for new recruits and formerly-manned-plane pilots. For new recruits, they wouldn’t have to get used to the switch from simulator to real plane; for pilots going from real plane to drone simulator, the transition may be less awkward or jarring since some of the real life aspects are still there. Local Air Superiority: The closer the drone is to the pilot, the less lag there is. If RPDs prove to be more capable then their manned counterparts, but their lag time is a limiting factor, RPDs could be very useful as short range fighters and interceptors, specialized as defensive units that can deploy to areas of high strategic importance, like a highly-industrialized region of a nation or near an important sector of the frontline. This specialization would mean they would require less fuel and thus less fuel capacity, allowing for the size and cost of the plane to be reduced, or for the freed-up weight and space to be used for other purposes like weapons or electronic warfare suites. Space Planes: Space is already dangerous enough without having people shooting at you. Space debris, anti-satellite weaponry, nuclear detonations, the threat of burning up in the atmosphere, and the general lack of oxygen in space will make this realm of one of the most dangerous for a pilot to fight in. An alternative may be to not have a pilot up there at all. Unmanned spaceplanes could have several, very useful advantages: First, every kilogram put into space costs a lot. The cost to put 1 kilogram of stuff into space to this day is still pretty expensive, at least several thousand dollars, if not tens of thousands (depending on the rocket and where it’s going). Single Stage To Orbit spaceplanes should, hypothetically, cut this cost by a lot, but if the average pilot weighs 90 kilograms, we’re talking somewhere in the range of tens of thousands to millions of dollars per flight, depending on if the plane is SSTO or not. Getting rid of the pilot not only gets rid of his weight, but also all the fuel that would otherwise be needed to get him into space, and the fuel needed to get that fuel into space isn’t needed either (I know, rocket science is weird and recursive. It’s literally rocket science). Point is, fuel and money are saved. Second, both pilots and spaceplane engines need oxygen. Though not all spaceplanes are being designed with them (see Skylon and SABRE engines), many designs have adopted Super Combustion ramjet engines (or SCRAMJET) as their primary method of thrust. Now, I’m not going to pretend like I understand how this all works, but suffice it to say that SCRAMJETs don’t work out of atmosphere. The solution is to bring the atmosphere with you, in this case by having an on-board oxygen supply to feed to the engines. Of course, humans need oxygen as well, so some of the potential air supply has to be taken up for life support. No pilot, no need, so more oxygen or other fuel could be put here instead. The lag time would be more pronounced, but the nature of orbital mechanics makes any combat in that theater slower and more deliberate, meaning that response time is not as important as in conventional air-to-air combat. Situational awareness is also easier to obtain. Missile Trucks: The B1-R Rockwell Lancer variant is, among other things, designed to carry a “holy crap” number of air-to-air missiles (AAMs). It can ripple fire them (i.e. fire a bunch in quick succession), and can work in pairs or trios to launch large salvos of AAMs against enemy formations. They are also lacking stealth capabilities and are pretty damn big. This makes them something every enemy wants to shoot down. The Lancer is designed for speed so that, if an enemy starts gunning for them, they can outrun their pursuers, buuuut… I’m fairly confident that Lancer pilots would feel a bit better if they weren’t actually in the firing line. Just in case. While missile trucks aren’t fighters, they are air-to-air weapons platforms, so I’m counting them here.  High-Risk Missions: I would expect even the most grizzled, tough-as-nails, Top-Gunniest sunnova bitch in the whole Flying Corps would be a little nervous having to fly a fourth-generation aircraft into range of a hostile integrated air defense system with an enemy air force flying combat air patrols in the sector. That is, unless he doesn’t actually have to do it. I think it’s important to note the importance of ground forces in air campaigns nowadays. Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) are becoming more popular across the world as top-of-the-line fighter planes get continuously more expensive to buy and maintain. An F-22 Raptor 5th generation stealth jet has a unit cost of $150 million. If you are most nations, your entire military budget is less than $6 billion, meaning that for most nations, buying just 10 Raptors would be at least 25% of your entire defense budget for that year. And that’s just for purchase, not plane, hanger, airfield, etc maintenance, crew training and salary, fuel, weapons, and all the other expenses an air force requires. Often it is much more cost-effective to purchase ground-based anti-air weapons, and if the right weapons are positioned in the right way you can build the so-called IADS, which is basically a brick wall put up in front of any enemy air force trying to attack you. It is, of course, an exclusively defensive system, but if you are Syria and Israel has obliterated your expensive air force on multiple occasions in the past with relative ease, an IADS will make more sense to you. Any craft without stealth capabilities is in serious danger if flying into an IADS umbrella. Even now, if the US wanted to launch an air campaign in Syria we would take heavy casualties and lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets. In these types of conditions, it’s no wonder the Air Force loves stealth so much. But ghosting through a wall isn’t the only option. You can also keep hammering it under it falls down. Enter the drone. Less expensive than a manned counterpart, drones can be affordable losses, and, with large numbers, can achieve through brute force the same destruction as a high-tech force in less time. Drones can also be launched into still-functioning IADS’s if the need is there, without worrying about losing the pilot. One way fighter-on-fighter combat may occur in these conditions is if a bomber force needs to hit a target, but enemy fighters are patrolling the area. In this case, sending in drone fighters as expendable cannon fodder and screening forces is preferable to sending in their human equivalents. Autonomous Drone Wings: The US military is currently working towards integrating all of their forces’ communication and information systems. At current, this can be exemplified in the air with the synergy between fighter wings, AWACS planes, air-refueling tankers, and various information-collecting systems and platforms. A smaller-scale version of this could manifest in the form of RPDs working in tandem with semi- or fully-autonomous drones. It could, for example, allow a situation where three autonomous drones are able to use a dedicated Electronic Warfare RPD’s onboard systems to make decisions or be guided by the RPD pilot. Alternatively, each drone’s weapons could be slaved to the RPD, and the formation used in a similar fashion to a missile truck. An RPD may be better for this role since the pilot’s space could be replaced with an EW suite, and since the RPD may get in the firing line. Another option, since apparently the US Navy is run by comic book villains, is for RPDs to carry payload of LOCUST drones as part of a distraction or screening force. More info about the LOCUST program here: LOCUST Launcher Fires A Swarm Of Navy Drones The TL;DR of all of this is that remotely piloted drones can, with further development, be deployed as supporting and auxiliary forces during air-to-air campaigns. Their disadvantages may not allow them to totally take over manned aircraft so long as enemy forces are using manned planes of their own, but they can definitely play a large role in future air warfare.

Some company prefer dealing with a corporate/company entity as it gave credibility as well as able to issue receipt with VAT. However setting up a company bring in costs and trouble such as setup fee, book keeping, and taxes. I won’t suggest to setup one until your profit is high enough for tax incentive or that setting up one will bring in more customers.Before we can answer which to focus: time, scalability, profitablity, team size, which niche?, We have to find out our current situation. What are our weaknesses and strengths, and most importantly where do we lack that can bring in more businesses so we can find partners or find ways to tackle those problems. For example if we already establish a good marketing/distribution channels, we might lack the resources (team) to provide enough services to demand. Hence expanding the team would be ideal however the next question is which model? Hiring, Partnering/Collaboration, Outsourcing, etc. There are pros/cons but if the jobs are constant and surely in demand for years to come, then consider hiring.After we already know the weakness and strength, we would know more of situation, then setup a priority and see which is the most critical for your business.

Mine is at best translucent, but I'll take a swing anyway. I'm going to start from an unexpected direction, namely, the US military's ambivalent attitude toward the combat rescue mission itself.  To a certain extent, a dedicated search and rescue arm has always been part of the implied promise to combat pilots that somebody will come after them if they go down in enemy territory.  This proposition was formally institutionalized in the 1960s through the creation of the Air Force's Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service (now ""Air Rescue Service"").   Rescue itself survived a series of body blows in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including (1) the presumed lethality of a central European battlefield leading to alternate rescue/recovery concepts; (2) the end of the ""local base rescue"" mission, which resulted in the shutdown of one third of all Rescue detachments in about an 18 month period; and (3) the failure of higher headquarters to ensure the deployment of a single combat rescue unit to the Persian Gulf during DESERT SHIELD/STORM in 1990 and 1991, leading to the rare shootdown mission being carried out by Special Operations forces, who don't like doing that kind of snap-response launch. Plans to modernize the helicopter fleet (delayed in the late 1980s by the need to re-program money for C-17 procurement) were scaled back sharply in the 1990s.  The venerable HH-3E ""Jolly Green Giant"" fleet was retired, as were single-engine UH-1F and UH-1H helicopters still retained as ""rescue"" assets.  Only a handful of combat rescue missions (as opposed to aeromedical missions flown under combat conditions) have been flown in almost twenty years.  The last Special Operations MH-53J PAVE LOW helicopters have long since been boneyarded, leaving a handful of aging HH-60 PAVE HAWKs to try to go anywhere they're needed... the very definition of a ""high demand/low density"" (HD/LD) resource. The controversy stems from steadily decreasing interest in these budget-constrained times in investing in the mission itself, as well as who should own it (a ""roles and missions"" food fight I won't dignify with additional comment).  Following multiple efforts to launch an acquisition program for modern rescue helicopters, the can has been kicked on several occasions with various dodges, including ""Special Ops can do it,"" ""The V-22 tilt rotor can do it,"" and so forth.   To me, the real issue is whether or not anybody really believes in the need for the capability any more.  We haven't fought anywhere that we haven't had massive air superiority for more than a generation, and it's not nearly as much a ""fighter pilot Air Force"" as it used to be.  I believe that nobody will ever have the gumption to step up and say, ""Shut down Rescue."" Rather, they're going to basically starve it of capability and talent until it's even more of a shell than it already is, then scream, moan and demand improvisation if and when our flyers wind up going in harm's way somewhere in the future where ejection is likely to mean capture, torture and death (again). Okay -- end of rant.  However, the reason I spent the time laying this foundation is to make the bald statement that I find it highly unlikely that anyone would invest in an unmanned recovery aircraft of any type unless it had lots of uses beyond that one mission.  There are a few airframes out there that easily could be pressed into such service with little modification -- the Fire Scout and unmanned K-MAX variant spring to mind -- but they'd require a LOT of reliability testing to entrust them (and their remote pilots) with human lives as cargo, and their employment in the rescue mission would require a whole command and control structure to be developed that would be able to employ them in a timely and effective manner... just like Rescue has and needs today. There's also the little question of a pilot's willingness to climb into an aircraft lacking another pilot (or any ability for him/her to fly it themselves), not to mention the probable need to still have highly skilled, well-armed pararescue specialists (aka ""PJs"") aboard to treat injuries and fight off bad guys during the pick-up itself.   In all honesty, the business case seems hard enough to make in the current climate as it is; trying to build a combat rescue capability that differs little from today's model with the exception of using unmanned instead of manned aircraft seems to me to be a virtually impossible sell.",2021-03-06T12:50:18.075Z,"What is the future of downed pilot rescue in the age of drones?

Only some drones were truly autonomous.  Autonomous recon drones were used in Vietnam to gather intelligence where it was felt too dangerous to send manned fighters. Modern drones are actually piloted aircraft.  Just flown from the ground.   Drone technology requires a high technology base to support effectively.  Or at least at the level of combat and military use.  You need advanced, secure, long range communications.  Resistance to tampering.  Advanced computer technology to support flight operations and drone control laws.  A highly educated and trained drone pilot force.  And for drones meant to carry significant loads in sensors and weapons, pretty advanced manufacturing capability. But the advantage as you describe.  In a hypothetical drone configured for air-to-air or air-to-ground combat, the removal of the pilot from the environment confers many advantages.  That weight is saved in life support systems and instrumentation.  That in turn lifts the artificial G-limits a pilot imposes on modern combat airframes. The downside is sensors.  We haven't quite developed the sensors to create fully synthetic 360 degree virtual cockpit to  allow drone pilots a high fidelity experience of being in the drone when they are not.  I don't think that technology is very far away given dedicated work.  All of the pieces are there now.  I envision a slaved stereo camera combined with traditional radar, IR, threat warning sensors as we fit today to manned aircraft.  Stick our drone pilot in a cockpit base or VR type HD helmet mounted display in a facility and I think as long as you have the bandwidth and low latency communications, you have a true manned fighter replacement.  While these technical challenges are daunting and difficult, I do believe the F-18E/F/G and F-22/F-35 will be the last manned fighters the US will deploy as front-line combat aircraft.  Once you get full virtual sensor fusion, the advantage of drone forces will outweigh the tradition of a man or woman in the cockpit.  Because they still will be.  Just not in the air. We got a taste of what a drone air-to-air capability might look like.  Back in the late 1970s.  A lot of people gushing and talking about drones have probably never seen this:   That is the Rockwell HiMAT.  Short for ""Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology"".  It was a modular, half-scale drone designed to explore future aircraft technologies.  See that black triangle on the 'canopy'?  That is the window where the pilot's forward looking camera is that provided their in-flight view.  The HiMAT was built as a drone as it was cheaper and considered too risky to try some of the ideas on full-scale aircraft.  Some were later done in the form of the AFTI F-16 (which demonstrated some of the limits of piloted fighters). The HiMAT is largely a forgotten aircraft as it was a research airplane.  But I've read stuff over the years that indicated the HiMAT was an amazing airplane.  They apparently did do some air-to-air testing with manned fighters and the HiMAT could turn inside them, pull unbelievable G-forces (I had read 12-16G) in the process and outfly anything that it went up against it. Imagine if that technology had been developed into a fully operational piloted drone targeted for air-to-air in the 1980s? The upside of  drone technology, no pilot in danger, is also its major downside.  What happens when you transform the ethics and cost of warfare when it is no longer us sending our sons and daughters to fight and die but equipment built on a production line and no lives at risk?  At least, our lives.  The enemy stills has their soldiers fighting and dying.   This dynamic completely transforms the cost of war.  We don't go to war now because of the political cost of lives at risk.  We consider it carefully.  It is an act of last resort.  With drone technology, that cost and decision point is lowered considerably.  Perhaps politicians will embrace war as a first act because lives are no longer risked for our side.  Who cares about the enemy?  It may make war palatable.  Even acceptable.  It becomes an economic decision.  While still political, the barrier is lowered below the point of traditional resistance. Imagine the world of drone have and have-nots from a combat perspective.  Imagine a war with say China or Russia if the USA could fight it by only have to make the other guy die for their country?  Things that would have gotten US soldiers the Medal of Honor in past conflicts is now simply an unmanned ground combat drone advancing relentlessly on a fortified enemy position.  No heroes or sacrifices.  Just another day at the office.  War would no longer be terrible and we would grow fond of it. It's not to say a drone army and air force would be unstoppable.  Those on the receiving side will likely find low-tech and brute force ways to deal with such forces.  Some may be quite effective.  For example: Broad spectrum jamming to destroy the remote communications.  Break the comlink and drones become little more than expensive, dumb junk.  Manned systems could still function albeit at tremendously reduced effectiveness.  But when the drone army is rendered 100% ineffective, even a 10% effectiveness would win a war.  But rendering such a force ineffective against those who have thought about and developed countermeasures against it happening would be a very uphill battle. The future will be an interesting place.

Pictured: U.S. Army soldier launching an RQ-11 Raven drone. They're small enough to be organically part of the Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) squadron's toolbox, and can fly up to 10km away (up to 15,000 ft above ground level) for nearly an hour and a half. Though it bears resemblance to a remote control toy airplane, this drone is one of the most effective tools in a special operation force's arsenal: being able to see, without being seen.  Drones and Cruise Missiles: they're the same thing; cruise missiles are basically drones with a warhead and (much more simplistic) guidance and navigation systems. The main difference is in how they are used. A cruise missile can only do one thing -- strike its target. It can be reprogrammed to loiter, or select a different target in-flight if necessary. But that's basically all it can do. It's just an expensive, stand-off ranged bomb delivery system. (And in limited numbers -- the U.S. has less than 3500 Tomahawks of all variants remaining in the arsenal, for instance).  This makes sense -- why would you spend money putting any unnecessary equipment into something that is literally intended to destroy itself in a massive fireball, right where the enemy is?   Pictured: AGM-129 ACM Advanced Cruise Missile.  It can fly 2000 miles, has low-observable ""stealth"" capabilities, and can deliver a W-80 nuclear warhead within feet of a chosen target (with yields ranging from 5kt to 150kt. The bomb dropped on Nagasaki was roughly 20kt and killed something like 45,000 people. A single B-52 strategic bomber can carry 12 of these missiles.) and sometimes we forget to take them off the plane. We withdrew this particular model from service in 2012.    A U.S. Navy F/A-18C showing off the AGM-84K SLAM-ER. Aside from having an awesome name (""Slammer""), it's the most accurate missile in the U.S. Navy, with a Circular Error Probability of less than 3 meters, fired from a range of up to 150 miles. (It's on the right outboard wing hardpoint, with the orange fins). It can be redirected in flight if the original target is destroyed; it can perform video comparison of what it sees vs. what it is supposed to be seeing, and it houses more computing power in its navigation system than the entire Apollo space program had.   Further, most cruise missiles must be launched from a very specific set of platforms -- either a bomber like the B-52 or B-1 for larger things like the ACM; or a strike fighter for smaller missiles like the JASSM; or a naval platform for the TLAM. It's hard to hide those kind of things from everybody. Cruise missiles are also very expensive, ranging from mid-hundreds of thousands, to well over $1.5 million U.S. dollars each. For the price of two TLAM (Tomahawks), you can get one reusable MQ-1 Predator; for the price of 10 TLAMs, you can get a reusable MQ-9 Reaper. That means a lot to generals, admirals, and defense budgets. (Don't worry: Lockheed Martin will find a way to suck out every last dollar they can, and then five more.)   Pictured: AGM-158 JASSM (Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile) in flight. It costs $700,000 for the base model, and around $1.3 million for the extended range model. It can fly 230 miles (620 for the extended range version) and carries a 1000lb warhead.  In comparison, an RPA (drone) can provide real-time intelligence and surveillance of a target to operators across the world, without the target ever knowing. It can be as small as something hand-carried by an operator, like the RQ-11 Raven, or as large and completely autonomous as the RQ-4 Global Hawk (pictured below), and be operated by two guys in a trailer on the other side of the planet.    If the RPA is armed, it can then proceed to engage the target with various missiles (such as the Hellfire, shown below being launched by a MQ-1 Predator) or bombs (SDB) with relative impunity and at a FAR cheaper cost than a cruise missile.  And it can be done without military oversight by an intelligence agency.     In summary: It's not the equipment that people have a problem with. It's the way that it is used.   Pictured: AGM-154 JSOW (Joint Stand-Off Weapon) -- this one was fired in Serbia in 1999. Does this look like a cruise missile or a drone? It's neither -- it's a long-range precision bomb, actually, with ""only"" 70 miles range, but roughly 1/4 the cost of the JASSM.  Additionally, I need to point out that the answer from Shayam makes two major mistakes -- first, drones have existed since the 1950's (in fact, they were used extensively for reconnaissance in Vietnam, with ultimately 6 drones being shot down by MiGs during the war). This includes armed drones (UCAVs), such as the QH-50 DASH produced in the thousands in the 1960s to fire torpedos at Soviet attack subs, to the BGM-34A Firebees used in the ""HAVE LEMON"" program, armed with Mavericks and glide bombs in 1971 (with several other armed variants in use throughout the 70's).     Pictured: the Ryan Firebee, a 1970's era UAV/UCAV drone. We equipped these with anti-tank missiles and glide bombs and used them extensively throughout the 70's. We still use them today as aerial targets. This particular one is Israeli.   An AGM-65 Maverick, which was carried on the Firebee drone back in the 1970's, about to obliterate a test tank. This missile is still one of the primary anti-tank missiles in the USAF arsenal.  Second, cruise missiles are used regularly against non-state actors, with Tomahawks having been launched against Al Qaeda in response to the embassy bombings in 1998, against Al Qaeda in Yemen more recently in 2009, and against Islamic State targets in Syria last month. Though, having said all of that, I agree with where Shayam is coming from.   The world famous (infamous) BGM-109 TLAM (Tomahawk Land Attack Missile). This one is a Block IV variant. We've only got around 3,500 of these left, and no more nuclear ones.  It can still fly over 1500 miles, and can deliver the same nuclear warhead as the ACM above.    A QH-50 DASH operating during the Vietnam war. Thousands were produced and armed with torpedoes to counter Soviet attack subs in the 1960's. Probably the first semi-modern UCAV (armed drone)   On the other hand, there's laughably bad answers like Joe Geronimo Martinez's rant against drones, which claims that nobody who lives outside the U.S. can be a terrorist or a threat to the U.S., and that drones have no defensive use (despite not having been armed at all until roughly a decade ago) -- that's the kind of paranoid propaganda that just muddies the argument and does everybody a disservice.

If you remember “The Miracle on the Hudson,” the flight crew that, after both engines had become inoperative from bird strikes, had scant seconds to decide whether they could reach the nearest airport or had to land in the Hudson. They picked the Hudson and there were no fatalities. If they had chosen the airport and didn’t make it, then probably all onboard and potentially many on the ground would have perished. US Airways Flight 1549 - Wikipedia In 1989, a DC-10, Flight 232 suffered an uncontained failure of the engine mounted in the aircraft’s tail. That destroyed the hydraulic system and flight controls and as a result the aircraft was rendered uncontrollable. Except that the two flight crew and another airline pilot that was deadheading, managed to use the asynchronous power from the remaining wing mounted engines to provide some minimal control. From what should have been a completed destruction, they managed to nurse the aircraft to Sioux City Iowa. Of the 296 passengers, 184 survived. United Airlines Flight 232 - Wikipedia In both cases, and many more, it was the Biological Computers (humans) that saved both flights. Since there are NO passengers flying drones it makes more sense to have them either remotely controlled or automated.

What is the actual cost of having someone pilot the plan vs full automation. Is it too much to drive for pilot-less planes? To give you a better comparison, adding a winglet will save a 767ER flight about 4.4%. With 24k gallons fuel capacity, that is around a thousand gallons. A saving of a 1k gallons will be around $1.5 to 2k. On an average, the most experienced pilot with the highest salary will be paid around $150 - 200/hr at 80 hours per month. You don’t need to train the winglets nor pay bonuses or put them in hotels or feed them. While it will cost $1M to install a winglet, I am pretty sure developing a fully autonomous system is a lot more expensive. Automation - planes are pretty much automated right now. The only role of the pilots is to make decisions for things that the computer cannot do.

Just remember that the MQ-9 is bigger on radar than an F-35 which means it’s more vulnerable in highly contested areas. At best it could fly at 300 mph but is realistically going to cruise at 194 mph. An F-35 can supercruise at about Mach 1.2 even though this wasn’t a design goal which means if a time critical target is 200 miles away from an airbase the MQ-9 could conceivably get their in 45 minutes at the fastest or closer to an hour with a full load of 2 500 pound JDAM’s and 4 AGM-114 hellfire missiles.  The F-35 could get there in about 15 minutes with 2 x 2,000 lb JDAM’s and 2 AIM-120’s or 8 Small Diameter Bombs and 2 AIM-120’s. If it does an external load for an environment with less SAM threat (one the MQ-9 would be used in) it could externally carry 4 JDAM/LGB’s (or more depending on mix of 2,000, 500 and SDB’s) along with two internal AIM-120, mix of internal bombs (2–8 depending on size) and then outer pylon IR guided missiles.   Now before arguing about the costs and capabilities to say which is the better option you need to consider the battlefield where you are sending them. In Afghanistan right now the F-35 would be more cost than you would really need. An F-16 and a couple MQ-9’s would be more useful. Against an enemy that has more systems to attempt area denial, then the F-35 would be more useful. And then in between the two sets of systems you have other options and some overlap where either could be used.

There are too many to name but one particular feature, Course Lock, offers a feature similar to the dual controlled Inspires whereby you can control the flight path with just the right stick, i.e., directionality specified by left-stick yaw is not required. Therefore, you can easily rotate the bird (and camera) to create outstanding video while keeping your flight path straight and easy to control. One downside – but now mitigated with the P4 Pro – is the aperture is a fixed F2.8. I wish the P4 standard offered variable aperture. Other than that – go get one – fly it for a while, take some video and you’ll see what a great bird the P4 is. ����4tLU Continue Reading",2021-03-06T13:02:33.527Z,"How does it feel to pilot a drone like phantom 4?

No matter how much science and technology we throw at ourselves that limitation will always exist. A drone designed to, can easily pull maneuvers that would black out or even kill a human pilot if they were to be subjected to the same g-forces.Drones “think” almost instantly. That split second might mean difference between mission success or failure.Drones don’t have “self-preservation”. They get assigned a task and do it. Even if it means that they’ll be lost themselves.The future will be human piloted fighter jets augmented by semi/fully autonomous drone fighters. Mark my words. I am that confident of that future. Everything will be synced in a single seamless networked war machine. Imagine a tiny, stealthy fighter-sized UCAV penetrating deep into hostile territory, way too fast and nimble for AA to intercept, to direct a super-long range anti-ground missile launched from a manned fighter way beyond AA range? That may be a possibility. Fighter pilots in the future will go from dogfighters in the air to aerial RTS players, swiping wings of drones to meet the oppositions wings of drones in the air. Considering that BVR weaponry has made visual-range dogfighting more or less a thing of the past, I don’t expect to see any “dogfighting” as we head into the future anymore between humans. Instead, between drones seems more likely. Boeing Australia is working on the AirPower Teaming System (Loyal Wingman) currently, which is a fighter-sized drone intended for assisting manned fighters with providing a mobile sensor suite for recon ahead of the manned fighters. However, its more than big enough for a large internal weapons bay in exchange for less endurance.",2021-03-06T13:02:54.672Z,"Will there be fighter pilots in 10 years or will drones take over?

It's also almost always the law.  There are also circumstances that occur in flight such as navigation, engine or communication systems failing that pilots practice managing. While they are not routine, these circumstances seem to occur multiple times in a pilot's career. The reaction time to avoid problems can be as short as 5-10 seconds.  It takes practice, skill, intelligence and teamwork to manage those situations safely.  At this point I don't see how a similar level of safety could be achieved for commercial airliners operated as drones. Drones aren't built to fly for 12-16 hours per day, every day, without maintenance issues affecting safety.  They crash relatively often in comparison to commercial airliners  (many times per year - look at the drone crash database which is easy to find via google.)  That doesn't mean that a no-pilot airliner will never occur, but it certainly appears that such aircraft are probably at least 20-30 years into the future.  If you have any doubts talk to a commercial airline pilot about what they practice in the simulator and the major decisions they make every day when flying, and I think you will appreciate that it will be a long time indeed until those decisions can safely be delegated to the aircraft itself or some person on the ground.

Group 4 and 5 UAS - the big boys like Reaper and Global Hawk - have a minimum two-person flight crew of an AVO (Air Vehicle Operator) and MPO (Mission Payload Operator). Some will also have additional AVOs and MPOs on duty, as mission commanders, tactical coordinators, instructors, and so on. There will be technicians to maintain satellite links and help troubleshoot in flight problems, and intelligence specialists to process the accumulated data. AVOs and MPOs either come into RPA/UAS from manned aircraft communities and are thus rated pilots/CSOs/aircrew, or in the USAF, can be selected out of flight school, in which case they’re still considered flight-rated personnel. Flight pay has been a big bone of contention, but the trend for large UAS is to keep them on flight duty orders and continue rating flight pay. Otherwise it’s a big disincentive and keeps talented dudes away. UAS/RPA are required to have current flight physicals and otherwise maintain the same readiness as manned aircrew. Group 3 and below operators are a mixed bag of officers, contractors, reservists, and enlisted. Some of them are considered rated flight crew, others not; depends on the service. 7",2021-03-06T13:12:52.881Z,"Is a military drone generally piloted by one person or a group of people and are these operators considered pilots and do they collect flight pay?

So, since the communication is wireless, anyone with the appropriate antenna can also communicate with the UAS. Obviously, there are security protocols in place to attempt to prevent this from happening, but no system is entirely secure. Manned aircraft are not vulnerable to being taken over by an undesired operator, so this reduces the complexity of control. An arguably even more important reason than security, however, is latency. All forms of communication have some delay between when the information is sent, and when it arrives at its destination. In a contest between a UAS that is being operated from hundreds of miles away and a manned aircraft, all decisions made by the UAS operator will be later than those made by the pilot. So, the UAS will be at a significant disadvantage. Obviously, there are many variables to consider in this situation. UAS do have many advantages not listed here and, most importantly, would not put the operator in danger.

Certainly this wouldn’t be true in certain situations, such as after some sort of mechanical failure or in a situation like a dogfight. Still, my impression is that the typical drone flight is pretty simple from a piloting point of view: “take off from here, fly to this spot, turn the cameras on, circle for 24 hours, fly back and land”. I’d think most military drones would need solid autonomous capabilities just to survive things like the occasional communications outage. While I’m sure the radios on today’s drones are very good, imagine what would happen should there be, say, a power failure at some ground transmission station - I wouldn’t want something the size of a big drone flying in the sky above me if it weren’t capable of finding its way to the ground in the event of some sort of lost communications situation. All that makes the job of the guy on the ground a little less demanding than, say, a Navy fighter pilot flying a mission from a carrier.

(We’ll lump any “hybrid” or the two in here next for reasons that will be made clear.Now lets say you got the latter route, since its what many people seem to advocating for these days. Well, for starters, the director of the Air Force 2030 plan stated himself said this in an article on Scout Warrior “Remotely manned systems present the biggest challenges, as they require a high bandwidth of secure and reliable global communications. This is likely an untenable option for fighting in highly contested space. Even an agile, smart, and self-healing network cannot maintain bandwidth and throughput in the face of raw jamming power projected over short distances.” So, no, not gonna happen. Any sort of platform that cannot devise a plan and carry out said plan without needing comms with any sort of directing force is out of the question. When full scale combat does erupt, the amount of white noise up at 30,000 feet is going be unseen. You might as well be flying with a blindfold. As for the first option, yes, there are AI out there that can deal with basic combat situations extremely effectively. BUT, and this is a big but, until the general public is okay with autonomous cars, and even something like unmanned cargo haulers, do you really think they’ll be okay with some unmanned derision making robot roaming their skies?

The actual flying is certainly easier for a sophisticated AI system (it is an order of magnitude easier to fly a drone compared with a model helicopter from the first generation of gyroscopic control), but there are too many things going on upon the ground which require human decision-making. I think the first use of pilotless aircraft must certainly be for air-to-air or air-to-ground combat.

But it doesn’t make the act of flying a UAV any easier. I have heard several people (especially on the instructor side) comment that just the opposite is actually true. People who have been flying UAVs [with telemetry links, like most modern “drones”] are normally quicker at picking up “proper” piloting skills and don’t fall for the #1 beginner mistake (trusting your internal sense of level & direction). That is because drone pilots, quite literally, can’t “fly by the seat of their pants.” If you’ve flown before (even as a commercial passenger) then you know that the plan almost always feels like it is flying straight and level. You’ll feel takeoff, landing, turbulence, and some drastic course changes; and that’s about it. Most other navigation and correction of the craft is done so that the summarized force vector for the passengers is “down” (into the seat) at roughly 1 G. Which makes it feel like straight and level flight, even when banking and turning. The pilots monitor the angle of bank and rate of turn by using their instrumentation, and this becomes especially important when they have lost visual reference (flying through a cloud, so everything outside is grey/white). For newer pilots, there is a temptation to “follow your gut” and use the internal equilibrium measures to gauge the orientation of the aircraft. This is normally when an instructor hears such gems as “I can just tell it’s level” or “it only felt like a slight bank left.” That last one was overheard at a debrief as the instructor played the poor guy a video of them banking out of the clouds, standing on the wing, nose a bit below level, and still rolling left (moving into inverted). Because of the characteristics of the pilot’s turn, the centrifugal force made it feel like he was mostly level when instead he was running toward trouble. Instead of trusting how the turn felt the pilot should have relied on his instrumentation. The artificial horizon would have quickly made it apparent how much he was overdoing the roll (as would the compass, since he was pulling that turn pretty hard). And this is where a person who started with UAVs has the edge. As a R/C pilot, you’ve been conditioned to triple-check with your instruments and fly by the numbers, because you aren’t there to feel it you instead measure it. Once you’ve picked up the good habit of reading the instruments, you’ll do it when in the cockpit yourself. So while you feel “1G, straight down, in the seat of your pants” you’re also looking at the horizon indicator, the compass, and the electronic chart (if you have one) and are seeing exactly how the aircraft is responding. And that is why every instructor I’m on a chit-chat level with has said they can tell the people who 1) have had some previous flight training (normally the ex-military pilots) or 2) learned to fly remotely first… and they like those guys, because they don’t have to be broken of the bad habit of “feeling it out” 2",2021-03-06T13:35:46.336Z,"Does experience as a pilot make it any easier to operate a drone?

At present, release of airborne munitions includes a ‘man in the loop’ (a common phrase, let’s take ‘man’ to refer to our species, rather than sex). With a piloted aircraft this is fairly obvious, with the unmanned systems the exact method may vary, but probably means that even in a system which can operate genuinely autonomously, rather than being piloted from afar, a human confirmation or target and release of weapon is required. Humans are versatile, and generally better than machines at dealing with unfamiliar or unplanned situations. This might make humans more reliable. But humans are also subject to cognitive errors, to lack of mental capacity to deal with very complicated situations, often resulting in bad decisions being made, and humans can be fooled by erroneous evidence. Do we place too much importance, or overinflated human performance in the argument for ‘man in the loop’? Maybe. Computerised systems on the other hand deal fairly poorly with the unexpected, and (without sophisticated new learning algorithms, which come with their own problems ) will make systemic errors: the same error will always result from the same input parameters. These aren’t comfortable traits for sanctioning use of weapons. On the other hand, computers can assimilate many different sources of information faster than a human, which, it could be argued, has potential to make them more reliable than humans. There are plenty of examples of humans releasing weapons on the innocent, or against their own forces, but in terms of perception, I think we would see it differently if an autonomous machine did the same. The role of public perception, as well as the militaries of the world and their respective governments, is important. And awkward, because perception doesn’t necessarily correlate with evidence. To actually answer your question, I don’t know. Not in the immediate future, as the latest generation of combat aircraft are manned, or at least remotely piloted for weapons. F35, Typhoon, Rafale and Gripen will be operating with the western nations at least for some time yet. My feeling is that we will see automated cars and trucks adopted first, and when they are mature and widely accepted, hopefully contributing to safer roads, then a while later we will see the rise of automated engagement with weapons.",2021-03-06T13:44:31.306Z,"How long do you think fighter jet pilots will be needed before only drones are used?

Designed to work seamlessly with the DJI Inspire 2 drone, the Zenmuse X7 delivers superior image quality, interchangeable lenses, and a new DJI Cinema Color System for post-production to give film and video professionals more creative freedom. “The Zenmuse X7 offers everything professional content creators need to make their aerial footage as stunning and vivid as they demand,” said Paul Pan, Senior Product Manager at DJI. “From the large Super 35 sensor to a new mount, lenses, and color system, the Zenmuse X7 gives cinematographers and professional photographers an unmatched set of tools that work seamlessly with the DJI Inspire 2 drone to capture high-quality footage that is easily integrated into projects shot with industry-leading handheld cameras.” Greater Expressive Freedom The Zenmuse X7 is equipped with a Super 35 video sensor featuring 14 stops of dynamic range for more detail in low-light conditions. Its low-noise image capture enhances grading flexibility by preserving details in both highlight and dark areas while enabling a shallow cinematic depth of field. To meet the rigorous requirements of filmmakers and television production professionals, the Zenmuse X7 captures the highest image resolutions ever for an integrated drone camera. It is capable of shooting 6K CinemaDNG RAW or 5.2K Apple ProRes at up to 30 FPS, as well as 3.9K CinemaDNG RAW or 2.7K ProRes at up to 59.94 FPS to integrate seamlessly into industry-standard post-production workflows. Enhanced Imaging Potential The Zenmuse X7 uses a dedicated aerial mount system, the DJI DL-Mount, featuring an ultra-short flange focal distance to carry prime lenses optimally. Available with focal lengths of 16 mm, 24 mm, 35 mm, and 50 mm, each lens has a maximum aperture of F/2.8 and is crafted out of carbon fiber, making them durable and lightweight for high-performance aerial cinematography with the DJI Inspire 2 drone. To allow for advanced setting adjustment and fine-tuning, the 16mm lens is equipped with a built-in ND 4 filter, and the 24 mm, 35 mm, and 50 mm lenses feature a mechanical shutter. Higher Flexibility in Post-Production DJI has also introduced a new DJI Cinema Color System (DCCS) making the Zenmuse X7 an asset on every film set for movies, TV series, commercials, documentaries, and more. “For the Zenmuse X7, we took our color science to the next level,” continued Pan. “We consulted the world leading authorities in color science, Technicolor. With their guidance, our engineers developed an optimized gamma curve for the X7 allowing more latitude without sacrificing image quality.” DCCS features a new D-Log Curve and D-Gamut RGB color space to give more flexibility and color options during the post-production process. The D-Log further extends the dynamic range, while the D-Gamut RGB color space preserves more color information to support the most demanding filmmaking scenarios, providing accurate color for quick and easy post-processing. The new EI Mode mimics the way a film camera works to help cinematographers capture as much information as possible in every scene while balancing the dynamic range and noise with different log curves for more flexibility during the post-production process. The Zenmuse X7 gimbal system weighs just 631 grams with the 16 mm lens. The DJI Inspire 2 has a flight time of up to 23 minutes with the Zenmuse X7. For more info about the Zenmuse X7, visit www.dji.com/zenmuse-x7. Price and Availability The Zenmuse X7 camera is priced at $2,699 USD. The 16 mm, 24 mm and 35 mm lenses will be available for $1,299 each, and the 50 mm for $1,199. Customers can purchase the Zenmuse X7 prime lens combo including all 4 lenses for $4,299. The Zenmuse X7 will start shipping in early November 2017 from The DJI Store: Shop for world-class drones and gimbals, in DJI Flagship Stores and through DJI Authorized Dealers worldwide.",2021-03-06T14:21:08.851Z,"How has drone technology affected cinematography?

If the cinematography is in Panavision the lens costs a few hundred thousand bucks, or rents for a few thousand dollars a day. So, you’d need a big drone that you’d trust to loft a cinema camera, like an Intel Falcon 8 that’s built for the purpose, or a big Matrice. Lots of cinema producers economize and compromise with something like an Inspire 2 with a big ZenMuse gimbal and camera for something like $20,000 to get their aerial shots. Google with terms like ‘movies shot with inspire 2’ and you’ll get a selection to consider if the video from an Inspire is good enough to entertain an audience in a cinema house. Pirates of the Caribbean and other movies have aerial scenes, and even some close to the water or ground, are shot with a ZenMuse. For anything that will be seen on a smartphone or in a browser, most any camera drone can get spectacular results and most of them have a ‘cinematic’ setting that smooths the drone’s maneuvering for best results.

60439014ed76476feda2ebf0,https://www.quora.com/How-are-drones-shaping-our-future-cinematography?-,"My thought is ruining most independent films used. Very low entry drones, are making film makers to impossible shots, but I disagree on the final quality shot. On the other hands, high budget films do have a better impact on the film and it’s lossless in a sense they can mount a real cinema camera such a Red Epic or an Alexa Mini. And they shoot a drone shot because is needed instead of using an helicopter. I feel most that most independent films, real low budget use a drone, because they can, and not because they need it. In my particular case, of the several short films that we shot, only once we used a drone because it was really needed to the story. And the other times, we didn’t even considered a drone, because it was just plain foolish to use one, even if we owned one. But yes, I wouldn’t call it shaping the cinematography or it’s future. It brings a possibility that was harder to reach to low budget films. And as Tom Bryan says: it’s a risk to fly any aircraft with a pilot and crew. So it’s safe in the sense if the drone crashes you might only lose the camera and the drone, but zero lives. Especially on those hard shots that are dangerous to maneuver. But again, I wouldn’t consider the “future” a drone shot, it is just a pebble of the full array that conforms the film language, that is nice to have sometimes.

Why Skype became so successful on the Voice over IP market? There were similar solutions before Skype, but it was Skype who truly brought VOIP to our everyday’s life. I would say there are couple of similarities on how two companies approached big wide world :) Ease of use. That’s what was essential with Skype - you just download it and start calling. Some may not remember, but before Skype there weren’t really many applications that could so seamlessly pass through all kinds of firewalls, NAT routers and what not and provide you with free tool to communicate.DJI drones are extremely simple to operate, maybe even too easy. My daughter was 7, when she was able to hover Phantom 2 drone in the air and she asked me “Dad, are they really pay to to fly these things? Hahaha, even I can do that”.Price. Well Skype2Skype calling was (and still is) free, while SkypeOut calling back then was real cheap. Maybe not cheapest, but very cheap. Combined with simplicity - well, it took off very quickly.DJI drones are really cheap. There is (almost) no point in building small camera drones anymore and same is happening (slowly) to higher-end professional drones. Some special use machines - sure, but consumer grade camera drone? Only if you’re enthusiastic hobby-builder and love building more than flying and making photos/videos, otherwise you’ll spend a lot of time building something that will probably never be as good as these ready-to-fly products off the shelves… And I’m saying this as someone who built his first drones long before DJI crushed the market.ConsistencySkype just worked. Well, most of the time - it failed sometimes and it started failing more after couple of acquisitions and re-acquisitions, but especially in the beginning and for cast majority of users - it just worked.DJI products just work. I landed in India and we got our drones (semi-)confiscated by Indian customs, so we had to rent machine from local guy. I did one test-flight - 2–3 minutes - and we started filming. While this sounds pretty obvious to everyone today it really wasn’t the case in, say, 2012 - every drone behaved differently, everyone had their own understanding what should be the operating logic, etc. It was as if you got someone’s self-built car and it had accelerator pedal on left side and brakes on right and clutch in the middle… Yes, operating principles are same, but it takes time to get used to it. And fun part - before taking off you never knew if that’s Ferrari or Trabant, you could only estimate by looking at a size of exhaust pipe (in case of drones, motor/propeller size, weight etc).Deploy, then deal with consequences. It’s not a secret, that Skype had it’s issues with authorities around the world, especially in it’s first years. “Is it telecom? Why is there no license? But you can call regular numbers? Why can’t we tap into calls? Why don’t you give us access to customer details?”. And all these blocking attempts - there was team, who’s main task was to look into how various security companies built different tools to block Skype and then figure out how to outsmart them.DJI came to market, sold first couple of million of drones and that’s when governments realised they have to do something. But that’s where DJI won - it’s much easier to defend yourself when you have millions of users around the world, right? Imagine before starting business they’d go and start asking around “We’re planning to build a great flying camera, that can go as far as 7km, transmit HD quality video with virtually no delay and it can be in the air for half an hour. Are you okay with that?”. First you launch, disrupt and after that start cleaning up and cooperating and that’s what DJI does.

The images are from Devdas, Padmaavat and Bajirao Mastani. Do watch these movies for their magnanimity. SLB is known for choosing always the best. Best costumes, actors and music too. Not just visually stunning but melodious to ears also.watch this scene too-              MOVIES— KADVI HAWA-     Asoka- Made by one of the best cinematographer Santosh Sivan.      LOOTERA- Based upon O. Henry’s short story “The last leaf”. Beautiful story, beautiful narrative, beautiful direction.     video-  TUMBBAD- This movie was my choice for an oscars in cinematography last year. Literally, if we’d have sent it, this time 2 international movies would’ve won the oscars. This was a path breaking, ground moulding horror movie based on mythology. BTW it took more than 5 years just to shot those beyond perfect rain scenes, in real location.-          PARINEETA- Another piece of art like Lootera.      MUGHAL-E-AAZAM- Madhubala is and will be the most beautiful woman ever created by god. EVER. PERIOD. This movie was made during B/W era but later colorised. It was the highest budget movie of that time. Like 1000x more budget than any other movie ever. All the animals you’ll see during the war scene are REAL!!! We didn’t have VFX till 90s man.         BAHUBALI- Need I say anything about this masterpiece? This opening scene-  And the song right after it-  When they showed us the whole kingdom-  this whole song is a visual delight-  Scenes at 1:25, 1:40, 2:23, 3:13  My fav one from the 1st movie-      KGF Chapter 1-        Pyasa- A timeless classic. Sahir Ludhianvi’s songs are literally the soul of this gem. I’d love to watch it in colours if that so happens.

The unmanned aviation sector currently is, to quote Doctor Who, ""a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey, stuff.""  Actors are striding onto and slinking off of the stage on a pretty continuous basis. Some of the more innovative ones have been eaten by major aerospace companies (e.g., AAI by Textron, InSitu by Boeing), while others seem to be hanging in there as independents (e.g., AeroVironment, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc.). At least one of the old-school airframers -- Northrop Grumman -- has been in the business for more than fifteen years with their offering, the RQ-4 Global Hawk and its offspring. By the same token, to date I don't think any of the above have come up with truly ""consumer"" unmanned aircraft (I'll stop being pedantic now and just say ""drones""). AeroVironment is starting to market some of its advanced smaller systems for various commercial and public safety uses, but they're superior products offered at (for now) breathtaking prices.   So, to describe the ""consumer drone"" niche, I'll confine the rest of this answer to those being sold for ""hobby and recreational"" uses. These universally weigh less than 55 pounds / 25 kilograms, payload included, and are intended to be operated within the pilot's line of sight only. I'll also stick to discussing this topic in the context of the U.S., because other countries have quite different takes on drone operations right now. (A mixed bag of rules is resulting in a mixed bag of offerings.) I also think it's important to say right up front that drone designs are not certified by any entity. They aren't manufactured to any kind of consensus standards. That means everything from their durability to their battery life to the reliability of their ground controllers is a total crapshoot. It's the Wild west out there, and some fly-by-nighters are grabbing some of the growing chunk of money being spent on these things. Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). There are some pretty good Web sites that have sprung up to help people decide among different types. That's important because some of the hobbyist systems are being re-purposed for commercial activities of various types, with users formally obtaining exemptions from the FAA allowing them to be used in this role. For example, Best Drones For Sale and Why is updated pretty regularly; in my experience, they seem to offer a reasonably objective array of recommendations that doesn't seem to favor any one brand too heavily. A ""top five"" list most commonly is measured against a particular set of criteria -- price, reliability, gross sales or whatever.  In the case of consumer drones, however, I'd prefer to just offer a list of five of the most commonly encountered brands. There's no objective way to rate them against either other. What's fine for one user might be terrible for another.  The best thing I can say about my list (which is double the requested five) is that these all are manufacturers that have been around for a while, meaning there's a reasonable body of user raves and pans available on-line, and the companies identified aren't likely to disappear overnight. Most also have the benefit of having been submitted as the platform of choice in a particular commercial application for FAA approval. In no particular order, if you're looking around for a ""consumer drone"" for fun or profit, I'd suggest your starting with the following manufacturers: DJI (The World Leader in Camera Drones/Quadcopters for Aerial Photography )PrecisionHawk Precision Agriculture, Commercial UAV and Farm Drones For Sale Yuneec - Electric Aviation Aeryon small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) – Aeryon Labs Inc. Astraeus Aeria Cinema (Home )AirRobot - Start - English Parrot (AR.Drone 2.0. Parrot new wi-fi quadricopter - AR.Drone.com - HD Camera - Civil drone - Parrot )Drones For Professionals, Mapping & Photogrammetry, Flight Planning & Control Software,: senseFly SA 3D Robotics (3DR - Drone & UAV Technology )Lumenier QAV250 These are all over the place in terms of cost, and and they are by no means U.S.-only manufacturers. Several have developed platforms for niche products (agricultural monitoring, aerial cinematography, etc.). However, each seems to have had a good track record in terms of safety and sales to date. I don't know if I'd call them ""top brands,"" ""the varsity"" or whatever, but they all seem to have at least a few solid performers in their respective offerings. If your primary interest is in purely hobby uses, I'd stick to the lower end of the cost spectrum consistent with consumer reviews. Whatever you buy most likely will crash and/or get lost at some point, so be prepared to eat the investment at least once.",2021-03-06T14:28:24.872Z,"What are the top five brands in the consumer drone space?

As an undergraduate, my friends and I would always drink and party during our weekend. I mean what else can we be doing? Besides studying(which we do have a lot of free time) it is the best time to be having fun before you actually enter into your career where you’ll probably be working for the rest of your life. So one day, we got bored of it and decided to try something more laidback as the drinks taking a toll on us. Fishing, driving aimlessly to explore new places, kayaking, etc. whatever you can think of you name it. We have got a lot of hobbies and silly ideas, but I would never expect that one day my friend’s dumb idea would earn us money. So Shawn(not his real name) the baller of our group randomly bought a Drone which he wanna try out of curiosity due to the recent craze regards to drone flying and videography with VR goggles. Needless to say, he spent close to $1000 for that drone. So we decided to take it for a spin like anyone else, and eventually, we all grow fond of it. Its one of the best feeling on earth. The thrill, speed, visibility, and distance. So how do we earn money from it? Well, photography and videography. Firstly, we took videos and photos of places at a certain angle any professional cameraman can never dream to make. We created accounts and post it all over our social media platforms to create memories for ourselves. Initially, we only do it out of hobby, but eventually, it becomes a habit, and it starts to catch quite a bit of crowd here and there. Of cos initially, we suck at it big time. We start going from websites to websites to learn more from other experts regarding drone videography and photography. The best way is to find a site that already collates all relevant tips for you like this one 16 Drone Experts Share Their Best Drone Photography Tips Before we know it, there are enquires on our social media platform asking us to help in volunteering to take videos of events. Yup, you read that right, volunteer work gets us no pay at all, but dinner was provided. We agreed because it seems like a challenge and its cool as it is our first time doing it for someone else other than our pure satisfaction. Little did we know that it build bridges for us along the way. After the event, we edited the video here and there and cut some scene away(please learn somewhere on how to do this as its one of the most fundamental skills you need) The organizer was very pleased with it and he shared it on his website and backlink us. That’s where everything starts falling into places. People were contacting us and even offered to pay for our services. From that day on, we took on many other projects and got paid for our services. One of my friends eventually went out to the market and bought his very own drone, and he is now collaborating with a wedding videographer company as added on features/services that come with an additional price. P.S. Before you decided to do all this, there are some fundamental core skills you need. Pick the right drone at the right price there are many drone blogs available in the market that teaches you which to pick for different purposes such as photography, videography, racing, entertainment, battery life, etc. Google them!!! Learn how to fly it well and fly it right. If you can’t even fly it right don’t expect to earn from it. Video editing is a must! Lastly, learn and get more tips from the expert! 99% of the drone experts out there are all friendly and always ready to lend a helping hand.

In fact, an ND filter set is no longer considered complete without at least going up to an ND 1.8 (6 stops). Wide angle lensing, close to subject, with large apertures is another common modern look. Night exteriors shot with mostly available light (mainly yellow sodium vapor street lamps), and shutter speeds slower than 1/48 second became popular with fast digital cinema cameras and continues to this day. There is a current trend of generally lower overall contrast specifically in the shadows, due to more sensitive sensors and working at unprecedented low light levels. This means that natural ambient light actually works as fill light. In the past, in order to achieve the same level of ambience, one had to create that fill light intentionally by adding movie lights. 90s and 2000s movies and music videos had higher contrast lighting and more modeling, plus high contrast bleach-bypass and cross-processed film stock looks, the unmotivated super-hot toplit and diffused ‘Robert Richardson’ look. Desaturated blue-green moonlight and cool-white fluorescent light looks were popular. There was generally more experimentation with colored lighting thru gels. 80s movies and music videos had the post- ‘Terminator’ double-blue hard moonlight night exterior look, super telephoto and extreme wide-angle lensing, backlit smoky look of directors like Ridley and Tony Scott, Adrian Lyne, Russell Mulcahy, etc. Earlier movies that were shot on slower film stocks had a higher contrast, more ‘lit’ look compared to later films shot on faster stocks. These commercial and music video directors also started a trend of shorter shots with faster aggressive edits. 70s had the soft, funky wide-open anamorphic lens look (due to slow film stocks while shooting on location), heavy use of zoom lenses, naturalistic and sometimes flat or under-lit looks, pushed-film stock looks, more blow-out windows or silhouettes. More long takes. So on, and so forth… I think it depends on the era. Stylistic trends in cinematography come and go, based on the available technology and fashion of the day.

They can be equipped with a little cannon that fires flyweight pellets to demonstrate the awesome power of an assassin drone. They’ve got an optional camera, not-stabilized, that provides low-resolution FPV to a smartphone or VR if you stuff the phone into VR goggles. Mambo’s little props stop quickly if they hit anything, and the worst damage from most crashes is popped-off prop guards or props.

There is no provision for commercial activity of any sort until one gets a commercial license, which is several levels above that, and requires yet more training and 250 additional hours of flight time—at more than $100 per hour, at the very cheapest. Only then can a pilot start charging for his or her services. “Drone” pilots (for this, I’m assuming you mean the little remote-control quadcopters; that seems to be the popular definition) are trying to keep themselves as unregulated as possible. They are typically self-taught, and the barrier to entry is very low. Someone can pick up a DJI Phantom for a few hundred dollars, practice for a few weeks, and hang out their shingle to do business in aerial photography. And yet, these people want to share the same airspace. When they do, it typically goes very badly for the aircraft pilot—a large bird can cripple a general aviation aircraft; a large octocopter could be lethal. I’ve got one more thing to worry about as I’m coming in to land. Disruptive. In the popular business lingo, drones are disruptive as well. It’s a startup culture, using new technology to get around a heavily regulated industry. It’s already changing the way aerial surveillance, photography and cinematography is done, and it’s doing it for a far cheaper price. Fixed wing pilots have to abide by noise regulations . . . drone pilots don’t have any. (Yet.) Disruptive. Pilots can’t fly below certain altitudes, and even then, require special clearance. Drone operators feel free to fly anywhere they want until someone complains or shoots the drone out of the sky. (Which has happened.) Disruptive.

So any sound recorded near one will have to have all sound and dialog replaced. Not an issue for the big aerial but for complex audio scenes it is a lot of work. For documentary work any chance of quietly getting a shot is lost.Blades in face. Drones have wide angle lenses on their cameras. A Steadicam, hand held or dolly shot can get extremely close to an actor and pose very little danger to the actor. A drones spinning blades means that camera must be much much farther away for safety and combined with the wide lens means the shot is always much wider and in many cases not even usable. Hiding production gear and personnel is very difficult with a wide lens far away and closeups on actors look way better than wide shotsMysterious wind. Because the drone is using spinning props to keep it airborne and moving it can’t move in close proximity to dusty surfaces, foam, feathers, flowers, fabric or liquid without creating a visible after effect. It also can't operate at close range in cluttered spaces since the blades could catch on things.People get very excited about a drones potential thinking of it like a magical flying steadicam for cheap! But it is only one tool in a big arsenal. What it can do in limited situations is amazing. Think wide smooth and epic. That introduction shot of the lone farmhouse in a corn field which used to require a helicopter or a large Jib can now be done with a drone in a fraction of the time. But it is also very limiting in it’s lack of safe repeatable intimate shots. A large jib can come down from the farmhouse, tuck into the window and settle on a tight closeup of the farmer with his steaming cup of coffee. The drone can go higher but nowhere near as close. Closeups are critical to good story telling.

A Mavic Mini and lots of other consumer drones get awesome video for a phone or website, but if blown up to a large high-resolution monitor or a cinema screen the video’s lacking the detail and texture we expect in a movie house or 75 inch monitor. DJI’s Inspire 2 and Matrice lines are built for cinema. The Inspire 2 can be bought with a ZenMuse X7 or better camera that gets cinematic results for something like $5,000 to $20,000 depending on how good you want it to be. Pirates of the Caribbean is an example, and googling around a bit for terms like ‘movies filmed with drones’ will find you video shot with Inspires. The Inspire 2 works so well that entire movies are shot with them. If it’s a shot on the ground, they can hand-hold the drone or put it on a dolly. Lots of shots, even indoors, can be made by flying the drone since it’s so stable and has enough intelligence to avoid ceilings and other obstacles. They can also be flown with two controllers, one for the drone, and the other for the cinematographer. DJI’s Matrice line consists of larger drones able to carry larger payloads and they’ll loft any camera that fits in the gimbal, including that $50,000+ cinema camera that gets exactly the results the director wants to see, They can also be used on a tripod or boom. They’ve got accessories like focusing and aperture wheels so the camera operator can tweak the depth of field to suit the scene, or to pull focus from one character to another. There are other manufacturers but DJI is regarded as the best at every pricing point, including drones for cinema.

If you are interested more in the aerodynamics of flight and fixed wings, is recommend the book ""Model Airplane Aerodynamics"" by Martin Simons. It's old, but still mostly relevant and is easy to read, short and well written. Most work in UAS is geared towards either business applications and advancing technology within software and electronics, not really in the airframes/aerodynamics. First, call them UAS or UAV, nobody will take you seriously if you call it a drone. I'm also going to assume you mean multi rotor UAS, there a few differences with fixed wing UAS but not much. Next, decide what aspect is appealing to you. UAS technology is penetrating into several large markets with great opportunity including cinematography, agriculture, delivery, and more (search quora on this I recently saw a great write up on a market forecast).  Next, think about what role you want to play. Are you interested in advancing technology, working the business aspect, or being an operator? I'm going to guess its either the technology or operator path you are interested in. The technology in these vehicles is increasingly more around software, code, and, sensors. I would disagree with the previous comment that an aerospace degree is best for for this industry. I would recommend either computer science or electrical engineering with an emphasis on control systems is far more suited. The aerodynamics of a multirotor is not the governing attribute that defines it, but the software and complementing hardware.  If you want to be an operator, I would recommend going to one of the UAS flight schools, although I question the credibility and promise of jobs in that field. The platforms are moving towards autonomous use in all fields except cinematography, so you can expect a surplus of pilots in the future.  Above all else, start building and flying them. Don't buy a DJI or parrot kit, learn how to scratch build, modify,  and work with them. In school, get involved with academic research, the two will be your value as a student or recent grad.  So to wrap it up, I would just say you should start with understanding the market and technology needs, and figuring out how to fit into it.

Avoid ""cool"" features like ""auto-flip"" - flipping a quad-copter is fun but I think it's better to learn to do it yourself, and I think these features contribute to quality reductions, as companies try to include them in cheaper products. 5. I disagree with Todd - do not attempt to build your first quad yourself. The problem with this method is you need flying skills to properly set up a quad. If you manage to build one that doesn't fly right on the first try, you might not have the skills to prevent it from crashing and then you're back to square one. I have a friend who is an actual rocket scientist, and he can't get his quad working because of this problem.

She got into it because she’d lost practically all of her photography business to drones and says in most cases a drone is a better option. Helicopters cost tens or hundreds of thousand $, drones a few hundred or thousand. Helicopters burn lots of avgas or kerosene, plus they take lots of maintenance $ with the set-aside for rotor and engine overhauls so they cost hundreds of dollars an hour to fly.

Helicopters burn lots of avgas or kerosene, plus they take lots of maintenance $ with the set-aside for rotor and engine overhauls so they cost hundreds of dollars an hour to fly. With a drone you just need to charge the batteries. Drones fly lower than 400 feet, can be rigged with RTK GPS and get centimeter accuracy over a hundred acre site in a half-hour or so with cheap mapping tech like DroneDeploy. If a drone’s flying a real-estate video it can finish by diving gracefully through the trees and hovering at the front porch. The helicopter’s stuck up at 500 or 1000 feet… Little drones, like a DJI Inspire, Phantom, or Mavic 2, can do a fine job and apps like DroneDeploy or FlyLitchi can automate most of the work and do a better job than flying by hand. Big drones, like an Intel Falcon and its competitors can fly a big camera for cinematography. Thermal and multi-spectral sensors and GPS/RTK rigs for drones are becoming more available and affordable recently. A drone can get down there to sniff out and visualize a gas leak. Drones can do more and more jobs better these days. There are fewer and fewer reasons to fly a helicopter for aerial photography… One of the textbooks I read studying to add an FAA 107 remote pilot rating to my commercial pilot certificate is written by a helicopter pilot.

So currently, making a commercial film with an unpiloted system is not legal. You would have to go to Germany, Australia or other countries that are more advanced in citizen use of drones. This means that a full-size helicopter must be used. There are lots of regulations on the use of helicopters in film production, following the crash of a copter during the filming of The Twilight Zone, resulting in the death of three actors on the ground, in addition to the crew on the vehicle. Just recently there was another crash (Helicopter crash kills 3 during reality TV production) showing how risky this can be and how desirable it is to have a lightweight, unmanned platform for cinematography. 1",2021-03-06T14:52:27.897Z,"What is considered the best copter for fimmaking?

Videography is the act of capturing video to document an event and generally consists of one person, standing in the back of your venue, shooting a long-form video without edits. When you think of a wedding video, images of a guy in an oversized suit hanging around the reception with a camera on his shoulder may pop up. Naturally, times have changed and technology has advanced, but the concept remains the same. Wedding videography, depending on the company, may be comparable to a home movie due to the format in which it is displayed. Unlike cinematography, generally speaking videography will be significantly less “Hollywood” in the shots, angles, and editing of the footage. To clarify things a bit, when you think cinematography, think Hollywood rom-com trailer, and for videography think of cute home video footage.
