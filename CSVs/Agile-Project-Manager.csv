It also manages the teams and has few layers within the same project area - Program level, Project level, Group level and team level. Each one has members that can be managed till the point that you can split the resources to multiple projects - we use it for cross team functions like DBA, Architects, Quality Managers...)  3. RQM - QA world. Test specifications, runs, alerts,Dashboards. It also has APIs for GIT and external automation tools that can be aggregated and monitored along with manual testing. 4. RDDI/JRS - this is analytic module that allows you to create any query you like and display it graphically.  What I like and need from the tool is the monitoring but also tractability from each of the modules. For example, I can export one report that shows direct links from the requirement to User Story(es) and tasks to the exact tests that validated the story. If connected to git and to your build system,it can also show and manage the builds, create automatic diffs and even identify code convention violations if configured. We are now trying to connect it to our Dynamic Analysis system to get the results in. Now as I wrote - You really need strong DevOps of killer integrator to get it running. For us it took almost a year till (I had 2 DevOps eng.) we were able get it all inline, but we did have some org and methodology changes that made this harder.  With new version coming out soon - it will also have out-of-the-box module for Configuration Management.

In agile, you accept that you don’t know what the end state is except possibly in some broad concept, but certainly not all the specifications. Ongoing communication must take place in agile to ensure you are constantly in synch with the process owner and stakeholders so that you can prioritize your backlog of features and produce minimally viable deliverables in iterations, gathering customer feedback as you go and integrating that into the backlog and prioritizing them for future iteration deliveries. Agile got its start in the software development industry, so if you think of software version releases, you’ll get a better understanding of how iterative releases are done, but such an approach isn’t limited to software. It’s now being done in a multitude of applications. Nevertheless, don’t look at this as agile is “new and improved” project management and traditional is “old and dead”. It depends on what the deliverable is, the organizational culture, stakeholder communications, project team knowledge of agile processes, etc before deciding which approach to use. Hope this helps. However, know that agile doesn’t fix everything. If you have a chaotic environment where communications are poor, you don’t have corporate leadership support, the project is underfunded, or has unrealistic schedule or performance requirements, no approach will fix that.

This generates self-organization on a cross functional team. Understanding how lean product development works, the dynamics of these teams that generate 5-10 times normal performance is critical. The biggest impediment for implementing agile is having people who do not have the mindset required. As a manager, I created Scrum to not only make the teams hyperproductive, but to enable me to be a hyperproductive manager. Scrum is not hostile to management, it is simply designed to implement self-organization to enable teams to innovate faster. Managers can implement certain ground rules, but then they need to remove impediments for the team, not tell them what to do. It frees up management time to focus on strategy, building customer relations, and streamlining company operations. The comments on Product Owners burning out are often the result of teams moving too fast for a Product Owner to keep up. You need to build a Product Owner team. One of the MIT area companies I work with had a seven product owner team in 2010 and now they have 35 product owners. So management failure to staff and train the product owner function can be a big problem. Again, this is the result of failure to execute with an agile mindset. Agile is a mindset and a motion like a martial art. If you are a women with an 8th degree black belt in Karate, like one of my Scrum users, virtually no-one can beat you in unarmed combat. Yet people say, karate is hard, it takes too long to learn, you have to follow the instructions of the master for years, you can get hurt, and on and on. These comments have nothing to do with the Karate process. They have to do with the Karate mindset and the inability or the unwillingness to achieve it. Scrum derives from the Lean Product Development teams viewed by Takeuchi and Nonaka. These teams, like the Toyota Prius team, required a special management style, where management provided challenging goals and then backed off and let the team figure out what to do. This generates self-organization on a cross functional team. Understanding how lean product development works, the dynamics of these teams that generate 5-10 times normal performance is critical. The biggest impediment for implementing agile is having people who do not have the mindset required. As a manager, I created Scrum to not  Continue Reading",2021-03-05T08:30:33.544Z,"What are the most pressing challenges in Agile Project Management? ",Quora

These 5 developers started working on the features after splitting the requirements equally . After the end of 5 months, assume 2 of the developers got some lucrative offers from other companies and after serving the notice period for 2 months they gonna leave the current employer. That mean 7 months of their work which hasnt gone into production is left idle or to be handled by some other who is completely unaware of the features that the previous dev did. This results in a horrible mess. This do increase the pressure on the remaining developers as the required timeline is inching closer and they have to deliver their deliverables as well as handle the code of the the other two developers who had left. But in case of agile, it's like a continuous delivery where the requirements are minimal so does the delivery time. In this case, even if few members of the team planned to quit the org, as the feature set is minimal, one or the other can easily handle compared to the bulk feature set in waterfall.

Having a scrum master removes impediments and shields the development team from external interference. Working cross-functionally allows development team members to learn new skills and to grow by teaching others.Increased collaboration and ownership: The development team, the product owner, and the scrum master work closely together on a daily basis. Daily scrum meetings let the development team organize around work completed, future work, and roadblocks. During sprint reviews the development team can demonstrate and discuss the product directly with stakeholders.Customized team structures: Self-management puts decisions that would normally be made by a manager or the organization into scrum team members' hands. Because of the limited size of development teams — five to nine people — agile projects can have multiple scrum teams on one project. Self-management and size-limiting mean that agile projects can provide unique opportunities to customize team structures and work environments.More relevant metrics: The metrics agile project teams use to estimate time and cost, measure project performance, and make project decisions are often more relevant and more accurate than metrics on traditional projects. On agile projects, you provide metrics byDetermining project timelines and budgets based on each development team's actual performance and capabilitiesHaving the development team that will be doing the workprovide effort estimates for project requirementsUsing relative estimates, rather than hours or days, to tailor estimated effort to an individual development team's knowledge and capabilitiesRefining estimated effort, time, and cost on a regular basis, as the development team learns more about the projectUpdating the sprint burndown chart every day to provide accurate metrics about how the development team is performing within each sprintComparing the cost of future development with the value of that future development, which helps project teams determine when to end a project and redeploy capital to a new projectImproved performance visibility: On agile projects, every member of the project team has the opportunity to know how the project is going at any given time. Daily scrum meetings, daily sprint reviews, and visible progress charts offer concrete ways to see progress.Increased project control: The many opportunities to inspect and adapt throughout agile projects allow all members of the project team — the development team, product owner, scrum master, and stakeholders — to exercise control and ultimately create better products.Improved project predictability: Agile project management incorporates several practices, artifacts, and tools for improved predictability:Keeping sprint lengths and development team allocation the same throughout the project allows the project team to know the exact cost for each sprint.Using individual development team speed allows the project team to predict timelines and budgets for releases, the remaining product backlog, or any group of requirements.Using the information from daily scrum meetings, sprint burndown charts, and task boards allows the project team to predict performance for individual sprints.Reduced risk: Agile techniques virtually eliminate the chance of absolute project failure:Developing in sprints, ensuring a short time between initial project investment and either failing fast or knowing that a product or an approach will workAlways having a working product, starting with the very first sprint, so that no agile project fails completelyDeveloping requirements to the definition of done in each sprint so that project sponsors have completed, usable features, regardless of what may happen with the project in the futureProviding constant feedback on products and processes through daily scrum meetings and constant development team communication, sprint reviews and retrospectives, and releases in which the end user can see and react to new features on a regular basisGenerating revenue early with self-funding projects, allowing organizations to pay for a project with little up-front expense.

The external set of activities involve working with people and resources outside of the team - on the teams behalf. I won't cover the internal aspect of the role.

Here are some of the outward-facing / external activities that project managers perform: Manage budgets and financial reporting for the project, particularly back to the people who own the budget and want to know how the money is being spentManage the logistics of getting the newly created software solution into a production environment, or into a process that distributes the solution (or solution access) to clients.Conduct a broad risk assessment for the project, and determine whether greatest exposures are. Follow-up by developing actions to reduce or remove these risks.For selected issues within the project, the project manager can organise for external resources such as technical specialists, external consultants and external vendor's - which help solve a problem within the project. This will include the negotiation the budget owners in the organisation as well as their negotiation with the external supplier of skills and resources.Act as a liaison to sales and marketing people within an organisation, if the software solution is something that is going to be marketed/sold. These functions need to be kept informed and ultimately have materials prepared for them to assist with a smooth delivery of the solution to marketIn large organisations the project manager can also fulfil some HR functions-in particular advocating for the promotion of high performers within the project team, and advocating for special leave in the case of personal problems/challenges with team members. This is simple ""looking after people"" activities that without an advocate would not happen.I think this is a small subset - based on my experience only. There will be a lot of variation amongst organisations and projects, and probably between individuals. Despite the variations in the list of activities between projects & people and project, what they would have in common is they contains activities that help the development project (and the people in it) survive and thrive in the organisation.",2021-03-05T08:35:57.102Z,"What is the role of project management in agile software development?

Source: paper The Abstract Recently, Agile development processes have become popular in the software development community, and have been shown to be effective in large organizations. However, given that the communication and cooperation dynamics in startup companies are very different from that of larger, more established companies, and the fact that the initial focus of a startup might be significantly different from its ultimate goal, it is questionable whether a rigid process model that works for larger companies is appropriate in tackling the problems faced by a startup. When we scale down even further and observe the small scale startup with only a few members, many of the same problems that Agile methodology sets out to solve do not even exist. Then, for a small scale startup, is it still worth putting the resources into establishing a process model? Do the benefits of adopting an Agile methodology outweigh the opportunity cost of spending the resources elsewhere? This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an Agile methodology in a small scale tech startup and compares it to other process models, such as the Waterfall model and Lean Startup. The Conclusion Thus, to answer the question, “Is a rigorous agile methodology the best development strategy for small scale tech startups?”, we have to determine the ultimate goal of the startup. In general, the Agile process model is most beneficial to improving the process of software development while Lean Startup is most beneficial to business and product development. A startup that is developing software for another company may already have a clearly defined product and does not have to worry about business development. In such a case, a rigorous, purely Agile approach will be most beneficial. On the other hand, if the startup is in charge of the business and product development, or when the software plays a huge part in the product, a hybrid of Agile and Lean may provide the most benefits in terms of the four metrics. Make sure to check out the full paper for more details. Q: Is Agile project management well suited to running lean startups?

Yes, that’s true- nowadays it’s either scrum master, product owner or in scaled frameworks you may be a resource train engineer, etc. That said, it ignores the point of your question, which I understand to be: “What are the skills and characteristics of a successful agile team member?” As someone stated Agile implementation is a set of tools and practices that are, conceptually, simple, but difficult to practice. You can educate yourself and certify and learn the various approaches for small team agile and agile at scale, no lack of information about it. I am fond of saying “Knowing how something works does not mean you know how to work it.” Learning how an agile method works isn’t complicated and you should invest in knowledge, but practice is where you’ll pick up the proficiency. To answer your question though- What makes a successful agile agent (of any role)- First, you have to understand that the success of an agile implementation depends on championship from leadership to engage and adjust the entire organization into an agile business flow. If you are set up in an agile team “in a silo” or as a “partial implementation” you are likely being set up to fail, and unfortunately a lot of organizations and leaders do not understand this. Obviously, small scale pilot programs are not a bad idea, but again the championship and plan for growth must exist. Continual improvement is a foundational tenant of the practice and that ethos has to permeate at the organizational, working and personal level for everyone involved. So in terms of characteristics- You need to communicate effectively, analyze thoughtfully, experiment and adjust fearlessly and continuously seek to improve your knowledge base and operating procedures and maybe more important than any of these, be able to diplomatically speak truth to authority. In terms of skills- If there is one skill that is make or break for a successful agile implementation, especially at scale, it is Organizational Change Management. More than a proficiency at organizing work and teams (also very critical), More than any project level or task level management or working skilll, Your ability to convince the org to champion agile organization (of the company, not just the projects), to make the long and difficult investment to pursue change and decentralize decision making and to pursue continual improvement, AND to be able to plan, execute and coach that change, both at micro and macro levels, to fruition is singularly more critical to your overall success than any proficiency with tools or methodology. Those things are still important, but cannot add value if the first does not exist. I see a lot of answers looking to educate you that Project Manager isn’t a role in the agile framework. Yes, that’s true- nowadays it’s either scrum master, product owner or in scaled frameworks you may be a resource train engineer, etc. That said, it ignores the point of your question, which I understand to be: “What are the skills and characteristics of a successful agile team member?” As someone stated Agile implementation is a set of tools and practices that are, conceptually, simple, but difficult to practice.

This is the dirt road/gravel road/asphalt/highway model of discussing how “polished” a feature needs to be. Push the team to build dirt and gravel roads before assuming that they have to build highways for every feature.If you must do estimates, then use estimates to plan the team’s work to their capacity, rather than as a way to measure productivity or as a way to secure commitment to a particular deliverable. Use estimates to help avoid over-committing and resist the urge to make the team look good by fudging the numbers so that velocity appears to increase over time.Help the team drive towards finishing and releasing things, rather than starting new things. If you like the Kanban method, then limit work in process. Don’t ask “How long will it take?” but instead “What’s left to do?”Learn about Theory of Constraints in order to know what to focus on when the team doesn’t deliver as quickly as you’d like (and it probably won’t). Understand what bottlenecks mean about planning. Understand that dependent chains of tasks lead to the relentless accumulation of negative fluctuations — a fancy way of saying that once you fall behind, you just keep falling more behind and can never catch up. Accordingly, don’t let tasks depend on each other. Guide the team to make tasks independent.Also related to Theory of Constraints, learn to focus on delivering (increasing throughput) and not keeping people bus (utilizing resources). It’s OK for someone to stand around and do nothing if they’re not a bottleneck and the bottleneck is already overloaded and they can’t help do work at the bottleneck. Understand the value and role of slack in helping the team succeed.When it’s clear that the team has Too Much To Do, help the team figure out what they’re not going to do, then help them NOT do it. Stop them from trying to do it. Stop them from feeling guilty about not doing it. They can’t do everything. Show them that you will actually manage the project, rather than just standing there like Homer Simpson, asking them if they can work any faster.That’s enough to get started. Also encourage the team not to try to figure out every detail up front, but instead, figure out enough to get started. Then start.

There isn't any other significance to them, other than that. Some tools (Jira, for example), use the term ""epic"" as the mechanism to group related stories, as a way to organize and classify backlogs, but originally the concept of ""epics"" was to convey an idea of size, rather than to indicate any kind of ""hierarchy"" or any other organizing principle. Imagine a big rock. You then smash it with a sledge hammer. The big rock ""disappears"", and in its place you have smaller rocks. Maybe you can call some of them ""boulders"", but they are all still rocks. Moreo Continue ReadingAn ""epic"" is simply ""a large, big story.""

Imagine a big rock. You then smash it with a sledge hammer. The big rock ""disappears"", and in its place you have smaller rocks. Maybe you can call some of them ""boulders"", but they are all still rocks. Moreover, the total mass of all of them equals the mass of the original rock, but that rock is gone. You then smash one of the resulting fragments. What do you get? same result again. Perhaps more ""boulders"" and a few ""pebbles"". Still, all rocks. Same thing happens to epics and stories: you split an epic, an the original epic disappears, being replaced by perhaps a few stories and (if the epic was big enough) a few other epics.[1] So, how do you know something is an ""epic"" rather than a ""story""? Something that doesn't fit within your sprint is definitely too big. But so is something that would take more than a couple of days to implement, so one way of thinking about ""epics"" is to use them as shortcut for ""a story that needs to be split."" Other people reserve the term for features that are ""significantly large"", or that are still vague and unrefined, etc. So, it's a matter of convention within your team, but again, to convey the idea of size rather than hierarchy. So, when do you ""close"" an epic? this assumes that the epic stays ""open"" while you still have stories for it, but as the example of smashing rocks show, once the epic is split, it simply disappears and gets replaced by the pieces we decided to split it into. Under this interpretation, there's nothing to close: the original work item in the backlog (the epic) is discarded and replaced with new work items (new stories and epics.) If, for tracking purposes, you find useful to somehow relate them to each other, then use whatever mechanism your tracking tool provides (in Jira, the Epics view; in a physical board, perhaps color dots; etc.) Once they are all ""DONE"", if you later identify a missing story, simply add it to the backlog and treat that along the usual process of backlog ordering/prioritization.

The case is very similar to a project where all the features required by a client are delivered at once. So the client has to wait till project acheives all the objectives. 2. In second case the project is delivered in parts. Also Client gets first set of important deliverables ( in this case money) in the early stages of project. Further, in second exercise if there is a situation where some notes are not acceptable to client,  feedback will be received early. In first case it will be done at end of the project.  The second case is an example of Agile project management. You execute projects in stages- deliver first important set of features early in the project; client can start making money and get ahead of competitors by early launch. The interesting thing is total time to deliver all the features is also less in case-2. One example: Everyday we see many applications in google play store giving updates. Imagine if the developers of application wanted to launch the application only when all the features are developed; it would take years and may be when the application is launched, somebody else with similar features, would have already captured the users.

Although it is quite possible or likely to outsource many of the construction process to highly efficient & effective specialty contractors, it will be relatively more expensive and time-consuming (less Agile) to plan, coordinate, execute and manage such external delivery activities. It is also quite apparent that construction project are less flexible (in terms of being built in pieces or parts) than software product delivery, where it is common to build software incrementally. Further, from my limited knowledge as an outsider, there are regulated external controls during construction process to limit the autonomy of delivery team and speed of actions. Lastly, a great splendour of Agile is the core team working very closely on the same wavelength throughout the delivery process, while construction would call for different trades at different stages of construction process, requiring other ways to get the broader team informed. That said, some of the ideas (or mindset) in Agile method could still benefit managing construction projects, for example, to somehow show sample constructs, options, or digital visual simulation, or reference projects to the client or end users to get a true or better feel of the look & feel, texture, integrated effect, color composition, etc, before the full build-out, i.e. a variant form of frequent look & loops, continuously assessing needs & wants and priorities; iterate the aforementioned process / exercise across exterior work, front landscape, back garden, living room, kitchen, powder room, master bedroom, basement, garage, etc, which is arguably the idea of MVP (minimal viable product).

These items should be added to the Prioritized Product Backlog as they are discovered” (pg 246, emphasis added, a free e-copy is available through the included link). That being said, the PO (Product Owner) in Scrum or project lead in other Agile frameworks will need to gather an initial list of requirements—Epics, User Stories, and so on—for the initial project backlog. The questions used to discover these requirements will vary broadly according to the field you are working in. Software development will have some very specific questions about functionalities while a project to develop a particular product such a component for a airplane engine will have questions about necessary specifications. Very generic discovery questions would include ones such as “What does your company want to be able to do with the product(s)/service(s) from this project?” “What needs will this product(s)/service(s) meet for your company and for your customers?” “What governmental regulations apply to this product/service, if any?” Area specific questions can arise from what you already know about the customer, such as “What should this product look like? Should it match an established line of products already? Or is the actual look and feel of the product not important?” For example, in software, these types of question may be about UIs and accessibility. For websites, these types of questions might include design elements such as the use of white space, colors, and the balance between text and images per page: the relationship between form and function. To get a general sense of a customer’s/client’s business philosophy, some discovery questions may include ones about the company’s core values and how they should be represented in the product/service. For many companies this is a great source of value. In most cases, a successful project building a product or service is about building a rapport. This is very general; hope it helps.

In our case, we had an overall (waterfall) project plan for the device, and only the software subteam worked explicitly agile. Some things to consider - if using sprints, lengthen them. Hardware development cycle times are usually longer. You cannot be quite as experimental - prototyping and doing early manufacturing runs are expensive so up front design is useful for the hardware components, while the software is relatively easy and cheap (maybe) to change. You could even run one long hardware sprint in parallel with shorter software sprints so as hardware is pushed out, the software team can iterate on a more frequent basis. If you are building hardware/software hybrids, be aware that late hardware changes has a big impact on software downstream. Of course sometimes hardware redesign must happen, but you must make allowance for this in terms of software rework. Software teams building hardware/device products often have to write software to correct hardware design flaws - this is the nature of the beast. For me working on this project in an agile way was very rewarding. The project was experimental and largely proved and tested as we went, so agile helped us cope better with frequent hardware changes and other problems better than a standard project management approach would have. We did have battles and frequent arguments with the project management team, and with our business sponsors as it was almost impossible to provide accurate forward estimates of completion.

I prefer to call that “traditional plan-driven project management”. The term “Agile Project Management” also might be confusing to some people. Some people think that means only a pure Agile approach and that’s not what it is. Here’s how I would define the difference between a plan-driven approach and an adaptive (or Agile approach): A traditional plan-driven approach follows what is called a “Defined Processs Control Model” that is assumed to be a repeatable process and it typically follows a series of well-defined phases (typically called “Waterfall”). This approach is most appropriate for a situation with a low level of uncertainty where the requirements for the project and a plan for the project with cost and schedule goals can be defined upfront prior to the start of the project. The emphasis of that model is on planning, control, and predictability. The problem with the traditional plan-driven model is that it doesn’t work well in a situation where there is a high level of uncertainty. That kind of environment requires a lot more flexibility and adaptivity to further define the project as it is in progress rather than starting out with detailed requirements and a plan upfront. That’s basically what an Agile approach is and it follows what is called an “Empircal Process Control Model”. This article explains the difference between these two models: What is Scrum and What is Agile - How Are They Different? The world of project management is going through huge changes at the moment as the result of the influence of Agile. For a long time, PMI did not recognize Agile as a legitimate form of project management. In 2013, PMI created the PMI-ACP certification that recognized the importance of Agile but Agile and traditional plan-driven project management have still been treated as somewhat separate and independent domains of knowledge with little or no integration between the two. The challenge for project managers is to create an integrated approach that blends these two different models in the right proportions to fit a given situation rather than force-fitting a project to a totally plan-driven - that’s what “Agile Project Management” is.

Two of the most common drivers of this are:- Failure to pivot or adjust early enoughFailure to understand the growth mechanismNow, I’ll nit-pick a little here and point out that “Agile” isn’t a project management system. Agile is a framework that prioritizes people, interactions and behaviors and embraces incremental change and learning. It is precisely this learning and change accommodation that makes agile well suited to startups. Learning early is key. Startups operate in extreme uncertainty with one notable exception - their runway. Most startups have a very good understanding of how much funding they have. The goal for all startups must be to understand their users, products and their method of growth before they reach the end of their runway. All successful startups have learned enough about those things before they got to the end of their runway. All failed startups missed on at least one of those. Agile facilitates incremental development - for startups these should be the smallest steps to test the most important theories (beliefs that inspired the startup). Each test must include validated user acceptance. User validation is the user paying. Each step must be as small as possible and as fast as possible. each test provides knowledge that is used to “tune” the business, or, on accumulation may make a pivot (large change) apparent. Learning the growth mechanism requires understandings of the market, the adjacent markets, the users, the channels, the growth process and the products diffusion. These are mostly dependent of behaviors and society. Startups need to focus on learning and behavior> Agile’s emphasis on small incremental steps with learning and changing as well as its emphasis on behaviors and interactions makes its well suited to startups.

This is 100% aligned with the Agile manifesto and any Agile Project management method or framework would then also be aligned. In a start-up, prototyping scenario, you might be less focused on velocity and more focused on innovation and design.

Rather than attempting to develop a complete and detailed plan for the project upfront, the plan for the project is further elaborated as the project is in progress.An Agile PM approach relies heavily on self-organizing, empowered teams and many basic project management functions are actually distributed among the team rather than being totally controlled by someone called a “Project Manager”.An Agile PM approach is incremental and iterative and heavily engages the customer in the project to provide feedback and input as the project is in progress. In a traditional PM project, the customer may not see the final solution at all until the end of the project.In an Agile PM approach, testing is fully integrated with development rather than being done sequentially by a separate and independent organization and there is an emphasis on using an incremental approach to producing a full-tested increment of functionality at the end of each iteration.Instead of relying heavily on detailed requirements documents, requirements are typically considerably simplified in the form of user stories and there is much more reliance on direct communication with the customer to further elaborate the details of the requirements as the project is in progress.Those are probably some of the more significant differences.

Agile is predominant in IT and software projects since it allows to adapt to rapidly changing business environments. Unlike traditional project management, Agile calls for producing and delivering work in short bursts, also called sprints. Gathering all the requirements before the development team even starts writing the code puts your software at a great risk of being not in line with current market demands and become a failure. When you decide what your product should be in the very beginning, you tend to ignore important iterations that must be made during the development lifecycle, thereby preventing your final product from being the right fit for the market. A plethora of project management methodologies are available in tech market, however, for the success and timely completion of a project, it’s imperative to choose the one that fits your business requirements and empowers the product development to keep the pace with changing client demands. Key characteristics of Agile Project Management Empowers developers to self-organize the taskEnhances learning, knowledge sharing and communications among team membersEmergent behavior to deal with uncertaintyNo detailed documentation and calls for just enough planningContinuous product refinement via regular iterationsConstant feedback, research and creativityFaster completion of projects without compromising on the quality of desired productMaximum ROIAgile project management is a boon especially to IT field because time determines the fate of your product. Since IT has become a fast-paced world, months have been reduced to weeks, and weeks have been reduced to days. If you take too long to develop a software, chances are high that the requirements for it change drastically by the time it is finally available for use, which makes Agility a matter of paramount importance. Agile enables the development team to work faster by dividing tasks into different sprints and incorporate innovation and uniqueness in the development process. Limited documentation in Agile project management also improves the pace of a product’s development lifecycle. Instead of long documentation that nobody has time to read, Agile calls for increased interaction among team members, customer feedback, imagination, coding, testing and new ideas. These factors result in appropriate response to a change rather than following a plan that has prerequisite measures and no room for dealing with a change. Unlike traditional project management, Agile paves the way to adapt to even last-minute changes.              source: Business Software Reviews from Software Advice™ The biggest reason for the immense popularity of Agile is its basis - It’s not possible to determine all the tasks going to be required for completion of a software project up-front, design an architecture upfront and get all the requirements upfront. Agile is built upon the belief that constant feedback cycles, research, undisrupted interaction and creativity allows the plan, the requirements and the architecture of a project to gradually emerge. As a result, the end-product meets not only the client’s need, but latest market demands too. Although Agile project management has proved to be a great help for IT managers, nearly 48% of US project managers use it for non-IT projects as well.                source: Agile Methodology Since Agile project management is the best fit for businesses that have continuously changing environments and highly complex situations, it is often deployed in ever-evolving software and IT industry. However, non-IT managers have also begun to use Agile for project management as even they find it difficult to articulate requirements without seeing a tangible product first.

The best work I ever read about software development is Philip Armour’s The Laws of Software Process. Google it, you should be able to find the first chapter online, and that’s 80% of the value. In a nutshell, Armour points out that software development is a process of knowledge discovery. You discover knowledge by exploring the requirements, codify that knowledge in software, test that codification by having people use the software, and use that testing to discover more knowledge, which you then feed back into the next iteration. Agile project management increases productivity largely through three factors: avoiding unnecessary work“working clean”better rapport with the end user“Avoiding unnecessary work” isn’t pithy; there’s probably a better term or phrase, but in essence, most traditional project management systems try to deal with the inevitable change by trying to suppress it, or plan ahead for it, or add lots of ceremony around it. All of these generate lots of extra work. A huge part of that extra work is in planning ahead and building code you think you’ll need. Instead, Agile says that modern programming languages, tools and techniques are sufficient to enable us to cope with those new requirements when we get to them, instead of trying to get it all nailed down ahead of time - which is doomed to fail anyway, and in the process will make you do a whole lot of extra work. “Working clean” is a concept from the cooking world (in french, “mise en place”) and it’s the idea that you actually go faster by constantly cleaning up your table, knives, cutting board, etc. It seems like that extra work would slow you down, but instead it enables you to go much faster. In software, “working clean” is about keeping the code “clean”, i.e. uncluttered, as simple as possible, as “clean” in design and structure as possible. Besides avoiding unnecessary code, a huge part of this is refactoring. Much of the worst of software messes is caused by a shift in the purpose of the system, based on newly acquired understanding that is not also reflected by the architecture of the system. Refactoring aims to keep the architecture of the system in sync and congruent with the purpose, which helps keep the rest of the code clean. “Better rapport with the end user” is, again, not the pithiest way to phrase it, but it’s accurate - you can’t avoid unnecessary work unless you know (and decide together with the customer/end user) what’s actually necessary. A lot of the practices of various agile project methodologies are aimed at overcoming the gulf that separates the developers from the people who actually have to use the software. This includes things like the Onsite Customer and Planning Game from Extreme Programming, and other techniques from other agile methodologies.",2021-03-05T10:32:25.949Z,"What is the role of Agile Project Management in increasing productivity level?

It was refreshing, intelligent and also quite controversial. Exciting. What has changed? Well… as far as project management goes… Its become a meaningless term bandied about by organisations and individuals who grasped neither the meaning nor the intent. The market place is awash with agile ‘experts’ the large majority of whom are anything but. Certification is rife, flawed and counter productive. It has become a ‘business’ domain rather than an engineering domain. Somehow the pox of Waterfall has begun to resurface acquiring some sort of legitimacy. We failed to keep ‘pumping in the antibodies’.. Oh.. I could go on.. its really quite dismal and pretty depressing. Seventeen years since I joined my first ‘agile’ project and I STILL see people spinning their wheels over estimation and points, what a story looks like, what does ‘ready for sprint’ mean etc. All the valuable lessons that Agile extracted from Lean Development seem to have failed to really hit home. I observe no significant improvement in the ability of companies to deliver to schedule / budget / customer sat. Projects fail with the same monotonous regularity as they did before. Just now we don’t call it failure we call it ‘changing priorities’. Agile project management has become, largely, a cargo cult. Cargo cult - Wikipedia But that’s project management… there is a bright side. By comparison to 2001 ( my reference point )….. Its rare these days to come across teams who don’t value unit testing ( and I mean the automated kind ). Its simply become part of the DNA in most organisations. The quality varies but the intention is clearly there. Most teams I come across consider continuous integration ( and deployment ) a must. In fact the development tools these days are literally geared to making this happen. Engineers understand the importance of working in time-boxes in a way most managers do not. Daily, hourly, minute-by-minute release are common place. Refactoring is a word I hear all the time. Engineers constantly challenge and will be very vocal about technical debt. Pair programming is a bit hit-and-miss.. but there is clearly a much stronger emphasis on peer review than there was 17 years ago. And the ubiquitous ‘pull request’ is, I think, the modern incarnation. Review of engineering, by engineers! Design, architecture, programming have on most teams blended together, as of course they should. Engineers understand the value of feedback loops ( sadly Project Managers treat sprints like planning tools ). Its interesting that back then, the ideas that were most controversial ( explicitly in Extreme Programming ) have now become almost de-facto… engineers it turns out, are pretty smart! The less controversial ones have become watered down, borderline farce.. but with a certificate and an army of experts to help you figure out how to write things down on bits of sticky paper.

The Just In Time concept and minimizing Work in Process shows itself in our focus on the immediate sprint and top of the backlog. Some of the other ideas like Genchi Genbutsu - going to the source - can be seen in our adoption of daily scrums and cross functional teams. From this perspective, it is easily arguable that Agile is present in many other industries and software got it rather late! However, no-one expects Toyota to have a ranked backlog and produce cars in two week sprints (although you might find daily meetings like scrums. In this case the methods can feel very different. They are not attempting to manage potential change in requirements on a rapid basis, but manage the efficiency of producing multiple copies of the same device (i.e. your shiny new car). Neither would you expect the construction industry to have a changing order of backlog and requirements that morph rapidly - making such a change would be expensive so in this case the team needs to manage and lower the risk of change - with more investment in planning up front. If you looked at one of these projects that would look more traditional in nature - although there is a case for agility during the planning phase to help gather feedback and settle on requirements. So in my opinion the difference is one of how you need to respond to change, projects that need to minimize change often use more traditional process. That isn’t so say maybe there are concepts worth applying and adopting. When I was building props for my kids marching band I estimated in story points, worked on a regular sprint basis on the same evenings each week and predicted delivery using an epic burn down chart, just to try and see.

Scrum derives from the Lean Product Development teams viewed by Takeuchi and Nonaka. These teams, like the Toyota Prius team, required a special management style, where management provided challenging goals and then backed off and let the team figure out what to do. This generates self-organization on a cross functional team. Understanding how lean product development works, the dynamics of these teams that generate 5-10 times normal performance is critical. The biggest impediment for implementing agile is having people who do not have the mindset required. As a manager, I created Scrum to not only make the teams hyperproductive, but to enable me to be a hyperproductive manager. Scrum is not hostile to management, it is simply designed to implement self-organization to enable teams to innovate faster. Managers can implement certain ground rules, but then they need to remove impediments for the team, not tell them what to do. It frees up management time to focus on strategy, building customer relations, and streamlining company operations. The comments on Product Owners burning out are often the result of teams moving too fast for a Product Owner to keep up. You need to build a Product Owner team. One of the MIT area companies I work with had a seven product owner team in 2010 and now they have 35 product owners. So management failure to staff and train the product owner function can be a big problem. Again, this is the result of failure to execute with an agile mindset. Agile is a mindset and a motion like a martial art. If you are a women with an 8th degree black belt in Karate, like one of my Scrum users, virtually no-one can beat you in unarmed combat. Yet people say, karate is hard, it takes too long to learn, you have to follow the instructions of the master for years, you can get hurt, and on and on. These comments have nothing to do with the Karate process. They have to do with the Karate mindset and the inability or the unwillingness to achieve it.

The result is that strategy design, merger design, key decisions, and similar client/consultant dialogues can be conducted using 1/3 of the effort. Part of the key was working out what needs to be discussed, in what sequences, and how. This research wasn’t on project management of consulting assignments, it was on project conduct of mgmt consulting assignments, but you could replicate the thinking by starting with a few projects to study.

Certainly, there are a number of challenges involved while managing an agile project with distributed teams or a team that is working remotely. In the present scenario, it is more likely to happen that high priority projects will still need to be handled remotely. Given the current circumstances, the hardships for agile project managers are increasing. Some of the major hurdles that agile project manager faces are as follows: 1- Initial Resource Planning One of the biggest and common challenges faced by agile project managers is initial planning for resources. The project needs to be handled in a delicate work frame and the person responsible is not always sure of the available resources in terms of costs, labor and work efficiency of the team. Due to this reason it becomes quite laborious to plan out an effective initial strategy. 2- Progress Tracking To deliver a high quality product, agile requires distribution of tasks among the team. With a distributed team, it becomes quite a handful for agile project managers to keep track of everyone’s progress. 3- Funding and Financing Not every agile project is fully funded but there is always room to move things around and get the means that are required. When working with remote teams on an agile project, it is hard to figure out how much the labor or increments for employees can cost. A proper budget needs to be settled for the project which often gives project managers a hard time.

I prefer to call that “traditional plan-driven project management”. The term “Agile Project Management” also might be confusing to some people. Some people think that means only a pure Agile approach and that’s not what it is. Here’s how I would define the difference between a plan-driven approach and an adaptive (or Agile approach): A traditional plan-driven approach follows what is called a “Defined Processs Control Model” that is assumed to be a repeatable process and it typically follows a series of well-defined phases (typically called “Waterfall”). This approach is most appropriate for a situation with a low level of uncertainty where the requirements for the project and a plan for the project with cost and schedule goals can be defined upfront prior to the start of the project. The emphasis of that model is on planning, control, and predictability. The problem with the traditional plan-driven model is that it doesn’t work well in a situation where there is a high level of uncertainty. That kind of environment requires a lot more flexibility and adaptivity to further define the project as it is in progress rather than starting out with detailed requirements and a plan upfront. That’s basically what an Agile approach is and it follows what is called an “Empircal Process Control Model”. This article explains the difference between these two models: What is Scrum and What is Agile - How Are They Different? The world of project management is going through huge changes at the moment as the result of the influence of Agile. For a long time, PMI did not recognize Agile as a legitimate form of project management. In 2013, PMI created the PMI-ACP certification that recognized the importance of Agile but Agile and traditional plan-driven project management have still been treated as somewhat separate and independent domains of knowledge with little or no integration between the two. The challenge for project managers is to create an integrated approach that blends these two different models in the right proportions to fit a given situation rather than force-fitting a project to a totally plan-driven - that’s what “Agile Project Management” is.

A project’s scope will often widen over its lifecycle as requests from customers and stakeholders for new features and functionality come in. This is a natural (and essential) part of any product development process, but issues arise when teams get sidetracked on the wrong things. Customer needs can change after the initial requirements for a product have been set, so effective product management requires a high degree of flexibility. That said; any changes made must align with the overarching product vision — otherwise, teams risk wasting resources (and creating weaker products) by focusing on the wrong things.  Why does scope creep happen? Scope creep can emerge in different ways, but most typically it occurs when teams start adding in additional functionality or features that haven’t been properly prioritized in the roadmap. While the roots of scope creep are typically found in external factors, it sometimes arises as a result of lack of consensus within teams, internal miscommunication, or weaknesses in product or (or project) management processes. How to manage scope creep To stay on top of scope creep, it's vital to have clearly prioritized product roadmap in place that documents changes to the project requirements and displays their impact on priorities or timelines. An effective product roadmap can also be the basis of a change control process, which includes: Monitoring a product’s current statusUnderstanding the original scope of a project and its core objectiveCapturing actual progress, then comparing it to the core objective to know how much the current project has diverged from the original planDetailing the causes of any change in requirements and defining how much product development has changed as a resultEvaluating change requests to recommend actions or decide if they should be challengedEnsuring all changes are processed, documented, and broken down into actionable tasks""You'll find more insights about here: What is scope creep.

Traditional project management places emphasis on following a plan and getting everything cast in stone (death by documentation), while agile project management places emphasis on responding to change and delivering value. In the end of the day, however, what matters most - regardless of which methodology you follow - is whether you deliver the project on-time, within budget and meet customer expectations. Taking that into consideration, the most important aspects of good agile project management is judgement and responding to change. Judgement. With judgement I mean the ability to see risks (good perception and listening skills) before they become issues and coming up with good strategies to mitigate these risks. Also making judgement calls whether to drop a feature, add more resources, change the delivery date, how much documentation is enough, etc.Responding to change. Some people talk, others do. What differentiate good from average project managers is their ability to take action. Good risk management skills on paper is as valuable as the paper it’s written on. The proof is in the pudding.

We've been exploring where else this can be useful (http://venturebeat.com/2012/04/11/facebook-groups-for-schools/). Before Groups were the awesome thing they are today, Facebook made use of mailing lists and an internal tool for discussions.  We also use an in-house-built task management tool that supports a lot of Facebook-like interactions like being able to Like a comment on a task. It's heavily centered around ownership, tagging, and task status. As a quirk/perk this system also supports the collection of Pokemon with each closed task. The tool probably has some similarity with Asana (http://venturebeat.com/2011/11/02/asana/) which was born at Facebook and probably doesn't have Pokemon. We also make heavy use of IRC (at least the engineering teams do). For instance, we use IRC to disseminate lunch menus (thanks to User-11996890232419197840 for creating his internally infamous menu-scraping IRC bot) and as a coordination tool for our code release process. There are a handful of other tools that make internal communcation easier with respect to file sharing, like Pixelcloud (https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=116769547792, https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/hackathon-22-redesigning-pixelcloud/501881803919). We also use a lot of email and chat. Because we have a bunch of offices all over the world, we use video conferencing and live streaming of video from wherever to wherever else it needs to go. This can be a hassle when something goes wrong, but in general in makes remote offices and people seem accessible. The degree to which we decentralize is also part of why it's super easy to work remotely without being missed or feeling left out. For code review, we use some awful tool Evan Priestley wrote called ""phabricator"" (http://phabricator.org). It's actually pretty good or whatever, but don't tell Evan because he'll get a big head about it.  We also talk to each other frequently. We're not nearly as meeting-heavy as a lot of companies I've worked for, but we spend a fair amount of time in impromptu whiteboarding and in discussion at or around someone's desk. Meetings tend to be low impact and over attended, so just going to the person or couple of people you need to interact with and banging out some details on the spot is usually a better option.",2021-03-05T11:03:44.803Z,"What tools does Facebook use for internal communication and project management?

Many people in the business industry have a misconception that software with an advanced and complicated interface generates more benefits. Keep in mind that Agile was made to make things easier so complexity in systems is not a necessary feature. You need to have full access to all your tool's features for optimal results. You can't do that with an interface you can't understand. I suggest using simple project management tools like Asana. It uses Kanban boards which you can drag and drop across the project board. You don't even have to train your employees much about this. There are existing YouTube tutorials for this software which you can choose from as their manual. It's also easier to learn from video and image materials. Asana is the epitome of a simple productivity-boosting project manager. It provides different views for your projects. We all know how it's easy to comprehend reports and work progress with good visuals. The software also enables project managers to put as many details as needed for each task. That includes dates, assigned member, task description, links, etc. Basically, it serves as an all-in-one task delegator--gives the project, provides all instructions, and automatically notifies the leader of the progress. Project leaders don't have enough time to delegate tasks to the team one by one or detail per detail through a communication platform. Even verbal explanation can leave out a lot of key project details. That's what you want to avoid the most in project management which Asana can eliminate from your workflow. Another useful project management technique that promotes agility is business process management. Managing your processes and keeping them up to date is one of the best pieces of advice I've received when it comes to project management. For any project, you need SOPs and guidelines to follow so it's no surprise that you will do your best when those are thoroughly documented. A great tool to use for this technique is Process Street - it's a checklist generating software that will definitely add onto any agile project management strategies you already implement.",2021-03-05T11:04:27.662Z,"How and which agile project management techniques can be applied while creating a startup product like apps or services?

Also in the exercise-2 the Client gets some money quite early.  Now let us discuss agile. 1. In the first case Client gets all the money at once. The case is very similar to a project where all the features required by a client are delivered at once. So the client has to wait till project acheives all the objectives. 2. In second case the project is delivered in parts. Also Client gets first set of important deliverables ( in this case money) in the early stages of project. Further, in second exercise if there is a situation where some notes are not acceptable to client,  feedback will be received early. In first case it will be done at end of the project.  The second case is an example of Agile project management. You execute projects in stages- deliver first important set of features early in the project; client can start making money and get ahead of competitors by early launch. The interesting thing is total time to deliver all the features is also less in case-2. One example: Everyday we see many applications in google play store giving updates. Imagine if the developers of application wanted to launch the application only when all the features are developed; it would take years and may be when the application is launched, somebody else with similar features, would have already captured the users.",2021-03-05T11:06:56.126Z,"Where can I get the best agile project management training in Houston?

Agile is intended to change the way you do things, not what you do. It should not be seen as a replacement for project management but rather an addition.Putting emphasis on fast delivery and iterative sprints while forgetting the big picture (aka getting lost in the details). I have seen that the roadmap and overall plan gets forgotten and only the stories and backlog is focused on, which is too fragmented to provide adequate context for decision making.When using scrum specifically (not agile necessarily), the focus on speed and velocity and the false sense of security that the team is delivering more.As many has pointed out, agile is associated mainly with software development. A project manager should take the non-development aspects (such as user support, training, infrastructure and other value chain activities) into consideration as much as the delivery of the software.Expecting teams to be autonomous too early. Kind of like expecting a baby to run before he has taken his first stable step yet.Advantages: If, however, understood and applied well, there are only advantages to doing project management in an agile way, including: A more engaged and motivated team by inclusive decision making, more freedom to experiment and fail and more creativity in doing the actual work.More transparency and thus a higher possibility for the project manager to always know how well the team is doing against the set-out objectives.Better risk management as there is more regular feedback loops.Higher quality products / services as it is designed and delivered with the user in mind and includes the users more frequently and earlier for feedback.Lower cost as the majority of the tools and techniques are low-tech and issues are discovered earlier which is exponentially cheaper than finding out issues after release.Much easier for the project manager as they can focus their energy on the important stuff like strategy, risk management and communication and less on the non-value add items such as updating documents that will never be read, managing people, writing reports etc.A higher probability of delivering the right product / service in a shorter time frame, thus higher productivity.Agile is really about getting rid of the waste that slows down project delivery, so ultimately the big benefit is increased productivity, or the ability to meet your goal faster.",2021-03-05T11:19:24.221Z,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of Agile as a project management tool?

For example, our skilled team can build robust project management tools to manage records/reports of employees (dismissed employees as well), projects and tasks in one place, help PM to analyze and plan the workflow of a project. Moreover, we can create meeting rooms (negotiation calendar) and apps for managing the company’s internal resources. We use such software as Webix UI library and DHTMLX widgets for building project management apps for our clients. Here is in the article - How We Made a Cost-Effective Project Management Solution with React, we try to describe our experience in building PM solution with ReactJS. XB Software was asked to create a project management system to be integrated into the existing enterprise resource planning system. The primary challenge was to develop a working project management solution in a reasonable time and reduce the risk of spending a year or more on developing software that might be unsuitable for the customer’s employees. Moreover, you can read more articles on project management in our blog - https://xbsoftware.com/blog/project-management/ Nowadays, the absence of frameworks, libraries, and other development tools is not a thing to worry about. Simultaneously with the evolution of web applications and the growth of their complexity, developers are creating and improving a wide variety of techniques allowing to reach new technological levels. As a result, the main task for modern developers is to choose proper tools that correspond to the features of a project.

For example, developers are expected to plan and manage their own work as well as the work of the team as a whole; and, of course, the Product Owner has many project management functionsHowever, there are situations where an actual project manager can provide value in an Agile environment: As you scale Agile projects to large, complex enterprise-level projects requiring multiple teams and/or requiring integration with other enterprise-level applications and functions, frequently require some level of overall project or program management. SAFe recognizes the need for this Program Management role.There are plenty of situations where a hybrid Agile model is required (Agile contracts is an example) where there is a need to manage customer expectations about project costs and schedules on top of an Agile development approach. For example, some years ago I was a Project/Program Manager for a large US government program that was so large that it required congressional oversight over costs and schedules but the government customer wanted to use an Agile approach to have some level of flexibility in the details of requirements. In fact, the US Department of Defense has mandated the use of Agile in some defense programs and you can bet that those programs cannot be done without some level of project/program management",2021-03-05T11:24:26.929Z,"When will people understand that there is no project manager in Agile?

However, here's what I believe are the differences or at least points of emphasis: Product Owner Clearly switching the word from Manager to Owner has implications.  The idea is have ownership over the product, to have skin in the game, to be responsible for the product from beginning to end.  To get business results.  To have a single responsible person.I also feel theres a bit more of a business orientation to the PO role.  Many companies have Product Marketing Managers in addition to Product Managers.  While PMs are responsible for product features, PMMs are responsible for pricing, marketing, and the go to market strategy.  I believe POs will often times take on these roles.  Indeed, in small companies you commonly find one person responsible for PM & PMM activities.  You could also see conflicts when these two roles are separate and hence a lack of clarity on one true ""owner"" so combining these roles into one PO would be Lean and efficient. Scrum Master The differences between Scrum Master and Project Manager (PJM) are interesting IMO.  Although the Scrum Master is still responsible for addressing barriers to progress, the role is mostly a ""coaching"" role to help teams adopt Scrum successfully.  In this coaching role the SM puts more back on the team vs. them taking ownership of it.  For example, if there are dependencies or issues between two teams the Scrum Master coaches the teams to ""self organize"" and address the situation themselves rather than taking ownership of ""the issue"".  Often times this is more successful since it empowers the teams to take ownership of the issue and work more directly with each other.I assume the authors of Scrum changed the names of these roles to help emphasize these differences.",2021-03-05T11:24:46.265Z,"Why did agile refactor the project manager role into the product owner and scrum master roles?

I am trained by PMI’s framework. I know the concepts. I understand the transformation required. To cope, get training! Understand what a Scrum Master is, and not a project manager. Understand what a Product Owner is, and not a product manager. Then learn to allow the teams to make decisions on work assigned. The hard part is to not directly influence the team. Let them make mistakes, let them learn, let them recover. If they need your help, let them come to you. Partly implemented Scrum will fail. I have seen Kanban fail, because they do not like pasty notes. They will not buy software. People will find excuses. People will rebel. If you can find cause, get rid of them. If you cannot move them to a position where they will not influence the effort. Finally, change or leave. Do not be the rebel.

Check out this article for more details on that: Is Project Management Obsolete - What Do You Think? The key point is that any project manager who only knows how to a traditional plan-driven project management and tries to force-fit all projects to that approach will have a significant amount of difficulty in this environment. However, there are potential roles for a project manager who knows how to blend Agile and traditional plan-driven project management in the right proportions to fit a given situation. Team-level Role – There is officially no role for an “Agile Project Manager” at the team level in an Agile project; however, a project manager who is skilled in blending Agile and traditional plan-driven project management principles and practices can play a real value-added role as either a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, or an Agile Coach.Hybrid Agile Role – For lots of reasons, companies choose to implement a hybrid Agile approach and this is an ideal environment for an Agile Project Manager to work in. An example would be an Agile contracting situation.Enterprise-level Role – As projects grow in scope and complexity to an enterprise level, there is a much more significant need for a dedicated Agile Project Manager role. As an example, I did a case study in my latest book on a project at Harvard Pilgrim that involved over 100 Agile teams – you just can’t do an effort like that without some form of project/program management.Here’s a job description I have written for an “Agile Project Manager”: Agile Project Manager Job Description Chuck CobbAuthor of ""The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile""Check out: Agile Project Management Training Online for Project Managers",2021-03-05T11:39:27.596Z,"Is the project manager role no longer required due to the popularity of agile software development in the IT sector?

Fixed price is very appealing to a customer because they can control their costs, thus having a higher chance of successfully achieving the business case that the project is founded on.It’s a simpler model that allows progress to be understood more easily. Many IT project stakeholders and senior decision makers are non-technical and don’t have the time to get into the detail of the project. Waterfall allows for scope to be defined and a relatively accurate percentage complete to be reported towards delivering that scope. Software projects are often just one component of an overarching technology / transformation program, and one on which business operations or other projects have a dependency. Therefore it is appealing for senior leaders to get a clear understanding of progress and the expected completion date.These advantages apply more to smaller, more controllable and discrete projects. As software projects increase in complexity, the above advantages tend to dissipate for the following reasons: Increasing complexity of contracts and pricing means that the customer often doesn’t understand what they’re signing up for. This means that the supplier can hit the customer with ‘change requests’ on the contract, thus increasing cost and time for the project.Unforeseen challenges can lead to problems in scope and design and increase the occurrence of technology risks. This may lead to extensions or additional phases, therefore negating the purported simpler model.

First of all, it is worth understanding what I believe Waterfall was originally designed to do. I strongly advise everybody to read Steve Mcconnell’s Sofware Project Survival Guide.This gives a strong clue as to the true aim of Waterfall. In Mcconnell’s vision of waterfall, it is designed purely to keep a project to budget. It is to allow for projects to get canned if they run the risk of going over budget, and to fail early fail fast. With waterfall, you spend, maybe 10 percent of resources on figuring out exactly what is needed, and at that point, you may decide not to undertake the project and save yourself 90% of the cost. Another key principle of Mcconnell’s waterfall is to put more of the brainstorming and thrashing at the beginning phase to avoid expensive rewrites later on. This makes a lot of sense and I don’t see why so many people like to jump on the bandwagon about why waterfall is so rubbish and dead, with agile being so much better. The question is not aimed to start the whole agile versus waterfall debate. I want to propose a completely alternative opinion/methodology on development within an enterprise, I am not even sure if this exists. I call it nihilistic development. Nihlistic development means accepting your company spends x amount of money a year, so just employ the best people to deliver what is right and reduce process management. Effectively, a company which uses significant amounts of technology will spend between 5–25% on technology. That effort will be on a combination of business as usual, and greenfield. A business which is connected to its goals, well aligned, with high functioning individuals, really doesn’t need project management at all. This might sound like a surprise, but it is not. Your company has already committed X % of its budget to a group of people who are fully aligned to your business, know what needs developing, retiring, and enhancing. Your leader(s) can direct on the priorities. Once you start to remove the burden of estimating effort, letting developers be autonomous, open up dialogue between the business and development - remember, you need good people, you find productivity increases. People who really understand business and can build solutions. Infrastructure and support staff will also be connected to the business goal too. People will state this idea is lunacy, but I redefine lunacy to be, having a scrum agile team of say, 2 developers, 2 business analysts, 1-2 testers, a scrum master, business people plus other people too - programme managers, PMO’s.

604219b8ed76476feda1e4d9,https://www.quora.com/Does-Agile-replace-project-management?-,"No. Agile is a thought process where as Project Management is a collection of processes and related activities done to manage the project. So Agile doesnt replace Project Management. What actually happens where this question could have come from is - in most of the Agile methods and Frameworks, we don’t have Project Manager role. This might have created an impression that Agile replaces Project Management. Its easy to understand - if you follow this. Role and activities carried out by that role are two different things. For example - when you hire a taxi - the driver has a role to perform. When you drive on your own - you are playing the role of the driver. So having a taxi driver is a dedicated role that drives the vehicle. In agile, you drive the vehicle instead of depending on a specific role. The activities done by the Taxi Driver and you while driving are same - change gears, steer the vehicle, apply brakes, park the vehicle, check the fuel etc. In agile methods and frameworks, the activities required to manage the project are done by respective roles. For example in Scrum, the Product Owner manages the performance of the Product Development. Development Team manages themselves. So the key activities required by the Project Management are taken care of by the existing roles in Scrum. So we don’t need dedicated PM role. But the activities required for Project Management are done by inbuilt roles. 1",2021-03-05T11:44:56.477Z,"Does Agile replace project management? ",Quora

Answer: No So let's explore why, Gantt charts have been around alooooooong time, like many many decades.Morpheus says 1910 I have no idea if that is true but its longer than agile by a lot.Gantt charts rely on quantitive measurements which are known ahead of time.For example a house or mass manufactured circuit board will need a specific number of component parts depending upon a detailed specification or architecture design to come in to existanceGantts utilize and rely on duplicityContinuing with the house and mass produced circuit board those deliverables are very easily predicted and duplicated with the same specificationsTimescale convergence through experienceAs the duplicity of these projects is so similar trends in timescales and effort will converge.The predictability of building a replica house or circuit board becomes increasingly more reliable as you make more and more of the productWaterfall has different fundamentalsWith this increasing consistency you get to the fundamentals of the waterfall methodology which are fixed time and scope with variable resources This leads us to why they are not suitable for agile frameworks. The key principles of agile are fixed resources and time with variable scopeThis is a complete inverse of the waterfall mindsetMindset shiftThis rejection of the waterfall mindset means the tools traditionally used for waterfall management are not as suitable for agile projectsAgile projects rely of progressive elaboration and planning horizonsProgressive elaboration meansContinuously improving and detailing a plan.This occurs as more detailed information and more accurate estimates become available.Planning horizons are used to accompany progressive elaboration as it encourages deferring details until they are requiredEssentially we can understand less about something which will happen 5 years from now when compared with a task to be completed in the next two weeksAgile encourages changes through its process as the next iterations worth of effort are always negotiable until it is begun based on flexible priorities.Waterfall projects normally have clear dependency structures which determine prioritiesE.g. For a house you don't try to put the roof on without the walls in placeSo to sum up, Gantt charts are not very good at displaying a list of future priorities with different levels of detail in the breakdown of what's involved to fulfill the acceptance criteria. Thus for agile project management backlogs are king. They are becoming widely used at many levels across an organization, for example if you look at something like the SAFE framework. It has many backlogs for all types of functions in an organization.

Project (or product management) is handled through other roles, using a combination of responsibilities that collaborate on the need. For example, in Scrum, the PO is responsible for product vision, longer term planning, and stakeholder communication. The Team is responsible for deciding how to implement the product, for short term planning, and communication with other teams and technical stakeholders. If I see the term “Agile project manager”, I suspect foul play. I have never seen that role work anywhere, and it usually means that organisation has corrupted or compromised on Agile values and principles, in an effort to accommodate Agile to their old corporate culture and ways of working.",2021-03-05T11:49:22.396Z,"What is the project manager responsibility in Agile?

I had to introduce this in my last three companies.  This is critical.  Executives are swayed by numbers, facts, historicals.  You need to be able to show them ""supply vs. demand"" in terms they can understand.  (If you use points, you may need to translate them to something more concrete like ""man days"" for executive consumption.) 3. ""I'm coming to the realization that a backlog and roadmap should be separate but I'm having a hard time tying the two together in a view for executives."" This is a critical comment and is at the root of your challenge -- the backlog and the roadmap are separate but dependent.  The roadmap should be a separate ""view"" from the backlog, but it should NOT be ""separate"" from the backlog. 4. ""I'm having trouble managing our backlog for a product which has many stakeholders, customers, bugs, 1-off operational feature requests, and large strategic initiatives (larger features).""  Yup, been there, seen that.  You need to ""bucketize"" things more.  Here's a framework I've used in Jira:1. Large Feature Development -  mostly Stories, but could contain Tasks and Bugs.  These items are Tied to Strategic Initiatives, Stakeholders, Customers etc.  Tactically in Jira these should be in an Epic.  (Do you use Epics?  If not, you should.)  You might have an Epic for each Stakeholder, Customer or Initiative.  You also might need to phase or timebox your Epics so you can track them e.g. Customer X Phase 1, Q1, or Jan. 2. Enhancements - these are Stories or Tasks that aren't tied to the above (not tied to an Epic).  If you want, you could create an Epic called Enhancements as a bucket to track these items. 3. Maintenance - this is mainly bug fixes, but could also contain tasks.  5.  ""The product and tech team can hardly keep its head above water with the bugs and operational support let alone the new feature requests."" Once you start tracking velocity by the buckets above, you may be surprised how little of your capacity is going toward #1 (e.g. ""let along new feature requests"".  In one of my last companies it was 50% on average, but would dip down to 25% at times when quality issues or customer complaints spiked! If you are tracking velocity, but don't have buckets, run a simple query -- look at all ""issues"" completed in the last few months by issue type.  What percent are Stories?  Pretty low I bet?  This is a good proxy.  If you're not tracking velocity or points, just do a percent by count e.g. assume each issue is worth 1 point. You need to be able to show this data to show management how your capacity is being spent (how demand exceeds supply, and how over burdened your team is).  The problem with most companies is: 1. they aren't tracking velocity and 2. they haven't created high level buckets that executives can understand.  So executives assume they have 100% of engineering capacity for Feature Development, AND plans and roadmaps are created using that assumption, and engineering teams get F*cked. SummarySo in summary, you need to create more hierarchy in Jira.  How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.  You need one backlog, but you have to be able to ""roll it up"", ""drill it down"", and ""slice and dice it"".  You need to create various ""views"".  One for executive consumption and prioritization, and others for various teams and day to day management.  Jira is not great at hierarchy, but it can do it now and its getting better.  Have you checked out the new Portfolio Management capabilities?  I haven't used it yet, but it is suppose to help with some of these challenges. Out of the box Jira has essentially 4 levels of natural hierarchy:1. Project  (which I think is a misnomer personally)2. Epic3. Story/Task/Bug4. Sub-Task (child to Story/Task/Bug) You should leverage these levels to enable roll out and drill down and help you manage your backlog.  Sub-tasks are generally way under utilized.  People are often lazy and create a Task vs. creating a sub-task to a Story.  Also use Projects carefully, because moving issues between projects requires ""moving"" the tickets.  Projects can have different workflows and meta data so moving tickets between projects should be infrequent IMO.  Projects should be aligned to Cross Function Teams IMO.  Sometimes this means one Project for a whole Engineering organization or a Project per Strategic Initiative.  I've generally used the Component field to track component teams, but there's now a Team field as well.  I've also added ""Strategy"" and ""Product"" fields at times.  Using fields is not ideal however, as this creates a dependency on data entry.  Things like Epics, populate this data automatically when you drag the issue into that bucket.",2021-03-05T11:49:41.737Z,"What is the best way to manage both a roadmap and a backlog?

You could undertake your literature review with the stated intent of finding gaps in current practice. Then consider those gaps, explore them in your discussion. Then choose ONE of them to form the question for the remainder of your research. When I completed my masters, I would research a theme until it felt like I had found as much as I was going to, then I sat back and used thematic analysis to find what was being discussed. I then used insights from that to help provide more focused search parameters, and went around again … and then again … and then again. This was an iterative and incremental approach, which felt totally appropriate and natural given my research domain. However, it does take longer. If this sounds attractive to you as a research approach, then look at the research techniques of: Problematization[1] (looking for gaps in current practice)Ground Theory Lite[2] (iterative research conducted on secondary sources)And maybe have a look at my masters thesis, where I discuss this research approach more fully: ‘The Paradox of Agile Transformation.

That said, there is also a dimension of the enterprise that is implementing the ERP solution / adopting the out-of-box processes. It is not unusual to require migration from legacy ERP, integration with other systems, automating manual processes, and complex organization changes. The latter dimension will most likely add many unknowns, especially foreign to the consulting firm hired to deliver. In addition, it is quite typical for an enterprise ERP implementation to run a couple of years, which, as the 3rd dimension, will surely incur changes over time. So the question is how to better embrace or manage the unknowns or changes, to minimize surprises? naturally some of the key concepts or idea for Agile will be quite helpful, for example, MVP (rationalize the scope, maybe start with a line of business, a region, a process area, or a pilot), a reasonably-sized cross-functional team and quick / short feedback loops (to reduce communication gaps), clear product ownership for faster / clean decision, etc. There is an interesting writing from McKinsey & Company on Agile in enterprise resource planning: A myth no more. Another example is the notorious Phoenix Pay system project by Canadian federal government (just google it). While Payroll may seem a largely mature enterprise function (mostly known?), but perhaps the project was just too big, the product to start was too complex, unknown organization complexities, even project team member comes and goes, changes added up during the few years, the project team were too big with many communication gaps, the feedback loop stretched too far apart. The point is, Agile or Waterfall is not quite a black and white / binary answer. Also keep in mind if any opportunity or benefit to breath some Agile spirit, or try hybrid Agile.

This results in a horrible mess. This do increase the pressure on the remaining developers as the required timeline is inching closer and they have to deliver their deliverables as well as handle the code of the the other two developers who had left.

The reality is that many features we think we want are never used, many features we didn’t think about are actually needed, and / or the market has changed. With agile development, we identify the core value of what we are developing, identify the minimum set of features that will prove (or disprove) that value, and deliver them in small batches that can more easily be validated for quality. We assume we are probably wrong in some way and will need to adjust our understanding or re-think the value goals. The sooner we can discover that, the less work it is to fix it and the less money we spend doing the wrong thing. The problem with most companies using the process is they don’t understand the principals and goals. Instead, they focus on ceremony and keep using the old assumptions.

When combined team meets for grooming, move stories that are now INVEST[2] grade, with points, to Ready. People will see that you don’t have to groom everything (and you can’t, practically). When Sprint planning, pull pointed stories into Sprint/Ready until you have your velocity. As you’re working them, move them to Sprint/In Progress. If your team wants to decompose them into tasks, they can do that. Put the story number on each task card, and the developer initials, too. This is like a little Kanban board. The team can see if they’re starting too much, making everything slow to finish. When implementers are done, move to Sprint/Done. When accepted by customer, move to Done. There are many variations on this scheme. This is the one I use because I think it’s the simplest you can make it without losing a key concept. It’s a lot easier for everyone to be able to think in Agile after doing it this way for a while. Tools have their advantages—I use them a lot—but they are best after everyone groks[3] the overall flow of work, and that’s much easier to learn with cards. Tools easily take over our brains. When it’s time to do the first release plan, I have a little Excel spreadsheet which generates two Flight Paths (conservative and 50/50) relative to a scope. It’s a powerful visual of another key concept—how Agile lets you trade scope and time and protect a deadline. Deep learning happens with paper. Some people seem to need a tool to take it seriously though. Footnotes[1] User Story Mapping - Jeff Patton & Associates[2] New to agile?

Typically you might have joint hardware/software teams working on a product - this was my experience. We were building a medical diagnostic device with of course a physical design and technology, an operating system, and specialised modules for diagnostic algorithms. In our case, we had an overall (waterfall) project plan for the device, and only the software subteam worked explicitly agile. Some things to consider - if using sprints, lengthen them. Hardware development cycle times are usually longer. You cannot be quite as experimental - prototyping and doing early manufacturing runs are expensive so up front design is useful for the hardware components, while the software is relatively easy and cheap (maybe) to change. You could even run one long hardware sprint in parallel with shorter software sprints so as hardware is pushed out, the software team can iterate on a more frequent basis. If you are building hardware/software hybrids, be aware that late hardware changes has a big impact on software downstream. Of course sometimes hardware redesign must happen, but you must make allowance for this in terms of software rework. Software teams building hardware/device products often have to write software to correct hardware design flaws - this is the nature of the beast. For me working on this project in an agile way was very rewarding. The project was experimental and largely proved and tested as we went, so agile helped us cope better with frequent hardware changes and other problems better than a standard project management approach would have. We did have battles and frequent arguments with the project management team, and with our business sponsors as it was almost impossible to provide accurate forward estimates of completion.",2021-03-05T11:57:54.035Z,"Does SpaceX use Agile for project management?

During work, it is possible to evaluate progress and incurred costs of the project in a clear layout. Look how IC Project looks like:  I appreciate IC Project for having a lot of functionality in itself, and they are perfectly matched to my needs. I don’t need additional training to learn the service, because it is a simple program for everyone. An important issue is also that I have everything I need in one system, so I don’t have to use other programs additionally. Features: Project ManagementTasksCalendarMonitoring and controlResource managementKanban cardsAfter the decision to implement, I have full control over the tasks, projects, working time of my employees and many other aspects. System has a built-in calendar, which allows to manage time by creating events and meetings. Another important issue is the built-in messenger, so that all employees can talk to each other in the system.  In my opinion, IC Project distinguishes: Modern design: Recognising the importance of this aspect in our times, we have made every effort to achieve the expected results. Effect? Feel free to check it out. Cutting-edge technology: The tool was built on the latest software version, which directly translates into speed and efficiency. Instant implementation: A few minutes of configuration allows you to fully utilize the ICP capabilities without having to read through the documentation. Data security: In the age of having almost all of one’s life on a disk in the cloud, the safety of our data was one ofthe priorities during its construction. Global reach: Global reach attained by working within the web model and applying time zones. Unlimited number of projects: Regardless of the intensity of your company's work, ICP will manage any number of projects!  What’s more? 1. You do not use many tools at the same time 2. You do not have to climb a learning curve 3. You do not have to keep the customer updated about work progress 4. You do not have to constantly be on your phone 5. You will not risk that you will not like it 6. No need to fear the future of ICP IC Project is a relatively new product of this type on the market, so it was difficult to trust me at the beginning. It certainly helped a free trial period, which I recommend everyone to use at the start. Test, read, try different functions and then decide if it's worth it.

There’s actually a lot of project management going on in an Agile approach although you may not recognize it as “project management” because you may not find anyone with the title of “Project Manager” and it’s a very different kind of “project management”. The functions that would normally be performed by someone called a “Project Manager” have been distributed among the various roles on the team and it’s a much more adaptive form of “project management” rather than being totally plan-driven. In a modern approach to project management, we shouldn’t be force-fitting all projects to a traditional plan-driven approach to project management. The right approach is to go in the other direction and fit the methodology to the nature of the project and it’s not a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes as many people seem to think.

Analysis and design taking forever, and the end result seems to be wrong or out of date once you hand it over. Developers unhappy; are they doing stupid things out of spite? Forget “Agile”. Let's tackle these problems one by one. Firstly, the really long delivery cycles have got to go. Let's think “work package breakdown”, where each package is small and can be delivered to the users. They'll have an opinion, of course, so we'll have to listen and adjust what we build next. Which means there's no point figuring out everything, just enough short-term detail backed up by a outline high level plan that evolves as we find things out. No more MS Project, no more 6-month analysis! Start delivering from day one. Financing needs special attention; “build until the money runs out, or we achieve enough, or things change too much, or we decide we don't like it”. The good news: no matter where we stop, we'll have delivered a lot, so nothing was wasted. Now we're delivering in small chunks. Let's pack as much in as we can, but it all has to work. That forces us to think in evolving steps, not final picture. We don't have time to wait for committee approval either, so bring decision-making and -maker into the team (while we're at it, let's try to colocate everyone and swap thoughts all the time). Our team are now fast decision-makers who have all the facts and deliver quickly. We'll give them space to improve what they do; time spent will be paid off in far higher performance. They'll need to trust each other, so the team should be long-lived. And because this is risky for everyone, keep it transparent with senior management protection. Use charts showing progress on a daily basis, and when things go wrong, identify and fix right away, no matter how painful. And that's it. When you commit 100% to fast delivery and continual improvement, you get these “Agile” practices naturally emerging. That higher performance, fast time-to-market and high user satisfaction is why Agile has become the dominant methodology, but there are areas it's not suitable for. Most members of the team appreciate the increased autonomy; it's hardest on the PM as this is a complete cultural change that many can't make. And therein lies the problem. Most IT management chains and power roles are filled with people (ex-PMs) who really believe that Waterfall is the way to deliver. When the org tries to adopt Agile as seen in startups like Spotify, it's superficial, with none of the two big points above properly implemented. And so one more failed Agile project, and the PMs remain convinced that Waterfall is the only way to build, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Evolution is a decades-long process, so I've seen a lot of organisations kick out the PMO layer and reform around Agile when they get desperate. So if you really want Agile in your org, decide how much time you have, chose the right strategy, then bring in experts to help. You're betting the farm on this; do it right.

From small scale to large scale, organizations around the world are dependent on project management systems to deliver software faster by the minute. Whether it is team workflow management or timing, these tools help to ensure that everything is going well without any obstacles. While there are so many different project management approaches, Agile is considered one of the most practical and flexible software development mechanisms that exist today. How is it any different? Handling dynamic projects Traditional project management follows has a linear approach, whenever a change or an iteration happens, usually, the team starts working on it from scratch. Whereas, when a time follows agile methodology a team is required to be adaptable to change at any given point, they can actively loop in the team members and stakeholders and ship the next version of the software with the changes incorporated. Bottlenecks and dependencies are identified as there is open communication between the team instead of following a process for it. Adapting to change In the traditional approach, every step and process is defined and has to be adhered to. Any change has to go through multiple approvals. The scope in itself has very limited scope or flexibility towards change. Agile encourages constant changes and is extremely adaptable to change. It is not rigid in nature. The flexibility it offers is the main benefit which is super necessary at this point. Cost In traditional software development, the customer involves only before the start of the development process. So, there might be a number of mistakes and a large amount of money needs to be spent to rework on them based on resource. Since in the Agile software development, the customer is more involved in every part of the project, the corrections can be made once the defects are detected. This helps us in saving costs in terms of resource. The basic concept behind Agile software development is that it delves into constant changes and united effort to bring out results rather than a predefined process. Adaptive planning is perhaps the biggest feature of Agile and one that makes it a crowd favorite among project managers.

But, you should also know there will be plenty of questions related specifically to the position. Are you smartly prepared to answer those questions? And do you know some of the major areas where you’ll be questioned about your relevant skills and experience? Well, that makes your heart start racing. Examples of Project Management Interview Questions This post is to help you out to make your interview process productive. Gear yourself up with these thoughtful questions you may be asked. Let’s start: What are the three key challenges for your industry today and how do you tackle them? The interviewer expects you to have a knowledge about the project management industry. Start with the challenges and solutions as well. Some can be from your past experience as a project manager like increasing project complexity, continued skilled resource scarcity, increasing pace of change, lack of stakeholder management, meeting the customer’s requirements, and so on. This is critical for the success of any project manager as the challenges will always come along your way. How do you give a start when a new project comes up? You’ll be asked this to have a better understanding of your work strategy. Tell them how you set priorities for your work, you make schedules to coordinate the tasks, or use real-life examples to better explain how you set priorities. Make sure your strategy makes you look smart to handle projects and use your team’s strength for your advantage. How do you delegate responsibilities? Put forward relevant examples of how you’ve done it in the past whether it’s by conducting brief meetings, using project management tool, and so on or your great ideas to do it in future. Of course, delegation is an important part of every project and knowing how to delegate effectively will help the team feel empowered. Are you proactive? Is it important? A project manager needs to manage any changes in time or cost to project progress as early as possible. Usually, the projects are unpredictable, so the manager needs to anticipate the problems as soon as possible. They should be proactive to make quick plans anytime. Be confident in showing that you can handle risks during the course of the project. How do you make sure your team meets all the deadlines? There is a solid deadline whenever a project comes up. The interviewer would want to know how you will manage your team effectively to make sure it meets all the deadlines. There is always a need for the project manager to communicate each person in the team how they have to hold their weight in completing the project. It is expected from a project manager to work together to finish a project within the designated deadline. Explain the difference between Agile and Scrum? It is helpful to know the difference between Agile and Scrum for an Agile interview. Agile is a broad spectrum, the framework of approaches that encourage “just-in-time” production. It is used in project management while Scrum is just a form of the Agile that describes the process more concisely. Agile is a practice whereas scrum is a procedure to carry on this practice. Agile is the broader umbrella where Scrum falls under. How do you plan an Agile project? They want to know how you set estimates about the cost of something and about the deliverables. Will you be able to manage the ROI of the products being built by the team. You’ll have to maintain the scope, schedule, and budget in the Agile world. Have you managed remote teams? Everything can never be all under one roof. When you come across outsourced resource, using dynamic project management tools will help meet the necessary remote team management. Knowing how to how to get them on-board, which tools to use, how to manage people and resources is a crucial point for project managers.(more) Continue Reading",2021-03-05T12:07:18.457Z,"What questions have you been asked in an interview for project manager or on Agile methodology?

To “check” whether or not a goal is “good” (not correct, but properly formulated) we check that the goal is: Specific (e.g., not arbitrary, not complex (more than one goal, applies to one idea)Measurable (e.g., we can quantify whether it’s been achieved)Achievable (e.g., it can reasonably be achieved, or is realistic)Relevant (e.g., it’s useful within the business context)Timebound (e.g., it can be achieved in a specific timeframeSo, in short, SMART tells us if the proposed Goal is evalid - but not if it’s correct. INVEST is most typically applied to User Stories on Agile projects, although it’s functionality isn’t limited to that. Using INVEST doesn’t mean the User Story/requirements is “right,” but it does help us understand if it’s “good.” In that way, it’s function is identical so SMART - just a different toolset. To “check” whether of not a User Story is good (not correct, but properly formulated) we check that the story is: Independent (e.g., can stand alone as a single idea) Negotiable (e.g., size or priority is open for discussion) Valuable (e.g., there is demonstrated business value) Estimable (e.g., it can be estimated and timeboxed) Small (or Sized Appropriately) (e.g., should fit within a single sprint or iteration) Testable (e.g., can be tested to ensure the intent was met). So, in short, INVEST tells us if the proposed User Story is valid - but not if it’s correct. As you can see, SMART and iNVEST serve a very similar purpose, and can (potentially) be used interchangeably. Good Luck!

Just see that you get a proper fit for the situation in your company, get a proper coach and then brace yourself for getting some really ugly, nasty things unearthed and openly spoken about. Because one of the most valuable - and in the beginning rather painful- aspects about agility is, that it’s brutally honest in pointing at errors, mistakes, things that go rather down the hill and other not so well spoken of stuff in the company. Handling this input properly is crucial, because you can’t get better if you don’t have an environment in which people trust they’re safe to say things management doesn’t like to hear or also actually have heavy - professional - fights.

Actually, that's not quite as unreal as it sounds...before there was Agile, there was Waterfall.  And Waterfall consisted of the creation of massive amounts of documentation before any work started, which was followed by checkpoint meetings to ensure that everything was in place, followed by more checkpoints as work progressed, to make sure the right boxes in the documents were being checked off, followed by Change Control Meetings, where new checkboxes were added, some checkboxes were removed, and others changed entirely.  Add to this the deathmarch of checking off boxes that may or may not have been relevant to the market and to the users, and eventually you'd get a release out after expending 9 months of development effort to put out something that was reasonably responsive to the needs of the market 9 months ago. In short, there was a lot of detailed documentation, a long tail of development execution, checked not by market need but by that documentation, and there were lots of processes and procedures in place to ensure that what was documented was what was being built, regardless of whether there was still a market need for that work. Having said all of that, I do want to address the second part of your question. Agile is not a must even today (heresy!!).  It's one tool in a collection of approaches that may or may not be appropriate depending on the business you're in, the product you're building, the development team you're working with, and many other factors.  It's also not a binary thing - there are many Agile practices that one can work into a more Waterfall approach, while still not being ""true"" Agile.  And yes, there are benefits to this, though the hard-core Agile evangelists will crucify me for saying so.",2021-03-05T12:15:36.431Z,"How did project managers carry out their role before Agile and why is it a must today?

I just wanna my share my knowledge in manual testing with might be useful. WATERFALL MODEL: ALSO KNOWN AS ! The Waterfall Model was first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. SIMPLE ! It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed fully before the next phase can begin. This type of software development model is basically used for the for the project which is small and there are no uncertain Neue Internetpräsenz the end of each phase, a review takes place to determine if the project is on the right path and whether or not to continue or discard the project. OVERVIEW !  When to use the waterfall model: This model is used only when the requirements are very well known, clear and fixed.Product definition is stable.Technology is understood.There are no ambiguous requirementsAmple resources with required expertise are available freelyThe project is short.Very less customer interaction is involved during the development of the product. Once the product is ready then only it can be demoed to the end users. Once the product is developed and if any failure occurs then the cost of fixing such issues are very high, because we need to update everywhere from document till the logic. AGILE ! Agile development model is also a type of Incremental model. Software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. This results in small incremental releases with each release building on previous functionality. Each release is thoroughly tested to ensure software quality is maintained. It is used for time critical applications. Extreme Programming (XP) is currently one of the most well known agile development life cycle model.  When to use Agile model: When new changes are needed to be implemented. The freedom agile gives to change is very important. New changes can be implemented at very little cost because of the frequency of new increments that are produced.To implement a new feature the developers need to lose only the work of a few days, or even only hours, to roll back and implement it.DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AGILE AND WATERFALL MODEL 1>Agile separates the project development lifecycle into sprints. Software development process is divided into distinct phases in WF model 2>It follows an incremental approach Waterfall methodology is a sequential design process. 3>Agile methodology is known for its flexibility. Waterfall is a structured software development methodology so most times it can be quite rigid. 4>Agile can be considered as a collection of many different projects. Software development will be completed as one single project. 5>Agile is quite a flexible method which allows changes to be made in the project development requirements even if the initial planning has been completed. There is no scope of changing the requirements once the project development starts in waterfall model. 6>Test plan is reviewed after each sprint The test plan is rarely discussed during the test phase. 7>Agile development is a process in which the requirements are expected to change and evolve. The method is ideal for projects which have definite requirements and changes not at all expected. https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.credosystemz.com/training-in-chennai/best-software-testing-training-in-chennai/best-manual-testing-training-in-chennai/?utm_source%3Dquora%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dquora%2520traffic&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1527228953213000&usg=AFQjCNFcnOv0X0psaNR7WDPP0vnPGBN0Lg Continue Reading",2021-03-05T12:42:02.734Z,"What is the difference between the waterfall and agile development models?

Spent 20 years managing the hub of delivering world wide engineering data to world wide manufacturing, with multiple networks, servers, interfaces to adjoining systems, multiple business processes, user interfaces, release and change control and more . Software packages come and go, are provided by a vendor who may be good about customizing to your requirements, but you better be a large paying customer or you will not get it. So, here is my answer - the best project management tool is your brain, and a plain piece of paper and a pen. At the start of a project, write down three these things: What is your deliverable? A good example of a detail needed is “A Car”. So, SUV, Sedan? Sport model? Engine size, transmission, suspension, 4 wheel?, 3 wheel?, computer chip for what functions, colors, fuel range, fuel type, —- what are your requirements? When is your delivery date? What is getting in your way - what are your issues? What priority are each of the issues? Who is fixing them? All your decisions will be based on these, no matter what “tool” you use. If you do not know in detail the answer to all those questions, you do not have a project, so go get them. Cannot describe deliverable in detail? Go clarify requirements. Not sure you can commit to a delivery date? Answer all the other questions in detail and you will know the answer to this one. Issues cover a lot of ground - money, enough people, communication with team, customer and vendors.

The direct answer to your question is: if requirements are all known and well defined, known to be immutable, if the allocated resources are known to be correct, if all dependencies are taken care of, it's the perfect fit for what I would call ""strict blackbox waterfall approach"", with zero outside intervention, just following the plan to the letter. The reality is that there is no such a thing as ""all requirements known"" and ""all requirements being immutable"". Some requirements are unknown and some of them change during the project. The only way to deal with uncertainty is to split it in small chunks, execute, check the outcome, reassess and start again (a summary of what Deming already defined as PDCA). Which means do small ""waterfalls"" in short periods of time to allow for reassessment and adjust the directions. We decided to call that ""Agile"" (It's a very rough definition, I know) The problem is that most people that started recently, that don't have a full grasp of what project management really is and how we have evolved to this point start to draw conclusions based on non-existent assumptions. One extreme conclusion from old days is that ""it is possible to map all requirements"" and by doing so it's possible to make a very precise plan. An ""estimate"" becomes a ""prediction"" and we start talking about ""standard deviation"", assuming that this is a precise and repeatable process. Of course this is wrong. The standard deviation assumption alone is broken because a project does not follow a Normal distribution. It's complex nature asks for a Paretto distribution where ""20% of the project can take 80% of the time"" as we all know from anecdote. On the other extreme, we understand that the previous predicament is wrong and we draw another wrong conclusion: because predictions are impossible so estimates are also impossible, and it's not worth even trying, so we assume that everything is completely unknown and we iterate forever until everybody ""feels"" like we got to a ""finished product"". And when it's done? Well, it's done when it's done, not one minute before. But we will not attempt to give an ""estimate"" - making the confusion that ""estimate"" equates to ""prediction"". People call the first extreme ""traditional"" or ""waterfall"" model and the second an ""Agile"" model. Both definitions and conclusions are very wrong. People should never draw conclusions based on unreal or non-existant assumptions. Everything has context. Let's assess the most common ground:  most projects are not the Research & Development (R&D) type, where there is a very abstract hypothesis that requires hard science and deep experimentation. Most projects are mashups of existing use cases. Ecommerces, Content Management Systems, ERPs, Social Networks, etc.any product can have as many features as the creativity or demand of the stakeholders wish. We know that we must ""prioritise"". Problem is that most people forget that every project is never about the features or the amount of code produced. It's always about the ""Goals"". ""What problem is this product trying to solve"". Now instead of thinking about ""what features feel important"" we must ask ""what features are actually relevant to achieve that specific goal"". Thinking that way we can quickly find what must be in and what can be out for a next version.it's unreal to think that everything will flow smoothly according to arbitrary plans. Plans work depending on assumptions. People usually forget about assumptions. For example: we know we can produce a particular set of HTML screens in 10 days, but the assumption is that the client will deliver all the required photoshops on day 1. What we state is: ""it's going to take 10 days if the required assets are available on day X, otherwise the project will delay as many days as it takes for the assets to become available"". This is an acceptable condition of any plan. A fixed price proposal has to have several of those assumptions in place because a plan without assumptions is just wishful thinking.most products can be described as a collection of ""work breakdown structures"" (WBS). Yes, this is ""traditional"" lingo, and yes it's a correct one. As I've stated before, most projects are just mashups of existing ""use cases"". If we can describe a project in terms of a collection of those ""use cases"" any experienced programmer can easily start seeing ""orders of magnitude"". For example, this simple project is one of those simple ecommerces together with a simple CMS. Considering the requirements we know that those usually take 2 months for the ecommerce and 1 month for the CMS. So the project is likely to take at least 3 months to be completed. Is this a precise prediction? No, but it's a fair estimate. An experienced professional also knows it takes time to kickoff the project, there is overhead involved in integrating those parts, there is overhead to do proper quality & assurance (Q&A), deploying to production, etc. Let's say this adds up to another month, now we're getting close to a 4 months project. That's how we do bottom-up analysis. Again, this is not prediction, this is a ballpark estimate.we don't need to assume that we know all the requirements and that those requirements will never change. On the contrary, the assumptions guarantee the validity of the plan. An assumption changes, we need to have clear rules of engagement. For example: ""if we replace one feature with another that takes roughly the same time, we don't need to change the original deadlines and costs"" or ""if a required asset takes more time than predicted to arrive, we assume the deadline will be delayed at least the same amount of days"", ""if the last payment is not made, intellectual property of the produced assets will not be transferred"", etc. This is ""flexibility"" and yes, fixed priced contract can be that flexible. a project will use all the time you give to it, this is an anecdote that proves to be true many times. The problem is that developers don't maintain a steady productivity throughout the project. They usually start slowly, pick up steam, and are at maximum velocity on the second half of the project. ""Agile"" methods try to minimise this difference. If you measure where you are you can correct faster. If you measure later in the process, you don't have any more time to correct. That's why the ""fail fast"" assumption is so important in any kind of project. Fixed price projects can ""fail small in the beginning"" we adjust. It's unreasonable to think that clients are going to throw away their money for nothing. They get upset when we don't give them options. For example, telling them at the end of the project that we will need an additional month is very unreasonable. Telling them that we might need an additional month, at the first week of the project, is reasonable. It can happen. We assume the cost for that 1 week if it's necessary, but the client still has time to steer and corrections can be made. They can decide to cut something from the scope. They can decide that the extra time is worth it. But they have the option. The only thing that really hurt projects are developers that hide the problems until they can't be fixed anymore. It all comes down to experience. Most people can read all the available literature and not really grasp what it means to manage a project. The summary of everything I've said is that it really doesn't matter using ""traditional"" methods or ""agile"" methods. All methods are tools, we use what's best for the current situation, no more, no less.  If you can take anything from all I've said, remember this:  fixed price projects are not bad: most people simply don't know how to manage them. clients never know everything they need, it's our job to fill in the gaps and create clear rules of engagement.estimates are not predictions (there's a reasons they are different words). Estimates are orders of magnitude.a project proposal must delineate clear assumptions, not only the detailed scope.agile processes are important to make the team fail fast. a project ""proposal"" is not a ""promise for deliverables"" it's a proposal for a relationship with mutual responsibilities. It doesn't matter if it's an flexible scope project or a fixed price project. Both will fail without clear rules of engagement. A product that doesn't have ""goals"" will never be successfully ""finished"".Those are all general understandings that I think people should think about before talking about ""I'll use methodology X"" or anything like that. it's not the methodology that creates a successful project, it's the understanding of what you're trying to achieve that does it.",2021-03-05T12:48:44.822Z,"Which factors determine whether a project should be managed better agile than traditional in your experience?

As we see from the answers that can mean somewhat different things to different people. For my purposes I considered the question like “what are the 7 most common causes of waste, in terms of time, effort or money, that are seen in software development projects?” With that in mind here is my list: Rewriting instead of refactoring. A very common practice is for a business to write an application, get it to a working state and then leave it alone. The code stagnates and is crippled by quick (and undocumented) fixes eventually the application becomes a support nightmare and everyone wants to write a new application all over again. You can then spend a year or more developing the new application. Over that year you are tying up developers, project managers, testers, environments and spending money. After all of that what you end up with is a new application that does exactly what the old application did but with new and undiscovered bugs. A far more savvy approach is to evolve the old application over time. Allow important refactoring and encourage the teams to keep this application current.Ignoring technical debt. This is related to my first point but important to expand on. As software is developed there will always be times when quick fixes or sub-optimal decisions are made. Schedule, budget or resources will often force a team to do something that they know is not the best but needs to be done to solve a more immediate problem. This is fine, what is not fine is forgetting about it afterwards and deciding to live with the consequences of that decision forever. This is where a culture of encouraging refactoring and evolving code will save a lot of time and problems.Strict separation of roles. By this I mean situations where developers develop, business analysts analyse, architects design and so on. Everyone has a silo of interest. Everything makes perfect sense in your own silo and everyone assume that all of the other teams are on the same page. The end result is always a lot of confusion and time spent sorting out different assumptions when you try to put it all together. Each component may be fine on its own but the lack of cohesion is easy to spot.Lack of understanding. A lot of money and effort is wasted on poor choices made because the people who made them lack a basic understanding of the decision they are making. This can be developers who don’t understand the business problem they are trying to solve; clients requesting features who don’t understand the cost and consequence of the request; etc. People given authority to make decisions need to have at least some understanding of the impact their decisions will incur.Manual testing. Not everything can be automated but any time you find testers verifying something that could be done automatically you are seeing lost time and effort.Poorly conceived development and test environments. Developers and testers spend their entire day working with the tools and environments that the project has set up. If the code streams are confusing and are often broken then developers will spend large amounts of their time sorting out broken dependencies, finding broken code and fixing problems in the build environment. If the test servers are slow testers will spend large amounts of time waiting for tests to complete. If a deployment takes four hours (and that’s surprisingly common) then everyone needs to wait for four hours to get a new deployment.Red tape. By this I mean processes that slow down development but don’t improve the quality. By way of example I have seen development processes where a review and approval of a code change was required by three different groups. Even the most minor change such as fixing a mis-spelled message took two days to complete. The actual time on the fix may have been minutes, the time spent filling out the change requests, justifications, verification and organizing reviews by all of the teams took up the rest of the two days.

Ameba focuses more on organization structure in an Agile way and now it has been very popular in China and Japan for the past decades. Because of Ameba, Each Ameba(a team) in our company forms of mostly 4 or 5 members so that we can keep running fast and lightly. Obviously, we are an agile team. In each Ameba(or a team), we manage our own product in ZenTao, we list the products or projects we are being involved in. An Ameba leader, you could take him as a Scrum Master, who will list all the stories of this product or project, which you could take it as a Product backlog, and there will be sprint planning, Ameba leader will create a plan with some stories of this product and create a corresponded sprint, it will last about one or two weeks. And after that, the team will communicate together and turn stories into tasks and they all get tasks which they should complete in this sprint.  We do a daily standup meeting and update our tasks and burndown chart every single day to make sure this sprint goes smoothly under control.  And what’s more for dev teams is that you could create a build for this sprint, and link all the finished stories and resolved bugs, and submit it to testers to do testing.  If a sprint has been finished completely, we could go to Product and create a release for this product in ZenTao. And that’s all of what should be done in a sprint. Agile really teaches us a lot for our team collaboration, it’s more a methodology, you have to implement with practices, maybe Kanban, or scrum, and use management tool is optional but it does really matter when it comes to online collaboration.

The more untested pieces get clogged up in the inventory the more difficult would it be to align them with the other pieces - they could literally start to ‘rust’ (ie because of the changing market requirements they may not remain ‘fit for purpose’ and fit to be joined up in the entire machinery). That is where the literal meaning of the word starts to surface. Quickly put to use what you have built - be nimble, be agile. Overall all of the above done together will make it easier for project dependencies to be raised, tackled and put to rest much easier than if everything were allowed to go ahead in an entropic environment. Who said Agile was easy or doesn’t need a plan ? It needs more planning but only for the immediate few weeks or iterations / sprints and not of the next 2 years out. Hope you see the difference from Waterfall methodologies and the true worth of Agile. if you look at the 4 values of Agile : Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools.Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation.Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation.Responding to Change Over Following a Plan.The stress is on individuals interacting and collaborating amongst themselves as much as with customers, in responding to change fast and creating working Software (more than just a comprehensive documentation). That doesn't say that processes and tools are less important, neither does it say that documentation, contracts or plans are bad. All of those are also ne Continue Reading",2021-03-05T12:54:15.829Z,"How does one manage project dependencies in agile methodology? ",Quora

Coming from a startup myself, I thought I’d share some thoughts from my team at ClickUp about what that isn’t the case: Are you using Excel for project management? There are only four reasons why you might actually use Excel as a project management tool: Your dad is a product manager with ExcelYour dad is Bill GatesYou are Bill Gates (Hi!)You are hoping to get money from Bill Gates (Uh, can we talk?) To be clear, Excel is an incredibly innovative tool for managing financial data, and has truly revolutionized business operations. But…it’s not a project management tool. Here are just a few way in which Excel actually damages team productivity: 1. Excel for Project Management Causes Communication Gaps In order to achieve success, project managers need to be in total communication with one another to share feedback, updates, comments, and questions. The problem is, there’s no way to do this in Excel. So, you can either layer Excel on top of your jumble of other project management programs, or you can seek out an all-encompassing tool to streamline your team’s communication. With ClickUp, team communication is easy because you can visualize each and every update happening within a task. ClickUp’s task description feature enables you to enter all the requirements of a task in its description box. You can also upload files and comment directly in a task, or take advantage of ClickUp’s Slack integration to chat with teammates about your workflow! 2. Tasks are Forgotten in Excel In many instances, the process of completing a task relies on a multitude of different people. However, just because you email someone to edit a document or follow up with a client, does not mean that they’ll remember to do so. This is a problem that is very apparent when using Excel for project management. Any task that is not included in a spreadsheet can easily fall to the wayside. ClickUp allows every team member to assign a task to anyone in the team and set a deadline. The assignee will see it as part of their to-do list and get a ClickUp notification. No need to email them, too. 3. Excel Doesn’t Work for Agile Project Management Agile Project Management is all about flexibility. More than ever, we understand we can’t plan ahead for every detail of a project. Our management styles have expanded to reflect this and remain open to unexpected issues and ideas that pop up along the way to completing a task. If Excel is your go-to software for project management, then you’ll know that the tool makes it very difficult to change course mid-project. Updating a spreadsheet is way more time consuming than updating a project management software. You will have to update, add or delete rows, and update functions and links between different worksheets. Additionally, often times the mammoth task of editing an Excel sheet falls to one project manager, to ensure no other employee makes an error that could through the entire project into disarray. In contrast, whatever changes team members make to their own tasks in ClickUp get automatically reflected in the project dashboards. Updating any dedicated project management software is easy.

The role that an ""Agile Project Manager"" might play in the real world is also not well-defined. I think PMI-ACP is a worthwhile certification relative to other Agile certifications; however, you should be aware of those limitations.  Before you go too far down the path of getting any certification, I think it's a good idea for you to have a clear vision for what you're going to do with it and, specifically, what job it is going to prepare you for in the real world.   I suggest that you take my free online course, ""How to Prepare for PMI-ACP Certification"".  It is not a typical PMI-ACP ""exam prep"" course that is only designed to help you pass the exam and not much else beyond that.  It goes beyond that and helps you understand the potential roles that an Agile Project Manager can play in the real world and how to go beyond simply passing the exam and prepare yourself for one of those real-world roles. http://agileprojectmanagementacademy.com/courses/how-to-prepare-for-pmi-acp-certification Chuck CobbAuthor of ""The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile""Check out my free online training at http://agileprojectmanagementacademy.com/",2021-03-05T12:58:15.432Z,"How can I use the Project Management Institute to become an agile project manager?
