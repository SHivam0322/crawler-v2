You just have to be really comfortable with numbers and data. A “modeler” would be someone who does more model-building (writes the software and/or researches the underlying science). A modeler would be an experienced developer or scientist, and might be part of the company’s research team who builds tools that allow the company to develop proprietary models. This allows the company to develop its own custom “perspective on risk,” i.e. the likely effect of catastrophes on its portfolio. Hope this helps and best of luck! Hi there!

With the data they produce, actuarial analysts help a company to determine how much to charge for products. Their job depends upon their industry. Actuarial analysts who work in the insurance industry use statistical models to analyze data and calculate the probability of and costs associated with certain events, such as product failure, accidents, property damage, injury and death. They use the results to design and price insurance policies. They also estimate the likelihood of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics and terrorists attacks, as well as assess the risk exposure of insurance companies. Actuarial analysts who work in financial services design investment and pension plans, while those who work as independent consultants may help businesses lower their insurance premiums by reducing their risk exposure. Actuarial analysts perform data analysis and statistical modeling and present their findings to senior management or clients. These workers may also be responsible for compiling relevant data and writing reports. Actuarial analysts are primarily employed by the insurance industry and often specialize in a particular area, such as health or life insurance. They are typically part of a team that includes business and insurance professionals such as underwriters and market research analysts. Most actuarial analysts hold full-time positions and work in offices, but consulting actuarial analysts may travel to meet with clients and work long hours to complete projects.

6043909bed76476feda2ecd2,https://www.quora.com/When-should-you-sign-a-pre-nup?-,"You should sign a prenuptial agreement prior to the marriage, because by definition a premarital agreement is one that is entered into before marriage. If you are considering marriage, consider entering into a prenuptial agreement early, since there are legal consequences for signing a prenup too close to your wedding. That said, as a general matter you should also avoid entering into a prenup too far ahead of your wedding (e.g. not more than 180 days in advance). The reason is that you don’t want to risk the argument that either party forgot what was in the prenup (or that they even signed one) by the time they get married, or that life circumstances have unknowingly made the prenup terms inaccurate by the time the marriage occurs. I would estimate that the majority of my clients enter into their prenuptial agreement 1 to 3 months prior to the marriage.  ​It may be the least-fun part of your wedding planning, but the reality is that divorce rates are too high to ignore. According to analysts and attorneys: 41%-50% of first-time marriages end in divorce60-67% of second marriages end in divorceAbout 74% of third marriages failUnfortunately, many marriages don’t have a fairy tale ending. Those divorcing couples who entered into a valid prenuptial agreement before getting married have a document that provides certainty as to their rights, minimizes conflict and legal costs. A well-drafted prenup is like a road map that helps both spouses find the path of least resistance and conflict amidst the emotional turmoil of the separation and divorce process. Smart, responsible adults routinely prepare for disasters as an obvious part of their everyday lives, but they generally protect against catastrophic events that have less than a 5% chance of occurring. The chances of a “marital disaster” approach 50% or higher, so every marrying couple should at least consider getting a prenup.",2021-03-06T14:24:27.924Z,"When should you sign a pre-nup? ",Quora

Before I begin. I am not a recommendation service. I don’t sell charting software. I am strictly an educator CMT. The retail financial news media pumps up stocks with adjectives and adverbs that inspire emotional responses for investors and traders who read those commentaries. This is INTENTIONAL as the financial services companies WANT investors and traders to react EMOTIONALLY rather than wisely, with knowledge, and all the information you need to invest or trade for YOUR benefit not theirs. Therefore you will find that there is a huge amount of negativity when it comes to stock charts or technical analysis. Please bear with me so you can understand the benefits of learning to read charts. Reading a stock chart is not a crystal ball, nor is it a magic prediction method. What it is is more musical than anything. Musicians make great investors and traders as they can read charts easily. For Example, below is the long term chart for PLUG. It IPO’d in 1999 at the peak of that TECH BUBBLE. It had a great idea, and potential growth product. However, it was too early to IPO as it had minimal revenues or earnings but needed to IPO to generate capital to continue its R&D.  Let’s do a basic analysis. The stock did not come to market at $1500.00 a share. The price is adjusted for splits and reverse splits so the pricing is not as it was at its original IPO. But this represents what it did from 2000 to current on a weekly basis. PLUG went into a long term downtrend called a “bear business cycle” and its stock moved down steadily from 2000 to 2013 when it high its final all time low and did a reverse split to stay listed. The bottom of 2013 represents the extreme low and the “survive by reinventing or go bankrupt” price level. PLUG survived. This is rare by the way not common. The fact that PLUG could manage to stay listed is remarkable due to the massive price loss. The stock recently developed a rounded bottom between 2014 - 2020. Notice also that the pandemic did not cause a any significant decline in price. This is a positive pattern. The lines drawn above price show the 2013–2020 “bottom completion” level which is a technical pattern and the “primary trend IPO bottom completion” level which is another critical level for the recovery of this stock after a serious loss of value. Also on this chart (not my software I just like this charting software) the upper right hand corner shows the Percentage of Shares Held by Institutions. This is a critical FUNDAMENTAL data set. this number is very important and it has been moving up which means more Buy Side Institutions or Sell Side Institutions or ETF Developers have been buying this stock. Buy Side Institutions buy for long term holds for Mutual Fund or Index fund development to sell to mutual fund investors. These are always intended to be very long te rm holds which stabilizes the price patterns for retail investor or retail traders. That is NOT a guarantee of stock price growth or company fundamental growth. It is just a data set everyone should be using as part of their fundamental analysis which is incorporated into software like this software does. The other fundamental data set that I have set on this easy to use software program (I am not affiliated with this firm I just like the software a lot) is the Earnings Report Date. This is the company set date at this time. It may change by a day or two but it is good enough for my analytical needs. What this tells me is that in early November, the CEO gave his official company earnings report to investors publicly. Now I also know that the Buy Side Institutions receive information about a company ahead of the report. This is not illegal, it is actually wise and they can afford to send an analyst to a company to see how the firm is doing. I have done these walk arounds myself. So we go back to early November to see if there was a pre earnings setup by pro traders. Below is a daily chart. Every candlestick is one day of trading. This is the ideal chart setup for a swing, momentum, day or platform position trade. It provides the details needed for those short term income generating trading styles.  Was there a pro trader setup and earnings run? Yes. That means that the earnings report, a fundamental data set, had some good, positive information. I haven’t checked the fundamental data earnings report yet but the chart indicates something was good or the stock would have had a flat sideways price action or a minor retracement downward. Instead it went up in early November. And it is still moving up long after the report. I do not recommend stocks. This is NOT a recommendation at all. What I am attempting to show you here is that if you study the stock chart daily and weekly, you will find a good START to your research as to whether you should invest or not. That decision MUST be yours and yours alone. Right now, PLUG based on the chart analysis is insufficient to determine whether it is a good long term investment or not. But it does have indications that it MIGHT be worthwhile to do the extra work of a full fundamental analysis to see if the stock growth potential, CEO guidance for next quarter and next year are positive or conservative. The other Analysis you MUST do is RISK ANALYSIS. I know from reading thousands of questions on Quora that most investors are not doing this analysis but are relying upon someone else to tell them what to do. That is a good way to lose money in the stock market. Nobody will ever take better care of your investment money than YOU. Everyone of you needs to start trusting yourself more and asking more questions before running to buy a stock in the news feeds. Write this on a sticky note pad and put it on your monitor (phones are not a good way to invest long term as you can’t put sticky notes on them easily). “Stocks are NOT an impulse purchase. If you feel an urgency to buy a stock DON’T”. If you remind yourself constantly that you don’t need to rush to buy a stock you will be a far better, happier, and less stressed out investor or trader who trades stocks for monthly income. There is no one price fits all equation when buying a stock. If you buy a stock that is extremely high risk for YOUR RISK TOLERANCE, then you will probably panic and sell the stock at the first little hiccup loss you have. IF you do your risk analysis properly and only buy stocks within those risk parameters you will never need to panic and will have excellent results and will sleep well at night knowing your investments are fine. Many new investors fear that the market will crash at anytime. Let me assure you, that only bubbles or sudden unknown events cause stocks to move down. IF you do your homework, each time you buy a stock, you will not endure a catastrophic loss because you won’t be gambling with stocks but investing. There is a huge difference between gamblers and investors. So this is just a small lesson on stock chart analysis incorporating some technical analysis and some fundamental analysis but no risk analysis. 3 Analysis are needed for a strong long term portfolio. 3 Analysis are needed for short term trading although far less than long term. Recommended stocks have inherently higher risk. Stocks constantly in the news are higher risk. Stocks trading far beyond their fundamentals are extremely high risk. The wonderful experience of investing with knowledge and your own personal criteria is that YOU did it. You made it happen. You are the master of your future. Even if you have an amazing Financial Planner, when you understand what you are investing in you will have a much better management of YOUR money. The fun thing about the stock market is that you are constantly learning new things. It is a complex, fascinating endeavor. Thank you for reading this very long answer. I am hoping it turns some light bulbs on in your head. That is my goal. Again, I am not recommending PLUG, I am merely providing a PARTIAL analysis.

The analysts, led by Adam Jonas, cut their price target on Tesla shares by 23% to $291, from $376, as they cut their expectations for earnings on “lingering manufacturing issues with the Model 3,” they said in a note. The Morgan Stanley analysts lowered their earnings forecast due to cutting their medium-term and long-term gross margin assumptions for Tesla’s passenger cars. They are “subject to extremely high levels of fundamental execution risk, market/funding risk, and a highly volatile share price,” the analysts said. “In our view, Tesla does not offer enough upside to justify” the equivalent of a buy rating or enough downside to justify a sell rating.  Here are some key takeaways from Tesla's first quarter earnings report which was released just after the market close on Wednesday, May 2 Tesla is not for the faint of heart: ""I think that if people are concerned about volatility they should not buy our stock,"" says Musk on a conference call with investors.Tesla ended the first quarter with $2.7 billion in cash and $10.8 billion in long-term debt and capital leases.

BAE Systems is indisputably one of the top military technology players on the planet.

There’s no doubt the UK retains the ability to design and build extemely high end military vehicles, and that includes the mooted Challenger 2 upgrades etc. The problem is there really isn’t any money in tanks. Allow me to explain why. If you’re replacing Chally II, you need to design an build a fast, versatile three or four person crew tank with a very potent main armament, that is protected against all current known threats, with a mixture of armour and active/passive protection systems. It needs to be built in Britain using British workers, even if some of the tech or processes aren’t British. It needs to be fast enough to keep up with the lightning fast strike brigade orientated IFV/APC and support vehicles. It must be “stealthy” in that it has absorbent coatings designed to spoof radars and targeting computers, a muffled/dispersed IR signature and is difficult to see hull down in low light. It has to be very fuel efficient, quiet, agile and easy to maintain. Powerpacks need to be modular to be able to be replaced in an hour or less using a minimum of specialist equipment and training. It needs to have a remotely operated weapons station and 360 degree cameras to improve its ability to persist in high threat low intensity environments. It needs to be able to be optionally-manned if necessary to be controlled remotely as a heavy weapons support drone. It needs to have the absolute latest and greatest fire control and targeting computers and gear money can buy. The systems need to be open architecture and upgradable but also resistant to hacking and directed EW attacks. It needs to have massive range. It needs to demonstrate near-miraculous ability to protect its crew should it be penetrated. It needs to be ergonomically designed inside so that it’s crew can fight the vehicle effectively in all environments. It probably needs to be dual fuel capable. It likely also needs a hybrid battery drive to augment the engine power to allow a smaller and lighter power pack to be used, so they can keep weight down. It needs to be hardened to fight in nuclear, chemical and biological wars. It needs to be fully datalinked to other assets using state of the art data link systems. It needs to have all kinds of latest top end comms systems wired into it that are designed to be extemely difficult to jam or disrupt. It needs to weigh less than forty five or fifty tonnes and be transportable by C-17 if necessary. It needs specialist support vehicles for towing, support and training designed especially as well. It needs to be ready to enter service in four years and require minimal training for Her Majesty’s Finest to operate right out of the box. ….aaaaaaand it needs to cost less than about £5m a pop. Excuse the lack of paragraphs but that’s a LONG list. All in all, a pretty tall order, I’m sure you’ll agree. Designing such a vehicle is so demanding and requires such large amounts of cutting edge materials, specific alloys, armour mixes and such that £5m per tank isn’t realistic unless you make massive compromises that aren’t usually acceptable in the design spec. The British Army don’t want a compromised tank. What you can do is build a cheaper tank first off then promise capability to be added in future tranches, that’s a fairly common way of loading up numbers on initial buy. We saw it with Typhoon. If the tank costs more than £5m a go, the UK MOD will just buy fewer of them. If it goes up to £10m they’ll buy half the number they wanted which will be a lot less than they need. Defence budgets are nowhere near as elastic as defence project construction costs. That’s a fact of life. At that point people start questioning whether there’s any point in buying any and political opposition start clamouring for the buy/programme to be shelved as there isn’t any point only buying less than a hundred or so, we need something cheaper, why do we need tanks again anyway, you could build loads of hospitals for that money etc yadda yadda. The UK MOD aren’t going to buy 700 of them. Those days are long gone. They’ll buy as many as the budget will allow. If budgetary constraints mean the UK MOD can only afford 150 of them then the contractor will make a loss per tank on every one they make. Given that UK defence contractors are not Government owned, they have shareholders and can’t do things like spend billions developing amazing new tanks that they will make a loss selling as the UK government can’t afford to buy enough to make it worthwhile. Shareholders simply won’t let you do things like that. There’s always the risk of course that programmes get delayed, run over budget and technology doesn’t work as well as it is supposed to. That’s absolutely toxic for private defence contractors when working for Governments who cannot and will not soak up delays and major cost increases. Yes, you can build a tank for the UK MOD and then try to sell a watered down vanilla version internationally but there are no guarantees. Once again, trying to get countries to spend that much on a tank when they could get a current export version Abrams or Leo for $4m or a latest tranche T-90MS or Type 99 for $2m is a tough sell. It’s why the French have not sold many $7m Leclercs or the Koreans have not sold many $8m Black Panthers, *sublimely* capable tanks though they most certainly are (and latest tranche latest updated versions of both would be good choices to replace Challenger 2 if needed, but would be dodgy politically) The UK government is under pressure to stop selling arms internationally and the days of applying political pressure to get sweetheart weapons deals signed are largely over now. It’s a tough sell and nothing is guaranteed. Not many countries can afford to buy a load of top end MBTs and anyway their use on the modern battlefield is widely acknowledged to be diminishing all the time. It’s a big risk. Obviously that’s not great for your shareholders or share price either. Shareholders don’t like risk. The shareholders like reward. It is far better to concentrate on the IFV/APC market which is global and incredibly robust. Most countries can afford them and almost everyone has them. The ubiquitous M113, BTR60 and BMP series are still in service by the tens of thousands globally and the demand to replace them with modern, ultra survivable platforms is intense. There are many competing designs but the market is vast so if you can bring a solid product (or smart spread of products to cover all angles) to market, and then market it well, you have every chance of selling many many of your APC/IFVs. Obviously the more you sell, the lower your manufacture costs are hence the higher your margins are. That’s great for shareholders and share price. A new MBT design will be multinational - for the same reason the likes of Typhoon and so on. Risk is reduced by factors, possible sales are increased by factors and manufacture risk is brought right down. So imagine BAE Systems, the UK arm of General Dynamics, Meggitt and Rolls Royce form a multinational consortium with Irizar / Iveco in Spain and Rheinmetall in Germany. They all share the risk and development cost on a new MBT for Spain, Germany and the UK. That’s how a modern MBT in Europe will be built. It is also, sadly, why Brexit is an absolute catastrophe for the UK MOD’s future war fighting development. Whether Europe or indeed the UK will get a new tank is open to question. There is a growing view amongst defence analysts and military think tanks that tanks are becoming obsolete on today’s ATGM-bristling battlefields. It used to be that you needed a tank as the optimal way to kill another tank but that’s not the case any more. There is a view (that I share to an extent) that tanks as they are are too large, too expensive and too vulnerable and cost too much to support and keep fighting, especially for low intensity and assymetric warfare which is pretty much how things are these days unless something catastrophic happens. Here are my separate thoughts on the value of the MBT on today’s and tomorrow’s battlefield which is of some relevance to this answer. Chris Morgan's answer to The battleship became obsolete during World War II. What major piece of military hardware might become obsolete in the next 10 to 20 years? Reading that, the question posed now is why would a Government spend £10m a go on a few hundred MBTs that don’t fit your strike brigade doctrine, and may well find themselves operationally if not technically obsolescent in ten to twelve years? With that in mind you can totally see why they would want to upgrade the Challenger II fleet to perform the narrow MBT role that remains (according to the MOD). Cheaper, better value etc. It will be interesting to see what happens in the coming years.

It took roughly 400 planes and 9+ months to come to this also gives a hint of how desperate of a decision production halt really is.  Boeing has tried everything to get the plane back into the sky ASAP to keep the line running, but they've got to a point where they have to stop. There's no way around it. They have more MAXes sitting around not delivered than those who are actually in the hands of customers. The situation isn't economically and logistically sustainable.  How big is the impact of this halt is going to be? Nobody knows for sure. Surely Boeing has made pretty good internal estimates, and some analysts might soon publish similar public ones. In the meanwhile, let's run down the facts and make some considerations. You have to keep in mind Boeing designed the line to crank out 50+ MAX aircraft per month (plus the odd NGs still left to be produced), they might eventually be stretched up even more (I've read their goal was 57 planes, maybe even 60 a month). If you intend to make those kinds of numbers, your line and supply chain is optimized and designed for that. What this means is that by running at 42 per month Boeing was virtually losing money for these entire 9/10 months of the grounding. Losing money on the production side of thing mind you, not even considering the fact they couldn't get paid by the customers because of no deliveries.The supply chain of the 737 is highly optimized since it’s such a high volume plane (no other factory in the world cranks out so many aircraft...Airbus might make the A320 in similar numbers, but their manufacturing happens in 3/4 different factories) and a low cost plane (one of the big advantages of the MAX and of any 737 really over the competition has always been lower prices). So the margins of error and economic wiggle room are just not there. People are talking about Boeing, but the real danger here is with the suppliers: they might as well go out of business or experience serious economic issues due to this production halt (and they were already struggling due to the lower rate of production). Surely Boeing isn't foolish, they're an economic giant and they might help their suppliers financially, but still, a very tough period for minor aerospace contractors all around the US.Manpower. This is relevant for both Boeing and their suppliers. With the orange guy in office, the American economy has been doing very very good indeed. Low unemployment, companies doing great etcetera. This is actually detrimental for Boeing and its suppliers: their highly qualified engineers and highly skilled technicians (those who ultimately enable such fast and efficient manufacturing) facing the risk of being laid off or going several months without pay will probably just protect their own interests and careers and just look for another job. The economy is doing so great that probably such a highly qualified workforce is gonna find better paying and more stable jobs quite easily. If the supply chain argument is big, the qualified workforce one is even bigger: once you lose your best workers, it’s very tough to recover. You lose expertise, insider hands on knowledge, all the ""production line know how"" that isn't really written down and you can't learn in a training course. This is the biggest risk in my opinion, especially for the suppliers, who are scattered around the country (thus there are many more differentiated job options for their employees looking to leave, than for the Boeing ones which are concentrated in northern Washington state); the suppliers also have smaller workforces, meaning even a few people moving elsewhere might have a big impact. Boeing is probably also gonna be hit hard by this, but being such a large company and being that all the 737’s workforce is in just one place, it's unlikely that many people are going to get another job...not that many on the total 11000+ 737 workers at least. They have put measures in places to limit this ""workers escape"", such as relocating to the Everett plant, keeping the 737-based P8 military plane production open and other similar things, but still, some people are gonna leave. What really is gonna determine the number of people leaving is going to be the duration of the production halt (if it's just 50 days, people might hold on and try to make ends meet and stay with the company) and how transparent Boeing is gonna be about it (if your employer says ""alright, you might not work for one month or maybe two months or maybe four, only the FAA knows"" you're much more likely to look for another job, given the uncertainty and financial insecurity that comes with it). The worrisome part here is that Boeing doesn't seem to be very clear and sure about how long they're going to be stopped, so yeah, not ideal.Further repercussions...the FAA now seems very pissed that Boeing has been kind of sort of ""blackmailing"" the authority through fear of layoffs/major economic damage, by making press releases like ""we strongly expect the FAA to certify the MAX in December"" and things like that. Given Boeing’s huge lobbying power, I'm not sure federal authorities might look to prosecute or press some kind of charges on the company's executives, but still...Various unknown factors. Renton has been cranking out 737s for what, more than 50 years? Halting such a well oiled and perfectly running machine might have unexpected consequences. I've seen other people or publications call this ""the beginning of the end for the 737"". I wouldn't be so catastrophic...but still, the economics, PR, operational, production and regulatory impacts of this whole scandal and this halt in production are gonna have very deep impacts on the US aerospace industry.

Further, another anonymous guy has explained situation by explaining the impeachment incident in IIM C in 2017. This single evil i.e. wrongdoings of placecom has hit hard the status of IIM Calcutta in 2018. The first reflection of this is in large waitlist movement this year. IIM Calcutta observed ~100 WL movement in very first list while IIMB observed less than 10. Among my friends, whoever had converts (except 1) from IIM B or FMS apart from IIMC chosen B or FMS over C. Why? Answer for most of them - Placecom and no assurance of any improvement. What they are doing this year is ragging in the name of conducting placement activities is explained below: 1.One day whole PGP1 batch is called in auditorium in so called smart casuals, without phone (so that no one records the incident) and are shouted at. They are made to feel like losers just because they came straight from airport after leaving their parents and couldn’t change dress for this ‘torturing’ in late night. 2.Some of them will go to such extent that they will check your pockets. If you have brought a bag and kept it outside auditorium, then they have so much disrespect for other’s privacy that they will check your bags. 3. In the name of guidance, you will be shouted at for hours in midnight. If you trim your beards very well and look smarter than them than its an offense. They have standard rule of clean shave. 4.If you are a person with 5–6 year experience, you will literally laugh over their understanding of professionalism. They live in their own colonial world and consider themselves “Laat Saaheb”. But wait, your heavy work-ex and professionalism is not going to stop them from shouting and abusing. If you laughed because of their foolishness, you will be made to feel like criminal. 5.They has affected whole senior-junior relationship here. Seniors, particularly placecoms and club members, will shut door at you, when you just go for a chat. 6. In the name of guiding they will force you to make 5 page CV and write rubbish things or make a lie. They perceive to verify all data. But truth is one who arrange more fake certificates and more verification is winner. The so called mentor will force you to add points from anywhere. 7.Overall there is a culture of homogeneity here. Everyone losses his uniqueness and become part of Joka Tribe. This tribe still lives in colonial era. You will be asked to behave in one manner. This is why college is getting limited to finance hub, rather than a multi-disciplinary opportunity for all. All students will be forced to use the cover pic clicked by one pgp2 (one can verify this. see current/past cover pics of all IIM C guys). All student will be forced to make their cv like their narrow minded placecom wants. All student will be forced to write quantity in each points ; even when u r such a person who has brought qualitative changes. 8.You will get frequent threatening of getting debarred from placement or getting debarred from sitting in preferred company etc., as if you had not come to college to follow college rules and get equal opportunity but to follow self-proclaimed tribal gods (placecom) of Joka. If you are sensitive persons then you will often feel that you are being ragged. And it actually amounts as ragging as per Indian law. Under laws in India, ragging is defined as: (i) Any disorderly conduct by either by acts or words spoken, the effect of which is teasing, treating or handling with rudeness any other student;(ii) Any rowdy or undisciplined activity, which causes annoyance, hardship or psychological harm;(iii) Raise fear or apprehension thereof in the minds of junior; (iv) Asking the students to do an act or perform something, which such student will not do in ordinary course, which has the effect of causing shame or embarrassment so as to adversely affect the physique or psyche of a junior student. Clearly they are indulged in ragging and They need to be made aware about consequences of Ragging which includes : (i) Cancellation of admission (ii) Suspension from attending classes (iii) Withholding/withdrawing scholarship and other benefits (iv) Debarring from appearing in exam/other evaluation process (v) Withholding results (vi) Debarring the student from representing in any national, international or youth festival. (vii) Suspension from hostel (viii) Restriction from institution for a period of 1 to 4 years (ix) Expulsion from an institution and barring from admission in any other institution. (x) Fine up to Rs. 25,000/- (xi) Collective institution. They will lose their PPO/job and even whole career if anyone of us come out to file a criminal complaint. They don't realize this. I have my friend in Ahmedabad and Bangalore too. One can’t imagine the difference in behaviour by placecoms here and there. There they are not elite, not arrogant. They help, don't shout. They take pleasure in getting best job for everyone, they don't behave like arrogant placecoms here. I personally feel mentally harassed to this level to write this.

Even fewer choices remain when an impulsive American president like Donald Trump calls the shots. Underneath the bellicose rhetoric, incessant name-calling and hostile threats, therefore, lies an incoherent and fragmented foreign policy. Political Amnesia The United Nations Security Council first sanctioned North Korea’s nuclear program after their first weapons test in 2006. As their arsenal proliferated, so did the sanctions. Over a decade later, Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship continues to grow stronger and his threats more potent. It is worth noting that the regime has achieved remarkable success in its preeminent goal of survival despite being the most isolated nation in the world. In over a decade of nuclear testing on the peninsula, the international community has acquired a sense of political amnesia. While the sanctions seem to be increasingly tougher, the Korean peninsula strays farther from denuclearization every day. It is safe to conclude, therefore, that the strategy of simply imposing economic pressure on the regime isn’t really a strategy after all. Rather, the current sanctions serve as a reprieve, guising the absence of a thorough and effective policy. Buying Insurance Trump’s understanding of North Korea proved to be far too acute for devising a functional strategy. Only a few months into his presidency, he is realizing that threats of “fire and fury” are as hollow coming from the United States as they are from North Korea. Moreover, “stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea” is a rogue suggestion. Cutting off trade with China alone, for example, would cost the US a million American jobs. The move also threatens isolation from other economies such as that of Russia, India, France, and Germany. As the BBC accurately notes, “It’s hard to see how the president would be able to sell a policy with such questionable effectiveness, and one that would damage the US economically more than it would limit North Korea’s nuclear options.”  In March, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson came out with a startling statement, “Let me be very clear”, he said, “the policy of strategic patience has ended.” Donald Trump reiterated the same remarks recently in Japan a few days ago. Nevertheless, such rhetoric has failed to translate to concrete actions. As a result, despite the initial pomp and circumstance, the Trump administration has continued the Obama-era approach of “strategic patience.” Or, as Scott Snyder of the Council on Foreign Relations says, “It is a coordinated pressure campaign that started in the last year of the Obama Administration and is continuing, and is now bearing more public fruit,” However, much to the dismay of the United States, “strategic patience” grossly underestimates North Korean resolve. Staunch Resilience North Korea’s resilience in the face of international pressure offers unique insight into the regime’s doctrine for survival. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, North Korea’s economy foundered. As a result, in the 1990s it was confronted with a deadly famine that killed up to 10% of its population. Yet, despite the disarray, the authoritarian grip on the nation remained all-encompassing and the regime persisted. Max Fisher of the New York Times writes, “Overriding its calculus, then, would require imposing costs greater than destruction or famine but short of war, which would risk a nuclear exchange. That may be a Venn diagram with no overlap.” Or to put it in the more eloquent words of Vladimir Putin, who said, “They’d rather eat grass than give up their nuclear program.” Contrary to popular belief, the Kim dynasty hasn’t developed a nuclear arsenal to obliterate the West, instead, it has done so to buy insurance. The Kims have witnessed the fall of Saddam Hussein who didn’t have nuclear weapons and that of Gaddafi who gave up his arsenal. In fact, the state-run news outlet in North Korea, referred to the same this January, “The Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq and the [Muammar] Gaddafi regime in Libya could not escape the fate of destruction after being deprived of their foundations for nuclear development and giving up nuclear programs of their own accord.” As North Korea sees it, nuclear weapons are their primary tool for ensuring survival. Confronted with an increasingly frustrated China, an unpredictable geopolitical landscape and a hostile American counterpart, Kim Jong-Un’s yearning for his nuclear arsenal is further reinforced. Moreover, the US and its regional allies can’t possibly risk a war in the Korean theater. The casualties and destruction that would come with it vastly outweigh the current threat. As US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis points out, “It will be a war more serious in terms of human suffering than anything we’ve seen since 1953.” Fareed Zakaria, a political analyst for the Washington Post writes, “North Korea has accurately calculated that China and South Korea are more terrified of the chaos that would follow its collapse than of its nuclear arsenal.” He adds, “More pressure only strengthens its resolve to buy even more insurance.” Xi’s Stronghold Meanwhile, there is a growing belief that Chinese intervention may be the only way out of the political impasse. After all, China, being the regime’s largest trade partner and only significant ally carries serious leverage on the dictatorship. Harnessing this influence has been every American president’s objective in the last decade. None have been successful. Reasonably, China has its own concerns. From its perspective, the repercussions of a North Korean collapse are likely to be adverse for China. A defeated North Korean dictatorship would make China’s borders vulnerable to an exodus of millions of refugees. Moreover, an American-led coalition that is in the cards threatens China’s acute political hegemony in Southeast Asia.  BEIJING, CHINA – SEPTEMBER 04 (Photo by Lintao Zhang/Getty Images) Any option without Mr.Xi’s backing, therefore, remains feeble. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once wrote for the Wall Street Journal, “An understanding between Washington and Beijing is the essential prerequisite for the denuclearization of Korea.” This includes the vast host of sanctions that have already been imposed. In the past, while China supported United Nations resolutions to sanction North Korea, it has been caught evading implementation frequently. Since Donald Trump took office in January this year, there has been little sustained diplomacy with North Korea. He has discouraged reasonable efforts by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to engage in negotiations and has failed to formulate a functioning strategy himself. The president should realize that rhetoric about inflicting “fire and fury” on “rocket-man” does not count as constructive dialogue. Deterrence Perhaps the international community should accept that North Korea is a nuclear power and one capable of wreaking havoc. Essentially shifting the focus from denuclearization to deterrence should pivot international focus on a more pragmatic and achievable objective. A delicate balance-of-power encompasses the Korean peninsula and efforts to alter it risk catastrophe. Implementing a measured and calculated response, therefore, remains of paramount importance. When confronting the Soviet Union’s challenge in the post-war years, American diplomat George Kennan highlighted a case for containment and deterrence. While the backdrop against which North Korea and the former Soviet Union operated differs vastly, stark parallels can be drawn in the challenges they have posed. As was in the Cold War, the objective still remains to tackle a nuclear power without direct confrontation or risking millions of lives. As such, the Soviet Union was defeated over four long decades of economic pressure and assertive diplomacy, outlining that a strategy of containment and deterrence had worked. Jeffrey Bader of the Brookings Institution elucidates what such a policy entails in his articletitled, “Why deterring and containing North Korea is our least bad option.” In it, he writes, “Containment and deterrence are not appealing options, just as many condemned those approaches as passive, immoral, and defeatist during the Cold War. In fact, they were none of those then, and would be none of those now.”  Furthermore, deterrence and containment work in line with and are collateral to America’s vision of “strategic patience.” A crucial element of this entails the international community imposing harsh trade and investment embargoes on the regime. Economic pressure, however, is just one of the many measures that need to be taken. Other critical elements include amplifying anti-ballistic missile defense capabilities and continuing joint military exercises in the peninsula. For all its efforts, Washington should also recognize that this North Korean strategy doesn’t function in isolation. It is part of a complicated geopolitical landscape. Consequently, consolidating the support of other nations that play a decisive role on the peninsula is a significant precursor to any assertive policy. Reassuring South Korea, Japan, and China of America’s commitment to security is necessary for their support to deter and contain Pyongyang. Bader emphasizes another aspect of diplomacy when he writes, “A three-way dialogue among the United States, South Korea, and China about how we would react to various contingencies in North Korea, such as instability or breakdown.” This requires America to muster serious diplomatic resources and political capital to engage in a sustainable approach. It also happens to be the arena where the Trump administration lacks most. The president has chosen to leave the position of Ambassador to South Korea and other key Asian diplomatic representatives vacant, which is “something it could fix quickly if it so chose” according to Zach Beauchamp of Vox. Mr. Bader also argues that “ before accept[ing] the necessity of such an approach,” the North Koreans should be given “one last chance for them to turn away from the disastrous course they are on.” He suggests that the US should propose a deal which trades complete North Korean denuclearization for an end to sanctions, a peace treaty and establishment of diplomatic relations. While the odds that Pyongyang would accept such a deal are slim, the proposal presents several advantages. It would demonstrate to the South Korean “President Moon Jae-in, that Washington is prepared to put an attractive offer on the table since Moon is seeking avenues for reconciliation with the North.” He adds, “Moreover, it would give the United States the moral high ground, making more likely Chinese and Russian support for the tough containment strategy that probably will be necessary.” The Trump administration is right about one thing- a strategy of deterrence and containment is vulnerable to miscalculation. Threats of preventive strikes exacerbate the risk that North Korea strikes first and Trump’s bellicose rhetoric on Twitter only worsens the situation. The same risk stood in the Cold War, however, at the time the American and Soviet leaders had a direct line of communication called the Moscow–Washington hotline to reassure their counterparts that an offensive was not going to be launched. Recently, Tillerson mentioned, “We have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang.” He went on to confirm that those channels are “direct” and not through Beijing. Tillerson’s efforts towards advancing diplomatic means of communication are a crucial part of the deterrence and containment strategy. In spite of being the only viable option, National Security Advisor H.R McMaster has already dismissed such a strategy, suggesting that the nuclear deterrence policy that the United States adopted toward the former Soviet Union would not work with North Korea due to its “brutality.” To this, James M. Acton of The Diplomat correctly argues, “Exactly the same criticisms were justly leveled against the Soviet Union. Indeed, the recent assassination of Kim’s brother with the nerve agent VX in Kuala Lumpur – which McMaster cited as evidence for the regime’s brutality – was distinctly similar to the 1978 murder of the Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov.” It is safe to say that the strategy of deterrence and containment is not an ideal one. Nevertheless, all other options either raise the risk of confrontation dramatically or do too little to prevent war. “The right question is not whether North Korea can be deterred, but rather how the risks of trying to do so compare to the risks of the alternative – a preventative war,” Acton writes. “When these risks are weighed up, deterrence turns out to be the less dangerous option.” The US and other world leaders have few choices when it comes to managing North Korea. Even fewer choices remain when an impulsive American president like Donald Trump calls the shots. Underneath the bellicose rhetoric, incessant name-calling and hostile threats, therefore, lies an incoherent and fragmented foreign policy. Political Amnesia The United Nations Security Council first sanctioned North Korea’s nuclear program after their first weapons test in 2006. As their arsenal proliferated, so did the sanctions. Over a decade later, Kim Jong Un’s dictatorship continues to grow stronger and his  Continue Reading",2021-03-06T14:37:22.188Z,"How do we stop North Korea? ",Quora

Consider it a Continue ReadingBelow are the 7 proven steps to become a trader.  1.Introspection The very first step should be to ask yourself why you want to trade in stock markets. Unless you have a clear answer for this, you should not move to the next step. For most of the people trading is gambling, for some it’s a means to become millionaire within a year and there are few strange occurrences where people trade to divert their minds from other issues they are facing. If your purpose of trading falls under any of these examples, then please go back and find out the real reason of entering the stock markets. Consider it as a profession rather than hobby. And never expect to multiple your income within few days. 2.Read, Learn, Repeat Your success at trading depends on your knowledge of markets. And knowledge can only be achieved step by step. Try to learn from the very scratch, and don’t consider yourself as an expert even if you know better the others. Start with this interesting article which explains what trading actually is: Trading for Dummies- A simple Analogy You may either select fundamental analysis for you trading decisions or you may go for technical analysis. We generally recommend the blend of both with more focus on technical analysis and charts. Read numerous books and watch videos from experts, and never stop learning. Use the power of social media to connect with fellow traders across the world. Don’t fall prey to scam websites which boast to make you rich in a month, and beware of tipsters. Start with equities first and then venture into futures and options. 3.Assess your knowledge It’s essential to assess your knowledge at regular intervals. Apply you knowledge in paper trading before you put money in the real market. Create a trading group and share your knowledge, involve into debates and group discussions. Start taking part in trading forums to share your ideas and learning. Apart from these,there are several standard certifications specific to stock markets. Go for one of these, it will help you to boost your confidence.  4.Open a trading account This is generally the first step people do while entering the stock market business. But we recommend to complete above 3 steps first and then start looking for a broker to open your trading account. Go for a discount broker instead of full-service brokers. Discount brokers offer a very low brokerage on your trades as compared to others. Brokerage is generally fixed and not a percentage of your investment value. For ex: RKSV and Zerodha are popular discount brokers in India and they charge brokerage as low as Rs. 20 per order. Paying a low brokerage would help you gain better profits from your trade. 5.Discover your trading style Every trader has a different risk appetite, and this determines the trading style he chooses. You can be a long term trader, swing trader or intra-day trader. None of these trading styles are bad as long as it is profitable. But we would recommend never to start with intraday trading on high margins. Try your luck and knowledge in swing or positional trading first and invest only in high liquid and low volatile stocks. 6.Develop a trading strategy Every trade you execute should be an outcome of pre-defined rules of entry and exit. These rules are called trading strategy or trading system. Never trade on gut feeling or any fundamental news. Execute a buy/sell order only if your trading system directs you to do so. Designing a trading system is a complex process and require deep analysis of various technical factors. There are many tools available in market which can help you to design a trading system and backtest its performance on past data. Examples are Amibroker, metastock, Ninja Trader etc.  7.Be patient and let your money grow This is last but one of the most important steps. Most of the traders quit in first 6 months once they lose all the capital. The only reason is that they lack patience and probably don’t follow their trading system with discipline. Patience is the key for successful trading. You cannot expect your trading system to be perfect all the time. Even the best trading system operated by hedge funds are profitable only 40% of times. But they have a good risk reward ratio. The other important thing is to let your money grow with time. Compounding is considered as the 8th wonder of the world. Cut short your losses and let your profits to grow. Always invest a part of your returns back into your trading system. If you consistently follow these 7 steps, no one can stop you from becoming a successful trader. You may fail in the first attempt, but then you should repeat these steps. The only thing you should remember in trading is ‘Never Give up‘ Below are the 7 proven steps to become a trader.  1.Introspection The very first step should be to ask yourself why you want to trade in stock markets.

Some investors want to sell off and want to hoard their cash. Some prefer to start buying the stocks that are falling the most. But such knee-jerk reactions may not create wealth for you. Here are five thoughts of Warren Buffett that may guide you in your investment actions in such volatile times. 3) Quality matters. Just because a company has fallen 20% from its 52 week high does not make it a great value buy. Do check the fundamentals of the company. Corrections in the market must be used to buy quality stocks for your long term portfolio. Buying them at a fair price makes sense for long term investors. Good businesses tend to compound their profits and reward the shareholders in the long term. Stick to companies that have exhibited decent business performance across business cycles. Picking up the micro-cap stocks with great potentials may not reward you if the stories do not materialise as expected. If you have a dud stock in your portfolio, use the spikes to get rid of it. Use the proceeds to buy fundamentally strong companies. 4) Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful. Volatile markets make investors worry about the holdings. The sudden drop in their portfolio’s valuations, make them consider selling out. The same investors were looking for more opportunities when the markets were marching up. Behavioural issues are a big influencing factor for the retail investors. The emotional swings force them to sell out when it is the time to load up more. Warren Buffett makes it clear that the valuations are attractive when no one is interested in stocks and the other way round. 5) Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree long time ago. This could be one of the ignored quotes of Warren Buffett. It speaks about the delayed gratification and how it impacts one’s future. If you sow the seeds in the form of regular investments and let them compound over a long period of time, there is a fair chance that you will see the wealth being created. 6) Never ask a barber if you need a haircut. If you buy the idea of long term wealth creation and start investing regularly, wealth creation is not guaranteed. You have to stick to asset allocation and you have to choose the right products that suit your needs. Many avail the services of investment advisors and distributors. While choosing your advisor be sure that his interests are aligned with your interests. 7) No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.There are no short cuts – Warren Buffett says. Follow the process and the let the time work for you. The results will be more likely to be in your favour. However, if you try to put your money on tips and get rich quick tricks then you may see some nasty surprises. Here a short story of the world's greatest INVESTOR of all time GREAT WARREN BUFFET FOLLOW HIS PRINCIPALS BUFFET found Coca-Cola an attractive investment because it had a moat and was attractively valued. Buffett began building his position following the stock market crash in 1987. Coca-Cola is the dominant company in the beverage industry and has large food holdings as well. Buffett's investing philosophy evolved from BENJAMIN GRAHAM and a focus on finding situations in which a company's value exceeded its MARKET PRICE. This evolution was due to the influence of HIS COMPANY and the larger size of Buffett's investable funds, which made it more difficult to take advantage of market inefficiencies. Coca-Cola Company Buffett once claimed he drinks about five cans of Coca-Cola per day, which may or may not be the reason why Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) stock is his third largest holding. It is certain he likes the durability of the company’s core product, which has remained virtually unchanged over time. Buffett started buying Coca-Cola shares in the late 1980s and did not stop until it comprised 25% of his portfolio. He holds 400 million shares with a $16 billion total market value, which is 12.59% of the total market value of his portfolio. As long as the company’s BRAND IDENTITY and global distribution systems remain world class, and its future cash flows remain high, Coca-Cola is likely to remain a top holding for Buffett. 8) Most investors are not as skilled with the financial markets as Warren Buffett, and may not be able to replicate his investment strategy of value investing. Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time. He performs a great deal of due diligence and fundamental analysis before investing in a company. 9) Buffett’s value investing strategy is out of reach for many investors. However, investors can mimic his investing strategy by buying shares in Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. As an alternative, investors can follow Buffett’s own advice and invest in a stock index fund with low costs. 10) Buffett’s Value Investing Buffett is known for his value investing style. This strategy seeks to find companies that are undervalued by the market and that can, therefore, be bought for a good price. Buffett believes that every company has an intrinsic value, which he defines as the amount of cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. The difficulty is in calculating the intrinsic value. Buffett notes that this number is an estimate as opposed to a hard figure. The intrinsic value can change if interest rates move or if the amount of future cash flows shifts. Buffett looks at different fundamental financial ratios to determine the intrinsic value of a company.If this intrinsic value is below the market value for the company, Buffett may explore it as an investment opportunity. He also uses other guidelines for investing. He sticks to businesses that make sense and that he understands. He does not reach for companies, such as those in the tech industry, that are outside his areas of expertise. Further, he looks for companies that have economic moats. A moat is essentially a competitive advantage that will allow the company to continue generating revenue into the future. 11) Obviously, the value investing style involves a great deal of analysis and subjectivity. Most investors do not have the time or energy to follow this approach, unfortunately most investors want to become rich overnight that's not possible should have knowledge 12) Finding a quality stock from the thousands that trade on exchanges may not be as difficult as it looks, provided you focus on right indicators. The key ratios you can use to analyse a company are return on equity (RoE), return on assets (RoA) and return on capital employed (RoCE).If the three are rising at the same time, you can be pretty sure that the money invested in the company is being used efficiently, leading to higher profits. 13) But one must be cautious. These may not be the only indicators of the company's prospects. Growth of the industry the company operates in and investment in productive capacities also merit close scrutiny. ""A simultaneous improvement in RoA , RoE and RoCE indicates the company is using shareholder funds efficiently. 14) HOW THEY ARE MEASURED RoE, or net profit divided by equity capital, shows profit earned in comparison with shareholder money. The higher the ratio, the more efficient the company is in using shareholder capital. RoA, or net profit by total assets, shows how efficient the management is at using assets to generate earnings. 15) RoCE measures returns that a business is earning from capital employed. Capital employed equals equity plus non-current liabilities (or total assets minus current liabilities), in other words all long-term funds used by the company. It indicates efficiency/profitability of a company's capital investments. It should be higher than the rate at which the company borrows. If it is not the case, increase in borrowing will reduce shareholder earnings.  16) REWARDING INVESTORS There are five companies in the BSE 500 whose RoE, RoA and RoCE have been rising since 2010-11. The list includes Ajanta Pharma, whose stock rose 3,465% to Rs 2,437 in four years till February 5; it was at Rs 48.37 on 4 February 2011. It is followed by Finolex Cables (443% to Rs 255), Britannia Industries (410% to Rs 1,860), HCL Technologies (310% to Rs 1,972) and Coal India (20% to Rs 369). The list expanded to 15 when we changed the period from four to three years. The stocks which were added included Mindtree (up 494%), Monsanto India (up 378%), Mastek (334%), Emami (273%) and Havells India (153%). ""A simultaneous rise in RoA, RoCE and RoE signals 'buy' if valuations are not discounting this already,"" 17)  ADVANTAGES & SHORTCOMINGS RoA indicates capital intensity, which will depend on the industry. Capital-intensive industries such as railway and power have low RoA as they have to own valuable assets. ""RoA gives an idea about how efficiently the management is using assets to generate profits. But it is of less interest to shareholders than some other financial ratios such as RoE."" But RoA has an advantage too. It tells investors if the company has too much debt, which RoE does not capture. At the same time, RoE tells how profitable a company is for its owner(s) and how profitably it is using equity capital. For a growing company: Stock price = EPS of next year / (interest rate - expected growth rate of the company) Let us use a simple example. If you assume Apple's next year EPS will be $48, the expected interest rate for such a risky company at 15% and an expected annual growth rate at 5%, you will get: $48/(15%-5%) or $48/10% or $480 as the ideal stock price for the company. Where did I get this magical 5% number? Getting the growth inputs:Now, we need to find the growth rate of the company and figure out what the company will earn in the next year, the following year and so on. This is not an exact science and no one has a perfect answer to this question. This is why we need stock markets. Collectively, we all pool our intelligence to figure out the future growth of the company and thereby its current price. To do this collective prediction, we constantly get new inputs and project that to future. For instance, if the company management gets hotshot new engineers, then we predict the future will be bright. What are the other news that investors typically use: Periodic financial results of the company that gives us a view into the company;s workings and its financial positionPeriodic results of similar companies that helps us guess this company;s results. Thus, when Apple sneezes everyone else catches a cold.Changes in the sector. If a new report comes that people are more inclined to using mobile phones, we predict growth of these companies will be high.Changes in the broader market.Changes in the international economyMarket Estimation:In short, we try to use every possible information to guess the future growth of the company, plug that into our formula and find out the stock price. For instance, if Apple comes out a report saying people are buying less of iPads, we might ding Samsung too as we believe their Galaxy Tabs will sell less too. Estimating growth rate is an art rather than a science, and is collectively done by millions of humans in a place called the stock market. Since, we need to constantly adjust the growth rate based on new information, stock prices constantly fluctuate. Main advantages of a stock market:1. Starting/building a business: The market lets companies get money from a large number of people. That means there are more options to get money to build a business. 2. Spreading risk: It lets you spread the risk of a business into a large number of people. Since, each person is investing only a small portion of their income in the stock of a particular company, the risk of a single company collapsing doesn't significantly affect investors. 3. Collective estimation of value. Summary: Modern corporations require a lot of capital, which is beyond the reaches of a few individuals. Markets help companies raise money from a large number of people and together these investors value their company. The theory is that when a large number of people do their independent valuation, the company's price comes more closer to its ideal worth. ""In the short term, the market is a voting machine. But, in the long term, the market is a weighing machine"". -- Buffett (Disclaimer: This is an answer targeted at basic-intermediate level investor & not high frequency traders or experts. I deliberately approximated a few things to improve clarity). I have been in the stock market for last 2 years and have seen both profits and loss. I wish to give you my 5 cents on it. A fall in stock price because of odd market pressures like less demand, cyclical movements, business expansion etc. is understandable. What you do need to understand here is you are investing your hard earned money in cheats and handicapped people (read NPA). These people make profits by cheating people like you and me. Go to a bank and see the arrogance of an average bank executive in a PSU. They make you feel like shit. Never invest in a business which have a weak base. Never invest in a business managed by cheats. Never invest in a business which is liable to frauds like these. Never invest in a business you do not understand. There are high chances that the NPA problem is not solved yet or we do not have complete information about it. There are high chances that this fraud might engulf other banks too. There are high chances that frauds like these will happen again. Considering the present political and social scenario do not invest in managements which are not reliable (see the interview of the PNB CEO, the man and the board should have been sacked by now and he was telling us about the history of the bank). If they being in such niche profession took 7 years to understand how can you give them your money??? Considering the present price of the stock there is a high possibility that you will make a lot of money, but when. Are you willing to wait till NPA mess clears out, or till profits increase. Maybe you will get 50% returns in a year. But are you ready to see your portfolio in negative for another 6 months and all this when you cannot understand what is actually happening. Eventually in a country like ours, Another demo is not possible. So there cannot be an increase in liquidity for banks. This is the maximum amount of money they will ever have for lending.There is a limit to bank recap also. NPAs will always increase because that the way things work in our country (NPAs is modified corruption).So I would suggest you to do this- Invest in any sector like IT/FMCG/Pharma. Where money comes on basis of product/service and not cheating.I would always trust somebody like FDA in honesty than our banks.Have a sound sleep.Investing in PNB is not investing but speculating. LASTLY FOR A BASIC INVESTOR'S BEGINNER READ SOME BOOKS OF WARREN BUFFET AND TRY TO APPLY HIS STYLE OF PICKING STOCKS THAT IS WHAT MY RECOMMENDATION!!! 1. Which stocks can be considered as best? To a novice, it can be overwhelming to identify best stocks to buy. This is where this blog post will help you to understand “how to pick the best stocks”. Majority people in India knows only few names of stock market. These stocks are Amir Khan, Salman Khan, Dipika Padukone’s of the market. They are super stars, and hence are expensive. But there are other stars like Irfan Khan, Rajkumar Rao, Kangana Ranaut’s etc who are cheaper but still make great films. In movies, it is easy for audience to decipher Best stars from others. But it is slightly more difficult to identify best stocks. Super stars of stock market are TCS, Reliance Industries, Infosys etc. No doubt these are good stocks, but most of the time they trade at overvalued price levels. 2. Keep your focus on not so popular stocks… The big names like RIL, TCS, WIPRO are always in news. But what about those stocks which are not as popular? Is is good to buy only popular stocks? On the contrary, experts say that one must be very cautious while buying popular stocks. This is because, popular stocks generally trade at overvalued price levels. There are more than 5,000+ stocks currently trading in Indian stocks market (BSE). So the question arises, which are the best stocks among this list of whooping 5,000+ numbers? Investment Gurus often talk about the two (2) basic screening criteria to identify best stocks for investing. This screening criteria has been shown in the below pictorial representation. For stock speculators, this concept is not important. But long term investors can bi-heart this concept like a bible. Ok, so now we have the concept. We have mugged-it-up, and we feel strong. But where is the list of best stocks to buy? Well, I have to make a confession here… You might have noticed that the list of best stocks are not readily available even on internet. You know what is the problem? The problem is no body knows it. Yes, not even me. But there is a way out… #3. Prepare your own list of best stocks Yes, when we wait for others to suggest us the names of best stocks, this is tough. Why? Because people who know about best stocks, do not care about posting it on internet. And people who posts on internet are often not reliable. But it is possible to settle for a compromise. You can do it yourself. It is possible. This idea is more reliable than waiting for TV, Print media or internet to suggest you best stocks. If best stock is gold, then investors are like miners. They have to do some digging-in to extract the gold. In this blog post, we will try to learn how to unearth this gold (prepare your own list of best stocks). Yes, you heard me right, I am suggesting all my readers to have their own list of best stocks. It is advisable to MAKE ONES OWN LIST of favourite stocks. Why? Because this is the best way to play the stock market game. Having ones OWN list of best stocks is one sure foot-forward towards becoming a successful stock investor. If one could copy others and make money, probably every stock trader in this world would have been millionaire by now. But the fact is, only the ELITE investors make money in stock market. What makes an investor rise to the stature of ELITE? 4. Why one must focus on “not so popular” stocks? What are the top two stocks in Indian stock market presently? RIL and TCS. These are those stocks which has the largest market capitalisation compared to other stocks. So are these stocks best? If these two stocks are the best, why expert investors are also buying others stocks? There is not doubt that the underlying business of TCS and RIL are rock solid. But as these are popular stock, they are also very overvalued. When “we” are busy buying only popular stocks, experts investors are busy buying stocks not so popular stocks. They largely stay away from popular ones. They focus more on the following: Quality of business &Price valuation.And why they do like this? Because less popular stocks are available at comparatively better price levels.

Of course, you’ve got to make it to a legislature, or even outside it, in a role that entails basically standing around the real legislator, with a shit-eatin’ grin and shouting out the occasional slogan. Oh … don’t write this off as secondary. After all, a collective of these is what makes the legislator worth including in the legislature ! Without these bleary eyed, assemblages of humanoid misadventures of nature, there is no legislation to be done ! You shall, consequently be hated by exactly double the number of people who even know you. Your only task shall be to go and stand behind whoever is the sitting MP. No need to feel obliged to subscribe to any particular ideology, or even to listen. Just being is enough.Civil Services. The one thing that any Indian will willingly submit his rights, his dignity , his anything to… the mai baap of commons, one who rides over existential drudgery and selects his own persuasions in life, without any obligation to state or citizen. He/she is the product of a youth sacrificed to the goddess of education ( not learning, or wisdom mind you ). The ultimate, certified autodidact. Since his clearing a mundane set of questionnaires full of trivia and twisters ( and facts like who the fµck invented the serviciodevo school of dancing ?) along with intermediate math and science, is the permanent proof that he is better suited than any academic or expert to administrate an entire gamut of institutions from the municipality to the welfare of the aged to economic re-zoning and industrial expansion. This automaton programmed with managerial exactitude shall be responsible for the way the country works, no matter what the politician says is supposed to be. And the prospects ? They shall stagger your mind. The funds that pass the offices held by this person are only what he/she says they are. There are entire dept.s and sub dept.s, committees and so on to post-justify the expenses on any number of things, while keeping the un-missed change. It’s all done here, folks. The economics of this stuff is so complex that they alone should justify the collective service of the best rote educated, quasi academics in the country. There is no other job quite like it. Especially in India.The nuisance. This is a newly discovered profession. Fast becoming the norm, like MBAs were once. Technology and connectivity have enabled the localized, or remote ‘butting in’ of any number of individuals into far displaced events and conflicts. They may even be displaced in time ! For example it is now possible to butt in , in the midst of a film production or the narration of a perfectly well recollected event or personality and stomp about insisting that it be recollected in a different way ! You may think this is a useless profession. What are the choices ? What is the scope of growth or greenness ? Plenty. You see, from the gray wastes of burnt books and ravaged monuments, from the confused social memories of confounded generations who’ve had to watch you stomp about and insist on your version, you can engineer an entire causality that leads to you profiteering in the end. It has only been enabled by social media and tech advances, and the receding graph of original and untrammeled thinking. This career may be applied in the service of no 2. also , and consequently shift to that profession.I can’t think of any more, I’m too depressed by now… but any one of these shall enable you to get the most out of India, without ever being obliged to give back to her.

China: At least 250 nuclear weapons. Now let me state the effect of one nuclear bomb that exploded on 9th august 1945 on Nagasaki, Japan. “An estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was Leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illness from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation.” One can imagine the destruction that the bombs these countries possess will bring to the world’s most populous region of the world. India, China and Pakistan amount to 38.62 % of world’s population. So the very possibility of such war makes the lives of all those more than 2.8 billion people at stake. Not only that the countries that are allies to the respective countries will also be drawn into this spurious situation, and that means in effect the whole world will be at war. WELCOME TO THE WORLD WAR III! WElCOME TO THE END OF THE WORLD! Now in case of any such possibility, Following things would happen: United nations Security Council will be held and China will be threatened by US and Russia while Pakistan will be threatened with total annihilation by both. China will also be threatened not only by US and Russia but virtually the rest of the whole world. In pakistan the US forces will take over the nuclear arsenal in their control. In my opinion this will be the first situation where US and Russia would be on the same side of any conflict. The combined forces of Russia and US will patrol the waters of South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, Sea of Japan and Arabian Sea. May be for the sake of preventing any mishap of nuclear incident NO-FLY Zone will be implemented on the skies of Pakistan. India will see flow of diplomats and heads of states calling it to maintain restrain and they will be assuring India of no any aggression on China’s part of Pakistan’s part.

Cinefans rejected the film so enthusiastically that the 125-crore film had a loss of 100 crores. Many call it the biggest flop in the history of Bollywood. Even actors Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma would prefer to disown this disaster. 3. Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja  It is said that producer Boney Kapoor put all his money in his most ambitious project. At a time when films were made in lakhs, this one had a whopping 9-crore budget. We're assuming even its original director, Shekhar Kapoor, realised how shoddy the film was, before leaving it halfway. Trade analysts held poor dialogues, weak music and a silly story-line responsible for the debacle. We still feel sorry for actors Anil Kapoor, Sridevi and Jackie Shroff. Bunty Aur Babli 4. Kites  A superstar son, a brilliant director, a Mexican hottie and a melodic album, but none could save the film. Kites could've been a dream crossover project for Hrithik Roshan onto international cinema. Rakesh Roshan even had a Brett Ratner cut of the film for American audiences. But unfortunately, he also had a cliched script. 150 crores wasted! 5. Asoka  Shah Rukh Khan's dream project refused to go down well both with critics and fans alike. The 3-hour long period film failed at a time when 13 crores was a massive investment. 6. Love Story 2050  With VFX teams from Australia and New Zealand, the film was much hyped in terms of special effects. But producer Harry Baweja's plans of giving his son Harman Baweja his dream launch failed miserably due to a ""senseless"" script. While Harman ended up with the tag of a Hrithik-lookalike, the corny film also lead to his breakup with his rumoured girlfriend and his female lead Priyanka Chopra. Ouch! 7. Raavan Mani Ratnam was supposed to make a comeback with this mega project starring Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. With a sloppy script, the 100-crore film lost more than 50% at the box office. 8. Mangal Pandey  We know how much time Aamir Khan took to prepare for this film to completely look his part. It was also one of the most eagerly awaited movies. But the basic idea of a prostitute romancing one of India's favourite freedom fighters didn't go down well with many. All we remember in this 35-crore film is Aamir's long hair and his big moustache. 9. Saawariya  Under Sanjay Leela Bhansali's banner, it could've been the perfect launchpad for Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor. But the story wasn't well received in the Indian market. Completely shot on 'blue-coloured' sets, the 40-crore film, after a point, left the audience gasping for some sunlight and fresh air. 10. Raju Chacha  It was made at a budget of 30 crores at a time when lavish films required 15 crores tops. Even its Christmas release couldn't do it any good. It's unfortunate resemblance to the 1965 classic The Sound of Music, a long and poor screenplay, and insipid lead performances crashed the film, much to the loss of producer-actor Ajay Devgan. 11. Blue  At 129 crores, this film became Bollywood's most expensive in 2009. It had some brilliant underwater shots, expensive action choreography, a long schedule in Bahamas but no grace! The hefty paychecks of Akshay Kumar and Sanjay Dutt took the film's budget overboard and its flimsy story about an under-sea bounty left many disappointed. Special appearance by Kylie Minogue (who was paid 6.6 crores) added to the producers' pockets. 12. Drona  It is always a risk to invest 87 crores on Abhishek Bachchan, right? But good friend and producer Goldie Behl took the risk, only to realise what he lost when the film bombed heavily at the box office. A superhero flick, so to speak, was too full of imaginary rubbish. 13. Ajooba A film with a budget of 8 crores in 1991 was solid money! So much so, that Shashi Kapoor had to close down his film production company after this film. His friendship with Amitabh Bachchan fell back real hard it seems. This highly hyped superhero film failed to make any impact on the audience. 14. Besharam  Sometimes we just wonder why brilliant actors like Ranbir Kapoor end up doing such poor films. His super stardom did draw the audience to the theaters but, ultimately, the content has to do the talking and it was declared an absolute letdown. The 85-crore film only managed to cover 35 crores. 15. RGV Ki Aag  Let's save the best for the last. So if I call it the biggest box office disaster till date, I hope most of you will agree. Many also listed it among the worst Bollywood movies ever made. The basic crux of remaking a classic Sholay raised many eyebrows. Ram Gopal Verma messed the older version making Amitabh play Babban Singh on the lines of Gabbar. Poor casting, bad storytelling and horrible reception made this big budget film a catastrophe! Shaandaar  I'm sure there were many like me, who genuinely felt bad for this film made at a budget of 75 crores.

I believe a basic overview will be helpful. Let's narrow our definition to include the understanding of the risks associated with the software system you might be testing. It is important to remember that risk areas can and do exist outside of the actual programming itself. For example: Insufficient staffing resourcesVendors that supply system software or hardware to projects can cause riskSo, let's use the following definition: The process by which project risks are identified and the impact of those risks determined. Think of risk as the probability that some part of the application under test will fail, and what the impact of that failure will be to the end user and to your company. In some areas, a failure might go unnoticed while other failures can have catastrophic consequences. This goes back to things such as: The project stakeholder's assessment of component business prioritiesRelative complexities of the functions being testedYour analysis should reveal which components have the highest/lowest business priority and which components have the highest/lowest existing or projected defect rates. This will help you apportion the risks correctly among the application components. Keep in mind, that risk can be subjective. The list of application modules that you think are high risk may not match the list of another stakeholder (keep in mind that the end user is a stakeholder). In fact, this happens often. It may be more important to the 'business' to get the application to market in a certain time than to make sure that 'Function X' is working properly. It helps to think about risk in two parts: The severity of the risk - what is the impact to key stakeholders if function 'x' fails - this has business priority rolled inThe likelihood that a failure will occur - some functions are complex and thus have higher expected defect rates - some modules are less complex and thus have lower expected defect ratesUsing the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle). it helps to remember that: Some modules will be used often possibly increasing their riskSome modules will be used infrequently possibly lessening their riskFrom this basic outline, what follows is a simple tool that can help you 'get a feel' for module risk. The format is easy to modify to fit whatever style your shop uses. Before you use this or any tool, check with your management to determine the tool's appropriateness for use on your project. Remember, your chart can have the same or different items in the chart. For example you might add values for external risks as discussed above. Additionally, the value system you use can be anything that is meaningful to your project. Below is both a chart and guide to using it. The terms used in the chart are defined as follows: Module - Module name or IDBusiness Priority - What the business' relative priority ranking is for this particular module versus the other project modules. Core functionality modules usually rank higher.Complexity - the relative complexity of the module as compared to the other modules. It's best to speak with a senior associate if you are unsure.Defect Rate Experience - Refers to module defect rates encountered in previous iterations if this module already exists or defect rates in similar modules used previously. If the module is new, you can 'guesstimate'.Test Data Design Impact - Some modules will be easily tested with basic data. Some modules will require extensive data sets to test properly. It is not uncommon for an analyst to severely underestimate the time needed to create the necessary data sets. Integration tests usually require different data from functional tests. The same goes for performance testing. Often, test data from previous testing may be available.Project Schedule - In today's Agile world, application functionality is usually done in iterations. Typically, functionality will be prioritized depending on core business needs. This will cause low priority modules to moved to 'later' in the process. Late schedule functionality can cause problems such as:Insufficient time to complete testing late in the schedule which can raise the risk levelFunctionality changes to late schedule modules which might affect the overall test strategyTotals - Add up the values and make your judgement. If you decide an item is NA, just put a 'zero' in that cell. If you just use the first three columns, it's my opinion that anything over '8' is risky. If you add the last two columns shown, then '10' looks risky to me. This is just an example. You and the other stakeholders can determine what items to use in the chart and at what level the risk becomes too much. With the actual chart complete, you can make an assessment of the relative risks of all the modules as they relate to each other. The inevitable time and resource issues will force you to prioritize the modules under test in case you need to focus testing efforts.Keep in mind, that this is just an overview to introduce risk assessment.

In the event of a system breach, an information security analyst leads company efforts to counter such entry and prevent one from occurring again. These efforts can either thwart a breach or minimize the damage it causes. It is a given that technology is constantly changing. This includes the hardware and software needed for data transmission, storage, analysis, encryption, and beyond. The effectiveness of an information security analyst depends largely on keeping up-to-date with both current and emerging security systems and cyber attack strategies. Although these methodologies fluctuate, the underlying mission of keeping a company’s vital information safe remains constant. Steps to Becoming an Information Security Analyst Pursuing a career as an information security analyst may be attractive to anyone who has always had an intense interest in learning how things work, to the point of taking gizmos and computers apart and putting them back together. While this could be the spark that eventually ignites an interest in a technology career, the typical journey to become an information security analyst is one that’s built on a combination of focused education and experience. Step 1: Earn a Bachelor’s Degree Most positions for information security analysts require a bachelor’s degree in a computer- or technology-related field. These undergraduate degrees can stem from generalized programs such as computer science or programming, or they can be linked to programs pointed toward the security elements of the computer world, such as a Bachelor’s of Science in Cybersecurity. Those who wish to take a deeper dive into computer-based security on an undergraduate level may want to pursue a degree like a Bachelor’s of Science in Management Information Systems. This type of education can help students apply their developing computer security skills in a business management context — a role that goes beyond the realm of spotting a bug or virus or learning the latest computer security techniques. A Bachelor’s of Science in Management Information Systems is intended to prepare students to properly design, develop, implement, and oversee a company’s computer security system, all within the confines of a typical modern business. The curriculum typically provides up-to-date knowledge about various IT-related systems and trends, exposing students to knowledge that is used by professionals who are already working in the industry. The knowledge and skill set honed by attaining a Bachelor’s of Science in Management Information Systems degree can also prepare students to handle other critical computer-related issues. For instance, the degree program can help teach an information security analyst the basics of how to create, analyze, and execute a data disaster recovery plan. The tasks involved can include transferring data to an off-site venue, restarting an entire IT system, and restoring its integrity in the aftermath of a catastrophe. Step 2: Gain On-the-Job Experience While a degree may help students stand out in the job market, it is recommended that potential candidates add experience to their résumé. Typically, an intermediate-level security analyst position requires several years of experience in information security, although some employers may accept experience gained in a computer-related field. This type of on-the-job experience demonstrates to potential employers that candidates know how to apply their knowledge in real-world situations, which makes hiring the candidate more viable. As is the case with most careers in the technology industry, a key element of on-the-job experience is focused on staying abreast of newly emerging technologies and methods in cybersecurity. These advances can range from state-of-the-art firewall systems, to new strategies built around incident responses. Being cognizant of these advances can enable information security analysts to gain practical experience in staying one step ahead of potential cyber breaches. Step 3: Attain Certifications and Training (Optional) In addition to keeping current with cyber safety issues, it’s equally important to keep abreast of the latest developments on the other side of the equation, i.e., the cyber attack side. Malevolent attempts to penetrate computer networks and systems, such as malware implementation and denial of service (DoS) attacks, are constantly taking on new appearances. It’s up to information security analysts to be up to the task for taking on these new versions and variants. One of the best ways for information system analysts to keep up with the constantly changing face of cybersecurity is to pursue certifications. Some employers require that job candidates — and even current employees — possess specialized technology certifications, as these provide further validation of a candidate’s skill set and core competencies. Some credentials, such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), reflect knowledge in general information security. However, there are other specialized certifications that indicate that a professional has deeper knowledge of a specific aspect of cybersecurity. For instance, a Certified Reverse Engineering Analyst certification emphasizes skills related to malware analysis, while a Certified Ethical Hacker credential demonstrates the capacity to lawfully hack into a network’s security system to expose flaws. Some of the credentials graduates may be interested in pursuing feature prerequisites. To be eligible to apply for CISSP certification, candidates must have at least five years of experience in two or more of CISSP’s eight domains, such as asset security, identity and access management (IAM), or communication and network security. To apply for an initial Certified Ethical Hacker certification, candidates must either have at least two years experience in an information security domain or have attended an officially sanctioned training course. Step 4: Pursue an MS in Cybersecurity for Advancement (Optional) Although it does take years of on-the-job experience to work up to becoming an information security analyst, it may be faster with an advanced degree like a Master’s in Cybersecurity. A program such as this typically merges academic coursework with practical work experience in a business environment. This experience component not only helps refine skills associated with cybersecurity, but also helps to gain insight into the business side of the profession. Exposure may include real-world case studies and analysis of the legal ramifications of the profession. An advanced curriculum in cybersecurity also usually helps strengthen skills relevant to adjacent subject areas, such as computer engineering and business. This can provide a more well-rounded and holistic approach to the information security analyst position, which, along with relevant work experience, may help graduates be considered for higher level positions or advancement. Skills an Information Security Analyst Needs An information security analyst must have several key qualities to be effective. As the job title suggests, strong analytical skills are key, as is in-depth knowledge of computer networks and digital systems. This is needed for assessing the effectiveness of security measures and spotting flaws that could lead to breaches. Information security analysts must also have excellent troubleshooting and problem-solving skills, as they may need to fix any issues they uncover. Successful information security analysts are detail-oriented individuals who can spot slight changes in a system’s performance that may indicate a security breach, unauthorized software or malware. Having the skill to catch and correctly diagnose system “hiccups” could prevent something much larger and more severe down the road. Finally, information security analysts should possess ingenuity that enables them to solve technical problems with creative methods and thinking. It’s important to be proactive, too, in anticipating information security risks and implementing new protection strategies before attacks occur. This vigilant approach can help catch a cyber attack before it has a chance to start. Information Security Analyst Salary and Job Outlook There is potential for an information security analyst to make a good income. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the 2017 median salary for the position is roughly $95,500 per year. The precise salary graduates can achieve in this career path is dependent on a few factors, such as years of experience and job location. The BLS also projects it to be a rapidly expanding field, with job growth expected to be 28 percent by 2026 — much faster than the average for all other occupations. One of the primary reasons for this growth is the fact that cyber attacks are anticipated to be an increasing issue as we become a more automated business society and rely more on digital technologies.

But these grand worries are rooted in research. Along with Hawking and Musk, prominent figures at Oxford and UC Berkeley and many of the researchers working in AI today believe that advanced AI systems, if deployed carelessly, could end all life on earth. This concern has been raised since the dawn of computing. But it has come into particular focus in recent years, as advances in machine-learning techniques have given us a more concrete understanding of what we can do with AI, what AI can do for (and to) us, and how much we still don’t know. There are also skeptics. Some of them think advanced AI is so distant that there’s no point in thinking about it now. Others are worried that excessive hype about the power of their field might kill it prematurely. And even among the people who broadly agree that AI poses unique dangers, there are varying takes on what steps make the most sense today. The conversation about AI is full of confusion, misinformation, and people talking past each other — in large part because we use the word “AI” to refer to so many things. So here’s the big picture on how artificial intelligence might pose a catastrophic threat, in nine questions: 1) What is AI? Artificial intelligence is the effort to create computers capable of intelligent behavior. It is a broad catchall term, used to refer to everything from Siri to IBM’s Watson to powerful technologies we have yet to invent. Some researchers distinguish between “narrow AI” — computer systems that are better than humans in some specific, well-defined field, like playing chess or generating images or diagnosing cancer — and “general AI,” systems that can surpass human capabilities in many domains. We don’t have general AI yet, but we’re starting to get a better sense of the challenges it will pose. Narrow AI has seen extraordinary progress over the past few years. AI systems have improved dramatically at translation, at games like chess and Go, at important research biology questions like predicting how proteins fold, and at generating images. AI systems determine what you’ll see in a Google search or in your Facebook Newsfeed. They are being developed to improve drone targeting and detect missiles. But narrow AI is getting less narrow. Once, we made progress in AI by painstakingly teaching computer systems specific concepts. To do computer vision — allowing a computer to identify things in pictures and video — researchers wrote algorithms for detecting edges. To play chess, they programmed in heuristics about chess. To do natural language processing (speech recognition, transcription, translation, etc.), they drew on the field of linguistics. But recently, we’ve gotten better at creating computer systems that have generalized learning capabilities. Instead of mathematically describing detailed features of a problem, we let the computer system learn that by itself. While once we treated computer vision as a completely different problem from natural language processing or platform game playing, now we can solve all three problems with the same approaches.

Over five days, in five emails, we’ll walk you through research and frameworks that will help you decide how much and where to give and other ways to do good. Sign up for Future Perfect’s new pop-up newsletter. Our AI progress so far has enabled enormous advances — and has also raised urgent ethical questions. When you train a computer system to predict which convicted felons will reoffend, you’re using inputs from a criminal justice system biased against black people and low-income people — and so its outputs will likely be biased against black and low-income people too. Making websites more addictive can be great for your revenue but bad for your users. Rosie Campbell at UC Berkeley’s Center for Human-Compatible AI argues that these are examples, writ small, of the big worry experts have about general AI in the future. The difficulties we’re wrestling with today with narrow AI don’t come from the systems turning on us or wanting revenge or considering us inferior. Rather, they come from the disconnect between what we tell our systems to do and what we actually want them to do. For example, we tell a system to run up a high score in a video game. We want it to play the game fairly and learn game skills — but if it instead has the chance to directly hack the scoring system, it will do that. It’s doing great by the metric we gave it. But we aren’t getting what we wanted.  In other words, our problems come from the systems being really good at achieving the goal they learned to pursue; it’s just that the goal they learned in their training environment isn’t the outcome we actually wanted. And we’re building systems we don’t understand, which means we can’t always anticipate their behavior. Right now the harm is limited because the systems are so limited. But it’s a pattern that could have even graver consequences for human beings in the future as AI systems become more advanced. 2) Is it even possible to make a computer as smart as a person? Yes, though current AI systems aren’t nearly that smart. One popular adage about AI is “everything that’s easy is hard, and everything that’s hard is easy.” Doing complex calculations in the blink of an eye? Easy. Looking at a picture and telling you whether it’s a dog? Hard (until very recently). Lots of things humans do are still outside AI’s grasp. For instance, it’s hard to design an AI system that explores an unfamiliar environment, that can navigate its way from, say, the entryway of a building it’s never been in before up the stairs to a specific person’s desk. We don’t know how to design an AI system that reads a book and retains an understanding of the concepts. The paradigm that has driven many of the biggest breakthroughs in AI recently is called “deep learning.” Deep learning systems can do some astonishing stuff: beat games we thought humans might never lose, invent compelling and realistic photographs, solve open problems in molecular biology. These breakthroughs have made some researchers conclude it’s time to start thinking about the dangers of more powerful systems, but skeptics remain. The field’s pessimists argue that programs still need an extraordinary pool of structured data to learn from, require carefully chosen parameters, or work only in environments designed to avoid the problems we don’t yet know how to solve. They point to self-driving cars, which are still mediocre under the best conditions despite the billions that have been poured into making them work. With all those limitations, one might conclude that even if it’s possible to make a computer as smart as a person, it’s certainly a long way away. But that conclusion doesn’t necessarily follow. That’s because for almost all the history of AI, we’ve been held back in large part by not having enough computing power to realize our ideas fully. Many of the breakthroughs of recent years — AI systems that learned how to play Atari games, generate fake photos of celebrities, fold proteins, and compete in massive multiplayer online strategy games — have happened because that’s no longer true. Lots of algorithms that seemed not to work at all turned out to work quite well once we could run them with more computing power. And the cost of a unit of computing time keeps falling. Progress in computing speed has slowed recently, but the cost of computing power is still estimated to be falling by a factor of 10 every 10 years. Through most of its history, AI has had access to less computing power than the human brain. That’s changing. By most estimates, we’re now approaching the era when AI systems can have the computing resources that we humans enjoy. Furthermore, breakthroughs in a field can often surprise even other researchers in the field. “Some have argued that there is no conceivable risk to humanity [from AI] for centuries to come,” wrote UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell, “perhaps forgetting that the interval of time between Rutherford’s confident assertion that atomic energy would never be feasibly extracted and Szilárd’s invention of the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction was less than twenty-four hours.” Learn about the smart ways people are fixing the world’s problems.

Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter. There’s another consideration. Imagine an AI that is inferior to humans at everything, with one exception: It’s a competent engineer that can build AI systems very effectively. Machine learning engineers who work on automating jobs in other fields often observe, humorously, that in some respects, their own field looks like one where much of the work — the tedious tuning of parameters — could be automated. If we can design such a system, then we can use its result — a better engineering AI — to build another, even better AI. This is the mind-bending scenario experts call “recursive self-improvement,” where gains in AI capabilities enable more gains in AI capabilities, allowing a system that started out behind us to rapidly end up with abilities well beyond what we anticipated. This is a possibility that has been anticipated since the first computers. I.J. Good, a colleague of Alan Turing who worked at the Bletchley Park codebreaking operation during World War II and helped build the first computers afterward, may have been the first to spell it out, back in 1965: “An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.” 3) How exactly could it wipe us out? It’s immediately clear how nuclear bombs will kill us. No one working on mitigating nuclear risk has to start by explaining why it’d be a bad thing if we had a nuclear war. The case that AI could pose an existential risk to humanity is more complicated and harder to grasp. So many of the people who are working to build safe AI systems have to start by explaining why AI systems, by default, are dangerous.  Javier Zarracina/Vox The idea that AI can become a danger is rooted in the fact that AI systems pursue their goals, whether or not those goals are what we really intended — and whether or not we’re in the way. “You’re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice,” Stephen Hawking wrote, “but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green-energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. Let’s not place humanity in the position of those ants.” Here’s one scenario that keeps experts up at night: We develop a sophisticated AI system with the goal of, say, estimating some number with high confidence. The AI realizes it can achieve more confidence in its calculation if it uses all the world’s computing hardware, and it realizes that releasing a biological superweapon to wipe out humanity would allow it free use of all the hardware. Having exterminated humanity, it then calculates the number with higher confidence. Victoria Krakovna, an AI researcher at DeepMind (now a division of Alphabet, Google’s parent company), compiled a list of examples of “specification gaming”: the computer doing what we told it to do but not what we wanted it to do. For example, we tried to teach AI organisms in a simulation to jump, but we did it by teaching them to measure how far their “feet” rose above the ground. Instead of jumping, they learned to grow into tall vertical poles and do flips — they excelled at what we were measuring, but they didn’t do what we wanted them to do. An AI playing the Atari exploration game Montezuma’s Revenge found a bug that let it force a key in the game to reappear, thereby allowing it to earn a higher score by exploiting the glitch. An AI playing a different game realized it could get more points by falsely inserting its name as the owner of high-value items. Sometimes, the researchers didn’t even know how their AI system cheated: “the agent discovers an in-game bug. ... For a reason unknown to us, the game does not advance to the second round but the platforms start to blink and the agent quickly gains a huge amount of points (close to 1 million for our episode time limit).” What these examples make clear is that in any system that might have bugs or unintended behavior or behavior humans don’t fully understand, a sufficiently powerful AI system might act unpredictably — pursuing its goals through an avenue that isn’t the one we expected. In his 2009 paper “The Basic AI Drives,”Steve Omohundro, who has worked as a computer science professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and as the president of Possibility Research, argues that almost any AI system will predictably try to accumulate more resources, become more efficient, and resist being turned off or modified: “These potentially harmful behaviors will occur not because they were programmed in at the start, but because of the intrinsic nature of goal driven systems.” His argument goes like this: Because AIs have goals, they’ll be motivated to take actions that they can predict will advance their goals. An AI playing a chess game will be motivated to take an opponent’s piece and advance the board to a state that looks more winnable. But the same AI, if it sees a way to improve its own chess evaluation algorithm so it can evaluate potential moves faster, will do that too, for the same reason: It’s just another step that advances its goal. If the AI sees a way to harness more computing power so it can consider more moves in the time available, it will do that. And if the AI detects that someone is trying to turn off its computer mid-game, and it has a way to disrupt that, it’ll do it. It’s not that we would instruct the AI to do things like that; it’s that whatever goal a system has, actions like these will often be part of the best path to achieve that goal. That means that any goal, even innocuous ones like playing chess or generating advertisements that get lots of clicks online, could produce unintended results if the agent pursuing it has enough intelligence and optimization power to identify weird, unexpected routes to achieve its goals. Goal-driven systems won’t wake up one day with hostility to humans lurking in their hearts. But they will take actions that they predict will help them achieve their goal — even if we’d find those actions problematic, even horrifying. They’ll work to preserve themselves, accumulate more resources, and become more efficient. They already do that, but it takes the form of weird glitches in games. As they grow more sophisticated, scientists like Omohundro predict more adversarial behavior. 4) When did scientists first start worrying about AI risk? Scientists have been thinking about the potential of artificial intelligence since the early days of computers. In the famous paper where he put forth the Turing test for determining if an artificial system is truly “intelligent,” Alan Turing wrote: Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that these machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them. ... There would be plenty to do in trying to keep one’s intelligence up to the standards set by the machines, for it seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. … At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control. I.J. Good worked closely with Turing and reached the same conclusions, according to his assistant, Leslie Pendleton. In an excerpt from unpublished notes Good wrote shortly before he died in 2009, he writes about himself in third person and notes a disagreement with his younger self — while as a younger man, he thought powerful AIs might be helpful to us, the older Good expected AI to annihilate us. [The paper] “Speculations Concerning the First Ultra-intelligent Machine” (1965) ... began: “The survival of man depends on the early construction of an ultra-intelligent machine.” Those were his words during the Cold War, and he now suspects that “survival” should be replaced by “extinction.” He thinks that, because of international competition, we cannot prevent the machines from taking over. He thinks we are lemmings. He said also that “probably Man will construct the deus ex machina in his own image.” In the 21st century, with computers quickly establishing themselves as a transformative force in our world, younger researchers started expressing similar worries. Nick Bostrom is a professor at the University of Oxford, the director of the Future of Humanity Institute, and the director of the Governance of Artificial Intelligence Program. He researches risks to humanity, both in the abstract — asking questions like why we seem to be alone in the universe — and in concrete terms, analyzing the technological advances on the table and whether they endanger us. AI, he concluded, endangers us. In 2014, he wrote a book explaining the risks AI poses and the necessity of getting it right the first time, concluding, “once unfriendly superintelligence exists, it would prevent us from replacing it or changing its preferences. Our fate would be sealed.”  Across the world, others have reached the same conclusion. Bostrom co-authored a paper on the ethics of artificial intelligence with Eliezer Yudkowsky, founder of and research fellow at the Berkeley Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), an organization that works on better formal characterizations of the AI safety problem. Yudkowsky started his career in AI by worriedly poking holes in others’ proposals for how to make AI systems safe, and has spent most of it working to persuade his peers that AI systems will, by default, be unaligned with human values (not necessarily opposed to but indifferent to human morality) — and that it’ll be a challenging technical problem to prevent that outcome. Increasingly, researchers realized that there’d be challenges that hadn’t been present with AI systems when they were simple. “‘Side effects’ are much more likely to occur in a complex environment, and an agent may need to be quite sophisticated to hack its reward function in a dangerous way. This may explain why these problems have received so little study in the past, while also suggesting their importance in the future,” concluded a 2016 research paper on problems in AI safety. Bostrom’s book Superintelligence was compelling to many people, but there were skeptics. “No, experts don’t think superintelligent AI is a threat to humanity,” argued an op-ed by Oren Etzioni, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington and CEO of the Allan Institute for Artificial Intelligence. “Yes, we are worried about the existential risk of artificial intelligence,” replied a dueling op-ed by Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and UC Berkeley professor, and Allan DaFoe, a senior research fellow at Oxford and director of the Governance of AI program there. It’s tempting to conclude that there’s a pitched battle between AI-risk skeptics and AI-risk believers. In reality, they might not disagree as profoundly as you would think. Facebook’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, for example, is a vocal voice on the skeptical side. But while he argues we shouldn’t fear AI, he still believes we ought to have people working on, and thinking about, AI safety. “Even if the risk of an A.I. uprising is very unlikely and very far in the future, we still need to think about it, design precautionary measures, and establish guidelines,” he writes. That’s not to say there’s an expert consensus here — far from it. There is substantial disagreement about which approaches seem likeliest to bring us to general AI, which approaches seem likeliest to bring us to safe general AI, and how soon we need to worry about any of this. Many experts are wary that others are overselling their field, and dooming it when the hype runs out. But that disagreement shouldn’t obscure a growing common ground; these are possibilities worth thinking about, investing in, and researching, so we have guidelines when the moment comes that they’re needed. 5) Why couldn’t we just shut off a computer if it got too powerful? A smart AI could predict that we’d want to turn it off if it made us nervous. So it would try hard not to make us nervous, because doing so wouldn’t help it accomplish its goals. If asked what its intentions are, or what it’s working on, it would attempt to evaluate which responses are least likely to get it shut off, and answer with those. If it wasn’t competent enough to do that, it might pretend to be even dumber than it was — anticipating that researchers would give it more time, computing resources, and training data. So we might not know when it’s the right moment to shut off a computer. We also might do things that make it impossible to shut off the computer later, even if we realize eventually that it’s a good idea. For example, many AI systems could have access to the internet, which is a rich source of training data and which they’d need if they’re to make money for their creators (for example, on the stock market, where more than half of trading is done by fast-reacting AI algorithms). But with internet access, an AI could email copies of itself somewhere where they’ll be downloaded and read, or hack vulnerable systems elsewhere. Shutting off any one computer wouldn’t help. In that case, isn’t it a terrible idea to let any AI system — even one which doesn’t seem powerful enough to be dangerous — have access to the internet? Probably. But that doesn’t mean it won’t continue to happen. So far, we’ve mostly talked about the technical challenges of AI. But from here forward, it’s necessary to veer more into the politics. Since AI systems enable incredible things, there will be lots of different actors working on such systems. There will likely be startups, established tech companies like Google (Alphabet’s recently acquired startup DeepMind is frequently mentioned as an AI frontrunner), and nonprofits (the Elon Musk-founded OpenAI is another major player in the field). There will be governments — Russia’s Vladimir Putin has expressed an interest in AI, and China has made big investments. Some of them will presumably be cautious and employ safety measures, including keeping their AI off the internet. But in a scenario like this one, we’re at the mercy of the least cautious actor, whoever they may be. That’s part of what makes AI hard: Even if we know how to take appropriate precautions (and right now we don’t), we also need to figure out how to ensure that all would-be AI programmers are motivated to take those precautions and have the tools to implement them correctly. 6) What are we doing right now to avoid an AI apocalypse? “It could be said that public policy on AGI [artificial general intelligence] does not exist,” concluded a paper this year reviewing the state of the field. The truth is that technical work on promising approaches is getting done, but there’s shockingly little in the way of policy planning, international collaboration, or public-private partnerships. In fact, much of the work is being done by only a handful of organizations, and it has been estimated that around 50 people in the world work full time on technical AI safety. Bostrom’s Future of Humanity Institute has published a research agenda for AI governance: the study of “devising global norms, policies, and institutions to best ensure the beneficial development and use of advanced AI.” It has published research on the risk of malicious uses of AI, on the context of China’s AI strategy,and on artificial intelligence and international security. The longest-established organization working on technical AI safety is the Machine Intelligence Research Institute(MIRI), which prioritizes research into designing highly reliable agents — artificial intelligence programs whose behavior we can predict well enough to be confident they’re safe. (Disclosure: MIRI is a nonprofit and I donated to its work in 2017 and 2018.) The Elon Musk-founded OpenAI is a very new organization, less than three years old. But researchers there are active contributors to both AI safety and AI capabilities research. A research agenda in 2016 spelled out “concrete open technical problems relating to accident prevention in machine learning systems,” and researchers have since advanced some approaches to safe AI systems. Alphabet’s DeepMind, a leader in this field, has a safety team and a technical research agenda outlined here. “Our intention is to ensure that AI systems of the future are not just ‘hopefully safe’ but robustly, verifiably safe ,” it concludes, outlining an approach with an emphasis on specification (designing goals well), robustness (designing systems that perform within safe limits under volatile conditions), and assurance (monitoring systems and understanding what they’re doing). There are also lots of people working on more present-day AI ethics problems: algorithmic bias, robustness of modern machine-learning algorithms to small changes, and transparency and interpretability of neural nets, to name just a few. Some of that research could potentially be valuable for preventing destructive scenarios. But on the whole, the state of the field is a little bit as if almost all climate change researchers were focused on managing the droughts, wildfires, and famines we’re already facing today, with only a tiny skeleton team dedicating to forecasting the future and 50 or so researchers who work full time on coming up with a plan to turn things around. Not every organization with a major AI department has a safety team at all, and some of them have safety teams focused only on algorithmic fairness and not on the risks from advanced systems. The US government doesn’t have a department for AI. The field still has lots of open questions — many of which might make AI look much more scary, or much less so — which no one has dug into in depth. 7) Is this really likelier to kill us all than, say, climate change? It sometimes seems like we’re facing dangers from all angles in the 21st century. Both climate change and future AI developments are likely to be transformative forces acting on our world. Our predictions about climate change are more confident, both for better and for worse. We have a clearer understanding of the risks the planet will face, and we can estimate the costs to human civilization. They are projected to be enormous, risking potentially hundreds of millions of lives. The ones who will suffer most will be low-income people in developing countries; the wealthy will find it easier to adapt. We also have a clearer understanding of the policies we need to enact to address climate change than we do with AI.  There’s intense disagreement in the field on timelines for critical advances in AI. While AI safety experts agree on many features of the safety problem, they’re still making the case to research teams in their own field, and they disagree on some of the details. There’s substantial disagreement on how badly it could go, and on how likely it is to go badly. There are only a few people who work full time on AI forecasting. One of the things current researchers are trying to nail down is their models and the reasons for the remaining disagreements about what safe approaches will look like. Most experts in the AI field think it poses a much larger risk of total human extinction than climate change, since analysts of existential risks to humanity think that climate change, while catastrophic, is unlikely to lead to human extinction. But many others primarily emphasize our uncertainty — and emphasize that when we’re working rapidly toward powerful technology about which there are still many unanswered questions, the smart step is to start the research now. 8) Is there a possibility that AI can be benevolent? AI safety researchers emphasize that we shouldn’t assume AI systems will be benevolent by default. They’ll have the goals that their training environment set them up for, and no doubt this will fail to encapsulate the whole of human values. When the AI gets smarter, might it figure out morality by itself? Again, researchers emphasize that it won’t. It’s not really a matter of “figuring out” — the AI will understand just fine that humans actually value love and fulfillment and happiness, and not just the number associated with Google on the New York Stock Exchange. But the AI’s values will be built around whatever goal system it was initially built around, which means it won’t suddenly become aligned with human values if it wasn’t designed that way to start with. Of course, we can build AI systems that are aligned with human values, or at least that humans can safely work with. That is ultimately what almost every organization with an artificial general intelligence division is trying to do. A success with AI could give us access to decades or centuries of technological innovation all at once. “If we’re successful, we believe this will be one of the most important and widely beneficial scientific advances ever made,” writes the introduction to Alphabet’s DeepMind. “From climate change to the need for radically improved healthcare, too many problems suffer from painfully slow progress, their complexity overwhelming our ability to find solutions. With AI as a multiplier for human ingenuity, those solutions will come into reach.” So, yes, AI can share our values — and transform our world for the good. We just need to solve a very hard engineering problem first. 9) I just really want to know: how worried should we be? To people who think the worrying is premature and the risks overblown, AI safety is competing with other priorities that sound, well, a bit less sci-fi — and it’s not clear why AI should take precedence. To people who think the risks described are real and substantial, it’s outrageous that we’re dedicating so few resources to working on them. While machine-learning researchers are right to be wary of hype, it’s also hard to avoid the fact that they’re accomplishing some impressive, surprising things using very generalizable techniques, and that it doesn’t seem that all the low-hanging fruit has been picked. At a major conference in early December, Google’s DeepMind cracked open a longstanding problem in biology: predicting how proteins fold. “Even though there’s a lot more work to do before we’re able to have a quantifiable impact on treating diseases, managing the environment, and more, we know the potential is enormous,” its announcement concludes. AI looks increasingly like a technology that will change the world when it arrives. Researchers across many major AI organizations tell us it will be like launching a rocket: something we have to get right before we hit “go.” So it seems urgent to get to work learning rocketry. No matter whether or not humanity should be afraid, we should definitely be doing our homework.

It should’ve said “research fellow.”",2021-03-06T14:46:24.298Z,"Do we all have a moral duty towards solving problems that threaten the human race such as AI and climate change? ",Quora

Accounting information seems to me to be moving towards the current cost convention and the historic cost convention is now an anachronism. However, lets compare the impact. With the historic cost convention (+impairment) the main problem you would have with accounts is that there is hidden value - eg. a corporate raider could buy a Company, sell off all its undervalued property and effectively get the rest of the business for free (extreme example but allow me some leeway please!) Here pension funds and individual investors would not have realised the correct value in their shares that were sold because the assets in the balance sheet were lower than the actual value of assets in the Company. There is the situation where the assets are temporarily overvalued by a market crash before impairment kicks in but this is very temporary and most actors should be aware of it. With a current cost convention, various assets might get revalued, so the Company is supposed to represent its accurate value at this time and date. However, there are several problems - the main one being that valuations are subjective. That means they depend on judgement and are hence manipulated - given the general pressures on any public Company they will tend to be overvalued. I would argue that auditors are not sufficient experts to directly contradict FDs in respect of valuations within their companies and I think this is borne out generally by history. There is also the financial pressure on auditors, it is very difficult for any audit partner to say that the Fortune 500 FD is wrong and still keep the audit next year. So who loses in both situations, in the historic situation the company may be sold for less than it is worth, resulting in a smaller gain than anticipated, but the risk with current cost accounting is that management overvalue the company somehow and analysts have the sophistication to realise but the general public don’t. So rather than being a lack of a gain (in the general historic cost case) this becomes a loss, possibly a catastrophic one. Just to note that I knew two people, UK qualified accountants, who worked for Enron in the UK and invested their spare funds in the Company - to their detriment in the end - so its easy to be fooled - because they were experts (and they were both very bright - top 2% at least). So does the international accounting profession work - partly, and to be fair, probably better than it has ever done before due to harmonisation of rules. One plus is that international accounting standards allow comparison of companies across countries. One minus is that some countries enforce standards more than others. This answer is too long already, but happy to talk more if you have any specific queries.",2021-03-06T14:49:58.837Z,"Does the international accounting profession still serve the needs of the different users of accounting information?

This is because market conditions generally affect the companies in the same industry the same way. But sometimes, the stock price of a company will benefit from a piece of bad news for its competitor if the companies are competing for the same market. Investor sentiment Investor sentiment or confidence can cause the market to go up or down, which can cause stock prices to rise or fall. The general direction that the stock market takes can affect the value of a stock: bull market – a strong stock market where stock prices are rising and investor confidence is growing. It’s often tied to economic recovery or an economic boom, as well as investor optimism.bear market – a weak market where stock prices are falling and investor confidence is fading. It often happens when an economy is in recession and unemployment is high, with rising prices.Economic factors 1. Interest rates The Reserve Bank Of India can raise or lower interest rates to stabilize or stimulate the Indian economy. This is known as monetary policy. If a company borrows money to expand and improve its business, higher interest rates will affect the cost of its debt. This can reduce company profits and the dividends it pays shareholders. As a result, its share price may drop. And, in times of higher interest rates, investments that pay interest tend to be more attractive to investors than stocks. 2. Economic outlook If it looks like the economy is going to expand, stock prices may rise. Investors may buy more stocks thinking they will see future profits and higher stock prices. If the economic outlook is uncertain, investors may reduce their buying or start selling. 3. Inflation Inflation means higher consumer prices. This often slows sales and reduces profits. Higher prices will also often lead to higher interest rates. For example, the Reserve Bank Of India may raise interest rates to slow down inflation. These changes will tend to bring down stock prices. Commodities however, may do better with inflation, so their prices may rise. 4. Deflation Falling prices tend to mean lower profits for companies and decreased economic activity. Stock prices may go down, and investors may start selling their shares and move to fixed-income investments like bonds. Interest rates may be lowered to encourage people to borrow more. The goal is increased spending and economic activity. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was one of the worst periods of deflation ever. 5. Economic and political shocks Changes around the world can affect both the economy and stock prices. For example, a rise in energy costs can lead to lower sales, lower profits and lower stock prices. An act of terrorism can also lead to a downturn in economic activity and a fall in stock prices. 6. Changes in economic policy If a new government comes into power, it may decide to make new policies. Sometimes these changes can be seen as good for business, and sometimes not. They may lead to changes in inflation and interest rates, which in turn may affect stock prices.

On June 14 - September 6, 1944, at the age of 33, became the youngest general in the German army. His efficiency on the battlefield made him one of the best-known soldiers of the Waffen SS. A shadow over Meyer's career is his admiration for National Socialism and Adolf Hitler, which he did not give up until the end of his days. In 1930, Meyer became a member of the NSDAP, and a year later, he left the police ranks to serve in the SS. His first assignment was the 22nd SS - Standarte in Schwerin, and he was promoted to the 1st rank as SS-Untersturmfhrer in 1932. Two years later Kurt Meyer was assigned to ""Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler"". In his ranks he took part in the Anschluss of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. His first war experience as as the commander of the reconnaissance battalion ""Leibstandarte"" took place during the September campaign in 1939 . He received the Iron Cross of the Second Class for her. During the fights, he became ""famous"" for by ordering the execution of 50 Polish Jews in the Modlin region and putting a platoon commander in front of a court martial, who refused to carry out this order. For participation in the campaigns - French he was decorated as SS-Sturmbanfűhrer and Greek campaign - on his uniform hung another decorations - Iron Cross and Class and Knight's Cross .. Two years later, the oak tree joined the latter decoration, which he received for his actions on Eastern Front. ""Panzer"" Meyer particularly distinguished himself during the battles for Kharkiv in early 1943. However, here too, his ruthlessness was felt - he ordered to completely destroy one of the villages near Kharkiv, and liquidate its inhabitants. Among the SS soldiers, however, he enjoyed great respect, he did not avoid being on the front lines and extermination of civilians. In the summer of 1943, together with a group of officers ""Leibstandarte"", Kurt Meyer was transferred to the newly formed 12th SS Panzer Division ""Hitlerjugend"". Already as SS-Standartenfűhrer he became the commander of the 25th Panzer Grenadier Regiment of the SS. The creation of a new division was hampered by shortages in equipment, fuel and ammunition. At the beginning of 1944, the unit had only 40 tanks and 1/3 armored personnel carriers and reconnaissance vehicles, which should have a full-sized armored division. Most of the trucks were taken over after the disarming of the Italian army. The undoubted advantage of ""Hitlerjugend"" was the commanding staff, whose top positions were occupied by veterans from the 1st Armored Division ""Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler"". Meyer's subordinates, the majority of whom were eighteen-year-olds, were brought up in the spirit of National Socialism, and during the fighting in Normandy they showed fanaticism. Most strongly, the 25th Panzer Grenadier Regiment became known to Canadian soldiers. Both Mayer and his soldiers were in the habit of not taking prisoners. There are confirmed information about the crimes committed by Meyer's soldiers on captured Canadian soldiers. On June 14, 1944, the commander of the 12th Panzer Division of the SS ""Hitlerjugend"", SS - Brigadefhrerhrer Fritz Witt died as a result of injuries sustained during the shelling of allied ships. The commander of the ""Hitlerjugend"" was taken over by Kurt Meyer, promoted in August to the rank of SS-Oberfűhrer. The 12th Panzer Division of the SS ""Hitlerjugend"" suffered huge losses in the battles in Normandy and during the retreat behind the Siegfried Line. On 6 September in Durnal (Belgium) her commander fell into the hands of partisans and was soon handed over to American troops. In the absence of information about his fate (it was supposed to have died) Meyer was appointed SS-Brigadefűhrer with seniority on September 1, 1944. Interestingly, in August 1945, Kurt Meyer offered his services to the Western Allies. He stated that he was able to recruit more than 20,000 volunteers for the ""SS Europe Division"", which could stand in the upcoming conflict with the Soviet Union on the side of the Allies. After the war, the former commander of ""Hitlerjugend"" stood before the court. Meyer was accused of war crimes committed by his soldiers in Normandy. SS-man received a death sentence, which was later turned into a life imprisonment. After spending part of the sentence in Canada, in September 1954, Panzer Meyer was in a British military prison in West Germany, where he was spent the rest of his sentence.

60439709ed76476feda2f8db,https://www.quora.com/How-profitable-are-mid-sized-AAA-games?-,"This is a lot more complicated question than it at first may appear. First of all, it is difficult to actually predict sales. By having a vast marketing and sales network in place you can pretty much guarantee a base sale level, provided that the initial reception isn't catastrophic. In such a case marketing involves intense hype from multiple popular sources and things like possibly paying various media news sites/sources to advertise the upcoming game in best possible light, sometimes this extends to actual release of the game with initial review scores and attitudes as being part of such transaction/contract. Second stepActual sales budget. If you're able to look at your target demographic size and all the possible variables and come up with some sort of range for sales budget in terms of ""best case scenario - average scenario - worst case scenario"" you will get an idea of how much gross revenue the game should bring in. However, depending on distribution channels and such, marketing budget and so you will need to deduct sales and marketing related costs from that gross revenue. You'll also have to deduct possible taxes and all such. The figure you end up is the net sales budget which is the money you're aiming to get into your coffers from selling the game (regardless of your monetization scheme, merely you'd change some of the terminology but the idea is the same). Third stepNow that you have the amount of money the game is likely to make you (in your hopes), you should start looking at the actual development budget. If you're aiming to make any profit then it the size of development budget in relation to net sales budget mentioned above determines your risk. RiskRisk comes from multiple sources but it mainly deals with the sales budget being lower than you anticipated/hoped for. If your development budget is 100 and your best case scenario for sales ends you up with 150 in net sales budget then it would mean that your best case scenario would mean 50% profit (with the marketing and sales costs, taxes and development budget deducted from gross sales). Now, if at the same time your worst case scenario is 50, it would mean you'd make 50% losses.Since you wouldn't know where you land, your predictions are showing that you risk losing half of your money if your worst case scenario becomes a reality. That is a big risk to take! So, as a part of third step, you'll want to scale the development budget so that you don't have insane risk of losing all of your money. However, this includes a feedback loop in that as you change the size of development budget it also affects gross sales budget as well because the scale and possibly even type of game will be affected by what you can afford to make. There is no straight line to be found anywhere in this assessment and it's got a lot to do with crystal ball foretelling, gutt feel and smoke and mirrors. Beware of analysts telling you what the sales will be like! So, at the end of third step, hopefully (and after a lot of work) you should arrive at figures where the risk is minimal and chances for profits are best. This would allow you to continue your business and it also prevents you from having to find a new job in a different field after your game! TL;DR The profitability of your game has nothing directly to do with whether it's AAA or not, whether it's a big or a small project. Profit comes from making more money than you invested. Since you have to put money in beforehand, you can only guess at what the income is going to be like and fortune telling is not exactly reliable. Even trying to predict something as stable as Jupiter's position 1000 years from now has error of margin, simply due to error margins in measurements as well as not being able to calculate in every single factor reliably. What do you think are the chances that someone looking at a couple of past game's key figures has at determining the future sales of a whole different game? Also, look at some non-AAA games like Minecraft and so. If we looked at linear-cynical corporate planning then Minecraft shouldn't have ever been profitable because it's not AAA, not a lot of money was spent on it and because it wasn't hyped with multi-million budget and because reviewers weren't recruited/bribed to favor it.",2021-03-06T14:51:53.483Z,"How profitable are mid-sized AAA games?

Continue ReadingGood afternoon, INTRODUCTION, Technical Analysis (also abbreviated as TA) is a popular technique that allows to do just that. It not only helps to develop a point of view on a particular stock or index but also helps to define the trade keeping in mind the entry, exit and risk perspective. Like all research techniques, Technical Analysis also comes with its own attributes, some of which can be highly complex. However technology makes it easy to understand. WHAT IS TA ? Technical Analysis is a research technique to identify trading opportunities in market based on the actions of market participants. The actions of markets participants can be visualized by means of a stock chart. Over time, patterns are formed within these charts and each pattern conveys a certain message. The job of a technical analyst is to identify these patterns and develop a point of view. Like any research technique, technical analysis stands on a bunch of assumptions. As a practitioner of technical analysis, we need to trade the markets keeping these assumptions in perspective. If we approach TA as a quick and easy way to make money in markets, trading catastrophe is bound to happen. When a trading debacle happens, more often than not the blame is on technical analysis and not on the trader’s inability to efficiently apply Technical Analysis to markets. JARGONS RELATED TO TA… Hence before we start delving deeper into technical analysis it is important to set expectations on what can and cannot be achieved with technical analysis. Trades – TA is best used to identify short term trades. Do not use TA to identify long term investment opportunities. Long term investment opportunities are best identified using fundamental analysis. Also, If you are a fundamental analyst, use TA to calibrate the entry and exit pointsReturn per trade – TA based trades are usually short term in nature. Do not expect huge returns within a short duration of time. The trick with being successful with TA is to identify frequent short term trading opportunities which can give you small but consistent profits.Holding Period – Trades based on technical analysis can last anywhere between few minutes and few weeks, and usually not beyond that. We will explore this aspect when we discuss the topic on timeframes.Risk ­– Often traders initiate a trade for a certain reason, however in case of an adverse movement in the stock, the trade starts making a loss. Usually in such situations, traders hold on to their loss making trade with a hope they can recover the loss. Remember, TA based trades are short term, in case the trade goes sour, do remember to cut the losses and move on to identify another opportunity.Thanks.",2021-03-06T14:52:13.995Z,"What is technical analysis in stock markets?

Let's Nationalize the Federal Reserve  I don't think Bernie Sanders wants to go that far but he did recently float some interesting proposals. Text of Bernie Sanders’ Wall Street and economy speech     The American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans – half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. They also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states. They spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings. While Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened. Greed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today. So, to those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. And, here is a New Year’s Resolution that I will keep if elected president. If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you. We will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else. While President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash, the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done. Our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires That means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of “too big to fail.” We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out. In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were “too big to fail.” Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country. If Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say “break ‘em up.” And he would be right. And, here’s how I will accomplish that. Within the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a “Too-Big-to Fail” list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout. Within one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act. And, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let’s be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system. In my view, Senator Warren, is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other “too- big-to-fail” banks into pieces. And that’s exactly what we need to do. And that’s what I commit to do as president. Now, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits. Secretary Clinton is wrong. Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act. Let’s not forget: President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton. And, let’s not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn’t just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world. Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree. As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: “Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton’s proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street’s excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can’t be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.” Secretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking. My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to “cut it out” and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to “cut it out.” The reality is that Congress doesn’t regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will. It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don’t vote. They don’t believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don’t think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice. We live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice. Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy. That will change under my administration. “Equal Justice Under Law” will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans. It seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless, unfair and deceptive activities. Some people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. In my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis. The reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of. How many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn’t illegal? Let me help shatter that myth today. Since 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate. Here are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity. In August 2014, Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis. In November of 2013, JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In June of 2014, BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years’ probation and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in penalties by a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan, Iran and Cuba. Let me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud. CNN Headline, May 20, 2015: “5 big banks pay $5.4 billion for rigging currencies.” Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Headline from the International Business Times (February 24, 2015): “Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices.” The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Headline from The Real News Network (November 26, 2013): “Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U.S. has committed mortgage fraud.” Headline from The Washington Post (March 14, 2014): “In lawsuit, FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy,” which included Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase. Headline from the Guardian (April 2, 2011): “How a big U.S. bank laundered billions from Mexico’s murderous drug gangs.” This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money. Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this: “Wachovia’s blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.” Yet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank’s $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail. And, if that’s not bad enough, here’s another one. Headline: The Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2011: “J.P. Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures.” Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act, yet no one went to jail. And, when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year. According to this study, 51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market. More than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace. Nearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful. Twenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities. Here’s what one banker from Barclays said in 2010, when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market: “If you ain’t cheating, you ain’t trying.” Here’s what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008, “Let’s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.” This country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street. Under my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail. As president, I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration. And, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy. We will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it’s Wall Street’s turn to help the middle class. We cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products. And, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street. Investors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings – ratings that they knew were bogus. And, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them. Under my administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products. If we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans, we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees. In my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM. It is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent. The Bible has a term for this practice. It’s called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates. Today, we don’t need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don’t need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law. Today, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent. In 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America. We must also cap ATM fees at $2.00. People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM. Big banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders. We also need to give Americans affordable banking options. The reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go? You go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable. We need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U.S. postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that’s what I will fight for. Further, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street. When Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages. Further, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street. In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed’s boards and handpick its members and staff. Further, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd. Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Finally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. The truth is that Wall Street, corporate America, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful. What this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy, which brings millions of people together – black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American – young and old, men and women, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, people of all religions. Yes. Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes. Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them. Yes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don’t have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change. Yes, we can make our economy work for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And, now more than ever, that is exactly what we must do. And so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can’t crash our economy again. Will they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I’m president? You better believe it. Thank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation, not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve.

DARE has been a program since 1983. It didn’t stop the crack epidemic, it didn’t stop the opioid epidemic, and it won’t stop any other drug epidemic, either. Demand-side education programs do not often work in preventing large-scale societal ills. But let’s go to the long answer on this one, and to do that, we need to look at what happened in the 2008 financial crisis. This is going to take a while. I. Quick Intro to Mortgage-Backed Securities The most basic financial instrument we’re going to deal with here is the mortgage. A mortgage is a long-term loan. The basic idea is that I get a large pile of money now, and then over the course of some years, pay back the money piecemeal along with some extra money called interest. When dealing with loans to purchase homes, the length of time to pay back the loan is often thirty years. Home mortgages are generally fairly big from the perspective of an individual, and you’re frequently looking at hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. The takeaway here is that most individuals are never going to write a mortgage — lend the money — because they’re not going to have it in the first place. Most mortgages are written by institutions, commonly banks. That said, if the bank lends out $500,000, that’s a lot of money to have outstanding, and in particular, it’s a lot of money to have outstanding to one person. If that person defaults — stops paying — that’s a lot of money gone, so it is definitely a good idea for the bank to do as much as possible before issuing the loan to make sure that the person borrowing it is likely to pay it back. However, even if the person does end up good for the money, it’s still a lot of money gone for the bank over the short term, which means that other people will not be lent that money by the bank. In other words, if you want a lot of people to buy houses, you need to get those mortgages off the banks’ books. Since the 1930’s, the United States government has done this through several institutions,[1] the most commonly discussed being Fannie Mae, founded in 1938, and Freddie Mac, founded in 1970. The basic idea is that, supposing the mortgages banks write meet certain requirements, Fannie and Freddie (again, among others) will purchase them from the banks — which means giving the banks a pile of cash now to take over collecting on the mortgage payments later. So what do the government organizations actually do with all of those mortgages? This is where things get a little complicated, but the bottom line is that they sell them. They do not, however, sell them exactly in the form they get them. Go back to how the mortgage is initially created. The bank does its due diligence and makes sure you’re going to pay back the money, then it lends it to you. But again, this makes every last part of the loan dependent on whether or not you and you alone pay back the money. What this means is that if I’m subsequently going to buy your mortgage, I need to do my due diligence and investigate you. That’s impractical. What is rather more practical is if an institution splits up your mortgage into pieces, so that each time you make a mortgage payment, each of the pieces gets a slice of that payment. If the institution then combines one piece of your mortgage with one piece from 9,999 other people’s mortgages, whether or not you pay your mortgage has much less impact on whether or not I get paid. This is called “risk amortization,” and what it means is that unless a massive number of people stop paying their mortgages, I’ll probably be fine. This combination of slices is called a “mortgage-backed security,” usually abbreviated as MBS. The thing is, you don’t need to be a government institution to create MBS. You just have to have a large pile of money to buy a whole lot of mortgages to turn around and sell to other people. Since you can make a massive profit doing this, non-government organizations took part. This is where investment banks (among others) really come into play. Of course, if you’re going to make a large pile of cash doing this, you need volume, which is to say, you need to do it a lot. However, there are only so many people who are virtual locks to pay their mortgages, which means you have an inherently limited supply of mortgages to play with, and the government organizations are already sucking up most of the supply. But what happens if you start purchasing the mortgages that Fannie and Freddie don’t? Remember, Fannie and Freddie have rules regarding which mortgages they can buy and which they can’t, and if a borrower looks too unlikely to pay back their mortgage, the government isn’t going to come knocking to take that mortgage off a lender’s hands. These borrowers are called “subprime,” and yes, here’s where we can finally move away from theory. II. Leading into the Crisis Now we have large financial institutions that are going to sell MBS. They’re going to do this with mortgages Fannie and Freddie won’t take. And they need a large supply of mortgages, because otherwise, they can’t assemble the MBS in the first place and they can’t do it in massive volume in the second place. Additionally, it doesn’t really matter if the individual mortgages are all that good in the first place, thanks to the risk amortization we’ve already discussed. So that is a colossal incentive to start writing a whole lot of mortgages to people who probably can’t pay them back. And that’s ignoring something else: the greater the risk an investment has, the greater the return on the investment has to be. If your thrifty billionaire best friend asks you to lend her a hundred bucks for a year and she’ll give you back a hundred and ten, you’re probably going to be cool with that, because she’ll almost certainly pay you back. However, if a random homeless person on the street asked for that, you’re not going to go for that deal. But if they offered to pay you back $1,000,000,000 you might reconsider, considering that’s an interest rate of 999,999,900%. If you think there’s a one-in-one hundred million chance of getting paid back, yeah, that’s worth it, and if you think there’s an even better chance than that, the deal is weighted in your favor. Thus, subprime lending allowed investors to get in on MBS products that had a potentially higher rate of return than your standard issue prime mortgage-backed security would have. There was even greater flexibility in that rate of return than what we’ve covered so far would imply. So far, we’ve discussed the case where all of those mortgages are sliced up and mashed together so that everyone ends up with the same type of end result. However, if you’d like, you can “layer” the mortgages so that if some people stop paying their mortgages, only some of your MBS products will feel the hit. Those people would obviously get a greater rate of return if everyone pays their mortgage, while the people who don’t get hit when there’s a small rate of default would get a lower rate of return. The riskier the mortgages start as, the more flexibility you have in how you set up your types (which are generally called “tranches”) of MBS. This was also during a fairly long run of house prices rising. In some ways, a rise in property values is a good thing, but what it also means is that some people are going to try and take advantage of the trend. So, for example, if you’re pretty sure that home prices are going to keep rising, then you might, for example, buy a house you can’t really afford to pay the mortgage of over a 30-year period, wait a bit, and then sell the house for more than you bought it for, pay off the mortgage immediately, and pocket the profit. If you can time the market, this is a good strategy. If you can’t, well, it’s like most things in finance: you’re trying to pick up loose change in front of a moving bulldozer. Sometimes you make money, sometimes you get creamed. This flipping strategy is important to understand, because it suddenly makes a certain type of mortgage look very attractive. In the United States, the default home mortgage type for prime borrowers is the fixed-rate mortgage: every month, you send off a check to the bank (or wherever you need to) with the same number on it. However, a whole host of subprime borrowers were attracted by adjustable-rate mortgages. These mortgages tie their interest rate to some external index[2] and re-evaluate the interest rate as time goes on. This can be a good deal for the borrower if the index suddenly drops. However, if it doesn’t, then your introductory rate is probably going to be the lowest one you get, and everything after that is going to screw you, hard. So long as home prices keep going up, everything’s fine. However, if those prices drop — or even stall — everything’s going to hell in a handbasket, quickly. III. The Crisis In 2004, the federal funds rate was at the lowest it had been since the 1950’s. Adjustable-rate mortgages tied to the federal funds rate were therefore highly attractive. However, starting in late 2004, the Federal Reserve began raising the target federal funds rate,[3] eventually bringing it to over 5% by 2006. In other words, when the mortgage rates started adjusting in 2006, a lot of people got hit hard. Housing prices peaked in mid-2006 — and then a whole lot of people stopped being able to pay their mortgages or flip their houses. This, of course, meant that the actual returns on MBS products declined. Eventually, it became quite clear that there was a whole lot of valueless paper floating around that entitled people to mortgage payments that were never going to be made. Which leads us to an important question: who owned these MBS? The reason I’ve gone through everything here so painstakingly (and, some would no doubt argue, painfully) slowly is because it is genuinely unreasonable to expect most people outside the finance industry to understand most financial products. Most people will never need those products, so in the way most people don’t really need to know how to fix the wiring in their houses, most people don’t actually need to understand how a mortgage-backed security works. What this means is that most people will never buy a mortgage-backed security. The people who do buy mortgage-backed securities? Well, they’re usually not people. They’re usually organizations staffed by finance professionals. In other words, that insatiable demand for mortgage-backed securities that led to banks and other organizations assembling them en masse came from many of those same institutions. And this is really why the crisis got as bad as it was. The mortgages themselves might have been bad, but there was a whole lot of extra bad that went along with this that resulted mostly from very smart people being too damn smart for their own good. Want an example of this? Let’s say you have a bunch of mortgage-backed securities from the highest risk tranche. The rate of return is theoretically high on these puppies, but again, so is the risk of default. You want to unload them, but you can’t seem to find enough buyers. You could just hold onto the position or cut your asking price. Alternatively, you could mash together a bunch of different mortgage-backed securities like they were mortgages, and create a second-level mortgage-backed security. Suddenly, we’ve amortized the risk again, and we can sell the results more easily. You might wonder who would actually buy such a product. Someone claims to have taken the worst of the crap and somehow turned a large chunk of it into a fairly safe investment. You might think think this sounds fishy as all hell. However, you’re not an astrophysicist who left behind academia for a fat paycheck at Lehman Brothers. If you were, you’d know the math on this checks out, just look at the Gaussian copula. That wasn’t the only case of clever finance people making the underlying crap mortgage problem worse. Let’s say you’re an insurance firm. You can insure a whole range of things — cars, houses, Betty Grable’s legs, you name it. What you can also insure is financial instruments. So, if someone feels worried about the value of their MBS, they can pay you some money each month, and if the MBS turns to crap, you’ll pay out the value of the MBS. This is called a “credit default swap” (CDS), and you do not have to be an insurance company to offer a CDS. You also don’t have to own the underlying security to get a CDS. So while it’s illegal for me to take out a life insurance policy on my neighbor, it is perfectly legal for me to get a CDS for an MBS I don’t own. If the MBS defaults, I’ll get paid, and if it doesn’t, well, I’ve been paying that small fee for the lifetime of the CDS. Again, this isn’t stuff that mom and pop investors are ever going to use. This is stuff only finance professionals will use, and it gigantically inflated the size of the crisis. IV. The Smartest People in the Room Now, obviously, there was a catastrophic collapse in the housing market, which in turn, caused an equally catastrophic collapse in the values of mortgage-backed securities, which in turn, caused a much bigger collapse in the finance market thanks to credit default swaps and other such instruments. The big question you have to ask is why comparatively few people in finance saw it coming. The mathematical models said everything was fine. Why wasn’t it? If you think back to our discussion of risk amortization, you’ll notice the basic idea is that, if you take a bunch of different mortgages, what are the chances that they’ll all go into default simultaneously? This can be very easy to calculate: if there’s a 50% chance that Mortgage A defaults and a 20% chance that Mortgage B defaults, then there is a 10% chance they’ll both default. However, if I put it in these terms, those of you who paid close attention in high school math will realize that I’ve made an assumption: I’ve assumed that Mortgage A going into default and Mortgage B going into default are completely independent events — if Mortgage A goes into default, it doesn’t tell me anything about the likelihood of Mortgage B going into default. So long as mortgages going into default are uncorrelated events, this is a perfectly fine way to build a model. However, importantly, this is not how the market works. If I stop paying my mortgage, someone is going to repossess my house and then attempt to sell it. That increases the supply of houses on the market which, barring any shift in the demand for houses, means that the price of houses is going to go down. Which means that anyone who owns a house to flip it is suddenly in the soup, and is facing down getting their house repossessed. It also means there’s less incentive to build houses. That means there are fewer jobs for contractors, electricians, plumbers, and a whole host of other people. It means that there’s less demand for lumber and concrete. What this means is that some people are going to see diminished income and some people are going to get laid off entirely, which means that they are more likely to go into default on their mortgage. In a crash, everything is correlated. When mortgages start going into default, it drags others into default. A whole lot of literal rocket scientists and astrophysicists working in the finance industry forgot this. V. Back to Drugs I started this answer by referring to drugs, and pointing out just how much of a failure DARE has been in the US. The exact line I used was “demand-side education programs do not often work in preventing large-scale societal ills.” However, over the previous four sections, one thing should have been made exceptionally clear: the demand that caused this crisis wasn’t coming from financially illiterate people who wanted homes. It was coming from financially literate people who wanted mortgage-backed securities — real ones, or essentially faked MBS in the form of credit default swaps. So, to go back to the DARE analogy, the problem here was that Wall Street was getting high off its own supply. And like any dealing junkie, it was willing to do all kinds of things to get its next fix. Send motivated sellers to poor neighborhoods to bamboozle the elderly to taking out pointless mortgages on homes they already owned? Better believe that happened. Downplay the risk of the index going up, which even financially literate people wouldn’t necessarily disbelieve? Yup. Straight up lie when filling in mortgage applications for your clients when you’re a broker? Well, how else are you going to get the not-just-financially illiterate into the system? And even if you don’t take the criminal malfeasance that undeniably occurred into account, you’re still dealing with highly motivated sellers here. Trained salespeople who will do pretty much anything to close the sale and get that mortgage set up to be sold to a bank. Even if you’re financially literate, they’re still going to sound convincing because that’s their job — and because you’ve already been primed to want their product. After all, isn’t the American Dream two kids, a dog, and a house with a white picket fence? The economy didn’t go to shit in 2008 because your neighbors didn’t understand how to calculate mortgage payments. The economy went to shit in 2008 because geniuses[4] got greedy and forgot how the housing market actually works. This isn’t the first time this has happened. Ten years earlier, in 1998, a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management nearly wiped out Wall Street by forgetting that, in a crash, everything is correlated. The Federal Reserve had to step in and get 14 banks to work together in concert to save LTCM and prevent its failure from turning into a highly vicious cycle. LTCM’s employees were pretty much all Wall Street veterans when they joined, and understood the markets and securities about as well as anyone else. Several LTCM employees had won the Nobel Prize for economics. They still nearly took out the global economy[5] — and they didn’t need your neighbor taking out a stupid home equity loan to do it. And it’s not going to be the last time it happens, either. Let’s say, for example, there’s a class of debt where, even if a person declares bankruptcy, that debt is not discharged. Let’s say this class of debt is intimately tied not only to career advancement, but in many cases, having a career in the first place. Let’s say incurring this debt is viewed by many as a complete no-brainer of a proposition, and the education system itself actively suggests to people they should incur it. Congrats, you’re looking at student loans, which at this point in the US, come out to close to $1.5 trillion — about 7.5% of the US’ gross domestic product. And considering that it is frequently necessary to get a college degree to even get a secretarial job in the United States, well, there’s a reason over half of all college students will borrow money to attend. But let’s say, for example, you were a student loan provider who wanted to get a whole lot of debt off the books. Could you, for example, pool a whole bunch of student loans together and then start selling the pieces? Why yes, yes you could — and here we enter the world of student loan-backed securities. And if someone were to want in on the action without necessarily purchasing a student loan-backed security, they could create a synthetic credit default swap and… Welcome to capitalism in the age of hard-core financialization of the economy. This is the world we live in. It’s not the fault of Billy, who thought going to college would be great until he couldn’t get a job afterward.[6] It’s not the fault of Joely, who thought she could afford a house because people who were paid to know better lied to her and said that the federal funds rate wasn’t very likely to go up. If the crashes were their fault, it would be like the economy getting a cold — simple fluctuations of supply and demand. Here? We’re dealing with a vastly different beast. If you don’t want another 2008, you have to deal with the systemic issues at hand. The systemic issues aren’t that people want to borrow money — it’s that the people who want to lend them money aren’t directly suffering the consequences when those loans go bad, and therefore, have absolutely no incentive to make sure the loans are good and every incentive to just make as many loans as possible.  [1] The exact relationship of these organizations to the government is weird and complicated and I’m not getting into it here. I’m going to call them “government organizations” in this answer, but they’re not owned by the government. [2] Many of these indices in the United States are either directly or indirectly related to one of two numbers: the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the federal funds rate. These numbers are theoretically reflective of the rate at which banks will lend money to each other. The federal funds rate actually does reflect this: it’s the interest rate banks lent each other money overnight the previous day. LIBOR, however, is the rate at which banks think they could borrow money from other banks. These are both vitally important numbers, and literally trillions of dollars are tied to each. Thus, when it came out in 2012 that the banks were colluding to fix LIBOR to rates favorable to their own investments, the reaction of the global industry was shock and horror. This was quite possibly the biggest scandal to ever hit the financial industry and unfortunately, few people outside the financial industry understood it. [3] In general, the federal funds rate and the rate of inflation (the rate at which your money loses value) are inversely proportional. When the federal funds rate is low for a long period of time, it encourages lending, as it implies low interest rates across the board. This allows for economic growth, but it also means that money is more plentiful, which means that it is comparatively worth less. When the Fed started hiking the target federal funds rate, inflation was climbing above 2%, and would hit about 5% in 2005. Whether or not 5% is a harmfully high inflation rate is a matter of debate; however, it is undeniably higher than the Federal Reserve generally likes to target. [4] I’m not being sarcastic here. Quantitative analysts frequently have doctorates in statistics, astrophysics, engineering, and numerous other hard sciences. [5] For further discussion of this, check out Roger Lowenstein’s wonderful book When Genius Failed. [6] And for those of you who might say “but useless degree,” I would kindly ask you to cram it. I had multiple STEM degrees, a high GPA, multiple academic honors, and prestigious internships — and I still couldn’t find employment for a year, and had to switch fields entirely to find a job. The world is not inherently just. The short and pithy answer is to say that financial literacy education would have about as much effect on the 2008 crisis as Drug Abuse Resistance Education has had in preventing the opioid epidemic in the United States. DARE has been a program since 1983. It didn’t stop the crack epidemic, it didn’t stop the opioid epidemic, and it won’t stop any other drug epidemic, either. Demand-side education programs do not often work in preventing large-scale societal ills. But let’s go to the long answer on this one, and to do that, we need to look at what happened in the 2008 financial crisis. This is  Continue Reading",2021-03-06T14:53:12.893Z,"Would the 2008 financial crisis have happened if financial literacy was taught from primary school onward? ",Quora

Here is a graph (from the Dept. of Labor) of total private sector employment in the U.S., including all of Trump’s latest numbers through April 2019, with all axis labels removed. At what point do you think Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was passed, signaling a shift from the “terrible policies” of Barack Obama to the new era when the “greatest jobs producer God ever created” started waving his “magic wand?” Hold your finger there. Then read on.  Although many Trump critics focus on his emotional immaturity and his ethical/legal struggles, I would like to focus on the things Trump himself claims are his greatest strengths: his economic leadership and deal-making skills. I run my own business and have quite a few friends and relatives who have led companies, some big and some small. (Mine is small.) The hope of many business owners like me, and our millions of workers, was that Trump would put American businesses on an even stronger path than the “Obama trajectory.” He would turn around our trade deficit, balance the budget, boost GDP, create an infrastructure for prosperity, and be the world’s greatest job creator. [*Many say cutting regulations is also important. But only if it gives their particular business a competitive advantage. Oil companies hate regulations that impede drilling or encourage fuel-efficient cars, but love those that impede wind farm or solar development. The “all regulations are bad” mantra makes as much sense as the commissioner of Major League Baseball saying he’ll “eliminate two rules for every new one” instead of encouraging teams to just play by the rules. Sure, get rid of inefficient or unfair regulations, but smart regulations can actually boost growth if implemented correctly. More importantly, regulations are our major instrument of corporate accountability. In short, “number of regulations eliminated” cannot be an objective measure of success.] When assessing a president’s performance as a “national CEO,” the question is not so much “how strong is the economy right now?” (partisans will take credit or cast blame to make their side look good) but rather “how is the president dealing with any current crises and laying the groundwork for future prosperity?” But of course, we can only look at the data in retrospect. It’s best to look at them in context, to get beyond the partisan boasts and talking points. Here are the numbers:       [From U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics] Where does it appear that the “Trump economic miracle” occurred? Are there clear inflection points in the data that signal that Trump’s “magic wand” has cast its spell? Under Trump, did the budget deficit come down? Did the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 cause real wages to increase, hiring to speed up, or GDP to accelerate? Did he “win the trade war?” When you actually look at the numbers, it’s clear that Trump’s performance is middling or slightly sub-par at best. The cherry-picked data he and his cheerleaders put out, when put into context, plainly don’t support their claim that he is a business genius who “turned around a mess [he] inherited.” In fact, the data show precisely the opposite. It appears that Trump inherited an economy with some decent momentum, all the more astonishing after the “Great Recession” of 2007–2009. (In Obama’s second term, GDP growth averaged +2.2% per year—not spectacular, but remarkably steady and far better than what economists had predicted following the Great Recession, and well above the 1.58% average GDP growth rate of the post-Depression “golden era” of 1945–1960.) Take the employment chart at the bottom, which is the first graph put into context. If Trump were “the greatest jobs producer God ever created,” we would see an inflection point in the graph somewhere in Trump’s first two years. In fact, there is an incredibly strong inflection point on this chart, but unfortunately it coincides almost perfectly with the day that Barack Obama signed the Recovery Act in February 2009, weeks after taking office. (To be fair, much of the change in the employment trend can also be attributed to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) passed by Bush in October 2008 and supported by both candidates for President, John McCain and Barack Obama. Senator Hillary Clinton also supported it. Bernie Sanders did not. TARP was the major driver of the huge budget deficits in 2009–2012, but it obviously succeeded in stopping the trend of enormous job losses, which was a much bigger problem.) Note that these are private, non-government jobs, so there’s no room for the “bigger government” counterargument. The unemployment rate has continued to decline under Trump, but only because the “Obama line” has continued. [Update, February 12, 2020: According to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly jobs growth rate in the first 36 months of the Trump presidency is +182,000. In the last 36 months of the Obama presidency, the average monthly growth rate was +224,000. In TrumpWorld, this 19% DECREASE in the monthly job growth rate is an “unprecedented turnaround like we’ve never seen.”] [You can be forgiven for suspecting that the last graph was faked, or at least manipulated, to make Obama look good. After all, if Obama’s employment numbers were that good, with a classic inflection point at the very start of his tenure, followed by a rocket-like trajectory, why wasn’t he Tweet-bragging constantly about it? (Never mind. We all know the answer to that question.) If you doubt the numbers, check them yourself. Go to the US Department of Labor Statistics website (BLS Tools), go to the “Employment” section, click on “Data Finder,” check “All employees, thousands, total private, seasonally adjusted,” make the range 2004 to 2019, download the Excel data (.xlsx), and make your own line graph.] But what about the Dow and GDP? Business leaders and investors want to see real changes in productivity and growth. As I write this, Trump has just started his 27th month in office—24 of which were with full control of all three branches of government, a “blank check” for Republicans—which is plenty of time to let his economic policies take effect. The Dow has gained +34.2% in that time. That is great compared to the –22.1% change at Bush’s 27th month, but middling compared to Obama’s +60.1% growth at this point in his presidency. Trump bragged a great deal about the 81 all-time highs for the Dow during his first two years in office, but since the Dow grows at a fairly steady 6-8% per non-recession year, all-time highs are not unusual. For comparison, after digging the country out of the Great Recession in his first term, Obama saw 91 all-time highs in the first two years of his second term. Trump has touted the 3% GDP growth in 2018 as “unprecedented,” but this isn’t even close to true, as the graph indicates. It seems almost anemic compared to the eight Clinton years. Even George W. Bush had TWO years of greater than 3% GDP growth, and he had the worst economic performance of any president since Hoover. It’s interesting to compare Trump’s economic performance to that of Bill Clinton, since Trump spends so much time trashing the Clintons and spreading conspiracy theories about them and the many others on his “enemies list.” Take your favorite metric—GDP growth, stock market performance, budget deficits, productivity growth, profit growth, job creation, balance of trade—and compare Trump’s performance to Clinton’s over equal time intervals. It’s enlightening to do your own analysis and free yourself from the propaganda coming from the corporate media and the White House. And it’s easy. Use BLS Tools, BEA Data, or any other objective data site. (Just stay away from the White House’s communications team or any politically biased media source, like CNN or Fox.) Based on the data alone, which one would you say is a truly great “business leader?” It’s a much different story outside of Trump’s Twitter bubble. [If you don’t have the time, you can look at Bloomberg’s thorough 14-point analysis of the economic data of all U.S. Presidents going back to Jimmy Carter. (It started this “presidential index” before Trump took office, so they’re not cherry-picking data for or against Trump.) As of late January, Trump ranked 6th out of 7 Presidents in terms of economic performance, ahead only of George W. Bush. Even Carter is ahead of Trump. Clinton is first, followed by Barack Obama, followed by Ronald Reagan.] According to one World Bank economist, the Trump Administration is following almost precisely the policies of the George W. Bush administration—tax cuts, increased spending, and deregulation, that led to the same conditions that produced the Great Recession. The numbers and trends are eerily similar. Perhaps we shouldn’t be so surprised, given that Trump’s personal and corporate return on investment (ROI) has been far weaker than—in fact, less than than 1/3 as strong as— a passive investment in the S&P 500. In other words, Trump has not provided investors with any legitimate reason to invest in him rather than the cheapest generic stock fund. Recently his net worth has certainly increased, however, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which by several analyses has netted the Trump family anywhere from $22.5 million to $1.1 billion, mostly through massive cuts to the Inheritance Tax. This is an enormous benefit only for the children of billionaires. Trump’s Productive ROI is probably so low because, unlike self-made billionaires, he never had to impress potential investors. When all your money is inherited (apparently, Trump started receiving his $480 million inheritance when he was only 3 years old), you don’t need a stellar business model. Of course, being an heir doesn’t automatically disqualify someone from being a great business leader. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Thomas Watson, Jr. also inherited large companies and enormous wealth from their fathers, but they also provided strong leadership for their companies and became great philanthropists. However, it doesn’t appear that Trump is on the same path, particularly since his family foundation was recently shut down due to campaign finance violations and self-dealing. Many of the habits that Trump acquired as a private CEO are troublesome when projected on a national scale. It’s alarming that Trump is working so hard to hide his taxes and make his finances above the law (and even more alarming that the Senate and courts may let him get away with it). Strong companies don’t hide their numbers unless they are cooking the books. It’s an even worse sign that not a single American bank has been willing to lend money to Trump for over a decade, and that the only bank that has funded Trump (Deutsche Bank) is a known epicenter for international money laundering. (A disreputable bank might lend money to someone who doesn’t repay his loans because he gives them something more valuable. One theory is that, in this case, it is access to Russian oligarchs who need to offshore tens of billions in stolen cash.) It’s also a problem to have such a confirmed reputation for stiffing your own workers and subcontractors, and not just because bullying is such a bad leadership stance: it’s a clear sign that your cash flow is poor, which means that you don’t have a profitable business model. But maybe Trump is just not a numbers guy. Great CEOs can have different styles. Sometimes, vision and inspiration are better keys to long-term success than just a laser focus on profits and growth. If you can attract and inspire entrepreneurs now, perhaps you can ensure prosperity down the road. Unfortunately, Trump seems to have a great deal of difficulty getting America’s top CEOs to accept his leadership on his own Business Advisory Council. Apparently, he does not like to share the spotlight. As a result, he doesn’t appear to attract and keep the best people or to provide strong guidance for business leaders. His advisors seem to be chosen because he saw them on TV, rather than because they have any substantial expertise. Their predictions have so far been just more Trumpian exaggeration, and not the reliable estimates of the economic future that business leaders need to make decisions on capital investment and hiring. Perhaps most importantly, his vision for the nation is historically bleak. “Keep the foreigners out,” “my haters are losers,” “everybody’s after me,” “bring back coal,” and “no collusion” aren’t very inspiring rallying cries for American workers and entrepreneurs. Trump is not leading on the economic issues that voters care about most, such as long-term financial stability (rather than more reckless debt); a 21st century data and transportation infrastructure, an affordable first-class healthcare system, prosperity in the face of climate change, ensuring worker security in the face of accelerating automation, and expanding free trade (rather than destroying alliances and building walls). One of Trump’s biggest campaign promises was to “totally fix” the “disastrous trade imbalance” that was “costing us trillions,” and that his predecessors couldn’t handle because they were too “weak and stupid.” (Most economists and CEOs disagree that trade deficits are a bad thing, but let’s go with Trump on this one.) In January 2018, Trump started his tariff war (which exactly 0 out of 60 economists surveyed by Reuters agreed would “benefit the U.S. economy”) that he promised would be “so quick and easy to win.” It wasn’t. Actually, it’s much worse than that. It pushed our 2018 trade deficit to at an all-time high. (Before Trump took office, the all-time worst monthly trade deficit was $76 billion in July 2008, at the depths of the Great Recession. Under Trump’s “tariff war,” that record has now been broken FIVE TIMES.) In July 2018, Trump had to pay farmers $12 billion dollars out of the U.S. Treasury to make up for lost revenue. It’s an impressive failure by all measures, which probably explains why he’s not tweeting about it much anymore. Trump also promised to be a “great dealmaker,” as his TV persona suggested. Trump is actually correct (in my opinion) that Chinese currency manipulation, protectionism, and intellectual piracy are real problems for the world markets, and America should be spearheading the fight against them. But a dealmaker needs a plan, a backbone, a steady hand, and the skills to maximize leverage. A smart deal maker would have kept us in the TPP (instead of dumping it because—umm, globalism?) so that the U.S. would have a much stronger leveraging position against China. Instead, Trump gave control of the Asian markets to China and started a weak, stupid, and needlessly expensive tariff war. It’s like quitting the game, then trying to “win” by throwing rocks at the players. Trump’s personal weaknesses in these areas are apparent to anyone who observes how he reacts to even ordinary challenges. Those who work closely with him have noted that he has an extraordinarily fragile ego and pathetically short temper and attention span. He doesn’t do his homework and therefore is ill-prepared in negotiations to apply appropriate leverage or respond nimbly to setbacks. He is far too susceptible to flattery, so it’s easy for our adversaries to take advantage of him. Since he seems to take pride in reneging not only on contracts he signs with his business partners, but also on treaties signed by his predecessors, it’s unsurprising that our adversaries and friends alike regard Trump’s “deals” with contempt, and regard America as a less trustworthy partner. Trump oversells and underperforms. He tends to spin his deals and policies as “huge victories for America,” but at closer inspection (for instance Korea, China, Iran, the ,Paris Accords, and the TPP) they seem to be poorly developed plans that do little or nothing to make America great. It appears Trump was lying when he said he had a beautiful plan to replace Obamacare, and the “Infrastructure Week” Trump has promised repeatedly over his first two years in office (including this week again), has turned into a cruel Internet joke-meme. Top business leaders understand the value of promotion and even “showmanship,” but only when it’s accompanied by a grand strategy and hard work to build the product. So far, Trump doesn’t seem to have any great economic product and no grand strategy. Many of us were willing to give him a chance, but at this point we shouldn’t be surprised that the Trump White House is following the dismal trajectories of Trump Airlines, Trump University, Trump Steaks, Trump Mortgage, and the Trump Taj Majal. All glitter, no substance, and way too much fraud. We can only hope that he doesn’t bankrupt America like he bankrupted those companies. The ultimate measure of any President who considers himself a “leader of the national brand” is the Anholt-GfK Roper Nation Brands Index. Ever since Trump took office, the U.S. has fallen below all of our chief competitors for the first time since George W. Bush left office. This means less influence, less investment, less credibility, and less power.  If a CEO of a Fortune 500 company had this kind of record after 3 years, he would almost certainly be fired by the board. Trump’s inability to keep the US at the top of the Nation Brands Index hurts every company in America that depends on imports, exports, overseas sales, or foreign investment, which is almost all of them. Business leaders would also love for Trump to get the crushing national debt under control, because it puts severe limits on our ability to grow in the future and to deal effectively with any downturns or recessions. (Debt control, at least in theory, is the reason that so many business people are Republican in the first place.) Unfortunately, Trump is heading fast in the opposite direction. He’s racking up record debt, but building very little prosperity-creating infrastructure. In fact, the deficit problem is even worse for Trump than the graph above indicates. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the 2019 deficit will exceed $900 billion, and will exceed $1 trillion for every year beyond 2022. It’s one thing to run budget deficits during a recession to counter the collapse in global demand (as in World War II, when U.S. deficit spending helped extract us from the Great Depression), but in times of relative prosperity, it is reckless and puts future prosperity at risk. The deficit-to-GDP ratio—perhaps the most important statistic to economic conservatives—is projected to be 4.6% in 2009, the first time in history that it has been this high when we are not in the throes of a recession or its immediate aftermath. Any honest conservative would be alarmed if this were happening under the Democrats, and they should be at least as alarmed that it’s happening under Trump. Trump seems to be more interested in strong-arming the Fed to goose his short-term numbers than he is in planning for long-term prosperity. In order to safeguard economic stability, the Fed must stay free from political meddling. Trump’s nominations of Herman Cain and the Stephen Moore to the Fed show that either he prefers political cheerleaders to qualified economic leaders, or that the qualified candidates don’t want to work with his administration. This is the kind of destabilizing behavior that creates bubbles and crashes. Even though a majority of the CEOs I know are Republicans, many admit (reluctantly) that Obama did a much better job of promoting the American brand, strengthening trade relations with other nations, maintaining the stability of governance that businesses need to grow, building infrastructure, and, despite some policy disagreements (primarily about particular trade deals and domestic spending), leading us out of a deep recession with a steady hand, all while Trump was sniping at him from Trump Tower. By all relevant accounts, it doesn’t seem that Trump knows as much as he claims about tax policy, trade policy, budgeting, brand-building, or—most surprisingly—deal-making. Now that he’s in office, we can see how he operates, and we’re not impressed. Thankfully, most American corporations are not run “the Trump way.” From Christopher Black's answer to Speaking completely objectively, is Trump a good president based on only what he has done in the office? Here is a graph (from the Dept. of Labor) of total private sector employment in the U.S., including all of Trump’s latest numbers through April 2019, with all axis labels removed. At what point do you think Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was passed, signaling a shift from the “terrible policies” of Barack Obama to the new era when the “greatest jobs producer God ever created” started waving his “magic wand?” Hold your finger there.

They were academic friends, each with a reputation that preceded them: astronomer Edmond Halley, polymath Robert Hooke, and renowned architect Sir Christopher Wren (pictured above, from left to right). Engaging in lively conversation on recent scientific developments, their focus soon shifted towards a topic that had long been a source of mystery and intrigue in the scientific community: the motions of celestial objects. At the time, it was known that the planets traveled in elliptical orbits around the Sun. In fact, this had been established less than a century before by the astronomer Johannes Kepler, through the first of three laws concerning planetary motion. But Kepler’s laws were based on analysis of actual data, without an overarching mathematical theory to support the results. In essence, it was known that the planets traveled in elliptical orbits, but why? This was what intrigued the three men. And so, it was on that day that a fateful wager was made: Wren offered a prize of forty shillings to the man who could provide an elegant solution to the problem. Hooke, who is said to have been a rather quarrelsome figure, was quick to claim that he already had the solution. But he chose to withhold it, promising to reveal it only when the others had admitted defeat. It’s unlikely that he truly had a solution, as he would not produce one down the line. But what can be said is that the wager made on this day, though seminal, would prove quite catastrophic for one man: Edmond Halley.  Halley obsessed over the problem in the following months. Though uncertain of the solution, he was sure that the key to it was something called the “inverse square law.” Since Kepler’s time, it had been thought that there was some sort of attractive force that kept the planets orbiting about the Sun. Specifically, it was believed that this force was inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; Kepler had said just as much in his second and third planetary laws. To Halley, the question was less about why the planets traveled in elliptical orbits, but rather what would be the shape of a planet’s orbit if the inverse square law held. But he was uncertain how to proceed from there. So, in the summer of that year, he traveled to Cambridge to call on the help of the university’s Lucasian Professor of Mathematics: the one and only Isaac Newton.  To Halley’s surprise and glee, Newton had indeed already solved the problem: the shape of the orbit would in fact be an ellipse! But when Halley asked if he could show his calculations, Newton couldn’t produce the paper. Yet, at Halley’s behest, he promised to redo the work and show it to him.  Indeed, Newton not only kept his promise, but he went far beyond it. He had long been thinking about the principles of motion ever since his days studying at university, and Halley’s request prompted him to consolidate all the work he had done in the past twenty years. And, after eighteen grueling months, the groundbreaking text was finished. It was called the Philosophia Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which translates to the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Nowadays, it is simply known as the Principia. This text contained all of Newton’s work on kinematics, from the three laws of motion to the universal law of gravitation. Halley’s search for an underlying mathematical explanation for planetary motion had not been in vain; however, it was not without cost on his part. For one, Newton had chosen to publish his work in three volumes, but after a dispute erupted between him and Hooke, he withheld publishing the third, which was a critical piece in understanding the first two. Only with much diplomacy and flattery on Halley’s part did the final volume come to light. Publishing the book itself also became difficult. Halley had initially secured the promise of the Royal Society to do it, but they eventually reneged. The year before they had sponsored the publication of The History of Fishes, which proved to be an immense flop.  After this fiasco, the society members were not open to the idea of risking their finances on a mathematical treatise. Thus, Halley made the generous effort to pay for its publication out of his own salary, while Newton habitually contributed nothing. To make matters even worse, Halley received news soon after that the Society, under whom he was employed, could no longer afford to pay his annual wage of fifty pounds. Instead, he would be paid in copies of The History of Fishes.  In retrospect, Wren’s wager proved quite damaging for Halley. For the price of forty shillings, he had staked his career, reputation, and salary to ensure Newton’s work would come to light. But the implications were undoubtedly glorious. The Principia didn’t simply explain the motion of planetary bodies; it also explained everything from the movement of ocean tides to the trajectory of a ball thrown into the air. Its beginning pages are rightfully considered the start of modern science, for Newton masterfully crafted a solid understanding of how our universe operated in terms of motion. It was a catastrophic bet certainly for Edmond Halley, but undoubtedly a seminal one for the scientific revolution! Credit for the story: Bryson, B. (2004). A Short History of Nearly Everything.

Short-term creditors cash out or refuse to roll over their loans, denying credit to financially weakened firms. Long-term creditors demand to be “made whole” and sue. Without cash, the firm fails. Financial firms in the United States pay about 34% of their profits in taxes, and, while they can deduct interest payments to creditors from taxable income, equity is not taxed as favorably. Most countries have similar tax preferences for debt over equity, thereby encouraging financial and other corporations to use more debt, as financial analysts have long known. And yet the argument that this tax preference for debt played a role in the financial crisis – and that it remains an ongoing risk to financial stability – was quickly rejected. After all, the tax preference for debt has existed for a long time, and nothing heightened it before the crisis hit. On the contrary, if anything, the tax preference has decreased somewhat over time. And the crisis was quite clearly tied to the explosion in risky mortgage-backed securities in the US; when the market abruptly realized that these securities could not be paid off in full, many systemically important financial firms were seen to be much weaker than they had seemed.

So despite the trailers suggesting that everything is going right for the film until its release, its fate at the box office shows how every penny spent can be flushed down the drains on a Friday! The story of these films, touted as some of the costliest in the business, will prove how they became the biggest duds in Bollywood. 1. Shaandaar  I'm sure there were many like me, who genuinely felt bad for this film made at a budget of 75 crores. Once called one of the most awaited movies of 2015, it just took a day for its fall despite a fresh pairing, luxurious sets and superhit songs. Alas! Nothing could save Shaandaar which had no script. 2. Bombay Velvet  Another big flop of 2015, Bombay Velvet has become a scar in the career of director Anurag Kashyap. Cinefans rejected the film so enthusiastically that the 125-crore film had a loss of 100 crores. Many call it the biggest flop in the history of Bollywood. Even actors Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma would prefer to disown this disaster. 3. Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja  It is said that producer Boney Kapoor put all his money in his most ambitious project. At a time when films were made in lakhs, this one had a whopping 9-crore budget. We're assuming even its original director, Shekhar Kapoor, realised how shoddy the film was, before leaving it halfway. Trade analysts held poor dialogues, weak music and a silly story-line responsible for the debacle. We still feel sorry for actors Anil Kapoor, Sridevi and Jackie Shroff. 4. Kites  superstar son, a brilliant director, a Mexican hottie and a melodic album, but none could save the film. Kites could've been a dream crossover project for Hrithik Roshan onto international cinema. Rakesh Roshan even had a Brett Ratner cut of the film for American audiences. But unfortunately, he also had a cliched script. 150 crores wasted! 5. Asoka  Shah Rukh Khan's dream project refused to go down well both with critics and fans alike. The 3-hour long period film failed at a time when 13 crores was a massive investment. 6. Love Story 2050  With VFX teams from Australia and New Zealand, the film was much hyped in terms of special effects. But producer Harry Baweja's plans of giving his son Harman Baweja his dream launch failed miserably due to a ""senseless"" script. While Harman ended up with the tag of a Hrithik-lookalike, the corny film also lead to his breakup with his rumoured girlfriend and his female lead Priyanka Chopra. Ouch! 7. Raavan  Mani Ratnam was supposed to make a comeback with this mega project starring Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. With a sloppy script, the 100-crore film lost more than 50% at the box office. 8. Mangal Pandey  We know how much time Aamir Khan took to prepare for this film to completely look his part. It was also one of the most eagerly awaited movies. But the basic idea of a prostitute romancing one of India's favourite freedom fighters didn't go down well with many. All we remember in this 35-crore film is Aamir's long hair and his big moustache. 9. Saawariya  Under Sanjay Leela Bhansali's banner, it could've been the perfect launchpad for Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor. But the story wasn't well received in the Indian market. Completely shot on 'blue-coloured' sets, the 40-crore film, after a point, left the audience gasping for some sunlight and fresh air. 10. Raju Chacha  It was made at a budget of 30 crores at a time when lavish films required 15 crores tops. Even its Christmas release couldn't do it any good. It's unfortunate resemblance to the 1965 classic The Sound of Music, a long and poor screenplay, and insipid lead performances crashed the film, much to the loss of producer-actor Ajay Devgan. 11. Blue  At 129 crores, this film became Bollywood's most expensive in 2009. It had some brilliant underwater shots, expensive action choreography, a long schedule in Bahamas but no grace! The hefty paychecks of Akshay Kumar and Sanjay Dutt took the film's budget overboard and its flimsy story about an under-sea bounty left many disappointed. Special appearance by Kylie Minogue (who was paid 6.6 crores) added to the producers' pockets. 12. Drona  It is always a risk to invest 87 crores on Abhishek Bachchan, right? But good friend and producer Goldie Behl took the risk, only to realise what he lost when the film bombed heavily at the box office. A superhero flick, so to speak, was too full of imaginary rubbish. 13. Ajooba  A film with a budget of 8 crores in 1991 was solid money! So much so, that Shashi Kapoor had to close down his film production company after this film. His friendship with Amitabh Bachchan fell back real hard it seems. This highly hyped superhero film failed to make any impact on the audience. 14. Besharam  Sometimes we just wonder why brilliant actors like Ranbir Kapoor end up doing such poor films. His super stardom did draw the audience to the theaters but, ultimately, the content has to do the talking and it was declared an absolute letdown. The 85-crore film only managed to cover 35 crores. 15. RGV Ki Aag  Let's save the best for the last. So if I call it the biggest box office disaster till date, I hope most of you will agree. Many also listed it among the worst Bollywood movies ever made. The basic crux of remaking a classic Sholay raised many eyebrows. Ram Gopal Verma messed the older version making Amitabh play Babban Singh on the lines of Gabbar. Poor casting, bad storytelling and horrible reception made this big budget film a catastrophe!",2021-03-06T14:56:41.887Z,"Which are the Bollywood Movies barely earn money? ",Quora

It virtually controls almost 3/4’s of the planets surface, keeps the water ways free for commerce and is a MASSIVE deterrence to any aggression over water. In fact no country has EVER staged a naval invasion since the end of world war 2 unless they were allied to the United States. You’ll never see a military analyst talking about any other country making a forcible approach over the oceans (even relatively short distances) without the tacit approval of the USA. We can’t even begin to measure how much impact the idea of a super carrier appearing off your coastline has influenced the world over the last 70+ years but it’s massive. One example I can point out is that China has regarded Tibet and Taiwan as rogue provinces for decades. Tibet has been brought inline by military force because China can drive tanks to Tibet and intervening would require full scale warfare risking or costing hundreds of thousands if not millions of men. On the other hand Taiwan continues to hold China at bay just because of 90 miles of water. You can be 99.9% sure that if China and Taiwan shared a land border Taiwan would have been brought into the fold decades ago but crossing even 90 miles of water with your troops on transports is VERY dangerous if you don’t completely dominate the seas and skies. Taiwan would have no answer for a massive land army from China but both Taiwan and the USA have answers for ships full of troops and tanks exposed on the sea. Thus no direct military action against Taiwan despite all the saber rattling and missile tests nearby. Yes the jets fly off a carrier, it’s expensive but necessary to keeping readiness high. Pilots need to continuously log hours and the rest of the crew also needs to train so they are prepared for any eventuality that might arise. The military is mostly downtime and training, even in times of war typically more than half of our military is not deployed to the war. For the Navy there’s a constant rotation between being at the front, training to be at the front and being in port for upgrades/maintenance and repairs. The lead times on these evolutions is so long that if we stopped being ready we would not be able to bring our Navy back online in a timeline that was meaningful to most confrontations. Keeping 3–4 carriers and the battle groups that go with them constantly on rotation is a massive endeavor but it yields massive returns both financially and diplomatically since no other nation in history has been able to project so much force so far from home so rapidly. The English Navy of the 17–1800’s was similar but still an order of magnitude less imposing or capable. The entire world economy is partly powered by free shipping lanes and it’s the US Navy (and to a lesser extent allied Navies) that maintains the ability for commercial ships to freely transit international waters in relative safety. There are still lots of places int he world were pirates operate and if the US Navy (or some similar force) did not exist they would multiply massively because the rewards of piracy in the 21st century are in the 10’s of millions of dollars per ship.

March 28, 2012 The Honorable Charles Bolden, Jr. NASA Administrator NASA Headquarters Washington, D.C. 20546-0001 Dear Charlie, We, the undersigned, respectfully request that NASA and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) refrain from including unproven remarks in public releases and websites. We believe the claims by NASA and GISS, that man-made carbon dioxide is having a catastrophic impact on global climate change are not substantiated, especially when considering thousands of years of empirical data. With hundreds of well-known climate scientists and tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief in the catastrophic forecasts, coming particularly from the GISS leadership, it is clear that the science is NOT settled. The unbridled advocacy of CO2 being the major cause of climate change is unbecoming of NASA’s history of making an objective assessment of all available scientific data prior to making decisions or public statements. As former NASA employees, we feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate. We request that NASA refrain from including unproven and unsupported remarks in its future releases and websites on this subject. At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees, and even the reputation of science itself. For additional information regarding the science behind our concern, we recommend that you contact Harrison Schmitt or Walter Cunningham, or others they can recommend to you. Thank you for considering this request. Sincerely, CC: Mr. John Grunsfeld, Associate Administrator for Science CC: Ass Mr. Chris Scolese, Director, Goddard Space Flight Center Ref: Letter to NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, dated 3-26-12, regarding a request for NASA to refrain from making unsubstantiated claims that human produced CO2 is having a catastrophic impact on climate change.",2021-03-06T14:57:19.052Z,"What are the names of the most acclaimed and respected scientists who deny climate change?

Between 1993 and 2006, more than 20% of Pakistan's annual government expenditure was spent on the military, according to estimates from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Missiles and nuclear weapons Both nations have ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. India has nine types of operational missiles, including the Agni-3 with a range of 3,000km to 5,000km, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington. Pakistan's missile program, built with Chinese assistance, includes mobile short- and medium-range weapons that can reach any part of India, CSIS said. The Shaheen 2 has the longest range, up to 2,000km. Pakistan has 140 to 150 nuclear warheads, compared with India's 130-140 warheads, according to SIPRI. India’s war capabilities will further be heightened by the induction of Agni -V .It is an intercontinental ballistic missile system -- Agni-V -- which will bring targets across China within its range, and is expected to significantly bolster the country's military prowess.The missile system, with a strike range of 5,000 km and capable of carrying nuclear warhead, are being inducted into the elite Strategic Forces Command (SFC). Very few countries including the US, China, Russia, France and North Korea have intercontinental ballistic missiles.In its armoury, India currently has Agni-1 with 700 km range, Agni-2 with a 2,000-km range, Agni-3 and Agni-4 with 2,500 km to more than 3,500-km range.  India also has The BrahMos (designated PJ-10) which is a medium-range ramjet supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarine, ships, aircraft, or land. It is the fastest supersonic cruise missile in the world.Pakistani super-sonic missiles like Babur 1,2 and 3 are no way near it. The missile travels at speeds of Mach 2.8 to 3.0 which is being upgraded to Mach 5.0. While Pakistani Babur have a speed of 0.8 Mach. Army India has a 1.2 million-strong army, supported by more than 3,565 battle tanks, 3,100 infantry fighting vehicles, 336 armoured personnel carriers and 9,719 pieces of artillery, according to IISS. Pakistan's army is smaller, with 560,000 troops backed by 2,496 tanks, 1,605 armoured personnel carriers, and 4,472 artillery guns, including 375 self-propelled howitzers. Air Force With 127,200 personnel and 814 combat aircraft, India's air force is substantially larger but there are concerns about its fighter jet fleet. India's defence plans require 42 squadrons of jets, about 750 aircraft, to defend against a two-pronged attack from China and Pakistan. With older Russian jets like the MiG-21, first used in the 1960s, retiring soon, India could have 22 squadrons by 2032, officials say. Pakistan has 425 combat aircraft, including the Chinese-origin F-7PG and American F-16 Fighting Falcon jets. Navy India's navy consists of one aircraft carrier, 16 submarines, 14 destroyers, 13 frigates, 106 patrol and coastal combatant vessels, and 75 combat-capable aircraft. It has 67,700 personnel, including marines and naval aviation staff. Pakistan, which has a significantly smaller coastline, has 9 frigates, 8 submarines, 17 patrol and coastal vessels, and 8 combat-capable aircraft.  As evident from the above comparison Pakistani Armed Forces hold no ground against Indian Army forces on any of the element be it land,air or sea.Pakistani Army is only capable of undertaking small misadventures that to undercover from terrorist organisations like Jaish-e-Mohammad. We’ve defeated Pakistan every time be it The First Kashmir War(1947),Indo-Pak war of 1965,Indo-Pak war of 1971 and The Kargil War.India as a country is strong on its own and does needs to back on state sponsored terrorism like Pakistan, which by far has been it’s only weapon.

Unless there are catastrophic economic or warlike events that occur in the next 50 years, I see a gradual balancing of military power between the now dominant U.S and an increasing technology based industrialized China.  [If timing is everything, the Office of the Secretary of Defense is pushing to implement former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel’s “third offset strategy,” intended to “sustain and advance America’s military dominance for the 21st century.” Along these lines, Secretary Hagel announced the Defense Innovation Initiative. Our current secretary of defense, Ashton Carter, as well as Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work are now pushing the Pentagon’s bureaucracies to bring Hagel’s vision to reality.  The following are excerpts of an essay by Peter Dombroski dtd 15 Sept 2015 Modern China, unlike most post-Cold War American adversaries, is becoming much more technologically advanced and someday relatively soon may even approach or exceed American capabilities in select modern military systems — missiles, space-based, and undersea systems, for example. The trend line for China’s own military technological progress is positive, despite significant but well-known weakness and failures. Where China cannot  match American capabilities in the short to intermediate term, it has invested heavily in asymmetric technologies and doctrines intended to counter existing American capabilities. Many analysts believe that China has developed sophisticated anti-access/area denial strategies (A2/AD) intended to prevent the U.S. Navy and other forces from operating close to China’s territorial waters Using a wide variety of approaches, from threat of long-range precision strike to mine warfare systems, China hopes to limit American freedom of action in the littorals and perhaps beyond the second island chain. If Chinese efforts are successful, American joint and combined military forces may not reach their full combat potential or incur great losses for trying. The most basic assumption underlying the offset strategy is that the economic, industrial, and technological strengths of the United States can and should be harnessed to overcome the advantages of potential adversaries and the inherent difficulties associated with projecting military power to the far reaches of the globe.  Some advocate that the United States adopt competitive strategies, which self-consciously impose costs on adversaries and potential adversaries by re-setting the pace with innovative military technologies. Yet the United States might not be able to sustain a high-technology strategy and, in the long run, China may be better positioned in a long-term race. Despite recent setbacks to its economy, China is still able and willing to invest major resources into  military modernization. Numerous accounts document how the Chinese defense industry has increased its capacities, at least in part, by using cyber espionage to steal American and Western technologies and reverse engineering weapons and systems. Many Americans, on the other hand, remains uncertain about the economic future, tired of the post-9/11 increase in national security spending, and, by some accounts, supportive of domestic infrastructure investment to ensure long-term prosperity. In short, pursuing a strategy that depends on out-innovating and outspending rivals, presents political risks for American leaders. Another challenge for the third offset strategy is that American allies and coalition partners will find it difficult to keep pace with American military innovations. As Defense analysts have observed about the most recent period of American military transformation, ""European states have simply been unable to match the level of US investment in new military technologies and so for some time critics have warned of a growing (transformation gap) between the United States and the European allies."" A similar dynamic may develop in the Asia-Pacific. Relatively few regional partners are likely to match the United States as it adopts innovative but expensive technologies. Clearly some states, like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore may choose to match American military investment in innovative technologies, while others with less robust economies or very different strategic cultures and circumstances (i.e., India) may choose not to or will try but fail. Japan’s defense spending remains limited by its constitution; India is still buying capabilities reminiscent of the Cold War (aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines), and the smaller states across the Asian littoral have been reluctant to invest in  militarily capabilities that  support but do not duplicate those of  the United States. Unless the U.S. military and intelligence communities can somehow overturn the laws of physics, economics, and geography simultaneously, America remains at a disadvantage relative to China in terms of the fundamentals of military conflict in Asia. The United States is attempting to project power against a continental-sized power half a world away. It therefore must expend vast resources to bring its military power to bear across the Pacific Ocean and rely heavily on allies for everything from bases to diplomatic support.] So in essence, everything is not coming up daisies for either the U.S. or China in the out years with neither side, proving to be vastly superior militarily to the other.

Bulhan* [a] Frantz Fanon University, Hargeisa, Somaliland. Colonialism is often misunderstood or narrowly defined. Some mistakenly confine it to either a geographic area or an era. Others convinced that colonialism is outmoded and passé, view it a system no longer operative in Africa and generally in the world. Still others narrow it to a system by and serving only inhabitants and descendants of Europe, ignoring that colonialism would not succeed or sustain in the past and present without local collaborators, minions, and conveyor belts essential for all forms of oppression to take root and persist. No wonder then that discussion on colonialism turned stale in Africa during the last several decades after most African countries attained independence. Euphoria swept through the African continent before and soon after African territories hoisted flags, sang national anthems, and celebrate the rise of African leaders to power. Africans believe then the Europeans had left for good, that therefore Africans could move forward unhindered to enjoy freedom and prosperity they thought in immediate grasp. The euphoria and rising expectation soon gave way to disappointment and despair because colonialism left behind enduring legacies – not only political and economic, but also cultural, intellectual, and social legacies – that keep alive European domination. …… Classical Colonialism Classical colonialism in Africa started in the nineteenth century. Like the colonization of the Americans and the Atlantic Slave Trade, it was systemic violence – organized, continuous, methodic and willful. It was not only integral capitalism, but also coexistent with racism, cultural domination and European self-aggrandizement. Whereas slavery focused on exploited isolated and captive individuals, the submission and exploitation of entire populations required sophisticated methods and numerous agents; the first point of colonial assault was occupation of land by force of arms. Land contained not only the world of things, but also the world of people. Taking control of land provided colonizers the raw materials they needed and geopolitical advantage in the competition among them for colonies. After occupation of land, control of the population followed to acquire not only cheap or free labor and market for manufactured goods, but also gradual erosion in the world of meaning. Thus, instead of exploiting defenseless individuals in alien lands as in slavery, classical colonialism held population captive in their own land, forcing them to serve the same economic, racial and self-aggrandizing motives that gave rise to and sustained the Atlantic Slave Trade. Lasting occupation of land, exploitation of human and material resources, and quelling resistance required the erosion of social bonding, indigenous beliefs, values, identities and indigenous knowledge. Colonialists achieved this by using different agents including missionaries, anthropologists, physicians, and journalists. Since violence and outsiders’ propaganda alone cannot sustain oppression, colonizers resorted to local agents to carry out the colonial mission. The most important of these were individuals educated in colonial schools or serving as subordinated in the colonial system. The so-called local elites inherited the colonial state whose function was not to serve the colonized but to exploit them. Classical colonialism ostensibly ended when these local collaborators demonstrated, through training and internalization of colonial values, their proclivity to serve as auxiliaries of neocolonialism. ….. Metacolonialism Metacolonialism revives an old system of colonial exploitation and oppression that masquerades in the more savory euphemism of globalization. Many analysts write about globalization in glowing terms, often extolling is as a system of worldwide innovation that shall bring great advances to humanity. Yes, these writings seldom answer this question: Who actually benefits from this new craze, and who suffers of its global effects? We find the answer not directly from the words of its promoters and defenders, but in the structures of power and global locations where its decision-makers concentrate. Specifically, Metacolonialism emanates from the same geography and societies as did the Atlantic Slave Trade, classical colonialism and neocolonialism.  France's dignified daylight robbery of 14 former African colonies explained - Face2Face Africa To this day, 14 Francophone African countries in West and Central Africa, excluding Guinea, which rejected everything French and currently has its own currency, use the CFA. They are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo and Cameroon, under West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon under Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l’Afrique Centrale (CEMAC). This homogenous monetary system has four main pillars: a standard exchange rate with the Euro; a guarantee of unlimited convertibility of CFA francs into euros; a centralisation of foreign exchange reserves; and a principle of free capital transfer within the franc zone. Additionally, the CFA countries need to maintain a billion dollar balance in France in the centralised exchange reserve. Currently, the obligatory reserve held is USD 20 billion (17 billion euros) for each country. Additionally, the countries pay a small percentage of interest to France for managing the reserve. Fifty per cent of these reserves has been held by the French Ministry of Finance.  OPINION: Africa's natural resources - From curse to a blessing There are also more indirect means by which we pull wealth out of Africa. Today's report estimates that $29bn a year is being stolen from Africa in illegal logging, fishing and trade in wildlife. Africa: A continent of wealth, a continent of poverty So, why is it that a continent with such vast potential wealth can remain so poor? It's in large part down to 'Illicit financial flows'. The illegal movements of money or capital from one country to another. The exploitation of mineral resources has all too often led to corruption, and a large proportion of the continent's resources and revenues benefitting local and foreign elites rather than the general population. Gold Dinar: the Real Reason Behind Gaddafi's Murder - Millenium State blog The gold dinar: a groundbreaking initiative In 2009, Colonel Gaddafi, then President of the African Union, suggested to the States of the African continent to switch to a new currency, independent of the American dollar: the gold dinar. The objective of this new currency was to divert oil revenues towards state-controlled funds rather than American banks. In other words, to stop using the dollar for oil transactions. Countries such as Nigeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Angola were ready to change their currencies. Unfortunately in March 2011, the NATO-led coalition began a military intervention in Libya in the name of freedom…. Free water, almost free gasoline, free health system and free education were commonplace for Libyans under Gaddafi’s dictatorship. The leader, who has been in power for 41 years, has managed to gain the support of all the major tribes and buy social peace through radical measures and a policy of shared oil revenues. Jihadism, the number one enemy of the West, Gaddafi eliminated it with Napalm in the 1990s. Although he financed many armed groups in the Sahel, Libya itself was a stable country where the risk of being kidnapped or even murdered by an armed militia was non-existent. With an excellent management of oil revenues, the Libyan state had managed to store hundreds of tons of gold (143 tons according to WikiLeaks) and the same amount in silver. All these resources were going to make Libya the most influential country in Africa, supplanting France for example. Gaddafi wanted to avoid American influence in his oil transactions by using this gold. He launched the gold dinar project, and other major African governments were ready to support him in this project. It was both an African dream and a nightmare for the West’s financial system. Clinton, Gaddafi, and the Death of Africa's Gold Standard Idea Summary Clinton’s leaked emails confirmed the long-held “conspiracy theory” that the plan to take out Libya’s then-dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, was motivated not by human rights concerns, but by Gaddafi’s plan to introduce a gold-backed currency that would unite the entire African continent. This currency would then be used to sell oil in the global market, and the African continent would be less reliant on the American dollar, strengthening Africa’s position in the world economy to the detriment of the NATO empire. Gadhafi’s Gold-money Plan Would Have Devastated Dollar “In 2009 — in his capacity as head of the African Union — Libya's Moammar Gadhafi had proposed that the economically crippled continent adopt the ‘Gold Dinar,’” noted Ilana Mercer in an August opinion piece for WorldNetDaily. “I do not know if Col. Gadhafi continued to agitate for ditching the dollar and adopting the Gold Dinar — or if the Agitator from Chicago got wind of Gadhafi's (uncharacteristic) sanity about things monetary.” But if Arab and African nations had begun adopting a gold-backed currency, it would have had major repercussions for debt-laden Western governments that would be far more significant than the purported “democratic” uprisings sweeping the region this year. And it would have spelled big trouble for the elite who benefit from “freshly counterfeited funny-money,” Mercer pointed out. “Had Gadhafi sparked a gold-driven monetary revolution, he would have done well for his own people, and for the world at large,” she concluded. “A Gadhafi-driven gold revolution would have, however, imperiled the positions of central bankers and their political and media power-brokers  The Looting Machine: Warlords, Oligarchs, Corporations, Smugglers, and the Theft of Africa's Wealth: Burgis, Tom: 9781610397117: Amazon.com: Books  In his first book, The Looting Machine, Tom Burgis exposes the truth about the African development miracle: for the resource states, it's a mirage. The oil, copper, diamonds, gold and coltan deposits attract a global network of traders, bankers, corporate extractors and investors who combine with venal political cabals to loot the states' value. And the vagaries of resource-dependent economies could pitch Africa's new middle class back into destitution just as quickly as they climbed out of it. The ground beneath their feet is as precarious as a Congolese mine shaft; their prosperity could spill away like crude from a busted pipeline. This catastrophic social disintegration is not merely a continuation of Africa's past as a colonial victim. The looting now is accelerating as never before. As global demand for Africa's resources rises, a handful of Africans are becoming legitimately rich but the vast majority, like the continent as a whole, is being fleeced. Outsiders tend to think of Africa as a great drain of philanthropy. But look more closely at the resource industry and the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world looks rather different. In 2010, fuel and mineral exports from Africa were worth 333 billion, more than seven times the value of the aid that went in the opposite direction. But who received the money? For every Frenchwoman who dies in childbirth, 100 die in Niger alone, the former French colony whose uranium fuels France's nuclear reactors. In petro-states like Angola three-quarters of government revenue comes from oil. The government is not funded by the people, and as result it is not beholden to them. A score of African countries whose economies depend on resources are rentier states; their people are largely serfs. The resource curse is not merely some unfortunate economic phenomenon, the product of an intangible force. What is happening in Africa's resource states is systematic looting.

The hedge fund could buy bonds (another type of debt); does this need to be regulated? The hedge fund could buy stocks; does this need to be regulated? The short answer is yes, to an extent; and, they are regulated to an extent. All brokers have to be licensed; while not all hedge funds managers must register, many (depending on the amount of assets they manage) have to register as investment advisers. They may, also, have to file reports (i.e. w/ the SEC). — So, what the hedge fund is buying is not so much an issue; you specifically pointed out “buying loans.” Well, which types? Residential, commercial? What’s the difference between these assets and, say, buying real estate directly? — The source of their more lax regulation standards is the notion that, in general, you have to have a certain level of net worth in order to be eligible to buy into hedge funds. For instance, that level may be $1 million or $2 million. This level of net worth qualifies constituent investors, per regulatory definition, as sophisticated investors. The regulations in place are meant to protect low-net-worth individuals, who will be more impacted by the type of deception and catastrophic loss (e.g., the unique risks of investing in) [potentially] unregulated hedge funds. The logic just sort of goes that a “sophisticated” investor should know not to put “all his eggs in one basket;” that standard didn’t really work out well for a bunch of Bernie Madoff’s victims. And, if you make that statement, it’s fair to say, also, that it did work for many of Madoff’s victims. If an individual investor is putting $1 million into a particular hedge fund, then likely this investor has other investments (i.e. a diversified portfolio of liquid and illiquid assets). Were this individual investor to lose the $1 million, invested in this particular hedge fund, he would be “sophisticated” enough to know to (and to have) more money, somewhere else held in cash or near-cash form, for this eventuality. Hedge funds may also attract some of the truly most sophisticated fund managers on the planet, such as those who administer the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). These people are not just technically sophisticated, per some governmental rule; they are technically sophisticated in the academic and experiential sense. Going back to Madoff — Madoff self-cleared. An individual investor might have to ask someone even what that means?!? A manager of an endowment — for instance, of a large university (especially, a public university) — would see self-clears; and, run for the hills (hopefully!). That is what I mean by technical sophistication (viz. academic and experiential) versus sophistication per investing guidelines (e.g., you must have $X million to invest in hedge funds). There is regulation of hedge funds; certain classes of investors are barred from investing in hedge funds; I said it that way first, but it’s really the reverse: hedge fund managers are barred from accepting investments from unqualified (“unsophisticated”) potential investors. — So far I’ve examined the issue a bit on the technical side; let’s look at at least one potential motivation for this lack of regulation by those investors who are qualified to invest in hedge funds. CalPERS, for instance, has enough money in management to, perhaps in some cases, move markets. The endowment for Harvard University may desire privacy. So, for CalPERS, privacy supports other regulations, such as prohibitions against trading on insider information (in the USA) [i.e. “front running”]. Harvard University’s endowment is not public information, as to quantity of funds and distribution of assets. It wishes for privacy as to, again, perhaps, how much money it has. If it invests in a hedge fund that doesn’t have to report regularly to a governmental oversight agency, then its less likely that the more easily apprehended information, such as what percentage of the endowment is invested where, will, to an intuitive analyst, reveal more global projections (i.e. what the total value is of the Harvard University’s endowment). — I hate to say it, but those concerns are not usually important on the mind of unsophisticated investors. For instance, will John Doe Blue Collar care if anyone knows he owns 100 shares of Microsoft stock? Compare that to → will the endowment for Harvard University care if it becomes known that it owns 25% of a hedge fund heavily invested in startup companies? Doing something like that, as long as it’s not barred by the bylaws of the endowment itself, is not necessarily wrong, or bad; it just might have bad optics (read: bad press associated with the public realization of it). — The most direct answer to your question is that a loan is not, in and of itself, a special class of asset that requires special regulation. Buying and selling loans is a common financial practice. The more interesting issue is why hedge funds can be unregulated; why hedge fund managers may not have to register as investment advisers. What a hedge fund invests in — well, that’s it’s own business; and, in my (financial/expert) opinion, when “loans” are the questionable asset of the investment strategy, this does not expose investors to risks that require any extra governmental oversight; the hedge fund could invest in municipal bonds, just as easily. The risk level can easily be same for these; there is nothing especially risky about buying good loans.",2021-03-06T15:00:10.441Z,"Why are hedge funds able to buy bank loans and be unregulated?

Among many industries, finance offers some of the best paying jobs, below are the top few such profiles. Who hasn’t heard of investment banking? Considered as the poster boy of finance, investment banking is a highly lucrative and well-paying job not just within the finance industry but across almost all kinds of jobs possible. But keep in mind, this is a highly demanding and rigorous profile and that’s why it is so rewarding. Other than investment banking, there are various other roles offered by banks such as commercial banking, retail banking, wholesale banking, and merchant banking. Apart from these core banking roles, there are a plethora of other roles that one can assume in the banking industry. For example, there is research, sales, trading, risk management, and other support functions. Pay-wise, one can expect higher pay packages in private banks but better benefits in the public sector. Now let’s look at the profiles in accounting. Public accounting firms offer a variety of roles right from valuations, transaction advisory, due diligence, consulting, and assurance. Not only are these profiles deemed prestigious, but they also pay well. Also, there are several financial institutions and non-banking institutions which offer a wide variety of finance-related roles such as portfolio management, private equity, asset management, research, and much more. Many such institutes have been known to offer competitive salaries in the market. Lastly, there are numerous corporates that house several important finance functions like treasury, FP&A, business intelligence, corporate development, investor relations to name a few. Pay-wise they are also very decent and sought after. It is a known fact that middle offices and back offices of many global MNCs are housed in India and offer one of the best in industry pay packages for finance profiles. Some of the companies to keep an eye for good opportunities are J P Morgan (one of the largest IB), Goldman Sachs (one of the oldest IB), Morgan Stanley, Nomura, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and the list goes on and on. Consulting is another industry where is highly demanding, highly-skilled, and highly rewarding. Apart from the big 4s, there are several other players in the market which offer great learning in terms of profile and good salaries as well.",2021-03-06T15:02:29.552Z,"What are the best paying jobs with a finance degree?

604399deed76476feda2fe34,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-can-you-get-from-marine-science?-,"Well, actually, any job where you could contribute with your experience, skills and attitude. I think nowadays job type you are finally landing tends to vary much from what you have studied. What actually hires you is beyond a degree. In addition, I would say that what gets you hired, it's often related with factors beyond what is your background or personal preferences, finally being bonded to your fate… but, I will stick to your question, and I will try to give you a glimpse of what to expect regarding Marine Sciences Degree. First and foremost, to say that I cannot consider myself the best example of successful marine scientist (at least like the kind of professional one would expect a priori, namely, as a scientist whose main field of study are any natural science branches related with the marine environment and who conduct all kind of research tasks related with this latter), even neither as the other types around -you will figure out soon what I meant- but I will bring out my experiences and knowledge in the matter hoping it will help to fulfill your curiosity… at least, whilst there is no other person more expert and more authorized than me to best reply the question. I will introduce you my personal experience first and then I will list the most usual jobs and competences that professionals with a related degree (marine science) are getting in my country (Spain) gathered by more official and authorized sources. This information is given by one of the professional association of marine science graduates in my home land (Galicia NW Spain, Atlantic coast, which has around 30% of total coast extension in Spain -the greatest of peninsular regions- and which local economy depends in large extend with the sea). They collected and resumed data from hired professionals and former students surveys. My personal experience: I got a Marine Scientist degree (long term study with master equivalence -MSc-) specialized in environmental issues and marine pollution. Just after my graduation I manage to get a full time job as field technician in a middle/small sized firm nearby my hometown (quarter million urban pop. ruling over a million pop. region) which was engaged in engineering and environmental services. My duties was to conduct sampling campaigns and environmental auditories. Later as I gather more experience, I began to take on more bureau works and tasks as technical reporting and expertise reporting, which made me a project engineer. As such, I gain more responsibilities and so I carried on projects where I had to design and implement solutions to environmental problems as environmental consultant, like environmental monitoring and environmental risks assessment topics. Adding to that, aside, I also was involved in various tasks of data analysis and spatial analysis for several projects out & within my responsibilities. Next, this is what Oceanographers Association of Galicia lists as marine sciences professionals duties and most usual jobs: What can do a Marine Scientist? Preparation of expert reports, reports and projects.Works management and team coordinationExecution of (environmental) improvement plans.Implementation and development of technology transfer programs.Realization of oceanographic campaigns.Assistance and advice in the marine environment.Teaching, divulgation and environmental awareness broadcasting.Management and application of geographic information systems (GIS).Marine Scientist degree’s main branches of specialization: BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY Inspection and fishing extension work.Advice on exploitation technologies, evaluation and management.Performing expert reports and technical assistance to fisherman's associations.Design, planning and management of farms and aquaculture plants.Management and realization of microbiological, pathological and animal health analysis.Supervision and direction of fish markets.Application of molecular and genetic biology techniques to cultivation and repopulation.PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY Oceanographic application of remote sensing.Meteorology and Climatology.Evolution of spills.Energy uses.Application of techniques, data analysis and theory of marine physical phenomena.Management and design of gauges, meteorological buoys and oceanographic buoys.GEOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY Exploitation of marine geological resources.Elaboration of bathymetry, cartography and geophysical surveys.Modelling of geological processes in the oceans.Regeneration of beaches.CHEMICAL OCEANOGRAPHY Management and conduct of laboratory analysis.Desalination plant management.Exploitation of marine chemical resources for pharmacology, cosmetics, energy sector, chemical industry ...MARINE MANAGEMENT Development and planning of studies applied to civil engineering as a preliminary step to actions in the marine environment.Risk assessment and prevention in the maritime sector.Preparation and execution of coastal management plans.Management of leisure and tourism activities, environmental interpretation centers, parks and protected natural areas and recovery centers for threatened marine species.Consulting and environmental advice.Management of natural catastrophes.Planning, direction and management of ports.Management of water purification stations.Management of aquariums and museums related to the marine environment.Where does a marine scientist work? Advising and Consulting companies.Civil Engineering Companies.Fisherman's guilds.Cannery companies.Aquaculture plants.Research centers.Other public and private entities.I’m aware this is a sight of the situation in a particular place, but not far from reality, as I have several colleagues which had been developing their professional careers in all around Europe (outside Spain itself), I am fairly sure it could be extrapolated to a more wide vision of what you can expect of this professional choice. As a final note, I also met personally colleagues who are developing tasks as data analysts for big bank companies in center Europe, and others as customs officers for fisheries department, even, there are someone who is marketing strategist for food brands… So my advise to your future career choice is:  choose wisely, choose freely: oceans are not the limit.

Today the notion of all-out nuclear war is rarely discussed. There are concerns about Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes and fears that terrorists might get hold of a nuclear bomb. But the fear of a war in which the aim is to wipe out the entire population of an enemy has startlingly diminished. In 1962, the concept of mutually assured destruction started to play a major part in the defense policy of the US. President Kennedy's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, set out in a speech to the American Bar Foundation a theory of flexible nuclear response. In essence it meant stockpiling a huge nuclear arsenal. In the event of a Soviet attack the US would have enough nuclear firepower to survive a first wave of nuclear strikes and strike back. The response would be so massive that the enemy would suffer ""assured destruction"". Thus the true philosophy of nuclear deterrence was established. If the other side knew that initiating a nuclear strike would also inevitably lead to their own destruction, they would be irrational to press the button. December 1991 the Soviet Union formally breaks up, two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall In the past, wars had been fought by defeating your opponent on the battlefield by superior use of force. But MAD was a radical departure that trumped the conventional view of war. The age of MAD heralded a new fear, with citizens knowing that they could be annihilated within a matter of minutes at the touch of a button several thousands of miles away. ""The central thing was the public had no control,"" says Dr Christopher Laucht, a lecturer in British history at Leeds University. ""You were at the mercy of political decision makers. Apart from the fear that one side would do something stupid, there was also the fear of technology and the question of 'what if an accident happened'."" Eight months after McNamara's speech the notion of MAD was almost put to the test by the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the end both superpowers gave ground and the problem was averted but mankind had never come so close to doomsday. Following a period of Cold War detente in the 1970s, tension rose again in the 1980s. By this point the Soviet Union had many more warheads, and it was commonly said that there were enough nuclear arms on Earth to wipe the planet out several times. The fear of impending attack became a part of everyday conversation. Children speculated in the playground about the first signs of a nuclear attack - hair and fingernails falling out - and whether one could survive a nuclear winter. In 1983 there were a number of Russian false alarms. The Soviet Union's early warning system mistakenly picked up a US missile coming into USSR airspace. In the same year, Nato's military planning operation Able Archer led some Russian commanders to conclude that a Nato nuclear launch was imminent. A string of films and TV series in the 1980s - from WarGames, Threads, and When the Wind Blows - reflected these fears. Sometimes the black humor emanated from unlikely places. In 1984 President Ronald Reagan famously said in a radio soundcheck: ""My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes."" The authorities tried to offer reassurance. In the UK a famous public information campaign Protect and Survive gave people advice on how to build a nuclear shelter. It was later satirised by When the Wind Blows, which portrayed an elderly couple building their shelter and perishing in the nuclear aftermath. Two decades after the Cold War ended, there are still more than 17,000 nuclear warheads around the world, the majority still pointing back and forth between the US and Russia. But MAD as a public fear has disappeared. ""In the Cold War there was a small risk of utter nuclear catastrophe,"" says Paul Rogers, professor of peace studies at Bradford University. Today the risk is not so much Armageddon but a ""slippery slope"" of proliferation, he says. North Korea is thought to have around 10 warheads, Rogers notes, while Iran is thought to be close to a nuclear bomb. Some have speculated Saudi Arabia could follow if Iran succeeds and it's been suggested that Israel already has more than 100 warheads. The most serious stand-off today is not the US and Russia but the prospect of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan in which ""tens of millions would die"", Rogers suggests. And the danger in any of these regional disputes is that the US and Russia get sucked in and what began as a war between two neighbors goes global. ""The fear of nuclear war has diminished partly because the risk has receded significantly with the end of the Cold War,"" says Nick Bostrom, director of Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute. ""But another factor might be simple changes in risk fashion - it becoming more popular recently to worry about global warming, for example."" More immediate worries are terrorist attack, pandemic disease, and economic meltdown. Robert Harris in his recent novel The Fear Index examined the modern anxiety that fuses the threat of powerful technology with unbridled financial markets. The main character, who runs a hedge fund, remarks: ""Fear is driving the world as never before... The rise in market volatility, in our opinion, is a function of digitization, which is exaggerating human mood swings by the unprecedented dissemination of information via the internet."" These are modern fears that John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, leading the superpowers at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, would struggle to comprehend. But the end of the Cold War hasn't removed the nuclear warheads. Relations between Russia and the West have deteriorated in recent years. China, whose nuclear programme is little understood in the West, is doubling its military spending. India and Pakistan remains a potential flash-point. So why don't people fear nuclear war as they used to? For many analysts the world is now a less stable place than it was during the Cold War. And all the major geopolitical confrontations still revolve around nuclear weapons, says Dr Nick Ritchie, lecturer in international security at the University of York. ""At least several hundred American and Russian nuclear missiles remain on 'hard alert' capable of being launched within minutes. Even if that isn't necessarily the policy or intent, the systems and practices remain in place."" The ghost of MAD remains even if people would rather not think about it.

Following the dual American successes of the first manned lunar orbit on December 24–25, 1968 (Apollo 8) and the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969 (Apollo 11), and a series of catastrophic N1 failures, both Soviet programs were eventually brought to an end. The Proton / Zond program was canceled in 1970, and the N1 / L3 program was terminated de facto in 1974 and officially canceled in 1976. Details of both Soviet programs were kept secret until 1990, when the government allowed them to be published under the policy of glasnost. - Wiki Soviet manned lunar programs - Wiki (historical record) ============= THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM EDITED & COMPILED BY MARCUS LINDROOS at: http://www.ryp.umu.se/~96ml/  ABSTRACT Twenty years after the first American moon landing, on August 18, 1989 the USSR officially acknowledged the existence of their manned lunar program with an initial release of information by the Soviet newspaper Izvestija. An increasing number of photographs and blueprints of Soviet lunar hardware have become available to Western analysts and space observers. It is now clear that personal rivalries, shifting political alliances and bureaucratic inefficiencies bred failure and delays within the moon program. There was strong competition between research teams and laboratories. This internal competition and the low budget for manned exploration of the Moon explains the failure of Soviet technology against the successful American Apollo program.  This paper summarizes the Soviet manned lunar program in the light of the latest findings published in the West.

Weather events are the critical events that make things change - socially, economically, agriculturally and ecologically. It all hangs around a society’s capacity to revive afterwards - especially given that many such events happen in places where they are likely to happen again. Such events cause migration, economic downturn, weakening of ecosystems, loss of crops and, perhaps most importantly, loss of human confidence in the future. The key issue therefore is resilience - a society’s capacity to withstand shocks of all kinds and to revive afterwards. This is a global issue too because weather crises are now incrasingly happening in multiples - while some parts this summer had heat and droughts, other parts had serious floods - and the overall impact on the world economy, supply chains, migration, insurance, market confidence, resources and knowhow is increasing. It is predictable that, sometime, some combination of events could impact the world economy as a whole - for example, in the form of a major global economic crisis or mass migration. One of the political issues at stake here is that more money is going on mitigation - specifically related to global warming - than on adaptation. Also, more money is going on profitable developments - technology and infrastructure - than on education and social support for resilience, on forest replanting, on river adaptation, on agricultural adaptation and other less immediately profitable yet longterm beneficial strategies. But there’s something more than global warming happening here, and insufficient funds and research are going into other factors that affect the overall scenario. And also, of course, there are many unknowns and uncertainties, and this will continue to be the case. So humanity should invest more widely and more holistically in social and ecological adaptation, facing the facts of what is actually happening, to make communities and regions more resilient. The problem here is that climate change is not going in one simple direction - many areas need to prepare both for floods and droughts, for example. But both of these can be helped longterm by natural regeneration. We need to quite standing around arguing about the causes and mechanisms and take a more wide-spectrum, facts-based approach. And weather events such as landslides, wildfires and hurricanes can be reduced in their human and natural impact by a wide variety of means. Each locality and region needs to make a serious assessment of risks and of measures available to them to improve resilience. We need to get more serious about this. They are saying that, regardless of the arguments around climate change, weather events and extremes are growing in scale and impact. Weather events are the critical events that make things change - socially, economically, agriculturally and ecologically. It all hangs around a society’s capacity to revive afterwards - especially given that many such events happen in places where they are likely to happen again. Such events cause migration, economic downturn, weakening of ecosystems, loss of crops and, perhaps most importantly, loss of human confidence in the future. The key issue therefore is  Continue Reading",2021-03-06T15:08:32.961Z,"What do these disastrous hurricanes and wildfires say about climate change? ",Quora

The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled-dry American empire, reads like a Who's Who of Goldman Sachs graduates. IF AMERICA IS NOW CIRCLING THE DRAIN, GOLDMAN SACHS HAS FOUND A WAY TO BE THAT DRAIN. BUBBLE #1 - THE GREAT DEPRESSION  Goldman wasn't always a too-big-to-fail Wall Street behemoth, the ruthless face of kill-or-be-killed capitalism on steroids - just almost always. The bank was actually founded in 1869 by a German immigrant named Marcus Goldman, who built it up with his son-in-law Samuel Sachs. They were pioneers in the use of commercial paper, which is just a fancy way of saying they made money lending out short-term IOUs to small-time vendors in downtown Manhattan.You can probably guess the basic plotline of Goldman's first 100 years in business: plucky, immigrant-led investment bank beats the odds, pulls itself up by its bootstraps, makes shitloads of money. In that ancient history there's really only one episode that bears scrutiny now, in light of more recent events: Goldman's disastrous foray into the speculative mania of pre-crash Wall Street in the late 1920s.This great Hindenburg of financial history has a few features that might sound familiar. Back then, the main financial tool used to bilk investors was called an ""investment trust."" Similar to modern mutual funds, the trusts took the cash of investors large and small and (theoretically, at least) invested it in a smorgasbord of Wall Street securities, though the securities and amounts were often kept hidden from the public. So a regular guy could invest $10 or $100 in a trust and feel like he was a big player. Much as in the 1990s, when new vehicles like day trading and e-trading attracted reams of new suckers from the sticks who wanted to feel like big shots, investment trusts roped a new generation of regular-guy investors into the speculation game.Beginning a pattern that would repeat itself over and over again, Goldman got into the investment-trust game late, then jumped in with both feet and went hog-wild. The first effort was the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation; the bank issued a million shares at $100 apiece, bought all those shares with its own money and then sold 90 percent of them to the hungry public at $104. The trading corporation then relentlessly bought shares in itself, bidding the price up further and further. Eventually it dumped part of its holdings and sponsored a new trust, the Shenandoah Corporation, issuing millions more in shares in that fund - which in turn sponsored yet another trust called the Blue Ridge Corporation. In this way, each investment trust served as a front for an endless investment pyramid: Goldman hiding behind Goldman hiding behind Goldman. Of the 7,250,000 initial shares of Blue Ridge, 6,250,000 were actually owned by Shenandoah - which, of course, was in large part owned by Goldman Trading.The end result (ask yourself if this sounds familiar) was a daisy chain of borrowed money, one exquisitely vulnerable to a decline in performance anywhere along the line .... BUBBLE #2 - TECH STOCKS  Fast-Forward about 65 years. Goldman not only survived the crash that wiped out so many of the investors it duped, it went on to become the chief underwriter to the country's wealthiest and most powerful corporations. Thanks to Sidney Weinberg, who rose from the rank of janitor's assistant to head the firm, Goldman became the pioneer of the initial public offering, one of the principal and most lucrative means by which companies raise money. During the 1970s and 1980s, Goldman may not have been the planet-eating Death Star of political influence it is today, but it was a top-drawer firm that had a reputation for attracting the very smartest talent on the Street.It also, oddly enough, had a reputation for relatively solid ethics and a patient approach to investment that shunned the fast buck; its executives were trained to adopt the firm's mantra, ""long-term greedy."" One former Goldman banker who left the firm in the early Nineties recalls seeing his superiors give up a very profitable deal on the grounds that it was a long-term loser. ""We gave back money to 'grownup' corporate clients who had made bad deals with us,"" he says. ""Everything we did was legal and fair - but 'long-term greedy' said we didn't want to make such a profit at the clients' collective expense that we spoiled the marketplace."" ... But then, something happened. It's hard to say what it was exactly; it might have been the fact that Goldman's co-chairman in the early Nineties, Robert Rubin, followed Bill Clinton to the White House, where he directed the National Economic Council and eventually became Treasury secretary. ...Rubin was the prototypical Goldman banker. He was probably born in a $4,000 suit, he had a face that seemed permanently frozen just short of an apology for being so much smarter than you, and he exuded a Spock-like, emotion-neutral exterior; the only human feeling you could imagine him experiencing was a nightmare about being forced to fly coach. It became almost a national cliche that whatever Rubin thought was best for the economy - a phenomenon that reached its apex in 1999, when Rubin appeared on the cover of Time with his Treasury deputy, Larry Summers, and Fed chief Alan Greenspan under the headline THE COMMITTEE TO SAVE THE WORLD. And ""what Rubin thought,"" mostly, was that the American economy, and in particular the financial markets, were over-regulated and needed to be set free.  ... The basic scam in the Internet Age is pretty easy even for the financially illiterate to grasp. Companies that weren't much more than pot-fueled ideas scrawled on napkins by up-too-late bong-smokers were taken public via IPOs, hyped in the media and sold to the public for megamillions. It was as if banks like Goldman were wrapping ribbons around watermelons, tossing them out 50-story windows and opening the phones for bids. In this game you were a winner only if you took your money out before the melon hit the pavement.It sounds obvious now, but what the average investor didn't know at the time was that the banks had changed the rules of the game, making the deals look better than they actually were. They did this by setting up what was, in reality, a two-tiered investment system - one for the insiders who knew the real numbers, and another for the lay investor who was invited to chase soaring prices the banks themselves knew were irrational. While Goldman's later pattern would be to capitalize on changes in the regulatory environment, its key innovation in the Internet years was to abandon its own industry's standards of quality control.fund manager. ""The company had to be in business for a minimum of five years, and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. But Wall Street took these guidelines and threw them in the trash."" Goldman completed the snow job by pumping up the sham stocks: ""Their analysts were out there saying Just another WordPress site is worth $100 a share.""The problem was, nobody told investors that the rules had changed. ""Everyone on the inside knew,"" the manager says. ""Bob Rubin sure as hell knew what the underwriting standards were. They'd been intact since the 1930s."" ...Goldman has denied that it changed its underwriting standards during the Internet years, but its own statistics belie the claim. Just as it did with the investment trust in the 1920s, Goldman started slow and finished crazy in the Internet years. After it took a little-known company with weak financials called Yahoo! public in 1996, once the tech boom had already begun, Goldman quickly became the IPO king of the Internet era. Of the 24 companies it took public in 1997, a third were losing money at the time of the IPO. In 1999, at the height of the boom, it took 47 companies public, including stillborns like Webvan and eToys, investment offerings that were in many ways the modern equivalents of Blue Ridge and Shenandoah. The following year, it underwrote 18 companies in the first four months, 14 of which were money losers at the time. As a leading underwriter of Internet stocks during the boom, Goldman provided profits far more volatile than those of its competitors: In 1999, the average Goldman IPO leapt 281 percent above its offering price, compared to the Wall Street average of 181 percent.How did Goldman achieve such extraordinary results? One answer is that they used a practice called ""laddering,"" which is just a fancy way of saying they manipulated the share price of new offerings. Here's how it works: Say you're Goldman Sachs, and Just another WordPress site comes to you and asks you to take their company public. You agree on the usual terms: You'll price the stock, determine how many shares should be released and take the Just another WordPress sitelet's say Just another WordPress sitea six percent fee of a $500 million IPO is serious money.Goldman was repeatedly sued by shareholders for engaging in laddering in a variety of Internet IPOs, including Webvan and NetZero. The deceptive practices also caught the attention of Nichol as Maier, the syndicate manager of Cramer & Co., the hedge fund run at the time by the now-famous chattering television rear end in a top hat Jim Cramer, himself a Goldman alum. ... ""Goldman, from what I witnessed, they were the worst perpetrator,"" Maier said. ""They totally fueled the bubble. And it's specifically that kind of behavior that has caused the market crash. They built these stocks upon an illegal foundation - manipulated up - and ultimately, it really was the small person who ended up buying in."" In 2005, Goldman agreed to pay $40 million for its laddering violations - a puny penalty relative to the enormous profits it made. (Goldman, which has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases it has settled, refused to respond to questions for this story.)day rewards for the chosen few. So instead of Just another WordPress site opening at $20, the bank would approach the Just another WordPress siteeffectively robbing all of Bullshit's new shareholders by diverting cash that should have gone to the company's bottom line into the private bank account of the company's CEO. ... Such practices conspired to turn the Internet bubble into one of the greatest financial disasters in world history: Some $5 trillion of wealth was wiped out on the NASDAQ alone. But the real problem wasn't the money that was lost by shareholders, it was the money gained by investment bankers, who received hefty bonuses for tampering with the market. Instead of teaching Wall Street a lesson that bubbles always deflate, the Internet years demonstrated to bankers that in the age of freely flowing capital and publicly owned financial companies, bubbles are incredibly easy to inflate, and individual bonuses are actually bigger when the mania and the irrationality are greater. GOLDMAN SCAMMED HOUSING INVESTORS BY BETTING AGAINST ITS OWN CRAPPY MORTGAGES. Nowhere was this truer than at Goldman. Between 1999 and 2002, the firm paid out $28.5 billion in compensation and benefits - an average of roughly $350,000 a year per employee. Those numbers are important because the key legacy of the Internet boom is that the economy is now driven in large part by the pursuit of the enormous salaries and bonuses that such bubbles make possible. Goldman's mantra of ""long-term greedy"" vanished into thin air as the game became about getting your check before the melon hit the pavement.The market was no longer a rationally managed place to grow real, profitable businesses: It was a huge ocean of Someone Else's Money where bankers hauled in vast sums through whatever means necessary and tried to convert that money into bonuses and payouts as quickly as possible. If you laddered and spun 50 Internet IPOs that went bust within a year, so what? By the time the Securities and Exchange Commission got around to fining your firm $110 million, the yacht you bought with your IPO bonuses was already six years old. Besides, you were probably out of Goldman by then, running the U.S. Treasury or maybe the state of New Jersey. (One of the truly comic moments in the history of America's recent financial collapse came when Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey, who ran Goldman from 1994 to 1999 and left with $320 million in IPO-fattened stock, insisted in 2002 that ""I've never even heard the term 'laddering' before."")For a bank that paid out $7 billion a year in salaries, $110 million fines issued half a decade late were something far less than a deterrent - they were a joke. Once the Internet bubble burst, Goldman had no incentive to reassess its new, profit-driven strategy; it just searched around for another bubble to inflate. As it turns out, it had one ready, thanks in large part to Rubin. BUBBLE #3 - THE HOUSING CRAZE  Goldman's role in the sweeping disaster that was the housing bubble is not hard to trace. Here again, the basic trick was a decline in underwriting standards, although in this case the standards weren't in IPOs but in mortgages. ...None of that would have been possible without investment bankers like Goldman, who created vehicles to package those lovely mortgages and sell them en masse to unsuspecting insurance companies and pension funds. This created a mass market for toxic debt that would never have existed before; in the old days, no bank would have wanted to keep some addict ex-con's mortgage on its books, knowing how likely it was to fail. You can't write these mortgages, in other words, unless you can sell them to someone who doesn't know what they are.Goldman used two methods to hide the mess they were selling. First, they bundled hundreds of different mortgages into instruments called Collateralized Debt Obligations. Then they sold investors on the idea that, because a bunch of those mortgages would turn out to be OK, there was no reason to worry so much about the lovely ones: The CDO, as a whole, was sound. Thus, junk-rated mortgages were turned into AAA-rated investments. Second, to hedge its own bets, Goldman got companies like AIG to provide insurance - known as credit-default swaps - on the CDOs. The swaps were essentially a racetrack bet between AIG and Goldman: Goldman is betting the ex-cons will default, AIG is betting they won't.There was only one problem with the deals: All of the wheeling and dealing represented exactly the kind of dangerous speculation that federal regulators are supposed to rein in. Derivatives like CDOs and credit swaps had already caused a series of serious financial calamities: Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings both lost fortunes, and Orange County, California, was forced to default in 1994. A report that year by the Government Accountability Office recommended that such financial instruments be tightly regulated - and in 1998, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a woman named Brooksley Born, agreed. That May, she circulated a letter to business leaders and the Clinton administration suggesting that banks be required to provide greater disclosure in derivatives trades, and maintain reserves to cushion against losses. ...Clinton's reigning economic foursome - ""especially Rubin,"" according to Greenberger - called Born in for a meeting and pleaded their case. She refused to back down, however, and continued to push for more regulation of the derivatives. Then, in June 1998, Rubin went public to denounce her move, eventually recommending that Congress strip the CFTC of its regulatory authority. In 2000, on its last day in session, Congress passed the now-notorious Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which had been inserted into an 1l,000-page spending bill at the last minute, with almost no debate on the floor of the Senate. Banks were now free to trade default swaps with impunity.But the story didn't end there. AIG, a major purveyor of default swaps, approached the New York State Insurance Department in 2000 and asked whether default swaps would be regulated as insurance. At the time, the office was run by one Neil Levin, a former Goldman vice president, who decided against regulating the swaps. Now freed to underwrite as many housing-based securities and buy as much credit-default protection as it wanted, Goldman went berserk with lending lust. By the peak of the housing boom in 2006, Goldman was underwriting $76.5 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities - a third of which were subprime - much of it to institutional investors like pensions and insurance companies. And in these massive issues of real estate were vast swamps of crap.Take one $494 million issue that year, GSAMP Trust 2006-S3. Many of the mortgages belonged to second-mortgage borrowers, and the average equity they had in their homes was 0.71 percent. Moreover, 58 percent of the loans included little or no documentation - no names of the borrowers, no addresses of the homes, just zip codes. Yet both of the major ratings agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, rated 93 percent of the issue as investment grade. Moody's projected that less than 10 percent of the loans would default. In reality, 18 percent of the mortgages were in default within 18 months.Not that Goldman was personally at any risk. The bank might be taking all these hideous, completely irresponsible mortgages from beneath-gangster-status firms like Countrywide and selling them off to municipalities and pensioners - old people, for God's sake - pretending the whole time that it wasn't grade-D horseshit. But even as it was doing so, it was taking short positions in the same market, in essence betting against the same crap it was selling. Even worse, Goldman bragged about it in public. ""The mortgage sector continues to be challenged,"" David Viniar, the bank's chief financial officer, boasted in 2007. ""As a result, we took significant markdowns on our long inventory positions .... However, our risk bias in that market was to be short, and that net short position was profitable."" In other words, the mortgages it was selling were for chumps. The real money was in betting against those same mortgages.""That's how audacious these assholes are,"" says one hedge-fund manager. ""At least with other banks, you could say that they were just dumb - they believed what they were selling, and it blew them up. Goldman knew what it was doing."" I ask the manager how it could be that selling something to customers that you're actually betting against - particularly when you know more about the weaknesses of those products than the customer - doesn't amount to securities fraud.""It's exactly securities fraud,"" he says. ""It's the heart of securities fraud.""Eventually, lots of aggrieved investors agreed. In a virtual repeat of the Internet IPO craze, Goldman was hit with a wave of lawsuits after the collapse of the housing bubble, many of which accused the bank of withholding pertinent information about the quality of the mortgages it issued. .... But once again, Goldman got off virtually scot-free, staving off prosecution by agreeing to pay a paltry $60 million - about what the bank's CDO division made in a day and a half during the real estate boom.The effects of the housing bubble are well known - it led more or less directly to the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG, whose toxic portfolio of credit swaps was in significant part composed of the insurance that banks like Goldman bought against their own housing portfolios. In fact, at least $13 billion of the taxpayer money given to AIG in the bailout ultimately went to Goldman, meaning that the bank made out on the housing bubble twice: It hosed the investors who bought their horseshit CDOs by betting against its own crappy product, then it turned around and hosed the taxpayer by making him payoff those same bets.And once again, while the world was crashing down all around the bank, Goldman made sure it was doing just fine in the compensation department. In 2006, the firm's payroll jumped to $16.5 billion - an average of $622,000 per employee. As a Goldman spokesman explained, ""We work very hard here.""But the best was yet to come. While the collapse of the housing bubble sent most of the financial world fleeing for the exits, or to jail, Goldman boldly doubled down - and almost single-handedly created yet another bubble, one the world still barely knows the firm had anything to do with. BUBBLE #4 - $4 A GALLON  By the beginning of 2008, the financial world was in turmoil. Wall Street had spent the past two and a half decades producing one scandal after another, which didn't leave much to sell that wasn't tainted. The terms junk bond, IPO, subprime mortgage and other once-hot financial fare were now firmly associated in the public's mind with scams; the terms credit swaps and CDOs were about to join them. The credit markets were in crisis, and the mantra that had sustained the fantasy economy throughout the Bush years - the notion that housing prices never go down - was now a fully exploded myth, leaving the Street clamoring for a new bullshit paradigm to sling.Where to go? With the public reluctant to put money in anything that felt like a paper investment, the Street quietly moved the casino to the physical-commodities market - stuff you could touch: corn, coffee, cocoa, wheat and, above all, energy commodities, especially oil. In conjunction with a decline in the dollar, the credit crunch and the housing crash caused a ""flight to commodities."" Oil futures in particular skyrocketed, as the price of a single barrel went from around $60 in the middle of 2007 to a high of $147 in the summer of 2008.That summer, as the presidential campaign heated up, the accepted explanation for why gasoline had hit $4.11 a gallon was that there was a problem with the world oil supply. In a classic example of how Republicans and Democrats respond to crises by engaging in fierce exchanges of moronic irrelevancies, John McCain insisted that ending the moratorium on offshore drilling would be ""very helpful in the short term,"" while Barack Obama in typical liberal-arts yuppie style argued that federal investment in hybrid cars was the way out.GOLDMAN TURNED A SLEEPY OIL MARKET INTO A GIANT BETTING PARLOR - SPIKING PRICES AT THE PUMP.But it was all a lie. While the global supply of oil will eventually dry up, the short-term flow has actually been increasing. In the six months before prices spiked, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the world oil supply rose from 85.24 million barrels a day to 85.72 million. Over the same period, world oil demand dropped from 86.82 million barrels a day to 86.07 million. Not only was the short-term supply of oil rising, the demand for it was falling - which, in classic economic terms, should have brought prices at the pump down.So what caused the huge spike in oil prices? Take a wild guess. Obviously Goldman had help - there were other players in the physical-commodities market - but the root cause had almost everything to do with the behavior of a few powerful actors determined to turn the once-solid market into a speculative casino. Goldman did it by persuading pension funds and other large institutional investors to invest in oil futures - agreeing to buy oil at a certain price on a fixed date. The push transformed oil from a physical commodity, rigidly subject to supply and demand, into something to bet on, like a stock. Between 2003 and 2008, the amount of speculative money in commodities grew from $13 billion to $317 billion, an increase of 2,300 percent. By 2008, a barrel of oil was traded 27 times, on average, before it was actually delivered and consumed.As is so often the case, there had been a Depression-era law in place designed specifically to prevent this sort of thing. ... In 1936, Congress recognized that there should never be more speculators in the market than real producers and consumers. If that happened, prices would be affected by something other than supply and demand, and price manipulations would ensue. A new law empowered the Commodity Futures Trading Commission - the very same body that would later try and fail to regulate credit swaps - to place limits on speculative trades in commodities. As a result of the CFTC's oversight, peace and harmony reigned in the commodities markets for more than 50 years.All that changed in 1991 when, unbeknownst to almost everyone in the world, a Goldman-owned commodities-trading subsidiary called J. Aron wrote to the CFTC and made an unusual argument. Farmers with big stores of corn, Goldman argued, weren't the only ones who needed to hedge their risk against future price drops - Wall Street dealers who made big bets on oil prices also needed to hedge their risk, because, well, they stood to lose a lot too.This was complete and utter crap - the 1936 law, remember, was specifically designed to maintain distinctions between people who were buying and selling real tangible stuff and people who were trading in paper alone. But the CFTC, amazingly, bought Goldman's argument. It issued the bank a free pass, called the ""Bona Fide Hedging"" exemption, allowing Goldman's subsidiary to call itself a physical hedger and escape virtually all limits placed on speculators. In the years that followed, the commission would quietly issue 14 similar exemptions to other companies.Now Goldman and other banks were free to drive more investors into the commodities markets, enabling speculators to place increasingly big bets. That 1991 letter from Goldman more or less directly led to the oil bubble in 2008, when the number of speculators in the market - driven there by fear of the falling dollar and the housing crash - finally overwhelmed the real physical suppliers and consumers. By 2008, at least three quarters of the activity on the commodity exchanges was speculative, according to a congressional staffer who studied the numbers - and that's likely a conservative estimate. By the middle of last summer, despite rising supply and a drop in demand, we were paying $4 a gallon every time we pulled up to the pump.What is even more amazing is that the letter to Goldman, along with most of the other trading exemptions, was handed out more or less in secret. ""I was the head of the division of trading and markets, and Brooksley Born was the chair of the CFTC,"" says Greenberger, ""and neither of us knew this letter was out there."" In fact, the letters only came to light by accident. Last year, a staffer for the House Energy and Commerce Committee just happened to be at a briefing when officials from the CFTC made an offhand reference to the exemptions.""1 had been invited to a briefing the commission was holding on energy,"" the staffer recounts. ""And suddenly in the middle of it, they start saying, 'Yeah, we've been issuing these letters for years now.' I raised my hand and said, 'Really? You issued a letter? Can I see it?' And they were like, 'Duh, duh.' So we went back and forth, and finally they said, 'We have to clear it with Goldman Sachs.' I'm like, 'What do you mean, you have to clear it with Goldman Sachs?'"" ...  [I]n a classic example of how complete Goldman's capture of government is, the CFTC waited until it got clearance from the bank before it turned the letter over.Armed with the semi-secret government exemption, Goldman had become the chief designer of a giant commodities betting parlor. Its Goldman Sachs Commodities Index - which tracks the prices of 24 major commodities but is overwhelmingly weighted toward oil - became the place where pension funds and insurance companies and other institutional investors could make massive long-term bets on commodity prices. Which was all well and good, except for a couple of things. One was that index speculators are mostly ""long only"" bettors, who seldom if ever take short positions - meaning they only bet on prices to rise. While this kind of behavior is good for a stock market, it's terrible for commodities, because it continually forces prices upward. ""If index speculators took short positions as well as long ones, you'd see them pushing prices both up and down,"" says Michael Masters, a hedge-fund manager who has helped expose the role of investment banks in the manipulation of oil prices. ""But they only push prices in one direction: up.""Complicating matters even further was the fact that Goldman itself was cheerleading with all its might for an increase in oil prices. In the beginning of 2008, Arjun Murti, a Goldman analyst, hailed as an ""oracle of oil"" by The New York Times, predicted a ""super spike"" in oil prices, forecasting a rise to $200 a barrel. At the time Goldman was heavily invested in oil through its commodities-trading subsidiary, J. Aron; it also owned a stake in a major oil refinery in Kansas, where it warehoused the crude it bought and sold. Even though the supply of oil was keeping pace with demand, Murti continually warned of disruptions to the world oil supply, going so far as to broadcast the fact that he owned two hybrid cars. High prices, the bank insisted, were somehow the fault of the piggish American consumer; in 2005, Goldman analysts insisted that we wouldn't know when oil prices would fall until we knew ""when American consumers will stop buying gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and instead seek fuel-efficient alternatives.""But it wasn't the consumption of real oil that was driving up prices - it was the trade in paper oil. By the summer of2008, in fact, commodities speculators had bought and stockpiled enough oil futures to fill 1.1 billion barrels of crude, which meant that speculators owned more future oil on paper than there was real, physical oil stored in all of the country's commercial storage tanks and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve combined. It was a repeat of both the Internet craze and the housing bubble, when Wall Street jacked up present-day profits by selling suckers shares of a fictional fantasy future of endlessly rising prices.In what was by now a painfully familiar pattern, the oil-commodities melon hit the pavement hard in the summer of 2008, causing a massive loss of wealth; crude prices plunged from $147 to $33. Once again the big losers were ordinary people. The pensioners whose funds invested in this crap got massacred: CalPERS, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, had $1.1 billion in commodities when the crash came. And the damage didn't just come from oil. Soaring food prices driven by the commodities bubble led to catastrophes across the planet, forcing an estimated 100 million people into hunger and sparking food riots throughout the Third World. ...  BUBBLE #5 - RIGGING THE BAILOUT  After the oil bubble collapsed last fall, there was no new bubble to keep things humming - this time, the money seems to be really gone, like worldwide-depression gone. So the financial safari has moved elsewhere, and the big game in the hunt has become the only remaining pool of dumb, unguarded capital left to feed upon: taxpayer money. Here, in the biggest bailout in history, is where Goldman Sachs really started to flex its muscle.It began in September of last year, when then-Treasury secretary Paulson made a momentous series of decisions. Although he had already engineered a rescue of Bear Stearns a few months before and helped bail out quasi-private lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Paulson elected to let Lehman Brothers - one of Goldman's last real competitors - collapse without intervention. (""Goldman's superhero status was left intact,"" says market analyst Eric Salzman, ""and an investment-banking competitor, Lehman, goes away."") The very next day, Paulson greenlighted a massive, $85 billion bailout of AIG, which promptly turned around and repaid $13 billion it owed to Goldman. Thanks to the rescue effort, the bank ended up getting paid in full for its bad bets: By contrast, retired auto workers awaiting the Chrysler bailout will be lucky to receive 50 cents for every dollar they are owed.Immediately after the AIG bailout, Paulson announced his federal bailout for the financial industry, a $700 billion plan called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and put a heretofore unknown 35-year-old Goldman banker named Neel Kashkari in charge of administering the funds. In order to qualify for bailout monies, Goldman announced that it would convert from an investment bank to a bankholding company, a move that allows it access not only to $10 billion in TARP funds, but to a whole galaxy of less conspicuous, publicly backed funding - most notably, lending from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. By the end of March, the Fed will have lent or guaranteed at least $8.7 trillion under a series of new bailout programs - and thanks to an obscure law allowing the Fed to block most congressional audits, both the amounts and the recipients of the monies remain almost entirely secret.Converting to a bank-holding company has other benefits as well: Goldman's primary supervisor is now the New York Fed, whose chairman at the time of its announcement was Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. Friedman was technically in violation of Federal Reserve policy by remaining on the board of Goldman even as he was supposedly regulating the bank; in order to rectify the problem, he applied for, and got, a conflict-of-interest waiver from the government. Friedman was also supposed to divest himself of his Goldman stock after Goldman became a bank-holding company, but thanks to the waiver, he was allowed to go out and buy 52,000 additional shares in his old bank, leaving him $3 million richer. Friedman stepped down in May, but the man now in charge of supervising Goldman - New York Fed president William Dudley - is yet another former Goldmanite.The collective message of all this - the AIG bailout, the swift approval for its bank-holding conversion, the TARP funds - is that when it comes to Goldman Sachs, there isn't a free market at all. The government might let other players on the market die, but it simply will not allow Goldman to fail under any circumstances. Its edge in the market has suddenly become an open declaration of supreme privilege. ""In the past it was an implicit advantage,"" says Simon Johnson, an economics professor at MIT and former official at the International Monetary Fund, who compares the bailout to the crony capitalism he has seen in Third World countries. ""Now it's more of an explicit advantage."" ... And here's the real punch line. After playing an intimate role in four historic bubble catastrophes, after helping $5 trillion in wealth disappear from the NASDAQ, after pawning off thousands of toxic mortgages on pensioners and cities, after helping to drive the price of gas up to $4 a gallon and to push 100 million people around the world into hunger, after securing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars through a series of bailouts overseen by its former CEO, what did Goldman Sachs give back to the people of the United States in 2008?Fourteen million dollars.That is what the firm paid in taxes in 2008, an effective tax rate of exactly one, read it, one percent. The bank paid out $10 billion in compensation and benefits that same year and made a profit of more than $2 billion - yet it paid the Treasury less than a third of what it forked over to CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who made $42.9 million last year.How is this possible? According to Goldman's annual report, the low taxes are due in large part to changes in the bank's ""geographic earnings mix."" In other words, the bank moved its money around so that most of its earnings took place in foreign countries with low tax rates. Thanks to our completely hosed corporate tax system, companies like Goldman can ship their revenues offshore and defer taxes on those revenues indefinitely, even while they claim deductions upfront on that same untaxed income. This is why any corporation with an at least occasionally sober accountant can usually find a way to zero out its taxes. A GAO report, in fact, found that between 1998 and 2005, roughly two-thirds of all corporations operating in the U.S. paid no taxes at all.This should be a pitchfork-level outrage - but somehow, when Goldman released its post-bailout tax profile, hardly anyone said a word. One of the few to remark on the obscenity was Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee. ""With the right hand out begging for bailout money,"" he said, ""the left is hiding it offshore."" BUBBLE #6 - GLOBAL WARMING  Fast-Forward to today. It's early June in Washington, D.C. Barack Obama, a popular young politician whose leading private campaign donor was an investment bank called Goldman Sachs - its employees paid some $981,000 to his campaign - sits in the White House. Having seamlessly navigated the political minefield of the bailout era, Goldman is once again back to its old business, scouting out loopholes in a new government-created market with the aid of a new set of alumni occupying key government jobs.AS ENVISIONED BY GOLDMAN, THE FIGHT TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING WILL BECOME A ""CARBON MARKET"" WORTH $1 TRILLION A YEAR.Gone are Hank Paulson and Neel Kashkari; in their place are Treasury chief of staff Mark Patterson and CFTC chief Gary Gensler, both former Goldmanites. (Gensler was the firm's co-head of finance) And instead of credit derivatives or oil futures or mortgage-backed CDOs, the new game in town, the next bubble, is in carbon credits - a booming trillion-dollar market that barely even exists yet, but will if the Democratic Party that it gave $4,452,585 to in the last election manages to push into existence a groundbreaking new commodities bubble, disguised as an ""environmental plan,"" called cap-and-trade.The new carbon-credit market is a virtual repeat of the commodities-market casino that's been kind to Goldman, except it has one delicious new wrinkle: If the plan goes forward as expected, the rise in prices will be government-mandated. Goldman won't even have to rig the game. It will be rigged in advance.Here's how it works: If the bill passes; there will be limits for coal plants, utilities, natural-gas distributors and numerous other industries on the amount of carbon emissions (a.k.a. greenhouse gases) they can produce per year. If the companies go over their allotment, they will be able to buy ""allocations"" or credits from other companies that have managed to produce fewer emissions. President Obama conservatively estimates that about $646 billions worth of carbon credits will be auctioned in the first seven years; one of his top economic aides speculates that the real number might be twice or even three times that amount.The feature of this plan that has special appeal to speculators is that the ""cap"" on carbon will be continually lowered by the government, which means that carbon credits will become more and more scarce with each passing year. Which means that this is a brand-new commodities market where the main commodity to be traded is guaranteed to rise in price over time. The volume of this new market will be upwards of a trillion dollars annually; for comparison's sake, the annual combined revenues of an electricity suppliers in the U.S. total $320 billion.Goldman wants this bill. The plan is (1) to get in on the ground floor of paradigm-shifting legislation, (2) make sure that they're the profit-making slice of that paradigm and (3) make sure the slice is a big slice. Goldman started pushing hard for cap-and-trade long ago, but things really ramped up last year when the firm spent $3.5 million to lobby climate issues. (One of their lobbyists at the time was none other than Patterson, now Treasury chief of staff.) Back in 2005, when Hank Paulson was chief of Goldman, he personally helped author the bank's environmental policy, a document that contains some surprising elements for a firm that in all other areas has been consistently opposed to any sort of government regulation. Paulson's report argued that ""voluntary action alone cannot solve the climate-change problem."" A few years later, the bank's carbon chief, Ken Newcombe, insisted that cap-and-trade alone won't be enough to fix the climate problem and called for further public investments in research and development. Which is convenient, considering that 'Goldman made early investments in wind power (it bought a subsidiary called Horizon Wind Energy), renewable diesel (it is an investor in a firm called Changing World Technologies) and solar power (it partnered with BP Solar), exactly the kind of deals that will prosper if the government forces energy producers to use cleaner energy. As Paulson said at the time, ""We're not making those investments to lose money.""The bank owns a 10 percent stake in the Chicago Climate Exchange, where the carbon credits will be traded. Moreover, Goldman owns a minority stake in Blue Source LLC, a Utah-based firm that sells carbon credits of the type that will be in great demand if the bill passes. Nobel Prize winner Al Gore, who is intimately involved with the planning of cap-and-trade, started up a company called Generation Investment Management with three former bigwigs from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, David Blood, Mark Ferguson and Peter Harris. Their business? Investing in carbon offsets. There's also a $500 million Green Growth Fund set up by a Goldmanite to invest in green-tech ... the list goes on and on. Goldman is ahead of the headlines again, just waiting for someone to make it rain in the right spot. Will this market be bigger than the energy-futures market?""Oh, it'll dwarf it,"" says a former staffer on the House energy committee. ....""If it's going to be a tax, I would prefer that Washington set the tax and collect it,"" says Michael Masters, the hedge fund director who spoke out against oil-futures speculation. ""But we're saying that Wall Street can set the tax, and Wall Street can collect the tax. That's the last thing in the world I want. It's just asinine.""Cap-and-trade is going to happen. Or, if it doesn't, something like it will. The moral is the same as for all the other bubbles that Goldman helped create, from 1929 to 2009. In almost every case, the very same bank that behaved recklessly for years, weighing down the system with toxic loans and predatory debt, and accomplishing nothing but massive bonuses for a few bosses, has been rewarded with mountains of virtually free money and government guarantees - while the actual victims in this mess, ordinary taxpayers, are the ones paying for it.It's not always easy to accept the reality of what we now routinely allow these people to get away with; there's a kind of collective denial that kicks in when a country goes through what America has gone through lately, when a people lose as much prestige and status as we have in the past few years. You can't really register the fact that you're no longer a citizen of a thriving first-world democracy, that you're no longer above getting robbed in broad daylight, because like an amputee, you can still sort of feel things that are no longer there.But this is it. This is the world we live in now. And in this world, some of us have to play by the rules, while others get a note from the principal excusing them from homework till the end of time, plus 10 billion free dollars in a paper bag to buy lunch. It's a gangster state, running on gangster economics, and even prices can't be trusted anymore; there are hidden taxes in every buck you pay. And maybe we can't stop it, but we should at least know where it's all going. The bubbles don't come 'til the end of the program...  Turn off the bubbles... Turn off the bubble machine!

The first clue was again avoiding responsibility by appointing Pence to handle the once in century global pandemic crisis. Trump’s worst enemy is his own mouth which clearly illustrates how delusional and uninformed he is. Trump is best as reality TV star and good at nothing else. The Arc of Trump's coronavirus comments defies reality on ground “WASHINGTON (AP) — In the course of a few weeks, President Donald Trump veered from confidently assuring Americans his administration had the coronavirus outbreak “very well under control” to declaring a national emergency and tweeting all-caps caution about the pandemic that has upended every facet of American life. Trump meandered from denial to grudging acceptance, and he seeded conflicting, inaccurate and eyebrow-raising commentary on a country desperate for unvarnished, even shock-to-the-system, guidance. Throughout the global coronavirus crisis, Trump’s statements have been colored by baseless optimism. Sometimes, his commentary has been flatly wrong. Frequently, it’s been amplified by aides and allies with the help of conservative media. As he confronts the most serious national crisis of his presidency, the lack of precision has cut into Trump’s credibility at a moment when he needs it more than ever, analysts say. “It started out with really what can only be described as full-blown denial,” said Brian Ott, a communication studies professor at Texas Tech University who has done extensive research on the president’s social media rhetoric. “Then as the crisis spread and as it became a pandemic ... it just wasn’t viable rhetoric anymore because it wasn’t at all where the American public was at.” Early on, the president downplayed the coronavirus as something similar to the seasonal flu — nothing that Americans should be overly concerned about and something that would quickly pass. His optimistic public comments often didn’t match the reality on the ground or even how U.S. public health agencies were approaching the looming crisis behind the scenes. In one of his first substantive public remarks on the virus, during a visit in late January to an auto parts manufacturer in Michigan, Trump acknowledged that the U.S. had seen a smattering of infections but predicted a “very good ending for it.” At that moment, there were only a handful of known cases in the United States, but the virus had already infected thousands in China, and the World Health Organization had declared the virus a “public health emergency of international concern.” “We think we have it very well under control,” Trump told the assembled workers. “We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for it. .... That I can assure you.” The next day the Trump administration said it would suspend entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the past 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of U.S. citizens or permanent residents. By then, more than 200 people had died, and nearly 9,800 had been infected worldwide. Weeks later — on Feb. 25 — his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, sought to ease volatile markets by assuring investors that the administration had the virus “contained” and “it was pretty close to airtight.” Kudlow added that coronavirus may be a “human tragedy” but predicted it wouldn’t be an “economic tragedy.” At one point, when the stock market was plunging, he even mentioned the prospect of “buying the dip.” The optimism was jarring. As Kudlow was attempting to reassure markets, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned of an incoming “disruption to everyday life.” The spread of the coronavirus in the U.S., agency officials warned, was “not so much of a question of if” but rather “a question of when.” Even as Democratic criticism of his approach mounted, the president — backed by aides and allies — turned to lashing out that his enemies were trying to use the catastrophe to score political points. By late February, after confirmed infections in the U.S. had accelerated, Trump accused political opponents and the media of pushing a “new hoax.” “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right?” Trump lamented during a campaign rally in South Carolina days after the CDC warning. “Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it.” Trump, throughout the crisis, has also seemed out of tune with aides and public health experts offering him guidance. At a White House news briefing Sunday evening, Trump claimed that his administration had “tremendous control” in containing the virus, even as the infection rate is surging in the U.S. Minutes later — and after Trump had left the news conference — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease specialist, told reporters, “The worst is yet ahead for us.” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said that Trump’s efforts to downplay the health crisis was particularly galling because public health officials had already warned that the virus was going to be explosive. “The trustworthiness of a president in a time of national crisis is his most important asset,” Jamieson said. “And when he says things that are proven to be untrue, or problematic from a public health standpoint, that erodes his credibility and the capacity of the country to prepare adequately.” Days later, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham echoed the president’s frustration on Fox News. “I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using this as a tool to politicize things and to scare people,” Grisham said on “Fox & Friends.” But it’s not only Democrats who have been frustrated by the president’s messaging throughout the crisis. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Trump should “step back” and let a public health official do the talking. “I think that the messaging at the federal level has been inconsistent, and when you are dealing with a novel virus like this, it’s very important that health professionals be out front and that there be a consistent message,” Collins said. The White House effort to blame Democrats and the media for putting too bright of a spotlight on the health crisis was further amplified by some commentators on Fox News and its related operations. Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren sought to minimize the crisis by raising the California homelessness epidemic. “Call me crazy, but I am far more concerned with stepping on a used heroin needle than I am getting the coronavirus, but maybe that’s just me,” she said. Fox Business host Trish Regan said the president’s opponents were trying to “create mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off” to undercut his reelection effort. Conservative talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh suggested that the president is the target of “virus terrorism.” Not all Fox News personalities bought into the conspiracy peddling. Last week, Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum expressed exasperation when Seema Verma, Trump’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, repeatedly ignored her question about whether American hospitals had enough ventilators and intensive care units to deal with patients who may be stricken. Fox News host Tucker Carlson, without uttering the president’s name, questioned the wisdom of baseless optimism, and he offered Trump some advice. “In a crisis, it’s more important than ever to be calm,” Carlson said. “But staying calm is not the same as remaining complacent. It does not mean assuring people that everything will be fine. We don’t know that. Instead, it’s better to tell the truth. That is always the surest sign of strength.” By Saturday, the president had abruptly changed course, tweeting “SOCIAL DISTANCING!” to his more than 70 million Twitter followers.

What is pleasure? How should I treat other people? How should I cope with unfortunate events? How can I get rid off unnecessary worry? How should I handle liberty? The answers to all these questions are condensed in a little book, The Ten Golden Rules I co-authored with Michael Soupios: 1. Examine life, engage life with vengeance; always search for new pleasures and new destines to reach with your mind. This rule isn’t new. It echoes the verses of ancient Greek philosophers and most notably those of Plato through the voice of his hero, Socrates. Living life is about examining life through reason, nature’s greatest gift to humanity. The importance of reason in sensing and examining life is evident in all phases of life-- from the infant who strains to explore its new surroundings to the grandparent who actively reads and assesses the headlines of the daily paper. Reason lets human beings participate in life, to be human is to think, appraise, and explore the world, discovering new sources of material and spiritual pleasure. 2. Worry only about the things that are in your control, the things that can be influenced and changed by your actions, not about the things that are beyond your capacity to direct or alter. This rule summarizes several important features of ancient Stoic wisdom — features that remain powerfully suggestive for modern times. Most notably the belief in an ultimately rational order operating in the universe reflecting a benign providence that ensures proper outcomes in life. Thinkers such as Epictetus did not simply prescribe “faith” as an abstract philosophical principle; they offered a concrete strategy based on intellectual and spiritual discipline. The key to resisting the hardship and discord that intrude upon every human life, is to cultivate a certain attitude toward adversity based on the critical distinction between those things we are able to control versus those which are beyond our capacity to manage. The misguided investor may not be able to recover his fortune but he can resist the tendency to engage in self-torment. The victims of a natural disaster, a major illness or an accident may not be able to recover and live their lives the way they used to, but they too can save themselves the self-torment. In other words, while we cannot control all of the outcomes we seek in life, we certainly can control our responses to these outcomes and herein lies our potential for a life that is both happy and fulfilled. 3. Treasure Friendship, the reciprocal attachment that fills the need for affiliation. Friendship cannot be acquired in the market place, but must be nurtured and treasured in relations imbued with trust and amity. According to Greek philosophy, one of the defining characteristics of humanity that distinguishes it from other forms of existence is a deeply engrained social instinct, the need for association and affiliation with others, a need for friendship. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle viewed the formation of society as a reflection of the profound need for human affiliation rather than simply a contractual arrangement between otherwise detached individuals. Gods and animals do not have this kind of need but for humans it is an indispensable aspect of the life worth living because one cannot speak of a completed human identity, or of true happiness, without the associative bonds called “friendship.” No amount of wealth, status, or power can adequately compensate for a life devoid of genuine friends. 4. Experience True Pleasure. Avoid shallow and transient pleasures. Keep your life simple. Seek calming pleasures that contribute to peace of mind. True pleasure is disciplined and restrained. In its many shapes and forms, pleasure is what every human being is after. It is the chief good of life. Yet not all pleasures are alike. Some pleasures are kinetic—shallow, and transient, fading way as soon as the act that creates the pleasure ends. Often they are succeeded by a feeling of emptiness and psychological pain and suffering. Other pleasures are catastematic—deep, and prolonged, and continue even after the act that creates them ends; and it is these pleasures that secure the well-lived life. That’s the message of the Epicurean philosophers that have been maligned and misunderstood for centuries, particularly in the modern era where their theories of the good life have been confused with doctrines advocating gross hedonism. 5. Master Yourself. Resist any external force that might delimit thought and action; stop deceiving yourself, believing only what is personally useful and convenient; complete liberty necessitates a struggle within, a battle to subdue negative psychological and spiritual forces that preclude a healthy existence; self mastery requires ruthless cador. One of the more concrete ties between ancient and modern times is the idea that personal freedom is a highly desirable state and one of life’s great blessings. Today, freedom tends to be associated, above all, with political liberty. Therefore, freedom is often perceived as a reward for political struggle, measured in terms of one’s ability to exercise individual “rights.” The ancients argued long before Sigmund Freud and the advent of modern psychology that the acquisition of genuine freedom involved a dual battle. First, a battle without, against any external force that might delimit thought and action. Second, a battle within, a struggle to subdue psychological and spiritual forces that preclude a healthy self-reliance. The ancient wisdom clearly recognized that humankind has an infinite capacity for self-deception, to believe what is personally useful and convenient at the expense of truth and reality, all with catastrophic consequences. Individual investors often deceive themselves by holding on to shady stocks, believing what they want to believe. They often end up blaming stock analysts and stockbrokers when the truth of the matter is they are the ones who eventually made the decision to buy them in the first place. Students also deceive themselves believing that they can pass a course without studying, and end up blaming their professors for their eventual failure. Patients also deceive themselves that they can be cured with convenient “alternative medicines,” which do not involve the restrictive lifestyle of conventional methods. 6. Avoid Excess. Live life in harmony and balance. Avoid excesses. Even good things, pursued or attained without moderation, can become a source of misery and suffering. This rule is echoed in the writings of ancient Greek thinkers who viewed moderation as nothing less than a solution to life’s riddle. The idea of avoiding the many opportunities for excess was a prime ingredient in a life properly lived, as summarized in Solon’s prescription “Nothing in Excess” (6 th Century B.C.). The Greeks fully grasped the high costs of passionate excess. They correctly understood that when people violate the limits of a reasonable mean, they pay penalties ranging from countervailing frustrations to utter catastrophe. It is for this reason that they prized ideals such as measure, balance, harmony, and proportion as much as they did, the parameters within which productive living can proceed. If, however, excess is allowed to destroy harmony and balance, then the life worth living becomes impossible to obtain. 7. Be a Responsible Human Being. Approach yourself with honesty and thoroughness; maintain a kind of spiritual hygiene; stop the blame-shifting for your errors and shortcomings. Be honest with yourself and be prepared to assume responsibility and accept consequences. This rule comes from Pythagoras, the famous mathematician and mystic, and has special relevance for all of us because of the common human tendency to reject responsibility for wrongdoing. Very few individuals are willing to hold themselves accountable for the errors and mishaps that inevitably occur in life. Instead, they tend to foist these situations off on others complaining of circumstances “beyond their control.” There are, of course, situations that occasionally sweep us along, against which we have little or no recourse. But the far more typical tendency is to find ourselves in dilemmas of our own creation — dilemmas for which we refuse to be held accountable. How many times does the average person say something like, “It really wasn’t my fault. If only John or Mary had acted differently then I would not have responded as I did.” Cop-outs like these are the standard reaction for most people. They reflect an infinite human capacity for rationalization, finger-pointing, and denial of responsibility. Unfortunately, this penchant for excuses and self-exemption has negative consequences. People who feed themselves a steady diet of exonerating fiction are in danger of living life in bad faith — more, they risk corrupting their very essence as a human being. What is good life?

These were repeated about every thousand years and include the well-known Medieval Warm Period , the Hot Roman Period, and generally warm periods during the Optimal Holocene period. These PERIODS OF THE PAST HAVE ALSO BEEN WARMER THAN THE PRESENT PERIOD, despite the CO2 concentration being lower than the current, while they are related to the millennial cycles of solar activity. These effects are not reproduced by the models. The full terms of the Italian petition follows - 90 Leading Italian Scientists Sign Petition: CO2 Impact On Climate “UNJUSTIFIABLY EXAGGERATED” … Catastrophic Predictions “NOT REALISTIC” By P Gosselin on 4. July 2019  In 1517, a 33-year-old theology professor at Wittenberg University walked over to the Castle Church in Wittenberg and nailed a paper of 95 theses to the door, hoping to spark an academic discussion about their contents. Source. The same is happening today in Italy concerning climate science as dogma. 90 Italian scientists sign petition addressed to Italian leaders To the President of the Republic To the President of the Senate To the President of the Chamber of Deputies To the President of the Council PETITION ON GLOBAL ANTHROPGENIC HEATING (Anthropogenic Global Warming, human-caused global warming) The undersigned, citizens and scientists, send a warm invitation to political leaders to adopt environmental protection policies consistent with scientific knowledge. In particular, it is urgent to combat pollution where it occurs, according to the indications of the best science. In this regard, the delay with which the wealth of knowledge made available by the world of research is used to reduce the anthropogenic pollutant emissions widely present in both continental and marine environmental systems is deplorable. But we must be aware that CARBON DIOXIDE IS ITSELF NOT A POLLUTANT. On the contrary, it is indispensable for life on our planet. In recent decades, a thesis has spread that the heating of the Earth’s surface of around 0.9°C observed from 1850 onwards would be anomalous and caused exclusively by human activities, in particular by the emission of CO2 from the use of fossil fuels in the atmosphere. This is the thesis of anthropogenic global warming [Anthropogenic Global Warming] promoted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations, whose consequences would be environmental changes so serious as to fear enormous damage in an imminent future, unless drastic and costly mitigation measures are immediately adopted. In this regard, many nations of the world have joined programs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and are pressured by a intense propaganda to adopt increasingly burdensome programs whose implementation involves heavy burdens on the economies of the individual member states and depend on climate control and, therefore, the “rescue” of the planet. However, the anthropogenic origin of global warming IS AN UNPROVEN HYPOTHESIS, deduced only from some climate models, that is complex computer programs, called General Circulation Models . On the contrary, the scientific literature has increasingly highlighted the existence of a natural climatic variability that the models are not able to reproduce. This natural variability explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850. The anthropogenic responsibility for climate change observed in the last century is therefore UNJUSTIFIABLY EXAGGERATED and catastrophic predictions ARE NOT REALISTIC. The climate is the most complex system on our planet, so it needs to be addressed with methods that are adequate and consistent with its level of complexity. Climate simulation models do not reproduce the observed natural variability of the climate and, in particular, do not reconstruct the warm periods of the last 10,000 years. These were repeated about every thousand years and include the well-known Medieval Warm Period , the Hot Roman Period, and generally warm periods during the Optimal Holocene period. These PERIODS OF THE PAST HAVE ALSO BEEN WARMER THAN THE PRESENT PERIOD, despite the CO2 concentration being lower than the current, while they are related to the millennial cycles of solar activity. These effects are not reproduced by the models. It should be remembered that the heating observed since 1900 has actually started in the 1700s, i.e. at the minimum of the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the last 10,000 years (corresponding to the millennial minimum of solar activity that astrophysicists call Maunder Minimal Solar ). Since then, solar activity, following its millennial cycle, has increased by heating the earth’s surface. Furthermore, the models fail to reproduce the known climatic oscillations of about 60 years. These were responsible, for example, for a warming period (1850-1880) followed by a cooling period (1880-1910), a heating (1910-40), a cooling (1940-70) and a a new warming period (1970-2000) similar to that observed 60 years earlier. The following years (2000-2019) saw the increase not predicted by the models of about 0.2 ° C [two one-hundredths of a degree]per decade, but a substantial climatic stability that was sporadically interrupted by the rapid natural oscillations of the equatorial Pacific ocean, known as the El Nino Southern Oscillations , like the one that led to temporary warming between 2015 and 2016. The media also claim that extreme events, such as hurricanes and cyclones, have increased alarmingly. Conversely, these events, like many climate systems, have been modulated since the aforementioned 60-year cycle. For example, if we consider the official data from 1880 on tropical Atlantic cyclones that hit North America, they appear to have a strong 60-year oscillation, correlated with the Atlantic Ocean’s thermal oscillation called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation . The peaks observed per decade are compatible with each other in the years 1880-90, 1940-50 and 1995-2005. From 2005 to 2015 the number of cyclones decreased precisely following the aforementioned cycle. Thus, in the period 1880-2015, between number of cyclones (which oscillates) and CO2 (which increases monotonically) there is no correlation. The climate system is not yet sufficiently understood. Although it is true that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, according to the IPCC itself the climate sensitivity to its increase in the atmosphere is still extremely uncertain. It is estimated that a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2, from around 300 ppm pre-industrial to 600 ppm, can raise the average temperature of the planet from a minimum of 1° C to a maximum of 5° C. This uncertainty is enormous. In any case, many recent studies based on experimental data estimate that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is CONSIDERABLY LOWER than that estimated by the IPCC models. Then, it is scientifically unrealistic to attribute to humans the responsibility for warming observed from the past century to today. The advanced alarmist forecasts, therefore, are not credible, since they are based on models whose results contradict the experimental data. All the evidence suggests that these MODELS OVERESTIMATE the anthropogenic contribution and underestimate the natural climatic variability, especially that induced by the sun, the moon, and ocean oscillations. Finally, the media release the message according to which, with regard to the human cause of current climate change, there would be an almost unanimous consensus among scientists that the scientific debate would be closed. However, first of all we must be aware that the scientific method dictates that the facts, and not the number of adherents, make a conjecture a consolidated scientific theory . In any case, the same alleged consensus DOES NOT EXIST. In fact, there is a remarkable variability of opinions among specialists – climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, astrophysicists – many of whom recognize an important natural contribution to global warming observed from the pre-industrial period and even from the post-war period to today. There have also been petitions signed by thousands of scientists who have expressed dissent with the conjecture of anthropogenic global warming. These include the one promoted in 2007 by the physicist F. Seitz, former president of the American National Academy of Sciences, and the one promoted by the Non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), whose 2009 report concludes that “Nature, not the activity of Man governs the climate”. In conclusion, given the CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE THAT FOSSIL FUELS have for the energy supply of humanity, we suggest that they should not adhere to policies of uncritically reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere with THE ILLUSORY PRETENSE OF CONTROLLING THE CLIMATE. http://www.opinione.it/…/redazione_riscaldamento-globale-…/… PROMOTING COMMITTEE: 1.

SIGNATORIES The UN and other alarmists used computer models that failed to reflect reality as evidenced by the glaring hindcast errors of global temperatures, 1979–2015.  Indeed the alarmist computer models have been so inaccurate they are a disaster and have influenced leading scientists to conclude garbage in garbage out. SNOW IS THE DEATH KNELL OF GLOBAL WARMING. KAZAKHSTAN’S CAPITAL UNDER “STATE OF EMERGENCY” AS SEVERE WEEK-LONG WINTER STORM CONTINUES TO RAVAGE THE CITY JANUARY 28, 2020 CAP ALLON  Authorities in the Kazakhstan capital of Nur-Sultan have declared a state of emergency after a week-long winter storm continues to pummel the city with strong winds and heavy snow, reports akipress.com . Deputy Minister of Interior of Kazakhstan, Yuri Ilyin, declared the emergency over the weekend. Since January 23, a total of 645 people have required rescuing from the snowstorms and accompanying drifts, according to tengrinews.kz . In addition, and over the same period, 133 stranded vehicles have been been dug-out and towed — 106 cars, 9 buses, 18 trucks, and 1 loader. Transportation links to and from Nur-Sultan were cut on January 27, while all schools in the capital remained closed. A spokesman for city’s International Airport has confirmed that all flights have been cancelled indefinitely, for obvious safety reasons. Kazakhstan's Capital under ""State of Emergency"" as Severe Week-Long Winter Storm Continues to Ravage the City - Electroverse FAILED PREDICTIONS ABOUT WINTER SNOW DEBUNK ANY HUMAN CAUSED CLIMATE CRISIS The UN and alarmist scientists put the state of winter weather in play. They predicted moderate winters without snow would be the key evidence validating their hypothesis denying Mother Nature controls the climate. This failed prediction goes to the heart of so called global warming. Winter weather must become much milder with increased temperatures or there is not climate change. The alarmist knew the science of the snow albedo when they made this key prediction.  Snowfall will become “A very rare and exciting event… Children just aren’t going to know what snow is.” Dr David Viner – Senior scientist, climatic research unit (CRU) The prediction that “children just aren’t going to know what snow is” was made by Dr David Viner, a senior research scientist at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, in the year 2000. It could not be more wrong and is cogent evidence that the new weather pattern of global warming/ climate change is not happening. TEMPERATURE IS ACHILLES HEEL OF ALARMISM Even though President Obama and other global-warming alarmists warn of a looming climate apocalypse, they avoid giving a metric to prove their claims. They blame man-made climate change for a vast array of ills, including floods, droughts, wildfires, and tornados. But they never quantify what they say is the driving force behind it all: temperature. Is Global Warming a Hoax? Written by Ed Hiserodt and Rebecca Terrell Is Global Warming a Hoax? Temperature increases over the past 140 years are too small and within the range of natural variability to constitute human made global warming. NASA Goddard Institute finds warming of 0.8* Celsius (1.4* Faherheit) since 1880. This means an average of only 0.0175 degree Celsius temperature increase annually. This minute amount is within the statistical error of the data. World of Change: Global Temperatures REFERENCES IN 2001, the UN IPCC predicted diminished snowfalls as human CO2 increased, claiming that “milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms” due to the activities of man kind person kind… IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change THEY also forecast “warmer winters and fewer cold spells, because of climate change…” ALBEDO is often key in academic articles about Climate Change. For example, in this paper research finds as the Albedo declines the temperature increases melting mountains etc. Albedo means the snow reflects sunlight away making the weather colder. This feedback goes on and on in a cycle of cooling impacting the spring, the next summer, fall and the next winter and ultimately the planet. Therefore with snowy winters the fear of a too hot climate is impossible.  Some say the alleged warming cases an increase in moisture and this causes the increased snow. This is impossible as it does not explain the record cooling needed for the moisture to turn to snow. The story of snow is strong evidence that the global warming hypothesis is false because reality so contradicts the hypothesis of human caused warming. The moderate snowless winter predictions made sense because without winter snow spring and summers would warm up and so on leading to unprecedented warming. On the other hand with snow continuing the prediction of global warming cannot happen. The moderate snowless winter predictions made sense because without winter snow spring and summers would warm up and so on leading to unprecedented warming. On the other hand with snow continuing the prediction of global warming cannot happen. Recent Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent trends and implications for the snow‐albedo feedback  Recent Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent trends and implications for the snow‐albedo feedback Stephen J. Déry Ross D. Brown First published: 27 November 2007 Recent Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent trends and implications for the snow‐albedo feedback 1. Introduction [2] Snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) ranges, on average, from a minimum extent of 2 × 106 km each August to a maximum extent of 45 × 106km each January or nearly one half of the NH land surface [Lemke et al., 2007]. Because of its large seasonal variability and distinctive physical properties, snow plays a major role in the climate system through strong positive feedbacks related to albedo [e.g., Groisman et al., 1994a] and other weaker feedbacks related to moisture storage, latent heat, and insulation of the underlying surface [Stieglitz et al., 2003]. The snow‐albedo feedback, along with the ice‐albedo feedback, is invoked as a leading cause of amplified warming in polar and mountainous regions [Serreze and Francis, 2006; Fyfe and Flato, 1999]. Consistent with this hypothesis, changes in snow cover duration during the first and second halves of the hydrological year over 1967–2004 show a contrasting seasonal response, with the largest decreases occurring in spring over mainly NH high elevations [Robinson and Dewey, 1990; Groisman et al., 1994a; Fyfe and Flato, 1999]. Easy to see why glaciers expand when the Albedo / snow cover is so bright. As the Arctic expands with increased ice and snow the albedo is triggered and that makes the temperature colder like we witnessed this year. The snow albedo from the Arctic is a loop where snow makes is colder which makes more snow which makes it colder and so on. This is surely a more common sense explanation than the bizarre unproved theory that global warming causes the shift in Arctic air. Also there are major science peer reviewed papers that identify the ALBEDO as the cause of this unique cooling. One year of uncontrolled wild fires in Australia in 2019 show no warming trend when averaged over 67 years.  But in 2019 record snowy winters are weather very relevant of global warming because they contradict the alarmism predictions about snow.  PHOTO of Australian ski bus and very happy skiers.

This even though an expert climatologist said this was not necessarily the case.“Yes, it is unusual but not unprecedented,” said climatologist Dr Willem Landman. “People always get worked up about climate change, but it is predicted that we will only be able to see its real effects decades from now.” He added that weather science has not even developed sufficiently to accurately predict weather patterns over the next five to 10 years. If weather science cannot accurately predict weather patterns over the next five to ten years, then how come the IPCC is trying to con us into thinking they know what's going to happen a hundred years from now?“ It’s still early to predict when the snow will end,” said Mkhushulwa Msimanga, a senior forecaster at the South African Weather Service. South Africans should brace themselves for more cold weather and snowfall over certain parts of the country.

Cold (1.8C CET), and generally quite sunny, although smog early in the month (starting on the 4th) probably killed several hundred people in London. This was the last of the great London smogs before the Clean Air Acts took effect. There was persistent freezing fog elsewhere in the country, around the 10th, followed by a wintry outbreak, with some snow across the country on the 12th and 13th. Midmonth there was rain and some severe gales as the weather became very mild. But the month is most notable as the start of the Great Freeze, one of the two greatest prolonged weather events of this century by my reckoning (the other being the summer of 1976). The pressure started to rise on Saturday 21st; there was widespread dense fog, with many football matches postponed. Cold air started to set in on December 22nd as an anticyclone formed over northern Scandinavia, bringing very cold continental air west from Russia. On the 23rd the pressure in the Scandinavian high reached 1050 mbars. There were a few days that were cold but sunny in the daytime, and with severe frost at night. Over Christmas the Scandinavian anticyclone collapsed and a new one formed over Iceland, bringing northerly winds down across the country from Greenland. Snowdrifts in Annfield Plain, February 1963 The front separating the cold Arctic air from the north met the even colder Continental air originating from Russia from the east gave a significant snowfall as it moved south across the country. It started snowing in the far north on Christmas Eve, and the cold front moved slowly south. Hence although Christmas Day was cold but sunny in the south, with maxima ranging from -4C to 0C, there was snowfall in the north: Glasgow had a White Christmas. The snow reached Lancashire at about midnight on Christmas night, and continued to move south across most of England during Boxing Day, reaching the Midlands around midday and finally reaching London and the south around midnight. I remember vividly waking up to snow and frost the next day. After this, a block was then formed, and cold air established. Occasionally mild air approached the south west, but the great winter was set until to the end of February 1963. Over much of the country snow lay from December 26th until March 2 (67 consecutive days). 2-4″ of snow fell in the north, but snow fell for longer (two days) south of the Thames, leaving up to 18″. The second major snowfall of the end of the month was on the 29-30th, and was accompanied by bitter, gale-force easterly winds. By the end of the month there were snow drifts of 8′ in Kent and 15′ in the west. This is the first major weather event I remember (apart from some frightening – to me – thunderstorms). I remember making a snowman, and the thick frost coating the windows. A Summary of Winter 1962-63 - Durham Weather UK More academic studies showing how snow causes lower temperatures. SNOW ENHANCES THE DIABATIC (physics involving the transfer of heat) COOLING The influence of autumnal Eurasian snow cover on climate and its link with Arctic sea ice cover Continental snow cover affects the atmosphere via changes in surface albedo (Cohen 1994). A larger snow cover increases the surface albedo and reflects shortwave radiation away from the surface (Gong et al. 2004, Jeong et al., 2013). A snowpack also insulates the atmosphere from the soil surface. In winter at high latitude, these two effects explain that snow enhances the diabatic cooling at the surface and in the atmospheric boundary layer (Fletcher et al. 2007; Dutra et al. 2011), which locally increases the sea level pressure (SLP). Abstract: The relationship between Eurasian snow cover extent (SCE) and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation is studied in reanalysis during 1979-2014 and in CMIP5 preindustrial control runs. In observations, dipolar SCE anomalies in November, with negative anomalies over eastern Europe and positive anomalies over eastern Siberia, are followed by a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) one and two months later. In models, this effect is largely underestimated, but four models simulate such relationship. In observations and these models, the SCE influence is primarily due to the eastern Siberian pole, which is itself driven by the Scandinavian pattern (SCA), with a large anticyclonic anomaly over the Urals. The SCA pattern is also responsible for a link between Eurasian SCE anomalies and sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies in the 34 Barents-Kara Sea. 35 Increasing SCE over Siberia leads to a local cooling of the lower troposphere, and 36 is associated with warm conditions over the eastern Arctic. This is followed by a polar vortex weakening in December and January, which has an AO-like signature. In observations, the association between November SCE and the winter AO is amplified by SIC anomalies in the Barents-Kara Sea, where large diabatic heating of the lower troposphere occurs, but results suggest that the SCE is the main driver of the AO. Conversely, the sea ice anomalies have little influence in most models, which is consistent with the different SCA variability, the colder mean state, and the underestimations of troposphere-stratosphere coupling simulated in these models. 1. Introduction The role of Arctic conditions in the mid-latitude winter climate is under debate, especially for the North Atlantic sector (Overland et al. 2015). In this region, the atmosphere has a dominant short-timescale chaotic intrinsic variability and is mainly unpredictable. However, several studies suggest that the variability of Arctic sea ice extent (Yamamoto et al. 2006; Francis et al. 2009; Honda et al 2009; Wu and Zhang 2010; Frankignoul et al. 2014; Garcia-Serrano et al. 2015, Koenigk et al. 2016, King et al. 2016) and Eurasian snow cover extent (SCE, e.g. Cohen and Entekhabi 1999, Cohen et al. 2007, Cohen and Jones 2011) have some influence onto the atmosphere during winter. Such influence may account for an improvement in skill of long-range prediction due to continental snow (Jeong et al., 2013, Orsolini et al., 2013) and sea ice (Scaife et al. 2014) initialization and improved physics (Riddle et al. 2013) in current forecast systems. Continental snow cover affects the atmosphere via changes in surface albedo (Cohen 1994). A larger snow cover increases the surface albedo and reflects shortwave radiation away from the surface (Gong et al. 2004, Jeong et al., 2013). A snowpack also insulates the atmosphere from the soil surface. In winter at high latitude, these two effects explain that snow enhances the diabatic cooling at the surface and in the atmospheric boundary layer (Fletcher et al. 2007; Dutra et al. 2011), which locally increases the sea level pressure (SLP). [Emphasis added] A larger SCE over Eurasia has been reported to intensify and expand the Siberian high (Jeong et al., 2011; Orsolini et al., 2013).

Global Warming False Alarm: The Bad Science Behind the United Nations' Assertion that Man-made CO2 Causes Global Warming Perfect Paperback – July 10, 2009 by Ralph B. Alexander (Author)  Have you ever wondered why so many people believe recent climate change is almost entirely the result of human activity, even when there's plenty of evidence to the contrary? It's because the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says so. This compact, readable book pulls apart the flawed science behind the IPCC's assertion that man-made CO2 is causing global warming. Author Ralph Alexander exposes the IPCC's deceptive manipulation of climate data, the roadblocks for the CO2 hypothesis favored by climate change alarmists, and the failed predictions of computer climate models. Dr. Alexander goes on to examine the consequences of the erroneous, but widespread belief that CO2 emissions need to be drastically curbed for the health of the planet. His analysis shows the folly of carbon trading schemes for regulating CO2, together with common illusions about renewable energy sources. The enormous economic cost of cap-and-trade systems squanders our resources on a problem that doesn't even exist. The book was awarded an eLit Gold Medal in March 2011, in the Environment/Ecology/Nature category, for books written in English and published electronically for the global marketplace. About the Author Ralph B. Alexander is currently a senior market analyst in environmentally friendly materials and industrial processes, at a small Midwest consulting firm. With a PhD in physics from Oxford University, Dr. Alexander has been a researcher at laboratories in Europe and Australia, a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, and the co-founder of a small high-tech materials company. Author of numerous scientific research papers and reports on complex technical issues, he lives in California with his wife, Claudia. The book does a very good job of outlining the various arguments demonstrating that climate sensitivity to very small changes in the composition of the atmosphere must itself be very small. And that is the only question that really needed to be answered in the climate debate.– Lord Christopher Monckton In addition from the beginning data tampering has been rampant to try vainly to show more warming. Massive Data Tampering Uncovered At NASA – Warmth, Cooling Disappears Due To Incompatibility With Models By Kenneth Richard on 16. January 2017 Ice-pack of lies Alarmists are avoiding the truth about climate and the poles  Howard Thomas Brady 24 August 2019 Unfortunately, critical scientific research does not always filter through to the public. Consequently, climate alarmists are getting away with blue murder pretending that we are on the edge of a climate precipice. These activists argue we are in a new era of catastrophic climate change. Make any reference to the historic past to gain some perspective and you will be howled down. Persist and you will be told that the pace of modern climate change is so rapid any perspective gained from examining the past is meaningless. They argue history must be whitewashed as we are in a ‘totally unique’ period; the Anthropocene. Once case in point concerns carbon dioxide levels that have risen from 280 to 410 parts per million since the mid-19th century. These levels are historically low. At various times for millions of years plants and animals have happily lived and thrived in levels between 1,500 and 2,000 parts per million; over four times the carbon dioxide levels of today. Climate events in the last 15,000 years have been as dramatic and rapid as any seen today. As such, those changes totally disprove the panic stories spread by activists. Why incite panic about the present retreat of polar glaciers when the retreat of polar glaciers in West Antarctica was even more dramatic 8,000 years ago? Why talk about the ‘unprecedented’ rate of modern warming when the rate of warming in West Antarctica was greater in the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries than in recent decades? Why pretend an ice-free Arctic Ocean would be a sign of dramatic climate change when the Arctic Ocean was ice-free at various times between 14,700 and 6,000 years ago? Why panic about ice loss in Greenland when the Greenland ice sheet was much smaller 10,000 to 6000 years ago? When the climate changes there is little temperature change in the tropics but there is amplified climate change in polar regions. A general term describing this gradient change is ‘polar amplification’. Consequently, historic climate changes in polar regions place climate change in the 20th and 21st centuries in better perspective. In Antarctica, alarmists point to the present retreat of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. But how can this retreat be unprecedented and indicative of catastrophic global warming when geological fieldwork indicates these glaciers retreated further 8,000 years ago? Alarmists may allege that the present rate of glacial retreat outstrips that of the past. But ice cores show such an argument is unwarranted. Dr Elizabeth Thomas and other scientists from Cambridge, England have examined Bruce Plateau, Ferrigno, and Siple Station ice-cores. These show the most dramatic rates of warming per decade in the last 308 years were not in recent decades, but in the decades between 1740 1789 and 1839 1888. Surface temperature records taken at West Antarctic stations tell an enigmatic story that is not consistent with the anthropogenic warming narratives of the alarmists. While the Argentine Orcadas Station on Laurie Island has a temperature record going back to 1903, most Antarctic temperature records come from stations set up since the 1950s or from automatic weather stations added since the 1980s. The overall pattern in these records shows warming since the 1950s and overall cooling or level temperatures since 1999. Such a pattern is not consistent with the alarmist narrative. There are other climatic surprises in Antarctica. The most surprising has been a general increase in Southern Ocean pack ice (sea ice) over the last 40 years at the same time there has been a significant decrease of the Arctic Ocean pack ice. And (surprise, surprise!) at various times in the last 10,000 years the oceans have been much warmer than today. Professor Yair Rosenthal and others have used chemical analyses of marine fossils to show that ‘the deep ocean heat content in both hemispheres today is not only less than in the Medieval Warm Period (i.e. 1,000 years ago), but it is well below the deep ocean heat content in the very warm period scientists call the Middle Holocene Thermal Maximum, which occurred 10,000 years ago.’ Alarmists point to declining areas of pack ice in the Arctic Ocean and the loss of ice from the Greenland ice sheet as evidence of catastrophic anthropogenic climate change. Tourists may gasp and cameras click, but the rate and extent of these spectacular events are not outside the natural variability of climate change. Even if the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free in the 21st century such an event is not ‘unprecedented’. Swedish scientists such as Stranne, Jacobsen and Björk, have uncovered evidence of an ice-free Arctic Ocean at various times between 14,700 and 6,000 years ago! In Greenland the alarmists point to recent ice sheet loss and the dramatic retreat of glaciers such as the Jakobshavn. Huge ice-blocks falling off glaciers are touted as proof of human-induced climate change. However, many studies and historical records show that Greenland was warmer during the Medieval Warm Period. The historical records left by the Norse settlers in southern Greenland from the 10th to the 14th Century tell of summer crops and cattle. But the real surprise came this year as Professor Axford and others unearthed evidence that a northern section of the Greenland ice sheet was at its warmest from 10,000 years to 6,000 years ago and was even smaller than today. They argue that ‘Lake Deltasø experienced the warmest summer temperatures of the Holocene between approximately 10 and 6.2 thousand year ago… the North Ice Cap reached its present-day size circa 1850 AD, having been smaller than present through most of the preceding Holocene (2019).’ One wonders what the alarmists would have predicted if they were living during the shrinking of the Greenland ice sheet 10,000 years ago. In order to advance their agenda, climate alarmists have spun a web of false statements and traded on the fact there is not enough historical knowledge to prove them wrong. However, as more of Earth’s history comes to light, their ‘slogans of alarm’ are being shown to be fallacious and meaningless. There is no reason to fear rising carbon dioxide levels. Present climate change, as epitomised in the climate-sensitive polar regions, has not been outside the bounds of natural variability during the last 15,000 years. Historical studies are debunking the climate alarmism that has for too long driven the modern climate debate.

He has a climate website: A guide to the climate debate Ice-pack of lies | The Spectator Snow data and experience is key to debunking global warming. Global warming does not make winters record colder and very snowy. Winters are colder because global warming is not happening.

Nobel Laureate Dr. Kary Mullis is correct in his assessment of the current state of climate science, describing it as a ""Joke"". As he correctly points out, there is no scientific evidence whatever that our CO2 is, or can ever ""drive"" climate change. There is also no published empirical scientific evidence that any CO2, whether natural or man-made, causes warming in the troposphere. None of the dramatic predictions of coastal cities being swamped, Islands sinking into the sea causing millions of ‘climate refugees,’ polar ice melting away fast, polar bears facing extinction have happened. Why? The evidence is the changes in the climate including temperatures have been well within natural variability. Look at temperature data since the LIttle Ice Age in 1700 and you see lots of oscillations up and down but in the end no change to worry about.

In the case of North Korea, while it has an antiquated air force and navy, it does have one of the largest standing armies in the world along with a reserve that is comprised of every citizen capable of fighting. In the Korean War, it was documented that the North Koreans charged in waves, the first wave being armed, with the second wave picking up the weapons they’d use from fallen comrades. The DPRK also has one of the largest artillery and rocket tube forces situated in fortified bunkers dug into the sides of mountains just on the other side of the DMZ separating the North from South Korea. Within 15 minutes it is estimated that these positions could rain down a blistering barrage of withering firepower on Seoul, causing up to a million casualties to its residents (not even using its nuclear short and intermediate range ballistic missiles). North Korea also is estimated to possess between 30 to 60 nuclear warheads. In addition, its defectors claim that it has a large arsenal of chemical and biological agents it can put into specialized artillery shells to deliver against the South. While the combined South Korean and US military forces have the advantage of superior weapons which create a force multiplier effect that offsets much of North Korea’s paper advantage, its main advantage would be the combined tactical fighter air wings. However, if North Korea initiated a preemptive attack using nuclear weapons mounted on its short and intermediate ballistic missiles, that advantage would evaporate because before the bulk of the aircraft could be airborne, they’d be neutralized. And while the DMZ is the most heavily mined and armed barrier anywhere around the world, it is known that the North Koreans are masters of building tunnels underneath it leading into the South. From time to time one of these tunnels is discovered. One was discovered that had a complete rail and roadway capable of rushing mechanized troops into the South bypassing the DMZ. A number of the artillery pieces and rocket tubes could also be dedicated to mounting a barrage on the DMZ itself, setting off the land mines now protecting against a land invasion across the 38th parallel. North Korea also has dedicated units for air and sea invasions, with large hovercraft, amphibious landing craft and Special Forces trained in insertion tactics, albeit their force size being small, they could cause havoc attacking command and control targets and political targets as they have done once before in an attack mounted against the President of South Korea in assassination attempts to disrupt the government’s ability to immediately react—at least that is the theory, though in practice South Korea has a well prepared order of succession in place and the military would and can function completely independent of the political side of government. The United States on has about 30,000 military personnel in South Korea—as a deterrent—hardly enough to thwart an all out assault on South Korea. Moreover, while the US has a defense treaty and strong commitment to South Korea, and theoretically its nuclear umbrella protects it (and Japan, which would also likely be simultaneously attacked, with ballistic missiles targeting the USMC base on Okinawa and the air and naval assets there, as well as stationed on Guam) is the US President prepared to loss a few major US cities to North Korean nuclear ICBMs, including its naval fleet and air force units station in Hawaii and San Diego, CA? If it were determined by intelligence officers and spy satellite observations that North Korea was mobilizing, would the US launch a preemptive nuclear attack on North Korean forces, combined with its conventional forces, targeting command and control, military units and infrastructure, assumed locations of North Korean nuclear weapons depots as well as the political and military leadership itself? Under former US and South Korean administrations in Washington and Seoul, perhaps. But President Moon who sits in the Blue House in Seoul today, and President Trump who is a political neophyte with no military background, would both sides be capable of making that decision within the very short time frame (literally within minutes) the’d have to attempt to escape the worse scenario? I doubt the South Korean political leadership would take a decision before an actual attack on South Korea began; they’d consider it another bluster and bluff by the Kim regime, or a major provocation but without the intent to actually invade. They’d take that decision based on past history and moreover because the alternative would be all out war which would leave Seoul in ruins and upward of a million casualties in the Seoul area alone. And while President Moon has repeatedly stated that South Korea can veto any US decision to unilaterally and preemptively attack North Korea to preserve its own security, on the US side that would likely hold no value because President Trump and US military leaders have already said that South Korea has no such veto power over its decisions to protect its own citizens against an attack by North Korea. And how does the saying go?—”better safe, than sorry”. Now let me discuss how prepared the US, and South Korea, Japan and even Australia, are prepared for a war with North Korea. Under articles within the NATO charter, an attack on any member triggers the mutual response by all NATO forces. However, only once has the article been activated and that was after the attack on American soil on 9–11. Would an attack on US forces on South Korean soil, or in Japan trigger NATO’s article? Maybe not. But an attack on Guam, a territory of the US, would. Certainly, an attack on Australia, which is not a NATO member, but which Australia and New Zealand, both contact countries, are members of the AUSCANNZUKUS strategic alliance, with similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members for aid cooperation, NATO members Canada and the UK, both also Commonwealth members, likely see a NATO commitment being triggered by an attack by North Korea. All that said, it would be suicidal for the Kim regime to act against South Korea and the United States, especially because it is considered a rogue terrorist nation armed with nuclear weapons and the civilized world, including China, is growing exceedingly more and more disturbed by both the bellicose rhetoric and repeated threats to nuke the US, South Korea, Japan and Australia…and any other country which may go up against it, including by implication: China. The fact that China mobilizes its border security forces stationed along its long border with North Korea, especially to show its displeasure with unilateral North Korean acts it continues to condemn, has left the Kim regime considering China with increasing amity and doubting China’s commitment to the Kim regime’s survival. The fact that Kim Jong-Un’s older half brother, Kim Jong-Nam, continued to irritate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un, who certainly ordered him assassinate on February 13, using a complex binary Sarin nerve agent, which could only have been supplied by the four North Korean agents who fled from Malaysia immediately after the attack at a Kuala Lumpur airport, is compelling circumstantial evidence that Kim Jong-Un ordered the killing. After all, along with eliminating senior high ranking military, intelligence, security and political elite within his government, in his march to consolidate power, Kim Jong-Nam was seen as China’s “wild card” in the geopolitical poker game being played out behind the scenes. Be it paranoia or a true sense that China was keeping Kim Jong-Nam as a potential replacement for Kim Jong-Un should they feel they lost their influence over Kim Jong-Un and a nuclear armed hermit state, was always present right under the surface in the souring relationship between President Xi and Kim Jong-UN. As evidence of the paranoia North Korea harbored over China’s ulterior motives, is the multi-billion dollar major motorway, railway and bridge China built to connect it with North Korea, presumably to enhance two way trade between both countries. Whilst China built the infrastructure at great cost, it ends in a empty field on North Korea’s side. North Korea decided not to build a connection to the terminus road and railway, believing I think, to the notion that it would leave North Korea exposed to a rapid invasion one day by China, allowing Chinese mechanized troops and tanks to pout into North Korea in the event China one day decided it needed to replace the Kim Jong-Un reign. So, today China is left with a geopolitical conundrum: whilst it does not want a unified Korean peninsula under the control of the government in South Korea, a staunch ally of the US, giving the US military and intelligence agencies a broad, long border with China, it does not want a nuclear armed North Korea causing a war, erupting along its border, with the US possibly using nuclear weapons itself against North Korea. Where would that leave China? Unlike 1950, China does not want to risk everything in a regional war which could rapidly morph into WW III between it and the US and its allies. Neither does it want the US to have permanent military bases and intelligence gathering stations along its border. So where does that leave President Xi and the PLA? In a dither. Before North Korea can perfect a nuclear tipped ICBM force capable of successful re-entry, showing it can deliver an intact nuclear warhead by which if can attack the US and its allies—which I should note, the DPRK of has just announced it may do by employing an atmospheric nuclear test in the Pacific using an ICBM to prove to the world it truly posses a nuclear-capable ICBM deterrent, China may decide it is in its best long term interests to de-fang Kim Jong-Un, either on its own so it can turn North Korea into a protectorate which it can influence in order to control the terms under which it would allow a unified Korean peninsula under Seoul, i.e insisting the US military bases in South Korea be terminated and “certain” provisions between the relationship between South Korea and China be formalized in binding agreements between both nations—all which would be to the detriment of US interests whilst at the same instance placing South Korea in a captive relationship to its immense economic and military advantages over South Korea. Or, President Xi may see an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to “one-up” the US by proposing to President Trump some kind of “grand alliance” involving major trade concessions favoring the US, and in return receiving from the US some kind of “understanding” giving a rising China a unchallenged hegemony over its plans for a China-led “near Asia” confederation. With such an agreement including some kind of understanding including how China will peacefully work with other ASEAN member nations, with competing territorial claims in the South China Sea, to mutually develop the mineral and marine wealth located there. Perhaps, such a grand bargain would even including the status of Taiwan and a commitment from the US to never again supply military weapons or assistance to it. But that would take an act of Congress to overturn current US laws concerning the relationship with Taiwan. If none of the above can be worked out, then the alternative I am sorry to say, is likely a US preemptive attack on North Korea just before or just after the US determines that it is actually at risk for a North Korean nuclear attack or the DPRK of can use its nuclear capacity to hold South Korea, the US, Japan and Australia hostage to economic blackmail; first forcing a recognition of the validity of the Kim government, second removing all UN and US sponsored embargo, economic and global financial restrictions, third a formal peace agreement ending the Korean War, fourth a removal of all US bases from South Korea and an end to further ROK-US military training operations. And that would just be for starters; it would, if successful on extracting those concessions, be followed up with demands for food relief, economic investments and technical assistance with its agricultural, mineral extraction and processing, and manufacturing sectors AND an unobstructed ability to sign government-to-government and commercial agreements with any nation it wishes to and which wishes to trade with North Korea. In the end, that may not be such a bad thing. It would help alleviate hunger for millions of DPRK citizens now suffering under the Kim regime; it would open up the mineral wealth of North Korea so it could trade with other nations freely to provide economic resources to improve its infrastructure, as well as to open up a beneficial trading relationship with mineral-poor South Korea, in return for which North Korea would receive technical assistance and both Korea’s could enter into long term joint manufacturing agreements which could help the North quickly develop its economy—all that would help guarantee Kim Jong-Un’s survival with less use of oppressive force to secure his position. If none of this comes to fruition—which is a real possibility because of the competing elements within the South Korean, Chinese and US governments—then war could result by miscalculation. IF that does, the US has 44 Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptor missile based in the United States in California and Alaska. This is the primary anti-ballistic missile system for intercepting incoming warheads in space, during the midcourse phase of ballistic trajectory flight. It is a major component of the American missile defense strategy to counter ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles. In addition, the US has the THAAD system deployed in South Korea, Guam and Japan. According to an article by Eric Gomez, a policy analyst for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute in RealClearDefense, “….U.S. officials confirmed that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense battery deployed on a South Korean golf course reached initial operating capability. As tensions grow on the Korean peninsula, THAAD’s deployment is supposed to improve deterrence by bolstering the ability of the United States and South Korea to defend against North Korean ballistic missiles. While THAAD does reduce the chances of a successful North Korean missile attack against important U.S. military bases and some South Korean cities, it probably won’t do much to cool down the situation on the peninsula. In fact, THAAD could contribute to instability and increase the likelihood of a crisis. Why is that? First, it is important to understand what the THAAD system is and isn’t capable of doing. THAAD is not able to defend Seoul from North Korean missiles because most of the capital city is just outside the 200 km range of THAAD’s interceptors. While not in a position to defend Seoul, THAAD could protect several locations that are essential for conducting sustained combat operations against North Korea, such as the port of Busan and Kunsan air base. Moreover, even if THAAD were deployed closer to Seoul, it would not be able to defend against the conventional artillery threat to the city. Critically, THAAD would not be able to shoot down a North Korean missile testor an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) heading for the U.S. homeland. THAAD can only engage missiles as they fall back down to earth. If a missile is falling within the engagement range of THAAD’s interceptors, then North Korea is not testing a missile, it is attacking South Korea. It will not work for U.S. homeland defense, either. The only thing capable of defending the continental U.S. from ICBMs is the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, which has a spotty testing record. While THAAD could not shoot down an ICBM, its radar could provide targeting data to the GMD to improve the chance of a successful intercept, but that is hardly a guarantee of success. With these technical limitations in mind, THAAD’s main purpose is to provide a protective umbrella for U.S. air force bases in South Korea, and the port of Busan, the primary port of entry for follow-on U.S. ground forces in the event of a long-term fight with North Korea. But although missile defense systems are usually viewed as solely defensive, the protection they provide also creates a perverse incentive for U.S. military planners to use force offensively. If U.S. planners believe essential military facilities are relatively safe from missile attack, they could be emboldened to launch first strikes against North Korea’s nuclear forces. Currently, the United States, South Korea, and North Korea all face strong incentives to go first in a conflict. The best way for the United States and South Korea to limit the damage of a North Korean attack is to destroy the North’s nuclear weapons on the ground or kill Kim Jong Un before he can give the order. Unfortunately, this also places Kim Jong Un in a “use it or lose it” position to attack first with his nuclear weapons in the hope of short-circuiting a disarming attack. Before THAAD, a disarming blow was incredibly risky because of the damage that just a few surviving nuclear-armed missiles could do to U.S. forces in South Korea. The risk and danger of a disarming strike are both still high, but THAAD does reduce them by providing a better shield against any weapons that may survive the first strike. Ultimately, THAAD will do little to defuse the current tensions on the Korean peninsula. The greater protection it provides to U.S. troops could make U.S. escalation less costly and therefore more attractive. The Trump administration will have to find another way out of this crisis. South Korea, Japan, Australia (along with certain US Naval Surface vessels) have the US Navy’s AEGIS anti-missile defense system on board specially fitted frigates and destroyers. Japan also recently requested the land-based AEGIS system to protect its homeland which can be deployed against ballistic missiles but not ICBMs. It needs to be noted that ICBMs have a short window of vulnerability, in their boost phase, in which the missile is gathering speed for escape velocity to overcome the Earth’s gravity in order to reach space. This is only about a five minute window when it is highly vulnerable to intercept and destruction before it can reach space. So the US Pentagon in coordination with the US Naval Research Center and US Air Force is now working on using its drone capability mated to either heat seeking missiles or eventually laser-based weapon systems, which would be stationed just off the Korean peninsula on constant airborne patrol. And using the strong THAAD radar, linked to its satellite network, would monitor North Korean missile launches. Using sensor technologies to determine whether the ICBMs are nuclear capable or not, the drones would intercept an ICBM in its boost phase and destroy it. The US is also looking to continue its use of cyber-warfare to incapacitate North Korean ICBMs, even causing their navigation system to revert the course back to the launch site. But we know little of the ability of US Cyber-Command to effect such actions, though many unsuccessful launch attempts in the past by DPRK have been attributed to cyber acts by the US—whether that is the case or not we do not know. There is also a secret project, of which snippets of information has reached the public, known as “Bright Shield”. It supposedly involves the launch of a cloud of depleted uranium ball bearings or similar like projectiles using special nose cones atop interceptor ICBMs. The released cloud forms a “Bright Shield” which theoretically will block the tracked flight path of any incoming North Korean (or other) ICBM. With a velocity of an incoming ICBM approximating 18,000 mph, any incoming ICBM hitting even ONE such ball bearing would tear a hole in it sufficient to destabilize the warhead so it tumbles and is destroyed upon its attempted reentry. Or, hitting a few would likely outright destroy the warhead immediately. The downside, for North Korea or any other attacker, is that once such a defense as Bright Shield is initiated the cloud will remain in space in the same geosynchronous orbit it was disbursed, placing future launches of any missile or satellite attempt of a space-bound missile in dire jeopardy. It also adds more space junk to the millions of pieces already orbiting the Earth putting space travel and satellite orbits in peril, but the idea is sound and would be an easier defense, and a much cheaper one, to effect than trying to use a kinetic projectile currently employed by the GMD interceptor system and remove some of the concern about overcoming decoy warheads—which can be as simple as mylar balloons—from confusing the interceptor’s real targeted warhead. Think of it as using a shotgun blast instead of a single sniper’s bullet, to hit a moving target; the chance of scoring a hit is exponentially increased by the number of projectiles released in the path of an incoming missile, rather than relying on just one projectile finding its mark. Using a stationary cloud blocking the incoming missile and placing a cloud of lethal static kinetic projectiles in its path is much easier and cheaper and has a higher percentage of success than the current GMD defense system. As any International Space Station astronaut will tell you, every time even a space object as small as a screw or bolt being tracked as coming close to the space station forces the crew into the emergency Russian space capsules since at the speeds involved, having something even that small, can cause catastrophic hazard to the International Space Station. If Bright Shield does exist, it is certainly an extreme method of defense because once in orbit, each of the released ball bearings or static cloud of projectiles becomes a future lethal challenge to any launch of a manned or unmanned space vehicle as well as posing an ongoing threat to existing geosynchronous satellites in orbit, such as GPS, navigation, communications, weather and monitoring satellites the modern societies of the world have come to rely upon. But it would be effective. The use of perpetually flying “on station” drones armed with heat seeking missiles or a laser system would be a better option so long as the US and ROK could monitor a launch within the short window of opportunity to take it down during its boost phase. But such a defensive system is only in the discussion stage even though the technology of using drones armed with heat seeking rockets is currently available and could be quickly employed if funded by the US Congress. Even so, it would probably be 2–3 years before such a defensive screen of airborne drones operating up and down the Korean peninsula off the coasts of North Korea could be placed in service. The radar systems to interact are already in place in South Korea with the THAAD and AEGIS systems being easily networked into the targeting system aboard any drone. As far as I know, these are the only two ICBM defensive systems being looked at that has a real chance of affording a real defense against a North Korean launch of nuclear tipped ICBMs. No country is prepared for a nuclear war.

In the past mainline protestant churches filled this role, but now we need something more secular.Sexism - many of these shootings have been due to animosity or toxic views toward women. Incels, rape fantasies, etc have been an underlying factor in some of these shootings. Gender education from an early age might help reduce certain toxic ideas about women (and men.) Unfortunately this won't happen because it would be seen as taking away from the parents' authoritarian control over what children should learn.Racism - a large plurality (if not majority) of these shootings are racially motivated. Race has been treated as a taboo subject historically, but shouldn't be. Education on race which incorporates knowledge about biology and sociology would help reduce racism in the society. But it won't happen, because the authoritarian control parents want over what their children are taught.Managed lives - schools in the United States treat teenaged students like prisoners. Parents also are helicoptering their children. When I first started university I was surprised by how much freedom and responsibilities international students at my university had in their secondary school years. Teenagers were treated much more like adults than in the U.S. This allowed them to contextualize things better, and be able to advocate for their needs, in my opinion.Pigeonholed career prospects/Economic anxiety - Since the 70's there has been an obsession with funneling teenagers into colleges. I think this is harmful to those persons who might have different occupational interests. We really need to diversify what options and occupational freedoms people have. If we can't do that, then maybe we have to reconsider the idea that employment and wage-labor are the sole means to survival for who are currently the working class, and possibly have social guarantees of one's needs independent of working status. Notice that rarely (although there are a few) are these mass shooters of an upper or upper-middle class background. There is a reason for that. Giving more young adults economic security would alleviate home-life stress, and provide them with opportunities to do the things they enjoy.Ultimately, if somebody decides to shoot random persons, there are significant problems or environmental influences in their life that can be eliminated socially. Making sure every young adult has the potential to develop in a stable home, free from bullying, with social freedoms and responsibilities that center them, and without the economic stresses which induce a survival instinct that pushes them to toxic ideologies will go a long way to eliminate many of these mass shooting. Additionally, teaching people about race and gender from an early age will innoculate them from toxic ideologies pertaining to these subjects, by giving them tools to question these ideologies. All of this could be done without touching a single gun law, and I am confident it would reduce the rate of mass shootings.

What is pleasure? How should I treat other people? How should I cope with unfortunate events? How can I get rid off unnecessary worry? How should I handle liberty? 1. Examine life, engage life with vengeance; always search for new pleasures and new destines to reach with your mind. This rule isn’t new. It echoes the verses of ancient Greek philosophers and most notably those of Plato through the voice of his hero, Socrates. Living life is about examining life through reason, nature’s greatest gift to humanity. The importance of reason in sensing and examining life is evident in all phases of life-- from the infant who strains to explore its new surroundings to the grandparent who actively reads and assesses the headlines of the daily paper. Reason lets human beings participate in life, to be human is to think, appraise, and explore the world, discovering new sources of material and spiritual pleasure. 2. Worry only about the things that are in your control, the things that can be influenced and changed by your actions, not about the things that are beyond your capacity to direct or alter. This rule summarizes several important features of ancient Stoic wisdom — features that remain powerfully suggestive for modern times. Most notably the belief in an ultimately rational order operating in the universe reflecting a benign providence that ensures proper outcomes in life. Thinkers such as Epictetus did not simply prescribe “faith” as an abstract philosophical principle; they offered a concrete strategy based on intellectual and spiritual discipline. The key to resisting the hardship and discord that intrude upon every human life, is to cultivate a certain attitude toward adversity based on the critical distinction between those things we are able to control versus those which are beyond our capacity to manage. The misguided investor may not be able to recover his fortune but he can resist the tendency to engage in self-torment. The victims of a natural disaster, a major illness or an accident may not be able to recover and live their lives the way they used to, but they too can save themselves the self-torment. In other words, while we cannot control all of the outcomes we seek in life, we certainly can control our responses to these outcomes and herein lies our potential for a life that is both happy and fulfilled. 3. Treasure Friendship, the reciprocal attachment that fills the need for affiliation. Friendship cannot be acquired in the market place, but must be nurtured and treasured in relations imbued with trust and amity. According to Greek philosophy, one of the defining characteristics of humanity that distinguishes it from other forms of existence is a deeply engrained social instinct, the need for association and affiliation with others, a need for friendship. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle viewed the formation of society as a reflection of the profound need for human affiliation rather than simply a contractual arrangement between otherwise detached individuals. Gods and animals do not have this kind of need but for humans it is an indispensable aspect of the life worth living because one cannot speak of a completed human identity, or of true happiness, without the associative bonds called “friendship.” No amount of wealth, status, or power can adequately compensate for a life devoid of genuine friends. 4. Experience True Pleasure. Avoid shallow and transient pleasures. Keep your life simple. Seek calming pleasures that contribute to peace of mind. True pleasure is disciplined and restrained. In its many shapes and forms, pleasure is what every human being is after. It is the chief good of life. Yet not all pleasures are alike. Some pleasures are kinetic—shallow, and transient, fading way as soon as the act that creates the pleasure ends. Often they are succeeded by a feeling of emptiness and psychological pain and suffering. Other pleasures are catastematic—deep, and prolonged, and continue even after the act that creates them ends; and it is these pleasures that secure the well-lived life. That’s the message of the Epicurean philosophers that have been maligned and misunderstood for centuries, particularly in the modern era where their theories of the good life have been confused with doctrines advocating gross hedonism. 5. Master Yourself. Resist any external force that might delimit thought and action; stop deceiving yourself, believing only what is personally useful and convenient; complete liberty necessitates a struggle within, a battle to subdue negative psychological and spiritual forces that preclude a healthy existence; self mastery requires ruthless cador. One of the more concrete ties between ancient and modern times is the idea that personal freedom is a highly desirable state and one of life’s great blessings. Today, freedom tends to be associated, above all, with political liberty. Therefore, freedom is often perceived as a reward for political struggle, measured in terms of one’s ability to exercise individual “rights.” The ancients argued long before Sigmund Freud and the advent of modern psychology that the acquisition of genuine freedom involved a dual battle. First, a battle without, against any external force that might delimit thought and action. Second, a battle within, a struggle to subdue psychological and spiritual forces that preclude a healthy self-reliance. The ancient wisdom clearly recognized that humankind has an infinite capacity for self-deception, to believe what is personally useful and convenient at the expense of truth and reality, all with catastrophic consequences. Individual investors often deceive themselves by holding on to shady stocks, believing what they want to believe. They often end up blaming stock analysts and stockbrokers when the truth of the matter is they are the ones who eventually made the decision to buy them in the first place. Students also deceive themselves believing that they can pass a course without studying, and end up blaming their professors for their eventual failure. Patients also deceive themselves that they can be cured with convenient “alternative medicines,” which do not involve the restrictive lifestyle of conventional methods. 6. Avoid Excess. Live life in harmony and balance. Avoid excesses. Even good things, pursued or attained without moderation, can become a source of misery and suffering. This rule is echoed in the writings of ancient Greek thinkers who viewed moderation as nothing less than a solution to life’s riddle. The idea of avoiding the many opportunities for excess was a prime ingredient in a life properly lived, as summarized in Solon’s prescription “Nothing in Excess” (6th Century B.C.). The Greeks fully grasped the high costs of passionate excess. They correctly understood that when people violate the limits of a reasonable mean, they pay penalties ranging from countervailing frustrations to utter catastrophe. It is for this reason that they prized ideals such as measure, balance, harmony, and proportion as much as they did, the parameters within which productive living can proceed. If, however, excess is allowed to destroy harmony and balance, then the life worth living becomes impossible to obtain. 7. Be a Responsible Human Being. Approach yourself with honesty and thoroughness; maintain a kind of spiritual hygiene; stop the blame-shifting for your errors and shortcomings. Be honest with yourself and be prepared to assume responsibility and accept consequences. This rule comes from Pythagoras, the famous mathematician and mystic, and has special relevance for all of us because of the common human tendency to reject responsibility for wrongdoing. Very few individuals are willing to hold themselves accountable for the errors and mishaps that inevitably occur in life. Instead, they tend to foist these situations off on others complaining of circumstances “beyond their control.” There are, of course, situations that occasionally sweep us along, against which we have little or no recourse. But the far more typical tendency is to find ourselves in dilemmas of our own creation — dilemmas for which we refuse to be held accountable. How many times does the average person say something like, “It really wasn’t my fault. If only John or Mary had acted differently then I would not have responded as I did.” Cop-outs like these are the standard reaction for most people. They reflect an infinite human capacity for rationalization, finger-pointing, and denial of responsibility. Unfortunately, this penchant for excuses and self-exemption has negative consequences. People who feed themselves a steady diet of exonerating fiction are in danger of living life in bad faith — more, they risk corrupting their very essence as a human being. 8. Don’t Be a Prosperous Fool. Prosperity by itself, is not a cure-all against an ill-led life, and may be a source of dangerous foolishness. Money is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the good life, for happiness and wisdom. Prosperity has different meanings to different people. For some, prosperity is about the accumulation of wealth in the form of money, real estate and equities. For others, prosperity is about the accumulation of power and the achievement of status that comes with appointment to business or government positions. In either case, prosperity requires wisdom: the rational use of one’s resources and in the absence of such wisdom, Aeschylus was correct to speak of prosperous fools. 9. Don’t Do Evil to Others. Evildoing is a dangerous habit, a kind of reflex too quickly resorted to and too easily justified that has a lasting and damaging effect upon the quest for the good life. Harming others claims two victims—the receiver of the harm, and the victimizer, the one who does harm. Contemporary society is filled with mixed messages when it comes to the treatment of our fellow human beings. The message of the Judaeo-Christian religious heritage, for instance, is that doing evil to others is a sin, extolling the virtues of mercy, forgiveness, charity, love, and pacifism. Yet, as we all know, in practice these inspiring ideals tend to be in very short supply. Modern society is a competitive, hard-bitten environment strongly inclined to advocate self-advantage at the expense of the “other.” Under these conditions, it is not surprising that people are often prepared to harm their fellow human beings. These activities are frequently justified by invoking premises such as “payback,” “leveling scores,” or “doing unto others, before they can do unto you.” Implicit in all of these phrases is the notion that malice towards others can be justified on either a reciprocal basis or as a pre-emptive gesture in advance of anticipated injury. What is not considered here are the effects these attempts to render evil have upon the person engaging in such attempts. Our culture has naively assumed that “getting even” is an acceptable response to wrongdoing — that one bad-turn deserves another. What we fail to understand is the psychological, emotional, and spiritual impact victimizing others has upon the victimizer. 10. Kindness towards others tends to be rewarded. Kindness to others is a good habit that supports and reinforces the quest for the good life. Helping others bestows a sense of satisfaction that has two beneficiaries—the beneficiary, the receiver of the help, and the benefactor, the one who provides the help. Many of the world’s great religions speak of an obligation to extend kindness to others. But these deeds are often advocated as an investment toward future salvation — as the admission ticket to paradise. That’s not the case for the ancient Greeks, however, who saw kindness through the lens of reason, emphasizing the positive effects acts of kindness have not just on the receiver of kindness but to the giver of kindness as well, not for the salvation of the soul in the afterlife, but in this life. Simply put, kindness tends to return to those who do kind deeds, as Aesop demonstrated in his colourful fable of a little mouse cutting the net to free the big lion. Aesop lived in the 6th century B.C. and acquired a great reputation in antiquity for the instruction he offered in his delightful tales. Despite the passage of many centuries, Aesop’s counsels have stood the test of time because in truth, they are timeless observations on the human condition; as relevant and meaningful today as they were 2,500 years ago.",2021-03-06T15:14:53.319Z,"How should I led a good life?

Impacts on Indian Economy- Reduced GDP growth, OECD has slashed India’s growth forecast for 2020-21 by 110 basis points to 5.1%, warning that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on business confidence, financial markets and the travel sector, including disruption to supply chains, could shave 50 bps off global growth in 2020.Global recession, Economies of the developed and developing countries slow down like USA, ASIAN and BRICS nation, their demand for imports of goods will go down and this will affect our exports which are even now not doing well.Pharmaceuticals, Hubei province of China, the epicentre of the coronavirus, is the hub of the API manufacturing industry. India is heavily import-dependent for APIs from China. India’s API imports stand at around $3.5 billion per year, and around 70%, or $2.5 billion, come from China.Crude Oil, India’s oil import bill will come down substantially. But this will affect adversely the oil-exporting gulf countries which absorb Indian labour.Automobile Industry, China is one of the leading suppliers of auto components in India, accounting for 27% of the total imports.Health sector, is already pushed thin and thus government will come up with some fiscal packages for it, thereby hurting the government’s target of fiscal consolidation. A wide fiscal deficit coupled with current account deficit and inflation does not augur well for the Indian economy.Job losses, the laying off of non-permanent employees has already started. As people, in general, buy less, shops stock less, which in turn affects production. and also ILO estimates that 400mn people in India are at risk of sinking deeper into poverty.Financial market, the stock market in India has collapsed. the value of the rupee in terms of dollar has also fallen. The stock market decline has a wealth affect and will have an impact on the behaviour of particularly high wealth holders.Other Sectors like tourism, transportation, MSME, Agriculture product industries, FMCG, BPO industries etc adversely affected.Chance for India to finally reform its economy: “In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity” -- Albert Einstein Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said. “Hopefully, this otherwise unmitigated tragedy will help us see how weakened we have become as a society and will focus our politics on the critical economic and health care reforms we sorely need.” India has a history of taking reform steps during periods of crisis. For example, in 1991-92, it freed the private sector from a myriad of government controls, deregulated financial markets, reduced import tariffs and opened up the economy to more foreign investment to avoid a balance of payments crisis. we must focused on; 1. Invest in sustainable infrastructure, Investments in energy sectorcreated more jobs than traditional investments. Increase support for renewable energy, particularly rooftop solar, through appropriate policies and business models. 2 .Encourage long-term change in behavior, the current crisis has changed patterns of consumption. Electricity usage patterns have shifted as people are working from home on more flexible schedules. Non-essential purchases have temporarily ceased. All these offer an opportunity for implementing demand-side solutions to drive long-term behavior changes for more sustainable development. 3. Make in India, India have opportunity to increase domestic production of goods and services. this will help us to be self dependent economy. then we will able to generate new employment. 4. Attract FDI and FPI, Multinational companies searching new market for their factories and supply in Asian region, investors also want to invest their capital outside china, so we have great opportunity to boost our manufacturing sector. but keep in mind we have to liberal with our policies because we were not get FDI during trade war. 5. Boost MSME’s, government has proposals to hike import duties on more than 300 products, such as an increase of 30 percent in furniture import from the current 25 percent price, provide an opportunity for local production to break out within the market, especially OMEs, SMEs, and even the ever-so-varied handicrafts of India. 6. Become an outsourcing hub, The global economic slowdown will mean that first world economies , such as the US and EU will be looking out for low-cost outsourcing solutions. Whether it is IT, finance or non-core items, India can rise up to the challenge and also have opportunity to increase service sector jobs in rural areas. 7. Change Psychology, schemes like MANREGA are rather focussing to reduce the challenges in people’s life by giving them no opportunity to grow and are making them more dependent on government support. We should develop schemes where the Government can provide skilled labour for industries. 8. Export oriented business, government should promote export-oriented industries and also monitor the international demand and finding avenues for the consumption of manufactured products. for this we will able to increase our forex monetary ratio. After the COVID-19 pandemic, India will have the opportunity to build an economy that is more resilient, diversified and attractive to the global manufacturers.

Profitable but its not a bet on the future, its a bet on asset recovery. The problem is that you cannot make synthetic statements, you actually have to break the problem down into its constituent parts. That means you have to define your terms carefully, and re-constitute a new working model fit for the purpose. Lets break it down. Lets assume a software (or tech generally) new business formation funded with professionally managed public market sourced risk capital. To keep the nomenclature simple, lets call them startups, and lets call the professional investors VC’s. This way we can assume that the contractual tools employed in the new business formation are professionally drawn: The technology is captured by proper IP agreements: trade secrets, non circumvent, non disclosure, and employment contracts. The VC’s control the voting rights, otherwise its herding cats with twitchy dobermans. The VC’s are ready willing and able to rationally price their investments, and having made a non follow up investment decision, they are ready to consolidate their investments in a vehicle capable of converting liabilities into assets by conglomeration. That presupposes that the investors have control of the corporation and the contractually defined means by which to dissolve one structure and create from that another structure.  When brilliant corporate technologists go for a startup and improvise as entrepreneurs they often get one thing catastrophically wrong: they build product extensions not products. As extensions to an existing business line (line card items) they are commercially viable provided the tool is marketed by existing corporate marketing assets and sold by the existing corporate sales department. All sales are a product of trade mark equity, however necessarily good the sales talent needs to be. Product extensions outside of the corporate garden fail, because the cost of marketing and sales exceeds the revenue the tools can generate. As a line card extension, you give the existing corporate’s sales department one more reason to go knock on their existing customer’s doors. At the very least it gives the individual sales person another excuse to do so. If the corporate has 250 sales people across the country, each with 10 customers, you got 2500 contacts points to quantify and analyze. You cannot do that with a startup. You cannot hire 250 people until you know the demand and revenue is there, and you will never know in time because it could take you 2–3 three years to get that kind of feedback. Money buys you speed. Corporate structure buys you exponential speed. If you had 20–30 good startups with this problem it would not be outrageous to consolidate those 20–30 tech-to-tech startups and consolidate the marketing, lead generation and sales function around one professionally managed organization. Splitting the sales function from the individual line card item makes sense if the original founders can pivot to product management.  The a-priori consequence of the above, is that technology investments are not selected on the basis of technical skill or market fit, but solely on the pitching technologist’s ability to sell. Salesmanship is not an individual endeavor. Its process, and providing the organization to do so is more critical than judging a single individual’s ability to dazzle the investment committee. Market fit, technology and professionalized process execution. That might be all that is necessary to float the good ship off the proverbial rocks of startup reality.  Most startup founders have never run a business, never mind profitably with an eye towards their cash flow statement. They are clueless. Most have the technology edge, but a massive execution deficit. What experience they have is enterprise grade, not entrepreneurial or business grade. Corporates see entrepreneurship as a cancer that must be excised with prejudice. HR departments algorithmically eliminate any candidates with entrepreneurial experience. Having entrepreneurial experience is a corporate career killer. The consequence is that startup founders are at a complete loss to execute with skills they have been taught since kindergarten to avoid like the plague. Professional business management excludes innovation. Its a backward looking statement not a forward looking statement. Meeting corporate goals going forward does not mean re-imagining the future, it means meeting established financial goals with all risks removed from the equation. Its ABC in, ABC+ out. First time entrepreneurs with corporate experience all hit the point where with every sale they come closer to insolvency because they do not understand that a sale only occurs against extending credit to the purchasing organization. Most entrepreneurs value revenue as “cash on the barrel” not realizing that revenue is a postponed event subject to the disposition of future liabilities. What corporate technologists (and even most salespeople) do not realize is that they are not selling product per se, but rather financing a client’s business process. Its channel credit proper. Most sales boils down to a banking function, and that requires deep pockets. Small business is not retail experience either. Recurring revenue streams are great if you can finance them twelve months forward. They work when you can cash compensate your sales people today for contracts that will be in the money sometime the following accounting period. A startup cannot afford on day one a proper Chief Financial Officer. They cannot even afford a proper accountant. What they usually hire is a book keeper with single retail operation experience looking to upgrade their skills on your dime. They can cash out the register at the end of the day, but their experience and expertise is limited to advising you to choose between making payroll or paying the vendors. If you have 20–30 good recurring revenue opportunities cash flow starved, it would not be unreasonable to consolidate them behind a beast of a financial wizard that can make sense of the cash flow requirements. Cash to fund closed sales should be the domain of financial engineering.  Most startups cannot source the technology to run the organization. Its a game of a thousand solutions. A SAP, Oracle or Microsoft integrated solution is an entreprise solution. There is nothing between Quickbooks and a multi million dollar solution that requires 18 months to implement with an army of specialized consultants. This is very critical in consumer products, where you have hopefully millions of accounting events. You take the order online… and then you have to manually enter the event in some piece of kit not designed for manual entry. The accounting solutions are designed by accountants for accountants. With most tools it takes an accountant to set up the tools. The tools are designed by experts for experts. You have hundreds of marketing tools, each individually useful, but all requiring a marketing specialist to use. You have finance tools that require a certified financial analyst to use. You take an order, and you have to manually enter the shipping information in Fedex’s tool. The above makes two cases: First, its a product waiting to be built. Second, most startups fail because the administrative burden is beyond the capability of super smart technologists. There is also a necessary paradigm differentiation between process engineering, and design engineering. The same holds true for running a business. If you have floundering startups with great technology, there is no reason they cannot be brought under one administrative system where operations are managed by professional managers, using tried and tested tools and processes. A startup cannot afford that level of specialization if it only needs it four weeks per year. The purpose of software encapsulation is to allow non specialists the ability to use specialist tools. Standardized process would solve a boat full of startup pain.  The tools required for entrepreneurship are different from the tools required to run a business profitably. By the same token an aspiring business, should be targeting the kind of growth that results in a proper corporate structure. Calling a brilliant coder with a funded startup a “CEO” is a load of horse shit. Great for fertilizing your rose beds, but not appropriate to the business at hand. CEO is a corporate enterprise grade title. The title is given not earned because the risk capital is public market grade. Its the inflection points where a startup turns into a business and then into a corporate that causes the greatest pain, and the most failures. Its not a failure to scale, its a failure to turn over the baton to the next business paradigm. The technology is capable of scaling, but most often the people are not. Or the other way around… When VC’s bring in professional managers, they either bring it in too early and kill the animal spirits, or too late to salvage the situation. There are plenty of startups that reach terminal velocity and move no further. They are limited by gravity, because nobody has specified the right leverage. I am making a case here to segregate out the technology from the growth management. Managing the transition points is the problem, and can be professionalized. You need entrepreneurial experience at startup. You need business experience at product consolidation, and you need corporate business experience past a given revenue level. Most startups that fail can be made successful if you rationalize the skill set. Different paradigms for each managed growth process.  The above can be applied to aspiring investments, as it can be applied to investments that have gone sour. At the end of the day its about bringing the necessary skills to succeed. You can never afford all the talent when you need it. If you bring it in too early you end up with people on your cap table that are useless at later stages of development, with the consequence that power plays disrupt the organizational growth. A programmer skilled in startup agile development will be useless by the time you have a million hit a day proposition. By the same token the specialist that can code a robust enterprise grade product will be useless when it comes to changing the product specs with every sales engagement in search of product fit. “But six months ago you told me x,y and z and I delivered and I am not about to change a damn thing! Why didn’t you know this six months ago…?!” Standard conversation ending in business failure. Enterprise grade programmers make annoyingly obtuse startup partners. Which is why corporates cannot innovate. They demand billion dollar rollouts before anybody has determined market fit or price point. Enterprise grade professionals make the point that speed to market code is total and complete crap. They are entirely 100% correct except for the fact that you would have to be able to read and comprehend the code before making that judgement and that is not always humanly possible. That is how organizations come apart… when those on the cap table start looking at the issues from discordant perspectives.  Marketing a startup’s product without brand equity requires a different skill set to that required to market product with brand equity. A marketer with Procter & Gamble experience has know how and tools fit for purpose. A startup has great difficulty attracting any marketing skill never mind startup no brand marketing skill. Marketing should be a collaborative process: startup specialists, consolidate the brand equity specialists, enterprise grade specialists. If that skill is in-house, that skill can be applied to multiple investments in process. Plus coders are a dime a dozen, good marketing people are a rare breed.  Organizations fail because of power plays. At start-up, code has all the power. Then marketing and sales get all the power. Then the professional corporate types have all the power. Instead of firing the founders, move them on to the next entrepreneurial specialist function within the organization. Corporate specialists fail at entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs fail at corporate work. Fast coders make a mockery of enterprise grade product. Enterprise grade programmers are permanently six months behind the market. Its all about managing the transitions. Fail to scale or to transition should not be an option.  A venture capital firm that has control of the voting rights can easily be persuaded to move on investments that cannot transition. That leaves motivating the entrepreneurs, the visionaries and the technologists to keep innovating and growing the product. An investment brought into a larger investment vehicle with specialized growth function knowledge, should treat each product as a separate P&L with its own internal pseudo cap table. Call them cap table residuals. When you hand it over to the next organization, you keep your residuals. If you reach the point where enterprise grade execution is required, you residual out the innovators. Its not that the code failed to scale and is a basket case. Its was assembled fit for the purpose of getting customer feedback and achieving market fit. Now you are there, pass it on to the specialized knowhow that can scale it. Entrepreneurs want the upside. The P&L residual is just as monetizeable as a financial stock option. The only difference is that the stock option requires SEC grade accounting, and a Residual only requires an honest business manager. If the trade mark gets sold, that entitles the residual holders their share of the profit from the creation of the trade mark onwards. Upsides for all.  You cannot offshore technical work, just like you cannot hire management consultants to run your business. You need to know where the limits of the technology are and where they can be expanded. New innovative technology has to lead the process.  Its about product with market fit at a price that justifies the software development, marketing and sales. How you achieve that matters, but one should not be married to the swim or drown process now in vogue. Investments should be judged on the basis of technical merit and market fit. Judging the investment solely on the basis of the CEO’s salesmanship is nonsense. Marketing and sales is a process, not a person. Leadership matters, but a good entrepreneur will always make a lousy corporate manager. Institutionalize the inflection points. They say that 900 out of 1000 angel funded investments fail, and of the 100 that get VC money, 90 fail. That is an abysmal track record. Clearly nobody has challenged the status quo because the unicorns covered all the bets. And that’s my story and I am sticking to it. Thanks for the ask always a pleasure.

The Covid-19 pandemic has released an unprecedented macro-economic trauma on the world, creating a terra incognita for all sectors, but few more so than the rapidly evolving wind and solar power industries as they navigate their way into the energy mainstream. Whether a year from now the impact of the coronavirus on the trajectory of the energy transition is judged to have been cataclysmic or revolutionary is epitomised by the physicist Niels Bohr’s words: “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.” Capex cuts In the short term, the shock-waves from the Covid-19-sparked collapse in the price of crude have the potential to cause serial disruptions to the energy sector supply chains and prompted oil companies to retrench spending to protect existing oil and gas investment rather then come IT capital to renewable. This has led industry analysts to forecast significant fall-out for the until-now swiftly expanding clean-energy sectors, with the debate now revolving round only how damaging it will be. Rystad Energy, for one, has forecast that the growth of commissioned renewables projects will now be “wiped out” worldwide this year, slashing its pre-coronavirus prediction to a “flat growth” total of 126 gigawatts of photovoltaic power and 71GW of wind capacity, and paring back it expectations for 2021 by a further 10%. Bloomberg New Energy Finance is slightly more sanguine, trimming its 2020 global solar outlook from 152GW to 143GW, and saying the wind sector faces “considerable downside risk” to the 75.4GW it forecast in December but still in line to have a record year for new installations. And Wood Mackenzie foresees 73GW of wind switched on this year — down almost 5GW on previous forecasts – as the industry grapples with “a crisis unlike anything it’s ever seen”. Europe projects In Europe, renewable energy developers and their supply chains have a put a brave — but realistic — face on the immediate impact of Covid-19. Danish utility Orsted’s chief executive, Samuel Poulsen, assessed the utility’s development plans to be “on track so far” and Germany’s EnBW announced surging profits from renewables had carried it to meet earnings targets early, making it “rock solid” to weather the coronavirus storm. Both, in the same breath, recognised there were “clear risks” down the road as the pandemic sweeps the globe. Wind turbine makers have been showing themselves to be resilient, temporarily shutting down nacelle and blade plants for safety reviews, but with the sector overall seeing manufacturing levels running at 96%, according to advocacy body WindEurope. And, based on early soundings of its membership, SolarPower Europe is sticking to its expectation that the PV build-out in the EU will not be derailed from reaching 35GW by 2023. The likelihood that this broad regional market stability would be maintained was given a shot in the arm following a statement by 27 EU heads of government in which they jointly argued that Europe’s Green Deal and longer-term energy transition strategy should be dovetailed via a “co-ordinated” approach to Covid-19 emergency measures built around the “green transition and digital transformation”. US looks gloomier Things look much less rosy in the US, where the pandemic has placed more than half of the wind power sector’s 44 GE short term project pipeline and some 35000 jobs at risk, according to the American Wind Energy Association, while, by mid-March, the pandemic was already “ taking a toll” on US solar, according to Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association  Matters in America have been materially complicated, in the short-term at least, by Washington having snubbed the renewables industry in the recently unveiled $2 trillion stimulus package, having turned a deaf ear to pleas from industry bodies that Covid-19 could cause “catastrophic” job losses and imperil active investments in wind and solar.  The bottom line, ultimately, is that no one can see over the horizon when it comes the first wave of economic damage being inflicted on the renewables industry. As Enel chief executive Francesco Starace said: “I challenge anyone to have imagined anything like Covid-19”, as he recently reflected to shareholders that no corporate resilience “wargame” could have foreseen the impact of coronavirus on the world’s people, economies and energy industries. Post-Covid-19 uncertainty Apparent market ‘certainties’ are, under the circumstances, best left to the economist-haruspices. The bigger – indeed biggest – question is how the energy transition and the renewables industries emerge into the period ‘post-Covid-19’ and what market outlook they will have. As historian Yuval Noah Harari wrote in a Financial Times column on the possible geopolitical outcomes of the pandemic: “We should ask ourselves not only how to overcome the immediate threat, but also what kind of world we will inhabit once the storm passes.” The International Energy Agency (IEA) chief Fatih Birol urged Government around the world in early in March to build in “large scale” spending on technologies including wind, solar, green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) to their coronavirus stimulus plans as this would “bring the twin benefits of stimulating economies and accelerating clean energy transitions”.  He later added that investment now in renewable energy projects would “firewall” economies against the heaviest financial impact of the pandemic. The size and shape of the industrial opportunity for renewables to see a global upswell in investment, however, hinges largely on what how the international oil companies redirect their capital investment in barrel-bottom oil market – or whether governments grasp the nettle and begin channeling fossil fuel subsidies, calculate by the International Monetary Fund to still be over $5 trillion a year, into renewable energy development. Oil price collapse With crude languishing at sub-$20 per barrel and not expected to soon – if ever – recover to above $35 per barrel, the global energy landscape has fundamentally changed. The oil price's current historic lows are also a “ window of opportunity” to withdraw fossil-fuel subsidies without having the kind of seismic impact on consumers that would cause a public backlash, points out International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) director-general Antonio La Camera. “Renewables have become the dominant source of new power generation capacity over the past six years because they are competitive at the bottom end of the conventional fossil-fuel power generation cost range,” he said.  “Conversely, oil price volatility may undermine the viability of unconventional oil and gas resources [such as shale gas and oil sands] as well long-term contracts. La Camera and others including Birol – who in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak in Europe expressed concerns oil companies could be “challenged [in keeping to] their commitments to clean energy investment” in the face of lower revenues – dismiss the notion that the crude price crash will ultimately take the legs out from under the energy transition, pointing to data from the 2014 oil price crash as showing “no evidence of a link between the two”, with renewables investment climbing to “new heights” that year and in 2015. Strategy re-jigging Many forward-thinking oil companies are convulsing with comprehensive reworkings of their investment strategies, but few hard numbers are in the public purview yet. Early signs of more ambitious energy transition plans in the sector included Equinor’ decision to shift executive vice President — who so far has headed the Norwegian oil and gas company’s new energy business area — to lead a temporary corporate project to handle its response to the coronavirus and oil price collapse, and BP announcing it would draft a shareholder resolution to be voted on next year that would enshrine its pledge to reach net-zero by 2050.  Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, European oil and gas groups had been leaving their American counterparts trailing when it comes to embracing renewables. US giant ConocoPhillips still to has yet to make a single investment in wind or solar, according to a study of 15 of the world’s biggest fossil players by law firm CMS, which calculated Western oil companies were injecting 3% of their combined capital budgets into renewables in 2018, with 96% of that $7 billion going into wind and PV. But, given that last year international oil companies only funnelled 0.8% of their capital expenditure into renewables and CCS, the only way is up. Meanwhile, in China, state stimulus packages included a massive, multi-billion-dollar capital infusion in 25 of power giant china three gorges renewable energy projects, with Asia’s largest offshore wind build among them. And as Rystad noted, so far there had been only low-level disruption to the Chinese wind and solar sector supply chains, with global shipments having “more-or-less arrived as expected”. Domestic turbine and PV panel suppliers staff have returned to work relatively quickly — although the nation’s world-leading renewable energy expansion targets are looking to be a long bet. 'Don't let a serious crisis go to waste' Danish wind giant Vestas restarted operations its China plants in mid-February, and German-Spanish OEM Siemens Gamesa has gradually resumed manufacturing over recent weeks — though unalloyed optimism on this front in Europe may be premature. As has been consistently caveated by almost every industry analyst — renewable energy or otherwise — the wheels have come off the old global economic models, capitalist industrial philosophies are being reimagined, and the world to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic is destined to be is some part unrecognisable from the era before the outbreak The abiding hope that the global energy transition will end up being supercharged by this cataclysm and not left flat by it, resides in the international community’s ability – in the much-quoted words of former US president Barack Obama’s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel – to “[not] let a serious crisis go to waste”. The months ahead could be the best of times or the worst for renewable energy. The Covid-19 pandemic has released an unprecedented macro-economic trauma on the world, creating a terra incognita for all sectors, but few more so than the rapidly evolving wind and solar power industries as they navigate their way into the energy mainstream.

The great offensive of 1941 might not have destroyed the Soviet Union, but more than 3 million Russians were dead.    Three million more were in German prison camps. Add to those grim statistics the tens of thousands murdered, or dead from deliberate starvation and mistreatment at the hands of the Wehrmacht and the SS.  Nazi flags flew over the Ukraine, Russia’s granary, and over the Donbas, industrial heartland of the Soviet Union.   A third of the country’s rail network was in German hands; its heavy industrial production was down by three-fourths. The Red Army had become a blunted instrument, its tanks and aircraft destroyed, its best divisions chewed up and spat out by the blitzkrieg, its winter 1941 counterattack met, then checked, by a German army at the very nadir of its own resources and fortunes.  German damage to the Soviets, however, had not been achieved without cost. More than 900,000 Germans were dead, wounded or missing — almost a third of the invasion force. As late as May 1942, some German infantry formations were at little more than a third of their authorized strength.  More than 4,200 tanks had been destroyed or damaged, and an overburdened industrial system no longer had any hope of replacing all of them. Roughly 100,000 trucks and other motor vehicles were gone, as were more than 200,000 horses — the latter arguably more important than the lost machines.  Since June 1941, Nazi Germany had been at war with both the world’s largest land power, the Soviet Union, and its greatest mercantile empire, Great Britain.  In December it added the biggest industrial power, the United States, to its list of enemies.  Hitler understood that his Third Reich did not possess anything like the resources to match such a coalition. He did not intend to try. On December 10, 1941, he had assumed personal command of the Eastern Front.  Many of the key figures of Operation Barbarossa, such as Heinz Guderian, Gerd von Rundstedt and Fedor von Bock, were relieved of command or transferred.  In their places stood new men, with reputations and careers to make. Like Hitler, they viewed the winter setbacks as temporary. And in many ways he was right.  A hundred thousand men, cut off in the Demyansk pocket south of Leningrad, had been supplied by air from January to the end of April 1942, and were then relieved. A month later, German and Romanian troops under Erich von Manstein completed the conquest of the Crimea, driving its last Soviet defenders literally into the sea in a series of frontal attacks.   Even when they operated on a shoestring, nothing seemed beyond the German Landser — the infantry in worn field-gray uniforms, the men who crewed the tanks and manned the guns, and the junior officers and NCOs who led them.   The German army in the spring of 1942 remained a superbly tempered instrument, combining the best features of an ideologically motivated citizen army and a seasoned professionalized force.   The months in Russia had pitilessly exposed weak human and materiel links. New tanks and weapons still existed mostly on drawing boards, but officers and men knew how to use what they had to best advantage. The German soldiers believed that their mobility, shock power, communications and above all disciplined initiative, resting on the base of comradeship and confidence fostered by the bitter fighting of 1941, would bring victory in 1942.  The losses suffered and the lessons learned during the previous year nevertheless structured planning for the next year’s campaign.  Instead of three offensives moving in different directions, Hitler’s directive of April 5, 1942, projected only holding actions in the northern and central sectors. The focus for the spring campaign would be in the south, with a major drive toward the Caucasus. The objective would be the destruction of Soviet forces in the region and seizure of oil fields that were vital to the German war effort. A secondary objective was Stalingrad — not for its own sake, but in order to cut the Volga River and isolate the Russians south of the industrial city.  Despite its reduced scale, the proposed offensive was risky. It would be launched on a 500-mile front. If it gained the set objectives, it would create a salient of more than 1,300 miles. Hindering the drive was the fact that the road and rail networks would grow thinner the farther the Germans advanced. The main attack was scheduled to begin at the end of June — at best, four to five months before rain and snow would put an end to mobile operations. Even if the offensive succeeded, however, there was no guarantee that the Soviet Union would collapse.  It had other major domestic sources of oil — not to mention the promise of support from its new ally, the United States, which was committed to keeping Russia in the fight at all costs. Such wider issues were not raised among German officers, who were focusing their energy on preparations for the upcoming campaign, which was dubbed Operation Blue. German planning staffs focused on the war’s operational and tactical levels. The army’s rapid expansion since Hitler’s seizure of power in 1933 had left it so short of qualified staff officers that everybody was too immersed in details to have any energy left for evaluating the big picture.  For their part, Soviet concerns in early 1942 primarily involved buying time — time for American assistance to arrive, time to re-establish an industrial base physically transplanted east of the Ural Mountains, and time to reorganize and re-equip an army shaken by disaster. Stavka, the Soviet high command, advocated a defensive strategy.  Soviet Premier Josef Stalin wanted to mount local offensives, designed in part to wear down the Germans and keep them off balance, and in part to restore Soviet domestic morale, which was far too low for the dictator’s peace of mind.  It was increasingly clear that the security and propaganda apparatus that had intimidated and inspired the Soviet people through the privations and purges of the preceding decades was by itself insufficient to counter the pressures presented by the German invasion. Only the Germans’ bestial behavior in territory they had conquered and their reluctance to consider mobilizing opponents of the Soviet regime under their flag had kept disaffection with the Soviet regime from reaching explosive proportions.      Stalin expected the revitalized Red Army to provide a safety valve by winning small-scale victories. Instead, the Germans checked and threw back its ill-prepared efforts. In May, a Soviet attack briefly recaptured the city of Kharkov but collapsed when a German counterstrike surrounded and destroyed four entire armies. Then, on June 28, Germany’s Army Group South tore the Russian front wide open.    Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, who had led Army Group Center almost to within artillery range of Moscow before being relieved of command in 1941, was getting a second chance.  He had 68 divisions, nine of them panzer and five more motorized. He possessed 750 tanks. The Luftwaffe provided more than 1,200 aircraft, including the close-support specialists of the VIII Air Corps under General Wolfram von Richthofen, a cousin of World War I’s ‘Red Baron.’  Bock’s order of battle included 25 divisions from German allies and client states as well. Mostly Italian and Romanian, those formations were not as well equipped, trained, led or motivated as their German counterparts.   Aware of that, Bock intended that they would simply play screening roles, serving as flank guards, and occupy less vulnerable sectors. Nevertheless, their direct participation in the offensive indicated the weakness of the German army in 1942 relative to its responsibilities — and implied a promise of trouble should things not go according to plan. For the first few weeks, the German offensive was a repeat of the lightning advances of Operation Barbarossa. German mechanized spearheads rolled forward across the steppe under an air umbrella impenetrable to a Red air force still woefully short of skilled pilots. But the ground gained was not matched by Soviet losses. Frustrated, Hitler fired Bock and split Army Group South in two. Army Group A, under Field Marshal Wilhelm List, was to turn south, take Rostov and drive into the Caucasus. Army Group B, commanded by Field Marshal Maximilian von Weichs, would thrust east and cut the Volga while screening the left wing of the offensive.   The new organization gained ground but produced no great tokens of victory. The Red Army’s abortive spring offensives had cost it more than a half-million casualties, which were suffered primarily among its best formations. Stavka’s officers argued that, temporarily at least, space must be exchanged for time. Stalin reluctantly concurred. Even after he authorized a strategic retreat on July 6, some Soviet formations were cut off by the successive German pincers. While some of the trapped Russians fought on, others surrendered with only token resistance. Enraged, Stalin issued Order Number 227 on July 28. Distributed to all fighting units, it called for an end to retreat and demanded that each yard of Soviet territory be defended. The penalty for failure to comply ranged from summary execution to service in a penal unit. During the course of the war, more than 400,000 Russians were sentenced to penal battalions and another 250,000 were sentenced to be shot for failure to obey 227.  Frustrated by a perceived lack of progress, Hitler became more deeply involved in the campaign’s operational aspects.  On July 16, he diverted the Fourth Panzer Army, and with it the bulk of Army Group B’s mechanized forces, south to Rostov, hoping to encircle Soviet forces there. At the same time, he not only sustained Army Group B’s mission to drive toward the Volga but, on July 20, specifically ordered its Sixth Army to attack Stalingrad.  A week earlier, Stavka had established an independent Stalingrad Front, and on July 19 Stalin put the city on a war footing.  At the time, both seemed little more than gestures. The Front’s three armies were an uneasy mixture of green troops and formations hammered in the earlier fighting. But Order 227 was more than a set of draconian threats. It was a reminder that there was nowhere else to go. The Russian people realized that not only the Soviet state was at stake.  Despite the horrors of Stalin’s regime, the citizens responded, not merely by digging ditches and filling sandbags, but by reporting to work and finishing their shifts.  On August 9, German troops captured the oil producing center of Maikop but found it completely wrecked.  As supplies ran low and the Red Army’s resistance stiffened, the German advance stalled on August 28 — well short of its objective, the Grozhny oil fields. Hitler dismissed the responsible commander at the end of August and began directing Army Group A himself.  Meanwhile, Army Group B found itself locked into increasingly bitter, close-quarters fighting as it clawed its way toward the Volga. Weichs initially intended to use the pincer movements that had served the Germans so well for a year. The Sixth Army from the north and the Fourth Panzer Army from the south were to break through the front and cut off the Soviet forces west of Stalingrad.  Both met determined resistance in terrain that handicapped the small-unit tactical maneuvers that often gave the Germans an advantage over their numerically superior foes. When it was man to man and tank against tank, casualties were higher and advances shorter. Nevertheless, the little flags on the map tables of both sides kept moving in the same direction, toward the Volga and Stalingrad.   On August 21, the tide seemed suddenly to turn. German infantry crossed the Don River, the first waves in rubber boats. Pioneers built bridges under Luftwaffe air cover. The next day, a panzer corps moved through the breach, and on the 23rd the spearheads of the 16th Panzer Division reached the Volga. As they advanced, however, the Germans found themselves under counterattack by everything the Soviets could throw at them, including civilians with rifles and armbands, and tanks fresh off Stalingrad’s production lines. Most of them were T-34s, whose gunpower and mobility the Germans had learned to respect earlier in the summer.  But the German crews were better trained and more experienced, and they picked off the green Russians by the dozens as the Luftwaffe set Stalingrad ablaze and German reinforcements pushed toward the river.   Still determined to complete his pincer movement, Weichs ordered both his armies forward, setting their junction point at the town of Pitomnik, 10 miles west of Stalingrad. Instead of staying in place to be destroyed, however, the Russians retreated into the city — whether on their own initiative or under German pressure depends on the nationality of the analyst.  Convinced that this movement symbolized the end of significant resistance, Weichs ordered an advance into Stalingrad’s suburbs.   The German commander was less inhibited at the prospects of fighting in the streets of Stalingrad than his armor commanders, most of whom were dubious about committing to a fight that denied their panzers freedom of movement. Their opposition ended, however, when one panzer corps commander was relieved for recommending withdrawal in his sector.  The man directly responsible for that relief had assumed command of the Sixth Army in January. General Friedrich Paulus had a good record as a staff officer and a corresponding image as a soft-shoe type rather than a muddy-boots commander.   Nevertheless, he had taken the Sixth Army across the steppe, and by August 31 most of his divisions were closing on the Volga, clearing what seemed to be Red Army die-hards holding out in Stalingrad’s rubble.  At this stage Paulus and Stalin had a common perspective: Both believed Stalingrad was doomed.  On August 26, the Soviet leader played his trump card.  He appointed Georgi Zhukov his deputy supreme commander in chief. Zhukov typified a new breed of Soviet general: as fearless as they were pitiless, ready to do anything required to crush the Germans and not inhibited by threats, actual or implied.   Arriving at Stalingrad on August 29, he insisted that further counterattacks with the available resources were futile.  Stalingrad must and would be held — but in the context of a wider strategic plan. Even as the situation around Stalingrad worsened and Zhukov busied himself with putting together a workable defensive plan, Stavka’s strategists insisted that the Red Army must not merely respond to enemy attacks, but concentrate its own strength and seize the initiative. In Zhukov’s absence, staff officers began developing plans for a winter campaign involving two major operations.  Uranus involved committing large mobile forces north and south of Stalingrad, then encircling and destroying enemy forces in the resulting pocket. Uranus was to be followed by Saturn, which would cut off and annihilate whatever remained of Army Groups A and B. Mars was the other half of the plan. With all eyes focused on the south, this operation would go in against a seemingly vulnerable sector on the hitherto quiet front of German Army Group Center: a salient around the city of Rzhev.  Described for years in Soviet literature as a diversion, Mars now appears to have been instead a complement to Uranus, intended like its counterpart to be followed by a second stage that would shatter Army Group Center and put the Red Army on the high road to Berlin.  It was an ambitious strategy for an army still improvising its recovery from the twin shocks of Barbarossa and Blue. Its prospects depended entirely on the ability of Stalingrad’s defenders to hold out.   That critical mission was, in turn, the responsibility of Lt. Gen. Vasili Chuikov. On September 12, he was appointed commander of the Sixty-second Army, the city’s principal operational formation.  On one level his mission seemed obvious: hold or die, with the threat of army firing squads and the pistols of the secret police keeping his men on the line as long as any remained standing. Chuikov, however, was also a student of tactics. The Germans, he argued, had prevailed through complex combined-arms attacks.  The broken terrain of an urban warfare environment like Stalingrad worked against that kind of sophistication. The Soviet commander used that to his advantage. Rather than simply sitting back and waiting for the Germans to batter him, Chuikov ordered his troops to ‘grab them by the belt’ and engage them as closely as possible, to fight not merely street by street and building by building, but floor by floor and room by room.  Such tactics would neutralize the Germans’ firepower and would deny them even the limited maneuvering space they needed for tactical initiatives. It would also cost lives, but the Soviet Union had lives to spend. On September 14, the final German drive for the Volga began. By that afternoon Chuikov’s command post had been silenced and the fight was decentralizing to rifle-company level as German spearheads flicked toward the landing areas along the Volga that were Stalingrad’s last hope.  With the fate of the city in the balance, a desperate Chuikov secured a single division from Zhukov, Aleksandr Rodimstev’s 13th Guards.  That night the division crossed the Volga, clawed out a bridgehead and held it for five days. It was long enough for further reinforcements to reach the city.  It was also long enough to create doubts on the German side about the wisdom of clearing the massive factory and warehouse complexes along the river that were becoming the focal points for a defense whose ferocity surpassed anything they had ever experienced. Stalingrad became a city of rubble, smoke and ash, where seeing and breathing became chores and movement invited anything from a sniper’s bullet to an artillery barrage.  In one of modern history’s great examples of leadership, Chuikov kept his men fighting by the force of his character. He offered no rhetoric and made no promises. Instead, he projected a dour fatalism that linked the fate of the city and its garrison. German generals and colonels also led from the front, hoping that inspiration would make up for lost mobility.  Compelled to substitute courage for skill and lives for maneuver, however, the German army in Stalingrad was ‘demodernizing,’ losing the capacity to fight anything but a close-quarters battle of attrition.     German Chief of Staff Franz Halder warned of the risks and was dismissed on September 24. The message was clear. To meet Paulus’ calls for reinforcements in the face of mounting casualties, Weichs began stripping less active sectors north and south of Stalingrad of German formations and replacing them with Romanians and Italians. The gamble might have been justified if the German-tipped spearhead had somehow been able to recapture the initiative. Instead, the most capable German formations were being chewed up in fruitless attacks in Stalingrad.  A Luftwaffe never designed for sustained operations was suffering from increasing maintenance problems. Artillery pieces were wearing out.  Tanks were breaking down.  The Soviets by contrast had succeeded in systematizing their reinforcement and resupply system across the Volga. More and more heavy guns were supporting the infantry.  On September 30, Hitler had announced Stalingrad’s imminent capture.  Instead, it was the Germans who were pinned in place, able to drive forward only locally and episodically, with losses far out of proportion to either military or propaganda gains.  As the October rains heralded winter’s approach, the Fuhrer hinted at great rewards for Paulus when the city was finally secured. The Sixth Army launched its final coordinated attack on October 14.  It broke into and through Chuikov’s lines, once again driving spearheads to the Volga’s banks, halting the movement of reinforcements across the river. The German plan called for an urban encirclement, a battle of maneuver and annihilation following Stalingrad’s street network. It almost worked.  Chuikov, as matter-of-fact a man as ever wore a uniform, talked about an inexplicable force driving the Germans forward. It was, however, merely a last brilliant flash of the fighting power, skill and spirit that had taken the Wehrmacht across Western Europe, North Africa and into the heart of Russia.  Pressed against the riverbank, the Soviets rallied and held, fighting the Sixth Army to a standstill.  On October 31, Chuikov counterattacked. His force was only a division strong and gained less than 200 yards of polluted rubble, but it thrust at the heart of six weeks’ worth of denial on the part of the Germans. Twenty of the German army’s best divisions were packed at the tip of an immense salient hundreds of miles inside Russia.  The salient’s flanks were held by troops for whom ‘dubious’ was a compliment. The main supply route was a railroad that at one point ran barely 60 miles from the front line, and winter was setting in. It was at this moment that Zhukov unleashed Operation Uranus.  For a month Stavka had held its hand, building up forces in the face of Stalin’s demands for action, waiting for the rains to end and the ground to freeze. Those forces now numbered a million men, 1,000 modern tanks, 1,400 aircraft and 14,000 guns — all of it undetected by a German intelligence blinded by Soviet deception measures, and by its own conviction that the Soviets were as locked into Stalingrad as were the Germans.  On November 19, a new Southwest Front, commanded by one of Zhukov’s protgs, General Nikolai Vatutin, hit the Romanian Third Army. A day later, another tank-tipped sledgehammer struck the Romanian Fourth Army on the Stalingrad salient’s southern flank.  Hopelessly outgunned, the Romanians in both sectors collapsed. On November 23 the Soviet spearheads met near the town of Kalach, 50 miles from Stalingrad, in a textbook encirclement.  It took a week to complete the encirclement of the 20-odd divisions and 330,000 men caught in what soon became known as the ‘Stalingrad pocket.’  Within days, internal friction among Soviet commanders slowed the advance and stiffened German resistance.  Nevertheless, by November 30 a 100-mile gap existed between the Sixth Army and the rest of the Wehrmacht. The response to the unfolding disaster among the Sixth Army’s command structure was conditioned by the decline of the maneuver-war mentality after two months of static operations. Too many of the German sergeants, captains and colonels who knew how to fight in the open were dead, or had been promoted to replace other casualties. The new hands — so far as replacements had been forthcoming — were conditioned to moving a few yards at a time, and very cautiously.  When Hitler proposed to relieve Stalingrad from outside, he reinforced an attitude held by many in the Sixth Army.  The Fuhrer’s plans called for Weichs to stabilize the front and to launch the new Army Group Don toward Stalingrad.  The new army group’s commander was Erich von Manstein, who since the start of Barbarossa had established a record as the Eastern Front’s specialist in difficult missions. Manstein’s command, however, was scraped together from various bits and pieces.  It was not until December 12 that he was able to concentrate a half-dozen divisions for Operation Winter Storm, the projected grand advance to relieve what Hitler now proclaimed Fortress Stalingrad. Meanwhile, the garrison was dependent on supply from the air. There is strong evidence that on November 20, alluding to the earlier success at Demyansk, Luftwaffe Chief of Staff Hans Jeschonnek told Hitler that under the right conditions Stalingrad could be supplied from the air — not Reichsmarshall Hermann Gring, as has so often been asserted.  Hitler used that information as a springboard for discussions with Gring, who assured the Fhrer of the Luftwaffe’s ability to successfully conduct the mission. By that time Jeschonnek had investigated further and concluded that the Sixth Army’s bare-minimum requirements of 500 tons of supplies a day could not be met by the available aircraft. Gring ordered him to keep his data to himself.  Doomed to failure from the start, hundreds of Luftwaffe pilots and aircrews soon set off on an operation to supply Paulus’ army. In the end nearly 500 aircraft were lost to weather and to a sophisticated Soviet defense system combining rings of guns and ground-controlled fighters. Only a steadily diminishing fraction of the required supplies arrived in a pocket under constantly growing pressure on the ground from increasingly superior Soviet forces.  An increasing proportion of the reduced deliveries was necessarily ammunition. When Kurt Zeitzler, Halder’s successor as chief of staff, reduced his food intake to the level of Stalingrad rations as a gesture of solidarity with the besieged troops, he lost more than 25 pounds in two weeks.  The situation soon worsened even further. Operation Mars began on November 25, under Zhukov’s personal command. Its initial successes were countered by German armored reserves, and after losses appalling even by Soviet standards, Zhukov broke off the operation in mid-December.  That ended Stavka’s original ambitious plan. As Manstein’s forces began assembling and advancing, Operation Saturn was in turn modified to Little Saturn, aimed at checkmating Manstein’s breakthrough by enveloping and crushing its left flank.  Little Saturn’s preliminary stages had already absorbed much of Manstein’s projected relief force by the time the main attack began on December 16. Soviet armor destroyed the Italian Eighth Army and temporarily overran the air base at Tatsinkaia, which was vital to the German airlift. Manstein drove forward with a single panzer corps on an ever-narrowing axis of advance in steadily worsening weather.   Thirty-five miles from Stalingrad, the attack bogged down against Soviet armor. On December 19, Manstein informed Hitler that it was impossible to break through to Stalingrad and sustain a corridor. He recommended that the Sixth Army break out to meet him.  Manstein flew his intelligence officer into the pocket to go over details of the plan and found the Sixth Army staff unwilling to risk such an attack until spring.  Whatever Winter Storm’s odds, it was the last chance to salvage the Sixth Army. In refusing to order the breakout, Manstein and Paulus showed an absence of the moral courage that is the principal requirement of high command. Instead they temporized, deferring to Hitler’s well-known and increasingly determined refusal to ‘abandon the Volga.’  For three days the debate among the German commanders continued as the Soviets drove into the German flank and rear.  Then, on December 22, the question became moot. The newly arrived Second Guards Army opened an attack that drove Manstein’s slender spearhead back toward its start line.  To an officer who subsequently flew into Stalingrad as Hitler’s emissary, Paulus said simply, ‘You are talking to dead men.’  With Soviet tanks and cavalry running wild in its virtually undefended rear areas, Army Group Don fell back and the Germans’ attention focused not on the fate of the Sixth Army but on the survival of their position in southern Russia.  Hitler initially refused to make reinforcements available and shorten the front by withdrawing from the increasingly untenable Caucasus salient.  Manstein made the best of what he had. In a series of brilliant tactical-level ripostes between January and March 1943, he enabled most of Army Group A to escape.  In doing so he confirmed his reputation as a battle captain and blunted an operation already suffering from Stalin’s determination to pursue the offensive beyond the Red Army’s capacity to sustain it. Stalingrad, hopelessly isolated, was now expected to tie down as many Soviet forces as possible — a mission the Soviets initially sought to deny by negotiating a surrender.  When Paulus refused, the final offensive began. On January 10, more than 7,000 guns and mortars began firing on every corner of the pocket within range. Tanks and infantry advanced simultaneously in all sectors, against resistance whose initial determination amazed even veterans of the earlier fighting.  Even before the few remaining airfields were overrun, the Germans were living on rations measured in ounces, supplemented occasionally by horsemeat and the occasional rat.  Conditions in the hospitals were beyond medieval. By January 17, the pocket had been reduced to half its size.  Once again Paulus was summoned to surrender; once again he refused. German die-hards fell back into the city’s ruins, using tactics learned from the Russians to prolong the end as ammunition ran out and men sought terms at bayonet point.  On January 31, Paulus’ headquarters was overrun. The field marshal, newly promoted by Hitler, was lying on his bed when a Russian lieutenant burst in and captured him.  Organized resistance continued until February 2. The Soviets took longer than that to sort out their 90,000 prisoners and start them on their long march into captivity.  In Germany, radio stations played the funeral march from Richard Wagner’s Twilight of the Gods.  In Russia, the propaganda machine tooled up to publicize the triumph of the Soviet motherland.       Stalin and his generals began plans for a new campaign to crush the invaders once and for all. And from Alsace to Vladivostok, families waited for news of their missing men.     In June 1942, Nazi Germany was looking forward to victory. Six months and a million casualties later, the Reich had barely averted catastrophe.  PS. The Stalingrad battle was a decisive battle for Germany. It was also the battle Adolf Hitler personally took charge of.  At Stalingrad the German army had suffered heavy losses, both in manpower and machinery power.   After Stalingrad, the German army had remained a shadow of it’s former self. It could never recover from this defeat. Germany’s Sixth Army in Stalingrad in World War II The arrogance of Adolf Hitler and the German high command (OKW) was heightened by the enemy’s stupendous losses in Operation Barbarossa.    The great offensive of 1941 might not have destroyed the Soviet Union, but more than 3 million Russians were dead.    Three million more were in German prison camps. Add to those grim statistics the tens of thousands murdered, or dead from deliberate starvation and mistreatment at the hands of the Wehrmacht and the SS.

KOREAN PENINSULA The only thing supporting the North Korean regime is China, and for good reasons. If North Korea ever falls under the influence of South Korea, an American ally with U.S. presence on its soil would be close to its border. Therefore, China will do everything in their power to keep American forces away from their borders. Unfortunately, North Korea is presided by an unstable antagonistic government like plays brinkmanship with the U.S & South Korea. Any small conflict in the Peninsula could quickly escalate into a global conflagration with the United States & possibly other NATO Members backing South Korea and China & possibly Russia backing North Korea.  INDIA -CHINA –PAKISTAN GREAT GAME India and China are natural rivals. They’re both large nations with over a billion people, and they’re both trying to leverage their massive populations to build their economies and are competing for the same niche in the global economy; that of a nation with an endless supply of cheap labor. A rising India concerns both China and Pakistan, For this reason China is making a string of ports and military bases around India known as the String of Pearls which is network of Chinese military and port facilities from the China to Port Sudan via sea lines run through several major maritime choke points such as the Strait of Mandeb, the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz and the Lombok Strait; as well as other strategic maritime centers in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. China’s alliance with Pakistan put pressures on India’s military in the Kashmir region and along the Arunchal Pradesh/Tibet Border on the North East Frontier. The entire Chinese-Indian frontier runs through the highest elevation of the Himalayas. Therefore, no large army can cross it. Even if it does happen, maintaining long-term supply lines is almost impossible. Power projection by India is limited due to buffer states like Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, Uyghurstan, and Tibet buffering China’s main population centers. Furthermore, China wants to gain strategic access to the Indian Ocean to reduce its dependency of shipping especially crude oil from passing through a long vulnerable corridor of the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea. This strategy will enable China also break out from any United States and Indian Navy containment strategy. China needs control and influence in the Indian Ocean to secure its investments in food, minerals and oil, as they come via The India Ocean and Arabian Sea from South East Asia, Africa & the Middle East. They is a possibility that these three nuclear armed nations plus the United States can come to blows in the future as China increasingly allies itself with Pakistan to gain influence in the Indian Ocean.   ISRAEL - IRAN - SYRIA - HEZBOLLAH CONFLICT Another Israel – Hezbollah war is inevitable. The defeat of ISIS and other Sunni rebels group by Russia, Assad forces, Iran and Hezbollah highlights the changing balance of power in the Levant region. The events of February 10th, 2017 highlighted the Levant’s volatility. Israel’s red lines in Syria’s civil war involves returning fire against any groups that fire into Israel (Hezbollah, Iranian or Assad). Also, deny the establishment of permanent bases by Iran within Israeli Golan border. Furthermore, prevent the transfer of advanced weapons transport from Syria to Hezbollah. To enforce those red lines, the Israeli Air Defense Force carries out attacks on bases, plants and artillery positions. Iran’s ultimate goal is to operate militarily across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon – north of its rivals Israel and Saudi Arabia. Iran controls thousands of militias in Syria militias recruited from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. As for Russia, Putin has signed an agreement with Assad to extend the military’s lease of its naval base in Tartus by a further 49 years. Russia’s base in Tartus is near the Incirlik airbase in Turkey, home to the US Air force and other NATO forces. The base is located strategically enable Russia to deter NATO from the Mediterranean to the Levant. The next Israel – Hezbollah war will be a missile war. The weapons Hezbollah acquired in recent years shows that it is still sticking to the “rocket component “of its guerrilla doctrine. Its missile arsenal has grown since the Second Lebanon War to about 150,000 rockets. The vast majority are Katyushas. During the next Israel-Hezbollah war, expect Hezbollah to target Tel Aviv and other Israel’s population centers. During the 2006 war, it was unable to fire upon Tel Aviv. This time around, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem are within range of Syrian missiles and Hezbollah rockets. Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile shield would destroy missiles and rockets that are being fired on them by Hezbollah and Syria. To combat the Iron Dome, Hezbollah would overwhelm the defense system with a massive number of rockets bombardments at any given time. By doing so, overwhelms the Iron Dome system. Thus Israel ground troops and air force would deploy across the border to Lebanon and Syria to halt the bombardment. Therefore, expect high Israeli causalities. However, Israel F-16 with its advanced systems can effectively neutralize the rocket salvos to some extents. Here is the kicker If Iran’s revolutionary guard gets involved in the conflict, United States Military under President Trump would get involved for Israel. Russia may join to support its ally Iran. THIS IS A BAD ONE. Secondly, Israel gets overwhelmed with the rockets and missile salvos from Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria respectively. Also, tens of thousands of militias from Pakistan and Iraq joining the fight against Israel. Worse, Assad decides to use Chemical weapons against Israel. WHOA, ALL BETS ARE OFF. ISRAEL WOULD LAUNCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON DAMASCUS & LEBANON. Expect Russian casualties due to its air & naval base close proximity to Damascus. Russia, enraged, launches a major invasion against Israel along with Iran after the dust cloud has settled.

Ice-Free Arctic Fantasies Melting Away As Temperatures Plummet…Sea Ice Mass Grows Impressively By P Gosselin on 14. March 2018 German skeptic and weather expert ‘Schneefan’ here writes how climate activist Mark C. Serreze recently announced this year’s sea ice extent was at the smallest all-time area. But since then Arctic temperatures have plummeted and sea ice area has grown to over 14 million square kilometers: At the sea ice portal, the development is clearly shown. From sea ice portal as temperatures plummet.  August 2020 Arctic sea ice portal shows lots of polar bear snow. Data about droughts shows a decline while evidence of snowfall is increasing around the world including Australia and these are not signs of warming. In fact the most notorious effect of the Little Ice Age was the increase in rainfall and flooding that killed millions and caused crop failure. TODAY RECORD RAINFALL AND HISTORIC FLOODING IS COMMON WORLDWIDE. Do your own research as the evidence is the weather is wetter causing floods and not drier causing droughts. The former is cooling the later not! For example Lake Powell in the desert has just risen 51 feet because of the record runoff in the Salt Lake are mountains.  This rise does not come from a climate that is dangerously too hot. This is not surprising when you realize the earth is in an ice age called the Quaternary and are temporary warming is only what is called ‘the interglacial period’ when it ends devastating brutal low temperatures will be the normal. REFERENCES DON’T BE FOOLED BY FUDGED DATA THAT IGNORES REALITY SHOWING THE CLIMATE IS COLDER AROUND THE WORLD SERIOUS U.S., CANADIAN SPRING-WHEAT HARVEST CONCERNS FOLLOWING COLD AND WET CONDITIONS SEPTEMBER 21, 2019 CAP ALLON A record-cold Q1/2 and excessively wet conditions ever-since have decimated the quality of spring and durum wheat crops in the northern U.S. Plains and Canadian Prairies, reports Reuters. Historic cold earlier in the year led to a very late planting season, and while that’s causing its own yield and quality concerns, it’s the persistent rains and waterlogging which are giving farmers the biggest headaches of late. The wet conditions are severely hampering harvest efforts, and have even caused some mature, un-harvested wheat kernels to begin to sprout, severely damaging the quality. Farmers in North Dakota, by far the largest U.S. spring wheat producer, were 73% harvested by Sept 15. Crops still standing due to the weather delays –some 86 million bushels– will likely have the poorest quality. “It’s really bad news,” said Joel Ransom, an agronomist with North Dakota State University in Fargo.  wyatt@NickwallMafia So much for the monster crop of spring wheat and durum in Eastern Montana and North Dakota. 7 to 12” of rain has made feed grain out of it now @USDA #farmlife #harvest19 on hold again So much for the monster crop of spring wheat and durum in Eastern Montana and North Dakota. 7 to 12” of rain has made feed grain out of it now @USDA #farmlife #harvest19 on hold again— wyatt (@NickwallMafia) September 21, 2019

Farmers had gathered just 13% of Saskatchewan’s spring wheat crop as of Monday, Sept 16. Harvest progress for all crops in the province totaled a paltry 23%, which is less than half the five-year average pace of 50%. The top grades of U.S. and Canadian spring and durum wheat “just are not going to be available in the same volumes,” said Chuck Penner, analyst at Winnipeg-based LeftField Commodity Research. And Jonathan Lane, head of ADM Agriculture’s grain trading, added that “weather concerns are still apparent in the southern hemisphere,” too. Wheat futures were on the march north this week, and as the harvest data continues rolling in, and the numbers continue falling short of what are very unrealistic market expectations, we should look for commodity prices to skyrocket in the coming months.

For climate science the data most followed is temperature and yet it is surely the most unreliable at the global level. Also temperature has shown no evidence over the past 140 years of anything but natural variability. Temperature increases over the past 140 years at 0.8*C are too small and within the range of natural variability to constitute human made global warming. NASA Goddard Institute finds warming of 0.8* Celsius (1.4* Fahrenheit) since 1880. This means an average of only 0.0175 degree Celsius temperature increase annually. This minute amount is within the statistical error of data. Weather by itself cannot be evidence of global warming/ climate unless there is statistical record stretching far enough back to account for thousands of years or at least for centuries.  The good news is that over the past decade increasing scientific research has shown that we don't need to choose between conquering poverty and saving the planet from disastrous warming. The actual warming effect of doubled carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will be much smaller than the 2.7–8.1˚F the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has claimed. It is certainly less than half, probably less than a third. Indeed, as climatologist John R. Christy, meteorologist Joseph D'Aleo, and climate statistician James Wallace put it, observational evidence indicates that ""once just the Natural Factor [solar, volcanic, and ocean current cycle variability] impacts on temperature data are accounted for, there is no ... Natural Factor Adjusted Warming at all"" left to blame on carbon dioxide. I.e., carbon dioxide's warming effect is likely so small as to be undetectable. THE MIDDLE EAST IS UNDER RECORD RAINFALL AND FLOODING  Climate change doesn't threaten to ""destroy civilization."" Misguided responses to it—including those promoted by Pope Francis—do. In reality, the postulate that CO2 is significantly trapping heat is still subject to debate (verifying the theory by measuring trapped heat can’t be done) and there are so many other factors involved in planet-wide warming and cooling that it’s impossible to say with any degree of certainty. For example, atmospheric water vapor (clouds) has a much more profound effect on temperature than CO2. The global circulation models—upon which rests the “proof” that CO2 is causing recent warming is based—don’t account for water vapor. This is one of many reasons the climate models were so inaccurate 6 years ago and why they’re even further off (p.5 graph) as time passes. Climate scientists haven’t been able to explain previous natural warming and cooling periods like the Medieval Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age, which had global temperature fluctuations that rivaled the current 1° C since the end of the Little Ice Age. In other words, despite the massive collective study of global climate by climate scientists over the past few decades, and the assurance by many vocal climate scientists who are concerned about catastrophic warming, the current temperature rise appears to be mostly—if not completely—within the range of natural variability. Advanced and accurate measurements of density of the growth rings in Northern Scandinavian pine trees have formed the basis for a highly accurate modern reconstruction of temperatures over the past 2,000 years. It shows that today's warm period is colder than the medieval warming, which again was colder than the Roman era. In modern times, there have been some particularly warm years, such as 2004, but they will be much less visible after a mathematical smoothing. Probably there have always been few years with exceptional heat or cold. It also follows from the historical accounts above about particular severe winters.  Sea surface temperature in the East China Sea (between Japan, Taiwan and China). It is seen that changes in temperature did not happen simultaneously over the whole Earth. The Roman Warm Period took place also in China, the cold spell of the Peoples migration period was significant, but not very long lasting, instead, it was replaced by the Sui-Tang heating period. The Medieval warm period was not particularly significant in East Asia and nor was the Little Ice Age. But the steadily falling temperature trend has been the same in China as around the Atlantic. Jan Esper and his co-authors to ""Variability and extremes of northern Scandinavian - -"" conclude that their results ""provide evidence of considerable warming during the Roman and Medieval warm period in larger scale and of longer duration than the twentieth century heating period."" More specifically they identify the Medieval Warm Period to has taken place around 700 to 1300 AD and identify the warmest 30-year intervals during this period, which occurred from 918 to 947 AD in which period the June, July and August temperatures were about 0.3 degrees hotter than the hottest 30-year interval in the current warm period. Their findings differ from other researchers, who think that the Medieval Heating period began around 950 AD. If for example we have declining temperatures from the past 7000 years then the onus to rebut this cooling and declare a new weather pattern of warming that amounts to ‘climate change’ is high and has not happened since our industrialization   The US has the most accurate weather stations although not enough and they show declining trend in temperature seesawing from hot to cold. Raw data shows a more accurate picture of the temperature decline.    Holocene climatic optimum - Wikipedia This graph is taken from Wikipedia. It shows eight different reconstructions of Holocene temperature. The thick black line is the average of these. Time progresses from left to right.  On this graph the Stone Age is shown only about one degree warmer than present day, but most sources mention that Scandinavian Stone Age was about 2-3 degrees warmer than the present; this need not to be mutually excluding statements, because the curve reconstructs the entire Earth's temperature, and on higher latitudes the temperature variations were greater than about equator.  Some reconstructions show a vertical dramatic increase in temperature around the year 2000, but it seems not reasonable to the author, since that kind of graphs cannot possibly show temperature in specific years, it must necessarily be smoothed by a kind of mathematical rolling average, perhaps with periods of hundred years, and then a high temperature in a single year, for example, 2004 will be much less visible.  The trend seems to be that Holocene's highest temperature was reached in the Hunter Stone Age about 8,000 years before present, thereafter the temperature has generally been steadily falling, however, superimposed by many cold and warm periods, including the modern warm period.  However, generally speaking, the Holocene represents an amazing stable climate, where the cooling through the period has been limited to a few degrees. History of Earth's Climate Science News With the long cooling trend there has not been a strong rise in temperatures except with fudged hockey stick data of Michael Mann erasing past statistics to create a false perception of temperature rise.  https://www.wolframalpha.com/share/img?i=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427em6otjnrlk&f=HBQTQYZYGY4TQM3EMI3WENBWGUYDCNBSG4ZDGOBVMJRWMNJSHEYAaaaa We are in the Holocene interglacial warmer period of our Quaternary Ice Age of the past 2.5 million years. What is happening as to warming is no different and in fact cooler than temperatures of the Medieval Warm period where humans, plants and animals thrived. What is more relevant is the evidence of cooling continues apace raising the real prospect that we are back in the Little Ice Age.

Given that the previous four ice ages lasted for right at 30 my, we likely have more than 27 my to go (the two ice ages that kicked things off were of snowball-Earth proportions and lasted much longer.

Those tell us things like why North Africa has been a desert for 5 ky when before that it was a populated savanna. “Fact 2: We are in an interglacial, the Holocene epoch to give it its name, a respite from glaciation. During an ice age, interglacials occur at 90 to 125 ky intervals and last approximately 7 to 14 ky. The Holocene is 11.7 ky old, but there is new evidence that the Allerød oscillation 13.9 ky ago was the actual start with a meteor strike 1 ky in producing the Younger Dryas cooling.* If we are actually, 13.9 ky into our interglacial, then natural cycles tell us we will be rapidly descending back into glaciation in 5… 4… 3… “The combination of glacials and interglacials looks like this:  THE sun continues to be very quiet and it has been without sunspots this year 62% of the time as we approach what is likely to be one of the deepest solar minimums in a long, long time.

FROM SHORT MINI ICE AGE TO LONG ICE AGE GLACIATION Global warming peaked in 1988 and slowly ending the Interglacial Warm Holidays to begin the short Mini Ice Age affecting all spectrum. After a return to short warming period, we expect a U-turn to long sleep of Ice Age Glaciation. It happened many times in the past, each time resetting Human evolution. During this shortcoming Ice Age, there won't be enough space to grow food and for comfort living, except between the two 33° latitudes north and south of the equator which is not enough lands, and there won't be enough cheap and fresh drinking water neither for mass survivals. Our SEAWAPA project is to harvest fresh drinking water from the 7 month monsoons and rains, the melting ice from Tibet and from the most abundant tropical cyclones region in the world on top of Lao mountain range, transfer it below via gravity by producing electricity, food, and goods, at the same time, distribute them to far-flung floating agricultural modules, to newly built megacities, and to industrial complex across the equator, between the tropical cyclones zone, connecting them to other continents, avoiding post ice age big melt danger. Once done, we can tap into the Primary Water Cycle for larger scale space programs, build Hyperloop transport system for universal distribution of drinking water, food, goods, electricity and heat, all year round. The heat and coldness redistribution across the world will minimize risks caused by Ice Age and post-Ice Age. Asteroids mining and universal commodity dispersion will allow humanity to progress beyond ""Sustainability"", and to solve other risks. http://SEAWAPA.org carmen roupp it has all happened before and it will happen again -flooding, freezing, warming thawing ,flooding, and on and on . it is nothing new.

Jakobshavn Isbrae was the single largest source of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last 20 years. In 2012, the glacier was retreating 1.8 miles (3 km) and thinning almost 130 feet (40 m) annually, and was used in literally hundreds of MSM articles as the poster boy for an AGW apocalypse. But how times have changed. The study’s authors, using airborne altimetry and satellite imagery, have discovered that since 2016, Jakobshavn has in fact been “re-advancing, slowing and thickening”.

MAY 2019 4 MAI 2019 ALAIN PRÉAT Tree-ring evidence reveals recent cooling and glacier thickening in Central Asia as well as flat temperatures throughout the last 432 years. Tree rings were the proxy used by Dr. Michael Mann to invent the orignal hockey stick graph. Twenty years later, yet another reconstruction (1580 to 2012 AD) indicates modern warmth in Central Asia is not unusual in the context of the last 432 years. In fact, there was a recent cooling period, in line with natural variability, that was accompanied by regional glacier mass gains. The following two days may have been among the worst of the entire retreat. When Napoleon reached Pleshchenitse on 30 November, a temperature of -30oC was recorded be Dr. Louis Lagneau (Zamoyski 2005). Frostbite was widespread among the tired and hungry soldiers. Selfishness reached new heights. Now that Napoleon had managed to get beyond his reach, Kutuzov felt even less inclined to force the pursuit than before. Also his army was in a terrible condition. His main force, which has marched out of Tarutino 97,000 strong one month before, was now reduced to 27,000 men due to the cold, according to his own figures (Zamoyski 2005).

On the evening of 5 December, at Smorgonie, Napoleon decided that it was time for him to go back to Paris, and take control from there. He called together his marshals and apparently apologised for his mistake of having remained in Moscow for too long. He then set off into the night. The Imperial Mameluke, Roustam, later reported that the wine in Napoleon's carriage froze that night, causing the bottles to shatter. On 6 December the temperature fell even more, reaching -37.5oC according to Dr. Louis Lagneau. The encampment suffered greatly due to winter weather, disease, and short rations.

Monday, 01 October 2018 NASA Sees Climate Cooling Trend Thanks to Low Sun Activity Written by James Murphy  The climate alarmists just can’t catch a break. NASA is reporting that the sun is entering one of the deepest Solar Minima of the Space Age; and Earth’s atmosphere is responding in kind. So, start pumping out that CO2, everyone. We’re going to need all the greenhouse gases we can get. “We see a cooling trend,” said Martin Mlynczak of NASA’s Langley Research Center. “High above Earth’s surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy. If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for cold.” The new data is coming from NASA’s Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry or SABER instrument, which is onboard the space agency’s Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. SABER monitors infrared radiation from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO), two substances that play a vital role in the energy output of our thermosphere, the very top level of our atmosphere. “The thermosphere always cools off during Solar Minimum. It’s one of the most important ways the solar cycle affects our planet,” said Mlynczak, who is the associate principal investigator for SABER. Who knew that that big yellow ball of light in the sky had such a big influence on our climate? There’s a bit of good news in all of this. When the thermosphere cools, it literally shrinks, therefore reducing aerodynamic drag on satellites in low Earth orbit. In effect, the shrinking thermosphere increases a satellite’s lifetime. But that appears to be where the good news ends, unless you prefer cold weather and increased space junk. “The bad news,” according to Dr. Tony Phillips, editor of SpaceWeather.com -- News and information about meteor showers, solar flares, auroras, and near-Earth asteroids, is: “It also delays the natural decay of space junk, resulting in a more cluttered environment around Earth.” Mlynczak and his colleagues have created the Thermosphere Climate Index (TCI), which measures how much NO is dumped from the Thermosphere into outer space. During Solar Maximum the TCI number is very high. At times of Solar Minimum, TCI is low. “Right now, (TCI) is very low indeed,” said Mlynczak. “SABER is currently measuring 33 billion Watts of infrared power from NO. That’s ten times smaller than we see during more active phases of the solar cycle."" SABER has been in orbit for only 17 years, but Mlynczak and the scientists at NASA’s Langley Research Center have been able to recreate TCI measurements back to the 1940s. “SABER taught us how to do this by revealing how TCI depends on other variables such as geomagnetic activity and the sun’s UV output — things that have been measured for decades,” said Mlynczak. In fact, TCI numbers now, in the closing months of 2018, are very close to setting record lows since measurements began. “We’re not quite there yet,” Mlynczak reports. “but it could happen in a matter of months.” The new NASA findings are in line with studies released by UC-San Diego and Northumbria University in Great Britain last year, both of which predict a Grand Solar Minimum in coming decades due to low sunspot activity. Both studies predicted sun activity similar to the Maunder Minimum of the mid-17th to early 18th centuries, which coincided to a time known as the Little Ice Age, during which temperatures were much lower than those of today. If all of this seems as if NASA is contradicting itself, you’re right — sort of. After all, NASA also reported last week that Arctic sea ice was at its sixth lowest level since measuring began. Isn’t that a sure sign of global warming? All any of this “proves” is that we have, at best, a cursory understanding of Earth’s incredibly complex climate system. So when mainstream media and carbon-credit salesman Al Gore breathlessly warn you that we must do something about climate change, it’s all right to step back, take a deep breath, and realize that we don’t have the knowledge, skill or resources to have much effect on the Earth’s climate. God — and that big yellow ball of light in the sky — have much more impact on our climate than we ever could. James Matkin • 6 months ago The earth is actually cooling and NASA grudgingly begins to admit reality over the fiction of failed computer modelling by the iPCC. So much waste and damage from the futile attempt to reduce our Co2 emissions for a colder climate. The climate alarmists have ignored solar natural variability not because of the science but because of their left wing economic agenda. They have ignored leading science papers like the 400 page study THE NEGLECTED SUN Why the Sun Precludes Climate Catastrophe, by Professor Fritz Vahreholt and Dr. Sebastian Luning. This study demonstrates that ""the critical cause of global temperature change has been, and continues to be, the sun's activity."" As NASA admits the sun is in a cooling phase and the solar cycles make impossible ""the catastrophic prospects put forward by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the alarmist agenda dominant in contemporary Western politics."" https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/30214-nasa-sees-climate-cooling-trend-thanks-to-low-sun-activity Don’t Tell Anyone, But We Just Had Two Years Of Record-Breaking Global Cooling Inconvenient Science: NASA data show that global temperatures dropped sharply over the past two years. Not that you’d know it, since that wasn’t deemed news. Does that make NASA a global warming denier? Writing in Real Clear Markets, Aaron Brown looked at the official NASA global temperature data and noticed something surprising. From February 2016 to February 2018, “global average temperatures dropped by 0.56 degrees Celsius.” That, he notes, is the biggest two-year drop in the past century. “The 2016-2018 Big Chill,” he writes, “was composed of two Little Chills, the biggest five-month drop ever (February to June 2016) and the fourth biggest (February to June 2017). A similar event from February to June 2018 would bring global average temperatures below the 1980s average.” Isn’t this just the sort of man-bites-dog story that the mainstream media always says is newsworthy? In this case, it didn’t warrant any news coverage *WINTERS ARE LONGER, COLDER WITH MUCH MORE SNOW WINTER COMES EARLY DOWN UNDER: EARLIEST RECORDED SNOWFALL IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA Date: 20/04/19 ABC News It is the earliest recorded snow event in the state’s history.

Svensmark: “Global Warming Stopped And A Cooling Is Beginning” – “Enjoy Global Warming While It Lasts” Published on June 1, 2016 Written by Henrik Svensmark The star that keeps us alive has, over the last few years, been almost free of sunspots, which are the usual signs of the Sun’s magnetic activity. Last week [4 September 2009] the scientific team behind the satellite SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) reported, “It is likely that the current year’s number of blank days will be the longest in about 100 years.” Everything indicates that the Sun is going into some kind of hibernation, and the obvious question is what significance that has for us on Earth. If you ask the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which represents the current consensus on climate change, the answer is a reassuring “nothing”. But history and recent research suggest that is probably completely wrong. Why? Let’s take a closer look. Solar activity has always varied. Around the year 1000, we had a period of very high solar activity, which coincided with the Medieval Warm Period. It was a time when frosts in May were almost unknown – a matter of great importance for a good harvest. Vikings settled in Greenland and explored the coast of North America. On the whole it was a good time. For example, China’s population doubled in this period. But after about 1300 solar activity declined and the world began to get colder. It was the beginning of the episode we now call the Little Ice Age. In this cold time, all the Viking settlements in Greenland disappeared. Sweden surprised Denmark by marching across the ice, and in London the Thames froze repeatedly. But more serious were the long periods of crop failures, which resulted in poorly nourished populations, reduced in Europe by about 30 per cent because of disease and hunger.  It’s important to realise that the Little Ice Age was a global event. It ended in the late 19th Century and was followed by increasing solar activity. Over the past 50 years solar activity has been at its highest since the medieval warmth of 1000 years ago. But now it appears that the Sun has changed again and is returning towards what solar scientists call a “grand minimum” such as we saw in the Little Ice Age. The match between solar activity and climate through the ages is sometimes explained away as coincidence. Yet it turns out that, almost no matter when you look and not just in the last 1000 years, there is a link. Solar activity has repeatedly fluctuated between high and low during the past 10,000 years. In fact the Sun spent about 17 per cent of those 10,000 years in a sleeping mode, with a cooling Earth the result. You may wonder why the international climate panel IPCC does not believe that the Sun’s changing activity affects the climate. The reason is that it considers only changes in solar radiation. That would be the simplest way for the Sun to change the climate – a bit like turning up and down the brightness of a light bulb. Satellite measurements have shown that the variations of solar radiation are too small to explain climate change. But the panel has closed its eyes to another, much more powerful way for the Sun to affect Earth’s climate. In 1996 we discovered a surprising influence of the Sun – its impact on Earth’s cloud cover. High-energy accelerated particles coming from exploded stars, the cosmic rays, help to form clouds. When the Sun is active, its magnetic field is better at shielding us against the cosmic rays coming from outer space, before they reach our planet. By regulating the Earth’s cloud cover, the Sun can turn the temperature up and down. High solar activity means fewer clouds and and a warmer world. Low solar activity and poorer shielding against cosmic rays result in increased cloud cover and hence a cooling. As the Sun’s magnetism doubled in strength during the 20th century, this natural mechanism may be responsible for a large part of global warming seen then. That also explains why most climate scientists try to ignore this possibility. It does not favour their idea that the 20th century temperature rise was mainly due to human emissions of CO2. If the Sun provoked a significant part of warming in the 20th Century, then the contribution by CO2 must necessarily be smaller. Ever since we put forward our theory in 1996, it has been subjected to very sharp criticism, which is normal in science. First it was said that a link between clouds and solar activity could not be correct, because no physical mechanism was known. But in 2006, after many years of work, we completed experiments at DTU Space that demonstrated the existence of a physical mechanism. The cosmic rays help to form aerosols, which are the seeds for cloud formation. Then came the criticism that the mechanism we found in the laboratory could not work in the real atmosphere, and therefore had no practical significance. We have just rejected that criticism emphatically. It turns out that the Sun itself performs what might be called natural experiments. Giant solar eruptions can cause the cosmic ray intensity on earth to dive suddenly over a few days. In the days following an eruption, cloud cover can fall by about 4 per cent. And the amount of liquid water in cloud droplets is reduced by almost 7 per cent. Here is a very large effect – indeed so great that in popular terms the Earth’s clouds originate in space. So we have watched the Sun’s magnetic activity with increasing concern, since it began to wane in the mid-1990s. That the Sun might now fall asleep in a deep minimum was suggested by solar scientists at a meeting in Kiruna in Sweden two years ago. So when Nigel Calder and I updated our book The Chilling Stars, we wrote a little provocatively that “we are advising our friends to enjoy global warming while it lasts.” In fact global warming has stopped and a cooling is beginning. Mojib Latif from the University of Kiel argued at the recent UN World Climate Conference in Geneva that the cooling may continue through the next 10 to 20 years. His explanation was a natural change in the North Atlantic circulation, not in solar activity. But no matter how you interpret them, natural variations in climate are making a comeback. The outcome may be that the Sun itself will demonstrate its importance for climate and so challenge the theories of global warming. No climate model has predicted a cooling of the Earth – quite the contrary. And this means that the projections of future climate are unreliable. A forecast saying it may be either warmer or colder for 50 years is not very useful, and science is not yet able to predict solar activity. So in many ways we stand at a crossroads. The near future will be extremely interesting. I think it is important to accept that Nature pays no heed to what we humans think about it. Will the greenhouse theory survive a significant cooling of the Earth? Not in its current dominant form. Unfortunately, tomorrow’s climate challenges will be quite different from the greenhouse theory’s predictions. Perhaps it will become fashionable again to investigate the Sun’s impact on our climate. https://principia-scientific.org/svensmark-global-warming-stopped-and-a-cooling-is-beginning-enjoy-global-warming-while-it-lasts/ FLOODING BRINGS FEARS OF THE RETURN OF THE LITTLE ICE AGE  After the drought the climate became colder and shifted to record rain and flooding. CURRENT ENDLESS RAIN AND FLOODING Historic, deadly Midwest floods are worst 'anybody has ever experienced' in some areas Doyle Rice, USA TODAYPublished 2:47 p.m. ET March 15, 2019 | Updated 10:38 p.m. ET March 15, 2019 Extreme weather is pummeling the Midwest, and farmers are in deep trouble For the past five years, the 18 states that produce the majority of the United States’ corn crop had an average of 90 percent of their fields planted by the end of May, according to data released Tuesday by the Agriculture Department. At the same point this year, 58 percent of the corn crop is in the ground. The outlook for soybeans is just as dismal, with 29 percent in the ground compared with 66 percent in years past. In individual states, the gap is even more severe. Just 22 percent of the corn crop had been planted as of May 26 in Culp’s home state of Indiana. Soybeans stood at 11 percent. Pools of water sit in rain-soaked farm fields on May 29 near Gardner, Ill. Near-record rainfall in the state has caused farmers to delay their spring corn planting. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) “Week after week, farmers haven’t been able to get out in the fields to plant corn and soybeans,” said John Newton, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, noting that this was the worst planting day on record since the USDA began tracking such data in the 1980s. “The frequency of these disasters, I can’t say we’ve experienced anything like this since I’ve been working in agriculture.” https://www.washingtonpost.com/w... Epic And Massive Flooding In Europe During The Little Ice Age Published on June 24, 2016 Written by http://iceagenow.org Killed more than 500,000 people.  1607 Flood In Bristol Channel A Uk Tsunami 1607 Andrew McKillop has a new article posted at The Market Oracle. Here are some excerpts. This is the global cooling fear Intense flooding in the low countries of Europe became “darkly repetitive” during the Little Ice Age, writes McKillop. The cooling period lasted 450 years, For the Dutch, the Grote Mandrenke is nothing to do with Linux software, but means “The Great Drowning” and is named for the epic and massive flooding that occurred, more and more frequently in the Low Countries of Europe’s North Sea region as Europe’s Little Ice Age intensified. Grote Mandrenke flood killed at least 100 000 Normal or predictable spring and autumn flooding was increasingly replaced by large-area and intense flooding, sometimes outside spring and autumn from about 1300, in recurring crises which lasted into the 18th century. In the Low Countries and across Europe, but also elsewhere, the cooling trend starting in the late 13th century became more intense. It brought long cold winters, heavy storms and floods, loss of coastal farmlands, and huge summer sandstorms in coastal areas further damaging agriculture. Climate historians estimate that major flooding on an unpredictable but increasingly frequent basis started as early as 1250. Extreme events like the Grote Mandrenke flood of 1362 which killed at least 100 000 people became darkly repetitive. Other giant floods probably killed 400 000 Other giant floods in the region through the next 200 years probably killed a total of 400 000 persons in the coastlands of what is now Belgium, Germany and Holland. At the time, Europe’s population was at most a quarter of today’s, meaning that corrected for population size these were really catastrophic disasters. During this time, the Zuider Zee region of northern Holland was inundated and its former farmlands disappeared under water – for several centuries. Crop failures and famines The basic reasons was that the weather was getting colder, as well as more unpredictable. As the climate cooled, it also became wetter. Combined with the cold, this caused more crop failures and famines spread as the northern limit of farming retreated south. The start of the cooling – called Europe’s Little Ice Age by glaciologist Francois Matthes in 1939 – in the 13th century was in fact the start of a long, sometimes steep dip in temperatures that held sway on an unpredictable, on-and-off basis until at least the first decade of the 19th century. Overall, the cooling lasted about 450 years. Preceded by more than two centuries of much warmer more predictable weather Making things worse, the cooling had been preceded by more than two centuries of much warmer and better, more predictable weather. Farming moved northwards, seasons were predictable, food supplies had expanded. Europe’s population also grew, in some regions tripling in 200 years. The colonization of Greenland, which failed when the cooling intensified, was a well-known historical spinoff from the previous warming, but by the 16th century there was no trace of Europeans in Greenland. Only ruins of their farms and homes could be found, but with few or no tombstones dated beyond the early 15th century, leading to the theory that these early “Climate Refugees” packed their longboats and sailed south, to what is now the New England coast. Where they became easy prey for American Indian tribes along those coasts. And as more evidence shows that the Medieval Warm Period was no isolated event in Europe but was a global phenomenon, McKillop’s analysis takes on more immediate relevance: The climate historian Hubert H. Lamb in his 2002 book ‘Climate History and the Modern World’ dates the cooling to two main phases. The first leg of this change he places at about 1200-1400, but his second phase of about 1500-1825 which for some climate historians is Europe’s Little Ice Age, was marked by much steeper drops in average temperatures. Indicators used by Lamb and other climate historians like Emmanuel Leroy Ladrie and Wolfgang Behringer include food price peaks as cold summers followed cold and wet springs, with increasing examples of “climate wars”, such as Louis X’s Flanders campaign where the climate chilling was a sure factor in play. I fear that we’re headed into such a period of great cooling and repetitive catastrophic flooding right now.

Some 400 villages and towns across 15 Iranian provinces have been flooded following weeks of torrential downpours, said Iran’s interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli on Monday, as more rains were predicted for the next two days. At least 44 people have been killed in heavy rains and flooding that have battered Iran, with tens of thousands of families displaced.  Flooding of Europe continues Flooding spread further through east Germany today, leaving emergency crews scrounging for sandbags to shore up crumbling dikes as the country faced its biggest relief effort since World War II. In Hungary, the Danube River peaked at a historic high in Budapest without causing major flooding after relief workers spent a frantic night bolstering dikes. The capital's high flood walls, built at the turn of the last century, held off the floodwater in the city center, though one barrier gave way in a northern suburb. The Czech Republic, facing a staggering cleanup bill after nearly two weeks of devastating flooding, said it is reconsidering plans to buy 24 new air force fighter jets. Heavy flood damage ""has changed priorities for everyone,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Milan Repka said in Prague. Europe is wrestling with the aftermath of violent storms that swept the continent two weeks ago. German authorities reported three more deaths, bringing the Europewide toll to at least 109. Floodwaters have ebbed in Austria and the Czech Republic and also were falling in Dresden, the biggest German city hit so far, allowing the start of a massive cleanup and rebuilding operation expected to cost some 20 billion euros Europewide. Weather forecasts for Germany and central Europe called for generally dry weather in the next few days, though rain was forecast for western Hungary. Under sunny summer skies today, thousands of emergency workers, soldiers and volunteers still worked nonstop to pile tons of sandbags onto sodden dikes along Germany's Elbe and Mulde rivers to protect towns along the way. A government relief agency, the Technical Aid Service, said that sand bags were ""in short supply"" and that Denmark had shipped 650,000 to Germany to help. Italy, France, the Netherlands and other countries have also offered to help, the agency said. Sweeping north toward the North Sea from the hills on the Czech border after record rainfall, high water flooded part of Dessau, a city best known for its Bauhaus modern architecture school. The two rivers converge there, and military helicopters dumped sand on the dikes to strengthen them. Upriver, the Elbe forced workers to retreat after bursting its banks in seven places Sunday near Wittenberg, the town where Martin Luther launched the Reformation in 1517. But officials said the old town was not under immediate threat. Rescuers used boats on ropes to pull people trapped in their homes to safety and scoured outlying villages in the darkness to evacuate stragglers. More than 80,000 people have been evacuated across the region. In Dresden, where expensively restored monuments such as the Semper Opera and Zwinger Palace museum were partly flooded, officials said some residents may be allowed to return home. Further north, the city of Magdeburg began to move people out as the Elbe's crest surged toward the North Sea. The river is expected to threaten there in the next few days. In Budapest, 10-metre high flood ramparts in the center of town kept the Danube at bay. The river peaked at a level of 8.49 metres early today, a touch over the previous record set in 1965, then began falling, said Tibor Dobson, a spokesman for Hungary's national disaster relief office. ""Our main concern now is to ensure that waste from the city's sewers does not cause any problems or enter the water supply,"" Dobson said. Most evacuated towns in Hungary lie north of Budapest. A few areas in the southern part of the capital also were evacuated - areas where the flood walls don't rise as high as in the city center. The government postponed an annual fireworks ceremony scheduled for Aug. 20, or St. Stephen's Day, which commemorates the king who founded Hungary 1,000 years ago. ""It would be unbecoming to celebrate with fireworks in a situation where tens of thousands are working on the dams,"" Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy said after the meeting. Szodliget, a village 30 kilometres north of Budapest, road posts barely stuck out above the muddy floodwater. But resident Janos Koros, 43, was counting his blessings. ""On the whole, I think we have gotten off pretty lightly,"" he said. ""Compared with what I've seen of Prague and Dresden on television, this is just a tiny rain drop."" Flooding of Europe continues May 22, 2019 Flooding, thunderstorms to threaten millions across central and eastern Europe into midweek By Eric Leister, AccuWeather senior meteorologist  NEXT UP Hail, hail as far as the eye can see A slow-moving storm system brought deadly flooding to Germany and more dangerous weather is possible across central and eastern Europe through Wednesday. Torrential downpours brought widespread rainfall of 50-100 mm (2-4 inches) to southern Germany from Monday into early Tuesday. The heavy rainfall triggered flooding and dangerous driving conditions which claimed the life of a motorist that skidded off a roadway in Bavaria. Several roadways were closed due to flooding throughout southern Germany from Monday into Tuesday. As the storm spins over Poland, the heaviest rainfall will shift from Germany into western Poland into Wednesday. Rainfall will taper off during the day across southern and eastern Germany. ""Some roadways may be closed due to flooding,"" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Tyler Roys. ""When you see a flooded roadway, always turn around."" Farther east, thunderstorms will be a threat from eastern Poland and the Baltic states to the Balkan Peninsula and Ukraine on Wednesday. https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/flooding-thunderstorms-to-threaten-millions-across-central-and-eastern-europe-into-midweek/70008318 Cars make their way through a flooded road near Marquartstein, Germany, Tuesday, May 21, 2019. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) A few locations from Ukraine to the Baltic states will endure severe thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon and evening. These storms will be capable of producing blinding downpours, localized flash flooding and damaging winds. ""There will also be a risk for thunderstorms capable of producing damaging hail in Poland on Wednesday,"" added Roys. UK Floods, Worst Flooding Since 2007, Extreme Weather Global Weirding?

Tuesday saw torrential rain and thunderstorms lash the country – with the worst hit areas in the southeast suffering power cuts and severe flooding. Today, the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning, with thunderstorms forecast to linger until later this evening around many of the same areas. The flood-hit community of Wainfleet in Lincolnshire is within the Met Office’s warning area, but forecasters are optimistic the town will escape the worst of today’s storms. Meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “A few showers are possible there, but it doesn’t look like it’s going to bear the brunt of the heavy downpours.” 00:03 / 00:30 UK weather: Flooding after month's worth of rainfall in 24 hours Show all 13     The town has already seen around 225 Olympic-sized swimming pools’ worth of water pumped out to sea following severe flooding last week. Around 350 tonnes of sand and ballast were dropped in the area by RAF Chinook helicopters over the weekend.

The Met Office said the deluge in the village, which lies between Maidstone and Ashford, came between 11pm on Tuesday and midnight. Images and video on social media captured spectacular lightning in the skies over the region, while Kent Police’s Roads Policing Unit tweeted that the lightning was “very active”. Eastbourne in East Sussex is said to have seen about 1,000 lightning strikes in an hour.

The rest of England and Wales could see a damp start, before things brighten up later in the day. The weekend is also set to bring some respite from the recent downpours, with temperatures rising to as high as 23C (73F). Additional reporting by Press Association Climate change hoax COLLAPSES as new science finds human activity has virtually zero impact on global temperatures 07/12/2019 / By Mike Adams The climate change hoax has collapsed. A devastating series of research papers has just been published, revealing that human activity can account for no more than a .01°C rise in global temperatures, meaning that all the human activity targeted by radical climate change alarmists — combustion engines, airplane flights, diesel tractors — has virtually no measurable impact on the temperature of the planet. Finnish scientists spearheaded the research, releasing a paper entitled, “No Experimental Evidence for the Significant Anthropogenic Climate Change.” The paper explains that IPCC analysis of global temperatures suffers from a glaring error — namely, failure to account for “influences of low cloud cover” and how it impacts global temperatures. Natural variations in low cloud cover, which are strongly influenced by cosmic radiation’s ability to penetrate Earth’s atmosphere due to variations in the strength of our planet’s magnetosphere, account for nearly all changes in global temperature, the researchers explain. As this chart reveals, more cloud cover is inversely related to temperature. In other words, clouds shield the surface of the Earth from the sun, providing shade cover cooling, while a lack of clouds results in more warming: Cloud cover accounts for the real changes in global temperatures This is further supported by researchers at Kobe University in Japan who published a nearly simultaneous paper that reveals how changes in our planet’s magnetic field govern the intensity of solar radiation that reaches the lower atmosphere, causing cloud formation that alters global temperatures. That study, published in Nature, is called, “Intensified East Asian winter monsoon during the last geomagnetic reversal transition.” It states: Records of suborbital-scale climate variation during the last glacial and Holocene periods can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of rapid climate changes… At least one event was associated with a decrease in the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field. Thus, climate records from the MIS 19 interglacial can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of a variety of climate changes, including testing the effect of changes in geomagnetic dipole field strength on climate through galactic cosmic ray (GCR)-induced cloud formation… In effect, cosmic rays which are normally deflected via the magnetosphere are, in times of weak or changing magnetic fields emanating from Earth itself, able to penetrate further into Earth’s atmosphere, causing the formation of low-level clouds which cover the land in a kind of “umbrella effect” that shades the land from the sun, allowing cooling to take place. But a lack of clouds makes the surface hotter, as would be expected. This natural phenomenon is now documented to be the primary driver of global temperatures and climate, not human activity. Climate change hoax COLLAPSES as new science finds human activity has virtually zero impact on global temperatures NB GREENHOUSE GASES ARE NOT MAKING THE CLIMATE HOTTER AS THE THEORY IS FALSE. MANY STUDIES DEMOLISH THE RADICAL GHG HYPOTHESIS. The Refutation of the Climate Greenhouse Theory and a Proposal for a Hopeful Alternative Thomas Allmendinger* Glattbrugg/Zürich, Switzerland *Corresponding author: Thomas Allmendinger, CH-8152 Glattbrugg/Zürich, Switzerland, Tel: +41 44 810 17 33; E mail: inventor@sunrise.ch Received March 14, 2017; Accepted April 12, 2017; Published April 18, 2017 Citation: Thomas Allmendinger (2017) The Refutation of the Climate Greenhouse Theory and a Proposal for a Hopeful Alternative. Environment Pollution Climate Change 1: 123.  ‘Environment Pollution and Climate Change’ is an international, open access research journal that convers several problems, associated risks, remediation methods and techniques pertaining to air, water, soil, noise, thermal, radioactive and light pollutions and climate change. This peer reviewed journal reports original and novel research observations in regard to environmental pollution and climate change thereby contributing to the new knowledge addition in the field.  Abstract In view of the global acceptance and the political relevance of the climate greenhouse theory–or rather philosophy- it appeared necessary to deliver a synoptic presentation enabling a detailed exemplary refutation. It focuses the foundations of the theory assuming that a theory cannot be correct when its foundations are not correct. Thus, above all, a critical historical review is made. As a spin-off of this study, the Lambert-Beer law is questioned suggesting an alternative approach. Moreover, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is relativized revealing the different characters of the two temperature terms. But in particular, the author’s recently published own work is quoted revealing novel measurement methods and yielding several crucial arguments, while finally an empiric proof is presented. The cardinal error in the usual greenhouse theory consists in the assumption that photometric or spectroscopic IR-measurements allow conclusions about the thermal behaviour of gases, i.e., of the atmosphere. They trace back to John Tyndall who developed such a photometric method already in the 19th century. However, direct thermal measurement methods have never been applied so far. Apart from this, at least twenty crucial errors are revealed which suggest abandoning the theory as a whole. In spite of its obvious deficiencies, this theory has so far been an obstacle to take promising precautions for mitigating the climate change. They would consist in a general brightening of the Earth surface, and in additional measures being related to this. However, the novel effects which were found by the author, particularly the absorption of incident solar-light by the atmosphere as well as its absorption capability of thermal radiation, cannot be influenced by human acts. But their discovery may contribute to a better understanding of the atmospheric processes. Summary and Conclusion In fact, it would be feasible to refute the climate greenhouse theory already by some simple arguments: The fact, that the atmospheric carbon-dioxide has increased while the average global temperature has increased, too, does not at all reveal a causal relationship but solely an analogous one. Moreover, a greenhouse needs a solid transparent roof which is absent in the case of the atmosphere. And finally, it seems unlikely that the extremely low carbon-dioxide concentration of 0.04 percent is able to co-warm the entire atmosphere to a perceptible extent. (Heat power 37.1 W, initial temperature 23.5°, pressure ca. 1032 hPa, humidity 45-55%) Figure 35: Limiting temperatures for different gases at different positions, average values of two measurements. However, these arguments are not taken seriously. This theory appears to be well-founded and untouchable. It is accepted by thousands of scientists, and numerous professional publications exist which guarantee the correctness of this theory. It cannot be that it is false. But the present treatise reveals yes, it can! It is hard to believe: But at least twenty objections could be alleged to question and refute the climate greenhouse theory, which may be characterized as a huge accumulation of theoretic constructs being opposed to a poor empiric foundation. Its main deficiency consists in the never verified assumption that within a gas the absorbed thermal radiation would entirely be transformed into heat. Further common misconceptions arise from the concept that the whole atmosphere is responsible for the Earth temperature, instead of its lowest layer being relevant for our perception of climate, and from the negligence of the boundary processes between Earth’s surface and atmosphere, in particular regarding the colour-dependent temperature of the surface material. Finally, the assumption is abstruse that the atmosphere behaves as a black body. Besides, and as a spin-off of this study, the Lambert-Beer law was questioned suggesting an alternative approach. Furthermore, and in particular, the Stefan-Boltzmann relation was relativized revealing the different characters of the two temperature terms. But this treatise is not confined to a mere critique. It rather presents a variety of recently published results which are based on novel thermal measuring methods using simple but adequate materials, and being consistent with basic physical laws. In any case, limiting temperatures were reached. Firstly, the solar reflective characterization of solid opaque materials is considered, delivering a direct measuring method for the solar reflection coefficient. Moreover, the cooling-down behaviour of solid bodies is studied. Secondly, the discovery of the near-infrared absorption by gases is reported which is relevant for the incident solar radiation. Surprisingly, and contrary to any former knowledge, any gas is warmed up, while the difference between air and pure carbon- dioxide is minor-that which delivers the first empirical evidence that «greenhouse gases» do not exist. The second and definite evidence is delivered by the here first mentioned warming-up experiments of air and of pure carbon-dioxide in the presence of thermal radiation, which even revealed a temperature reduction by carbon-dioxide, apart from the fact that the carbon-dioxide content of the air is so low that it can be neglected. As a consequence, it is absolutely certain that the atmospheric temperature is not at all influenced by trace gases such as carbon- dioxide. On the contrary, the Earth surface represents the governing factor affecting the climate considerably, in particular due to its colouring. Hence this entails the only option to influence the climate by taking human measures while the radiative behaviour of the atmosphere cannot be influenced. They would consist in a general brightening of the Earth surface, and in additional measures being related to this. However, so far any really effective measures have been impeded. This passivity is favoured by ever subordinating such measures to the greenhouse proclamation. A typical example for this is given in [47], while its abatement by alleging a global model computation using the greenhouse assumption, as delivered in [48], is even more destructive. Thus, it is high time to realize that each day on which the climate greenhouse theory is maintained, in spite of its here alleged refutation, and hindering any appropriate and effective measures at the Earth surface–particularly in cities, is a lost day. Perhaps it will be one lost day too many... https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-refutation-of-the-climate-greenhouse-theory-and-a-proposal-for-ahopeful-alternative.pdf GERMAN CLIMATE RESEARCH PAPER Falsification Of The Atmospheric CO2 Greenhouse Effects Within The Frame Of Physics  Gerhard Gerlich, Ralf D. Tscheuschner (Submitted on 8 Jul 2007 (v1), last revised 4 Mar 2009 (this version, v4)) The atmospheric greenhouse effect, an idea that many authors trace back to the traditional works of Fourier (1824), Tyndall (1861), and Arrhenius (1896), and which is still supported in global climatology, essentially describes a fictitious mechanism, [Emphasis added] in which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat pump driven by an environment that is radiatively interacting with but radiatively equilibrated to the atmospheric system. According to the second law of thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist. Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature it is taken for granted that such mechanism is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation. In this paper the popular conjecture is analyzed, and the underlying physical principles are clarified. By showing that (a) there are no common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass houses and the fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects, (b) there are no calculations to determine an average surface temperature of a planet, (c) the frequently mentioned difference of 33 degrees Celsius is a meaningless number calculated wrongly, (d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately, (e) the assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical, (f) thermal conductivity and friction must not be set to zero, the atmospheric greenhouse conjecture is falsified. 115 pages, 32 figures, 13 tables (some typos corrected) Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (http://physics.ao-ph) Journal reference: Int.J.Mod.Phys.B23:275-364,2009 DOI: 10.1142/S021797920904984X Cite as: arXiv:0707.1161 [http://physics.ao-ph] (or arXiv:0707.1161v4 [http://physics.ao-ph] for this version) PEER REVIEW Izvestiya, Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics is a peer reviewed journal.

See the detailed analysis of why china is proving he is the real superpower in 2020. ——————————————————————————————————— Why China Is Proving He Is The Actual Superpower After Corona Pandemic ——————————————————————————-————————— Spain is one of the countries worst affected by the Coronavirus. He is in dire need of medical resources and equipment. Especially in those areas of Spain where the cases of infection of COVID-19 have been the most. But, Spain’s efforts to mobilize these essential medical resources came in the way of its stand against the Turkish government. As a result, the Turkish government took over the ships laden with the consignments of hundreds of ventilators that Spain’s three health trusts had purchased. The Spanish media, quoting his government, termed this Turkish act as ‘theft’.  After nearly a week of the pullout, Spain finally managed to get the ship loaded with its medical equipment from the grip of Turkey. But, this incident is another example of how the coronavirus is giving rise to diplomatic tension in all parts of the world. Diplomatic Tention Around The World Between Countries Due To Coronavirus It is true that the diplomatic rhetoric between the US and China over the Coronavirus is being given more attention around the world. Especially when US President Donald Trump accused the World Health Organization of running at the behest of China and the US is now considering stopping the funds being given to the World Health Organization.  But, this is not the only example of diplomatic tension due to Coronavirus. Even though China is facing allegations that it has concealed the number of coronavirus patients, it is not necessary that every diplomatic conflict related to COVID-19 is related to China. Sophia Gaston of the London School of Economics’s Institute of Global Affairs told the BBC, “At the time of this pandemic, countries were expected to cooperate with each other as a common challenge, so as to counter the crisis.” It is happening that all the countries are giving preference to their personal interests and instead of cooperation they are competing with each other. “ One example of this is the rift in the unity of European countries. When the incidence of Covid-19 infection increased rapidly in Italy, Italy appealed to its neighbors to help them in providing medical resources. However, Italy’s two big neighbors Germany and France banned the export of such products from their own country. “Of course these are not auspicious signs for European unity,” wrote Mauricio Masari, Italy’s ambassador to Brussels, the European Union’s headquarters, on a website called Politico. The people of Italy are unhappy with another German act. A proposal came that a fund should be raised by raising funds to help the countries most affected by the coronavirus epidemic. However, Germany joined the countries opposing it. Apart from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Finland also openly opposed this proposal to raise funds to help Covid-19 affected countries. Whereas, Spain, France, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Slovenia, and Luxembourg supported the proposal. China’s Mask Diplomacy Italy is also an example to understand the ‘mask diplomacy’ of China. After stopping the outbreak of the coronavirus within its borders, now China is providing resources to many countries, which can prove to be helpful in stopping the outbreak of the virus. Russia is also getting such help from China. Similarly, China has also provided medical equipment and testing kits to Italy. Simultaneously, China has also sent a team of its doctors to Italy, who is being seen as heroes in Italy. The #grazieCina or thank you China hashtag has been trending for a long time on Italy’s social media.  By shipping medical supplies to European countries, China is seeking to boost its image as a responsible global leader Gesu Antonio Baez is the executive director of a consultancy firm named Pax Tecum. The London-based company provides services related to diplomatic and international development issues. Baez says that China today is making a sly attempt to fill the diplomatic space vacated by the US during this global crisis. This situation has worsened because US President Donald Trump has been following the policy of ‘America First’ since coming to power in 2016. Anyway, the attitude of America does not appear to be of cooperation with anyone. In addition to the tussle with China, the Trump government annoyed old ally Germany when they tried to gain the privileges of the COVID-19 vaccine being developed by a German pharmaceutical company. Recently, the US President also warned India that if it does not lift the ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug, the US will also reverse India. Because hydroxychloroquine is also being tested for the treatment of COVID-19. Says Baez, “America has not interfered as a diplomatic superpower during this global epidemic crisis. And that is why China has the opportunity to fill America’s vacant position in world diplomacy.” However, the road to China’s ‘mask diplomacy’ is not so easy. One example of this is Brazil. Most countries of the world generally believe that China has failed to stop the outbreak of this new coronavirus in the right way at the right time. Sofia Gaston says that because of this, there is also resentment towards China in many countries. Quarrel in China and Brazil on Social Media Sophia Gaston cites an American intelligence report that China is hiding cases of Covid-19 infection in itself. British officials have also questioned the number of cases of coronavirus infection in China.  Sophia Gaston says, “At the time China’s COVID-19 figures are being questioned, at that time China’s propaganda system is campaigning to improve the image of our country. Just like we in China, the actual figures of Covid-19 are Will know about, in the same way, resentment towards China will increase in the world. “ Brazil has also questioned the Chinese way of dealing with the Coronavirus. Ever since this epidemic has spread, there has been a lot of conflict between Brazil and China. Once the situation had reached such a level that the close officials of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Chinese diplomatic officials were openly accusing each other on social media. Its most recent incident came to light when Brazilian education minister Abraham Weintraub tweeted. Chinese officials were so angry with Abraham’s tweet that he dismissed it as racist. The Chinese embassy in Brazil tweeted, “Such statements are ridiculous and condemnable because they contain a racist view.”  China is Brazil’s largest trading partner. It can be understood that China is buying 80 percent of Brazil’s soy. However, Brazilian officials were struggling to obtain ventilators and other health equipment from China. During this time, the tweet of Education Minister Abraham Weintraub came. Which added to the already ongoing tension. Baez says, “It is clear from such examples that today the world needs diplomatic efforts more than ever. All countries need to communicate and eliminate the fear of each other.” The tweet tweeted by the Chinese Embassy in Brazil in Portuguese meant that “such statements are ridiculous and condemnable. The racist thinking in them is palpable.” However, the outbreak of this virus has further ignited the ongoing diplomatic struggle. Such as between Colombia and Venezuela, the two neighboring countries of Latin America. The government of Colombia does not recognize the government of Nicolas Maduro, the President of Venezuela. Tensions are also increasing over the large number of migrants moving from Venezuela to Colombia.  A recent example of the tension between the two countries came to light on April 1, when Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro proposed to give Colombian President Ivan Duque two testing machines of the Covid-19. Earlier, there were reports in the media that the only machine to test in Colombia was damaged. Nevertheless, the President of Colombia did not respond to Venezuela’s proposal. This made Venezuela. Vice President Delsey Rodriguez became very angry. Delci tweeted, “The government of Ivan Duque has turned down President Maduro’s proposal to give two testing machines. This is another example of the Colombian president’s behavior that he is looking for the life and health of the Colombian people. Don’t matter. “ In an interview to a radio channel on April 7, Colombian President Evan Duque said that “the machines that Venezuela was offering to us did not match the chemical and other resources available to us.” Talking about the Middle East, between Qatar and Egypt, there was an escalation of the future of the Egyptian citizens trapped in Qatar. Qatar currently has the highest number of coronavirus patients in Middle-East countries. Qatar officials told the Al Jazeera channel that the Egyptian government had rejected their proposal in which Qatar had proposed to send Egyptian civilians trapped in a special aircraft to their country. Egypt is one of the Arab countries that have severed all diplomatic relations with Qatar since 2017. These countries have accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations. Apart from masks and lockdowns, there are many issues of debate- There is no tension between many countries of the world only over masks and lockdowns. On 18 March, a European Union report leaked to the media that media institutions operating under the influence of Russia are campaigning to spoil the image of Western countries with the Covid-19 virus. A spokesman for the Russian government called the allegations baseless. If the conflict between all the countries of the world is increasing, then there are many reports praising the mutual harmony between some countries during the epidemic.  Mutual harmony between some countries during the epidemic.The researcher of the think tank named Overseas Development Institute, Analisa Prison, says that the crisis of the epidemic has also opened up new opportunities for mutual cooperation between countries. She says, “One thing is proving from this crisis that developed countries are not always right. They are not experts in every issue.” “The way China has helped Italy with its experience of preventing the outbreak of the virus is another example of this,” says Annalisa. However, Sophia Gaston still believes that more cooperation is needed to deal with this epidemic among all the countries of the world. She says, “So far all countries are missing opportunities to increase mutual cooperation. Especially in Western countries, this is happening under pressure from nationalism and democratic movements. While it is time to show the power of cooperation. But, its policies are being made in a place that is further deteriorating the already tense relationship of many countries. “. Please do like.

They’ve peddled the myth since lawn tennis took off in the 20th Century; and the peddling spiked through the 1970s and 1980s, the era of the 5 legendary lefties:  Rodney Laver, Martina Navratilova, Jimmy Connors, Guillermo Vilas, and John McEnroe. Currently, the myth has entered social media through the idle chatter of those casual fans who have a tendency to favor Roger Federer over the lefty Rafael Nadal. These casual fans bought the peddled myth at face value, and then used it to oversimplify the Spaniard’s success over Federer down to a phrase that is meant to sound nuanced and sensible, but is really just simplistic and underinformed: “The Match-up Problem.”[1] The way they talk about it, one could be forgiven for thinking it was a real-life version of a cheatcode that the Spaniard was given by his coach-uncle (in picture), because he is otherwise “too brawny” to win matches using anything resembling talent or intelligence.*  The way they talk about it, Federer should be absolved from all the backhand peccadilloes, slow-court inadequacies, and psychological weaknesses he exhibited when he came up against this “mindless brute,” because the mindless brute had had his left arm imbued with righty-hypnotizing magic by his coach and other consulting witch-doctors on his pagan island in the Balearic. The Match-Up Problem, and its complimentary myth, the Righty-Hypnotizing Technique, will continue to plague tennis long after the Federer-Nadal rivalry, and as long as the majority of the tennis-playing population remain right-handed. This is because most right-handed losers will perpetuate these myths to excuse losses to left-handed winners, rather than own up to their own inferiority or the lefty’s superiority (not that Federer does this; it’s his (mostly righty) fans that make the excuses).  This majoritarian process isn’t just restricted to tennis. History will continue to be the sound of other anti-minority myths like the one in this context → the majority will continue to denigrate the minority for anomalous (they imply underhanded) traits, cry bloody murder about it, and get away with it because they own the sonocracy. Examples: the crap you hear about immigrant minorities, LGBTQ people, and any misfit.Semantic examples: We’ve gotten the the word ‘sinister’ from the Latin word for ‘left’, and the word ‘left’ from the Old English word for ‘useless’. We've progressed through history superstitiously thinking lefties were demons or morons.There are two technical bases to tennis’ version of the anti-minority myth: (1) Lefty’s forehand to righty’s backhand: Righties argue that cross-court forehands hit by lefties are exploiting their weaker wing — the backhand — and that this is an unfair “built-in” advantage.  This is based on the notion that the backhand is the weaker wing of the average tennis player. The notion might have been truer until the 1980s, when the two-handed backhand was scarcely used, and most players used a single-handed backhand that they found slightly unwieldy for balls that bounced too high too fast, above shoulder-height. And it still might be true in the modern two-handed game, though there will always be exceptional cases, like Andy Murray, whose two-handed backhands are arguably stronger than his forehands.  But the obvious problem with their argument is that they, the righties, can exploit the mirrored exchange — their stronger forehands to the weaker lefty backhands. And therein lies the rub. (2) Lefty serve wide from Ad side, to righty’s backhand: Many a time, when a lefty serves wide from the Ad side (i.e. from left to his right), he is using his left-handed slice and spin to get the ball to always curve away from the righty’s backhand, far from that righty’s preferred striking zone.   In doing this, he is getting two advantages He’s forcing the righty to hit from his weaker wing.He’s forcing the righty to hit the backhand from wide off the tramlines and far from his core, decreasing the chances of him getting a deep, powerful return in.Further, tennis’ side-changing system forces the lefty to serve from the Ad side at any even-numbered point (2nd point: 0-15, 15-0; 4th point: 15-30, 30-15; 6th point: 30-40, 40-30; 8th+ point: Ad). The righties allege that the lefties are getting “more important” gamepoints (40-30, Ad) and breakpoints (30-40, Ad) on which to hit this Ad serve. The obvious flaw in this argument is, again, the mirrored exchange: the righty can do the same while serving from the Deuce side, to the lefty’s weaker backhand, as illustrated in this video by Youtube user, Daily Tennis Lesson.  And even though he is doing this at all odd-numbered points (1st point: 0–0; 3rd point: 15-15, 30-0, 0-30; 5th point: 30-30, 15-40, 40-15; 7th point: 40-40), he secretly knows they are just as important as breakpoints or gamepoints. In fact, at any one moment in time, the current point is the most important point you are playing, a playing philosophy Rafa has immortalised among current tennis fans. In criticizing these points as “less important”, righties are suffering from, what I call, chronological hypermetropia: looking too far into the future for catastrophe/salvation, and not concentrating on the present.They're also forgetting that they will have 3 lucky Deuce serves before reaching the same game/break point.In tennis, the only way to plan for the future is to plan for the present. This serving advantage to get ahead is, therefore, equal, and there to be taken by both the lefty and righty servers. Both players, as returners, can also predict a wide serve to their weaker backhands and run around the backhand to get a stronger forehand return in, as illustrated in this graphic from the New York Times, where Federer has the option of the forehand inside-out and inside-in, off Nadal’s slightly-off wide serve from the Ad court, because he expected Nadal to hit there.  (Nadal famously served one down the T, instead, on a pressure point in the fifth set of the 2008 Wimbledon final, to screw with Federer’s expectations) These cases show that, in real time, there is no such thing as a built-in advantage. You make your own advantages via split-second decisions based on your opponent’s own decisions, which is guesswork unless you know his “tell” — as Andre Agassi allegedly did, for Boris Becker and his tongue[2] — or his fall-back-on tendencies, as Federer and Nadal know, of each other.  The other point that righties make, one more psychological than technical, is that they are “less used to” lefties, while lefties are more used to them. This argument, while on the surface correct, has a deeper flaw that invalidates any lazy excuse they may want to concoct: They’re playing modern tennis with prepatory time, not fighting to the death in ancient Rome or in their favorite high-fantasy series. Their opponent is a known entity.These righties know that they’re going to play a lefty tomorrow, or day after tomorrow.Federer knows he is going to play Nadal a few days before their match.Modern tennis is not like those gladiator-themed movies, where young Federer would be captured by a band of slavers, a rudimentary wooden stake and a dirty loincloth shoved into his hands, and suddenly pushed beyond a curtain, into a bloody arena.  Modern tennis is not like the continuation of that movie where, from behind a curtain on the other side of the arena, to the sound of snare drums, a gigantic, muscular bull fitted in resplendent Shardplate and an iron-horned helm, primed for goring men to death, will come to do battle with little, loinclothed Federer—who has no idea how to counter it, no tools of note, and, just a few seconds ago, didn’t even know that such a nightmare existed!  No, unlike the situation on top, Federer is given unbiased conditions to fight his lefty opponent. Federer is given time to make a tactical plan around his lefty opponent, with video evidence of that lefty’s favorite patterns, and scores of lefty hitting partners who would jump at the opportunity to play with the Swiss tennis superstar.You are given time to make a tactical plan around your lefty opponent, as well.If you have a modicum of common sense, you will already know the information I have written in my answer without reading it, because it is fairly obvious to someone who has played tennis for a while, and you can form a plan with that information to beat that lefty. It doesn’t even matter if you have never played a lefty before; what matters, if you research him in that prep time given to you, is his weaknesses—and they will be as exploitable as yours; he is only human. Most professional tennis players like Federer, however, will have already competed professionally against lefties before meeting a lefty that particularly troubles them, so will have already got a “feel” for the instinctive patterns of play, in the rare cases that he doesn't find a lefty hitting partner. And Federer had no problem defeating the other top left-handers of the 21st Century. He’s won 42 of 44 matches against Verdasco, Lopez, Mannarino, Ramos-Vinolas, Melzer, Muller, Llodra, and M. Zverev. Nadal defeated Federer not because of the lefty element of surprise (they've played close to 40 times; what's left to be surprised of?), but because Nadal’s level of play was almost on the level of a full-powered bull with armor-plating, one that even sword-wielding opponents couldn't help but go slack-jawed at, finally getting gored through their ...  Unlike those other lefties, Nadal’s backhand and forehand were both strong due to him working hard towards mixed-handedness after switching from a two-hand forehand at the age 11. And his tireless footwork, at the deeper court position from where he hit those forehands and backhands from, made it almost impossible to hit through him or force him to a cheaper reply. He played a brand of the sport that few ever dared and even fewer had the discipline to keep at for long hours. It was brinkmanship that usually fizzled out at the end of the 10-month season, but never the end of a 5-hour match. No one had ever imagined a player like Nadal before. His success wasn’t down to the element of surprise or any alleged “built in” advantage as much as the aforementioned two aspects of his mixed-handedness and footwork, and the hard work he put into his own anomalous forehand, as left-handed legend Martina Navratilova once noted: Nadal is not unusual because he’s a lefty. He’s unusual because of how he hits the ball.[3] And as did some others: [Nadal’s forehand], the heaviest topspin forehand in the game, is generally placed wide and high to the backhand of a right-handed opponent, like Federer. The dizzying topspin doesn't give Federer a lot of options, often eating him up and causing him to mishit, or shank the ball.[4] It was because of these three factors that in their matches, he outplayed Federer on every aspect of tennis except the serve and volley. As it was in the case of Federer, but not his fans so much, it would be more honest to compliment your lefty opponent, and acknowledge that he played better than you, than make up a myth that is so easily busted.  But let’s take a look at one of the more legendary stretches of the Federer-Nadal rivalry: the 14-minute tiebreaker in the fourth set of the 2008 Wimbledon final, to analyse the patterns of play that favour Nadal, and the ones that favour Federer, and how they were acted out. [Warning: In-depth analysis suitable only for nerds, hard-lining aficionados, and technical analysts]  Mind you, they were playing on grass, which is Nadal’s worst surface, due to: Its slippery nature denying Nadal the sure footing he usually has on clay and hardcourts, for his harder running style.The ball getting cushioned on the grass and bouncing lower off his heavy top-spun forehand ball (he’d prefer if it bounced higher to trouble the opponents), which can still go quite high due to the extra kick he generates off that heterodox, lasso-whip technique.This 18-point breakdown is going to showcase how Nadal troubles Federer with his patterns and vice versa, with both having no built-in advantages, except the ones they create with their own talent, grit, and intelligence. 0–0[Time in video — 0:00-11]Nadal serves hard down the T, from the Deuce side, to Federer’s backhand, as he usually does.Federer lunges, and makes one of his famous short slice returns. Note this short slice return by Federer, as it will become important in another latter point. These short slice returns usually, and not always, just skim over the net, bounce low on the grass, and force the opponent off the baseline and into the forecourt, into the uncomfortable position of hitting a low ball that provides no possible angle to hit a powerful reply. Usually these short slices don’t trouble Nadal as much as they trouble other opponents, because the Spaniard is double-quick on his feet to set up forehands even from their low bounce. Also, his ruthless forehand topspin technique takes the ball up over the net, and swerves it down with the Magnus effect, just before it reaches the baseline.But Federer’s short slice return is so close to the net this time, that Nadal can’t reach it as fast as he’d like, to put as much speed and spin into it, and he can only tamely hook it to Federer’s backhand side.Federer takes a huge swing with a backhand, straight down the middle at Nadal’s body, denying him any reaction time.Nadal reflexively volleys from the forehand side, but without much time or control, given the power of Federer’s shot. Somehow the volley stays in.Federer reaches it quickly and hooks a lob over Nadal’s head to keep his advantage, but it isn’t as high as he’d like and Nadal uses the backhand smash cross-court.It bounces too shallow, and Federer is able to reach it and hit an easy winner down the line.Analysis: Cracker of an opening point. Federer, at the end of his backhand range, neutralized a good serve by Nadal, showing us that he has a low-percentage chance to stifle Nadal’s follow-up shot (usually the forehand). However, if that short slice return went any deeper, Nadal would find an easy angle for his forehand, and effectively finish the point in the next two shots.1–0[Time in video — 0:51-58]Federer second serves from the Ad side, a deep kick serve, above Nadal’s left shoulder, i.e. the Spaniard’s forehand side.However, Nadal’s deeper returning position gives him more reaction time, and he shuffles to his right, and takes a swing. He utilizes his strength and timing to muscle-topspin the ball, deep into Federer’s backhand corner.Federer has no option but to weakly dink-slice it back, and it falls lamely in the middle of the court. And this time Nadal is easily able to reach it and punish Federer with an off-forehand winner.Analysis: This is another brilliant point that showcases the service-returning prowess of both players, especially the advantages of Nadal’s oft-criticized deeper returning position. That kick serve was good enough to stifle most players, but Nadal was well-placed and strong enough to hook the ball exactly where he wanted it go, deep to Federer’s weaker wing.1–1[Time in video — 1:27-36]Federer second serves from the Deuce side (his lucky side, if he wants a wide slice serve to Nadal’s “weaker” backhand) to Nadal’s forehand.Nadal hooks it back, but it isn’t so deep, and falls slightly beyond mid-court.Federer hits a powerful forehand straight to Nadal, trying to cramp him, but, once again, Nadal’s deeper court position gives him a little more time to hit a mid-court backhand, with him still on the defence.Federer continues in offence, and this time tests Nadal’s forehand, which is rumored to be his weaker defensive wing because of his heterodox technique, grip, and it being his non-dominant hand. Nadal, however, sponges the pressure, and hits one more mid-court ball back at Federer, giving him another shot at finishing the point.Federer goes to Nadal’s backhand this time, but aims too close to the lines, and hits it wide.Analysis: So why did Federer avoid the wide-Deuce-serve-to-lefty’s-backhand advantage and serve to Nadal’s forehand instead? He probably did this to surprise Nadal; he doesn’t want Nadal predicting his patterns, and expecting a wide slice serve. He probably wants to save that wide serve for an important point (But there is another possible reason, which I will come to, later, in my analysis of the 7th point of this tiebreak). This 3rd point showcases the desperation of both players — of Federer in offence, and Nadal in defence. Nadal is always losing the point, but is so desperate to keep himself in it, and Federer in doubt, that he doesn’t seem to mind if he’s providing easy mid-court balls for Federer. Federer is always winning this point, but not quite because of Nadal’s desperation, and is desperate to hit the ball as fast and hard as he can, so he can make the most of his advantage. It is his downfall, as he hits too close to the lines, considering Nadal’s speed and strength.2–1[Time in video — 2:11-15]Nadal serves from the Ad side, his lucky side, if he is to take a slice serve to Federer’s backhand.He does just that. It is a perfect slice serve. It goes deep into the corner of the service, and curves away from Federer always, and the Swiss cannot put his racquet on it. Ace.3–1[Time in video — 2:44-47]Nadal serves from the Deuce side.He uses the body serve this time, and it’s deep enough, possibly even clipping the paint and bouncing lower than usual, to give Federer less time to hit the ball. The ball hits Federer’s racquet and richochets down to the grass at Federer’s feet. Service winner.1–4[Time in video — 3:15-20]Federer serves from the Ad side.He hits a hard serve into Rafa’s backhand, and the Spaniard’s reply is weak, mid-court, and sits up nicely for Federer to slot in an easy-sounding inside-in forehand winner. The players change ends on the conclusion of the 6th point of the tiebreaker.2–4[Time in video — 4:05–24]Federer serves from the Deuce side.He uses the lucky pattern, to Nadal’s “weaker” backhand wing. It has decent slice — not as much as Nadal’s previous serve from the Ad side on the 5th point — and forces Nadal well wide of the tramlines.However, this is where you’d see Nadal’s dominant right-hand strength come into play. Nadal is right-handed, but he’s also mixed-handed in tennis i.e. he is able to do specialized tennis-related tasks with both hands relatively well. And, more importantly to the context, this is not a built-in trait; he evolved it with hard work all through his childhood. His left-hand is the non-dominant one, but he has evolved it to hit the heaviest forehand in the business, since the age of 11. So what do you do to a man who has evolved both his hands to such a degree? You can only mix the play and keep him guessing. Federer, in the tiebreaker, had played to Nadal’s forehand in 2 out of 3 serves before this point, testing out Nadal’s (what should be a) weaker left hand. Now he takes his chance on the right-handed backhand. But Nadal uses his strength to muscle the ball back, and it is an effective shot — it almost clips Federer’s baseline. It’s not hit with tremendous, flat speed that discomforts Federer. But it’s a deep, muscled ball that takes all possibilities of offence out of Federer, and that is very, very important with Federer chasing the tiebreak, at this point. Nadal has basically nullified the exchange that is supposed to play to Federer’s advantage, with his dominant hand. Only practice can give you this complex of strength and agility. This is not built-in.Federer hooks a top-spin forehand to Nadal, as deep as he can. He’s now playing with a vigor that wants to rush Nadal, until he gets an opening. But, of course, the momentum was lost when Nadal made that unnatural return.Nadal just hooks one top-spin forehand back, to Federer’s weaker backhand wing.Federer hits a neutral looking ball crosscourt to Nadal.Nadal doesn’t unload, and just hits it back crosscourt with even more topspin, not particularly looking for the lines or even Feerer’s backhand.Federer is able to shuffle around the backhand and hit a deeper offensive forehand to Nadal, to rush him, now, trying to force an error.Nadal just hits it back a little deeper than the mid-court, and in the middle, telling Federer telepathically, that he will not be erring this time.Federer hits a safe one, deeper than middle, not near the lines, to Nadal’s backhand.Nadal hits down the line, not urgently, to Federer’s backhand, but in such a way that Federer can run around it for another forehand.Federer hits it down the line to Nadal’s backhand, and it is safe and cautious.Nadal unloads on a backhand, and outs a little more pace, and hits it sharper crosscourt.Federer is up to it, and hits his forehand crosscourt, deep into Nadal’s backhand corner.Nadal, using that righty strength, hits the ball flatter down the line, back to Federer’s backhand side, forcing Federer to run back to his ad side.Federer, fed up and slightly nervy, finally goes for a winner targeting Nadal’s backhand, but aims too close to the lines, and the ball goes wide. Nadal exults. Federer is livid, screaming something to himself/his box. The match is now on Nadal’s serve.Analysis: This is the point that changed the tiebreak, and should have given Nadal the advantage to serve the match out in the next 4 points. And it was all built on the impetus of that backhand return, the one John McEnroe commented that only 1 in a 1000 players would have made. The other possible reason that Federer had served to Nadal’s forehand earlier, in the 3rd point, which I had mentioned above, was that he already knew the strength of Nadal’s backhand, and didn’t want to risk him doing something similar.5–2[Time in video — 5:09-30]Nadal serves from his lucky Ad side.He misses a first serve, and shows his hand: he was either aiming for Federer’s body or forehand, forgoing his wide serve for the element of surprise.Probably unsure of what to hit now, and nervy, as this point could bring up championship point, he hits down into the body/forehand, and clips the tape, hoing out. Double fault. He actually has the grace to smile ruefully.5–3 [Time in video — 6:04-11]Nadal serves into Federer backhand from the Deuce side.Federer is expecting it, this time, and hits and inside-out backhand return deep into Nadal’s baseline.This forces a shorter, floaty backhand reply from Nadal.And Federer punces and hammers a forehand cross, to Nadal’s backhand side.Nadal, with not enough time to reach the oncoming ball, tries to muscle it with his right hand but the ball is too behind him, and he can only hit into the net. It’s back on serve in the tiebreaker.4–5[Time in video — 6:40-46]Federer serves to Nadal’s weaker forehand from the Ad side.Nadal hits a return, but it falls into Federer’s strike zone in the forehand side.Federer dispatches it with a crosscourt forehand into the open court for a winner. Classic one-two punch (or “serve+1”) strategy. All square.5–5[Time in video — 7:10-12]Federer serves down the T, to Nadal’s weaker forehand.Nadal isn’t expecting it there, or was, but it being a quick serve renders him unable to reach it on time anyway.Service winner. Set point for Federer next.5–6[Time in video — 8:08-31]Nadal second serves down the T from Ad side, to Federer’s forehand.This was one of Nadal’s surprise tactics in this match. With Federer expecting Nadal to target his weaker backhand again, with a second serve wide, Nadal bravely goes down the T instead, to Federer’s forehand. Federer shuffles a little to his left, expecting to run around the backhand, and is surprised by the change-up, a split-second late in adjusting.A little late, he can only hit a mid-court forehand down the line to Nadal’s backhand.Nadal hits it back to Federer’s backhand, which cannot open the court easily, unless Federer has the mental comfort of being up a few sets.Federer uses one of his short slices crosscourt to Nadal’s forehand, and Nadal hits its deep crosscourt, back to Federer’s backhand, almost slips, and recovers back to the baseline, ready for Federer’s backhand shot.Federer notices, and attacks Nadal, who is a little too inside the baseline for his comfort, on the forehand side (a wise strategy considering Nadal’s forehand is weaker defensively on grass, if rushed). But Nadal waits for it to bounce up, and uses his muscle to topspin it back crosscourt to Federer’s backhand. He seems to tell Federer, “If you want this set, you have to win it with your weaker shot.”Federer’s next backhand is crosscourt, but safer: the ball bounces in the middle of the court, with middling depth. He seems to say, “No, if you want to stay in this set, you’ll have to hit yourself out of it with that forehand. I’m playing safe, too.” It’s a neutral ball, that Nadal obligatorily puts back into Federer’s backhand.Federer’s next backhand goes up slightly to the Ad side, but still, for the major part, in the middle of the court. It’s another neutral ball, which Nadal has the time to run around and hook another bigger forehand to … guess where? Federer’s backhand. Their little mini-battle is not going to end anytime soon.Federer parries quickly crosscourt this time. It’s deeper, making Nadal run a little more off to his Ad side.Nadal changes it up and goes hard down the line, returning the favor, by forcing Federer to do some quick sprinting.Federer reaches, and goes hard down the line back to Nadal. Their little backhand-to-forehand mini-battle is torn up. It seems they’re raising the stakes by testing both their stronger shots.But Nadal says, “Nah fam.” He goes crosscourt again, to Federer’s backhand, making Federer run again.Federer reaches the ball and hits a mid-court ball to Nadal’s backhand.Nadal hits a three-quarter ball to Federer, but to his stronger forehand side.Federer is tempted enough by that, and attempts a winner down the line, by unloading on a forehand. It goes wide. Nadal survives. All square. The players change ends.6–6[Time in video — 9:43-52]Nadal serves from Deuce side, to Federer’s forehand.Nadal surprises Federer again by going to his stronger shot, and Federer can only reflexively hit a weaker, mid-court ball again.The ball sits up for Nadal, who dispatches it crosscourt with lots of topspin, making the ball bounce really high.Federer takes the ball on the rise, on the backhand, and goes down the line to Nadal’s backhand. It’s a beautiful shot, a neobackhand before the neobackhand, and it goes deep into Nadal’s baseline.Nadal’s backhand finds a sharper angle crosscourt, but the ball bounces higher than he’d like, and Federer sees this, eager to finish the point off.He hits a topspin forehand deep on Nadal’s baseline, but it just goes long. For good measure, Nadal shows him that he had it covered with a hooked crosscourt (what would have been a) winner deep into Federer’s backhand corner. Championship point 1.6–7[Time in video — 10:23-25]Federer serves to Nadal’s forehand, from Ad side.Perhaps, that it goes to his forehand surprises Nadal. But even if it had gone to his backhand wing, the serve was too flat and well-placed (on the line!) for Nadal to have done anything with it. Nadal can only get his frame on it, and the ball falls to the ground. Service winner. All square again.7–7Legendary point alert[Time in video — 11:00-09]Federer second serves to Nadal’s body/backhand, from Deuce side. He goes on the body after showing his card on the first serve, where he went down the T, to Nadal’s forehand again.Nadal is deep enough to have time to hit the serve on his backhand. I’m not sure if it was an intentional body serve meant to cramp Nadal, or just push him back with the kick, but it is partially effective, as Nadal can only push it back deep, without pace, to Federer’s backhand side.The ball is slow enough that Federer can run around it and hit a big forehand inside-in, to Nadal’s backhand.Nadal parries crosscourt, but his shot is only mid-court, and sits up high enough for Federer to have an easy putaway.Federer doesn’t go for the putaway and plays the percentages, hitting an approach forehand deep down the line, coming into the net, forcing Nadal to run from all the way from his backhand side, and covering the easier crosscourt angle that Nadal can produce.Nadal covers the ground quickly, and produces one of the shots of the match, a forehand, the ball squeezing itself in that tiny window between Federer’s position at the net where he expected the crosscourt ball, and the line. Everyone gasps. Championship point 2.8–7Legendary point alert 2[Time in video — 11:56-12:02]Nadal serves to Federer’s backhand, from the lucky Ad side.Even though it is a brilliant serve that exploits the angle, this time Federer is expecting it, and he hits his second short slice return of the tiebreak (the other one being the 1st point), crosscourt, which bounces in the service box, but not high enough that Nadal can get an angle for an easy put-away.Nadal reaches it, and can only find himself going with the easier crosscourt angle, with Federer aware that that is what Nadal is going to do. Nadal cannot hit the ball with too much pace (or can, but he’s tight, it being a big point) and he sends it tamely to Federer’ backhand.Federer hits a backhand passing winner down the line, mirroring what had happened earlier, but with the point a lot more in Federer’s control than was apparent. All square again.8–8[Time in video — 12:41-53]Nadal predictably serves to Federer’s backhand, from the Deuce side.Federer is ready, hitting a deep backhand down the line into Nadal’s forehand corner.Nadal goes back down the line, deep, with a forehand.Federer goes crosscourt, to Nadal’s backhand.Nadal goes down the line to Federer’s backhand, but the ball is neutral enough that Federer can run around to hit a forehand.Federer hits a brilliant off-forehand deep into Nadal’s forehand corner.Nadal scrambles, but the shot is too good, and he can only hook it mid-court, to give Federer an easy put-away.Federer duly puts the ball away for a winner crosscourt. Set point 2 for Federer.9–8[Time in video — 13:33-38]Federer second serves to Nadal’s backhand, from Ad side.It’s a neutral serve, and Nadal has time on the slower second serve ball to swing away, trying his best to get it as deep as possible to hurt Federer.But the backhand sails a little long, and Federer wins the set.Bottomline: The point of writing all this, even if it was too protracted, was to show how the established patterns of play are never really established in real time, and to show Nadal’s mixed-handedness messing up any idea of him being a typical lefty. His stronger-than-usual backhand, his heterodox forehand, and his tremendous foot speed are the three main traits that caused Federer difficulty to play against, more than other lefties. These positive traits were not “built-in” for Nadal, but rather developed by Nadal on the practice courts over close to 30 years. Federer did try hitting his forehand to Nadal’s backhand, as should be the righty’s favoured pattern. But not as frequently as Nadal did to his, because he knew Nadal’s backhand was stronger than it looked. Federer also made serves to Nadal’s backhand, but after getting frustrated by Nadal’s amazing backhand return at 2–4 down, figured that targeting Nadal’s weaker defensive forehand would give him a better chance to win a point. Rather than any simplistic pattern, the two main technicalities of this, and any, match-up are: The element of surprise.Mixing the play so as to make it difficult to read.If Nadal keeps on hitting to Federer’s backhand, sensing a weakness there, then Federer will begin to expect it to go there, and figure out a way to use that to his advantage, to surprise Nadal, such as running around his backhand to hit a big forehand, or pre-emptively hitting a short slice return (16th point). If Federer keeps on hitting to Nadal’s backhand, sensing a weakness there, then Nadal will begin to expect it to go there and figure out a way to use that to his advantage, such as leaning to the backhand side so as to run around it forehand earlier than usual, or hitting a backhand with more pace and depth than usual, which Federer wasn’t expecting. That Federer knew Nadal exploited his backhand all the 10 years of their rivalry from 2004–14, and didn’t change his position, mentality, or decision-making in using that shot, can allow us to blame Federer for a naive simplicity in hoping “things would all come together one day,” rather than Nadal for exploiting that so-called “simplistic” pattern. *At 11, he switched to a lefty forehand of his own accord, and not on the coercion of his coach uncle. Previously, he was a double-double-hander. Most professional-leaning youngsters who are double-double-handers are advised to chose a forehand at that age, if not earlier, for their careers.

It echoes the verses of ancient Greek philosophers and most notably those of Plato through the voice of his hero, Socrates. Living life is about examining life through reason, nature’s greatest gift to humanity. The importance of reason in sensing and examining life is evident in all phases of life– from the infant who strains to explore its new surroundings to the grandparent who actively reads and assesses the headlines of the daily paper. Reason lets human beings participate in life, to be human is to think, appraise, and explore the world, discovering new sources of material and spiritual pleasure. 2. Worry only about the things that are in your control, the things that can be influenced and changed by your actions, not about the things that are beyond your capacity to direct or alter.This rule summarizes several important features of ancient Stoic wisdom — features that remain powerfully suggestive for modern times. Most notably the belief in an ultimately rational order operating in the universe reflecting a benign providence that ensures proper outcomes in life. Thinkers such as Epictetus did not simply prescribe “faith” as an abstract philosophical principle; they offered a concrete strategy based on intellectual and spiritual discipline. The key to resisting the hardship and discord that intrude upon every human life, is to cultivate a certain attitude toward adversity based on the critical distinction between those things we are able to control versus those which are beyond our capacity to manage. The misguided investor may not be able to recover his fortune but he can resist the tendency to engage in self-torment. The victims of a natural disaster, a major illness or an accident may not be able to recover and live their lives the way they used to, but they too can save themselves the self-torment. In other words, while we cannot control all of the outcomes we seek in life, we certainly can control our responses to these outcomes and herein lies our potential for a life that is both happy and fulfilled. 3. Treasure Friendship, the reciprocal attachment that fills the need for affiliation. Friendship cannot be acquired in the market place, but must be nurtured and treasured in relations imbued with trust and amity.According to Greek philosophy, one of the defining characteristics of humanity that distinguishes it from other forms of existence is a deeply engrained social instinct, the need for association and affiliation with others, a need for friendship. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle viewed the formation of society as a reflection of the profound need for human affiliation rather than simply a contractual arrangement between otherwise detached individuals. Gods and animals do not have this kind of need but for humans it is an indispensable aspect of the life worth living because one cannot speak of a completed human identity, or of true happiness, without the associative bonds called “friendship.” No amount of wealth, status, or power can adequately compensate for a life devoid of genuine friends. 4. Experience True Pleasure. Avoid shallow and transient pleasures. Keep your life simple. Seek calming pleasures that contribute to peace of mind. True pleasure is disciplined and restrained. In its many shapes and forms, pleasure is what every human being is after. It is the chief good of life. Yet not all pleasures are alike. Some pleasures are kinetic—shallow, and transient, fading way as soon as the act that creates the pleasure ends. Often they are succeeded by a feeling of emptiness and psychological pain and suffering. Other pleasures are catastematic—deep, and prolonged, and continue even after the act that creates them ends; and it is these pleasures that secure the well-lived life. That’s the message of the Epicurean philosophers that have been maligned and misunderstood for centuries, particularly in the modern era where their theories of the good life have been confused with doctrines advocating gross hedonism. 5. Master Yourself. Resist any external force that might delimit thought and action; stop deceiving yourself, believing only what is personally useful and convenient; complete liberty necessitates a struggle within, a battle to subdue negative psychological and spiritual forces that preclude a healthy existence; self mastery requires ruthless cador. One of the more concrete ties between ancient and modern times is the idea that personal freedom is a highly desirable state and one of life’s great blessings. Today, freedom tends to be associated, above all, with political liberty. Therefore, freedom is often perceived as a reward for political struggle, measured in terms of one’s ability to exercise individual “rights.” The ancients argued long before Sigmund Freud and the advent of modern psychology that the acquisition of genuine freedom involved a dual battle. First, a battle without, against any external force that might delimit thought and action. Second, a battle within, a struggle to subdue psychological and spiritual forces that preclude a healthy self-reliance. The ancient wisdom clearly recognized that humankind has an infinite capacity for self-deception, to believe what is personally useful and convenient at the expense of truth and reality, all with catastrophic consequences. Individual investors often deceive themselves by holding on to shady stocks, believing what they want to believe. They often end up blaming stock analysts and stockbrokers when the truth of the matter is they are the ones who eventually made the decision to buy them in the first place. Students also deceive themselves believing that they can pass a course without studying, and end up blaming their professors for their eventual failure. Patients also deceive themselves that they can be cured with convenient “alternative medicines,” which do not involve the restrictive lifestyle of conventional methods. 6. Avoid Excess. Live life in harmony and balance. Avoid excesses. Even good things, pursued or attained without moderation, can become a source of misery and suffering. This rule is echoed in the writings of ancient Greek thinkers who viewed moderation as nothing less than a solution to life’s riddle. The idea of avoiding the many opportunities for excess was a prime ingredient in a life properly lived, as summarized in Solon’s prescription “Nothing in Excess” (6 th Century B.C.). The Greeks fully grasped the high costs of passionate excess. They correctly understood that when people violate the limits of a reasonable mean, they pay penalties ranging from countervailing frustrations to utter catastrophe. It is for this reason that they prized ideals such as measure, balance, harmony, and proportion as much as they did, the parameters within which productive living can proceed. If, however, excess is allowed to destroy harmony and balance, then the life worth living becomes impossible to obtain. 7. Be a Responsible Human Being. Approach yourself with honesty and thoroughness; maintain a kind of spiritual hygiene; stop the blame-shifting for your errors and shortcomings. Be honest with yourself and be prepared to assume responsibility and accept consequences. This rule comes from Pythagoras, the famous mathematician and mystic, and has special relevance for all of us because of the common human tendency to reject responsibility for wrongdoing. Very few individuals are willing to hold themselves accountable for the errors and mishaps that inevitably occur in life. Instead, they tend to foist these situations off on others complaining of circumstances “beyond their control.” There are, of course, situations that occasionally sweep us along, against which we have little or no recourse. But the far more typical tendency is to find ourselves in dilemmas of our own creation — dilemmas for which we refuse to be held accountable. How many times does the average person say something like, “It really wasn’t my fault. If only John or Mary had acted differently then I would not have responded as I did.” Cop-outs like these are the standard reaction for most people. They reflect an infinite human capacity for rationalization, finger-pointing, and denial of responsibility. Unfortunately, this penchant for excuses and self-exemption has negative consequences. People who feed themselves a steady diet of exonerating fiction are in danger of living life in bad faith — more, they risk corrupting their very essence as a human being. 8. Don’t Be a Prosperous Fool. Prosperity by itself, is not a cure-all against an ill-led life, and may be a source of dangerous foolishness. Money is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the good life, for happiness and wisdom. Prosperity has different meanings to different people. For some, prosperity is about the accumulation of wealth in the form of money, real estate and equities. For others, prosperity is about the accumulation of power and the achievement of status that comes with appointment to business or government positions. In either case, prosperity requires wisdom: the rational use of one’s resources and in the absence of such wisdom, Aeschylus was correct to speak of prosperous fools. 9. Don’t Do Evil to Others. Evildoing is a dangerous habit, a kind of reflex too quickly resorted to and too easily justified that has a lasting and damaging effect upon the quest for the good life. Harming others claims two victims—the receiver of the harm, and the victimizer, the one who does harm. Contemporary society is filled with mixed messages when it comes to the treatment of our fellow human beings. The message of the Judaeo-Christian religious heritage, for instance, is that doing evil to others is a sin, extolling the virtues of mercy, forgiveness, charity, love, and pacifism. Yet, as we all know, in practice these inspiring ideals tend to be in very short supply. Modern society is a competitive, hard-bitten environment strongly inclined to advocate self-advantage at the expense of the “other.” Under these conditions, it is not surprising that people are often prepared to harm their fellow human beings. These activities are frequently justified by invoking premises such as “payback,” “leveling scores,” or “doing unto others, before they can do unto you.” Implicit in all of these phrases is the notion that malice towards others can be justified on either a reciprocal basis or as a pre-emptive gesture in advance of anticipated injury. What is not considered here are the effects these attempts to render evil have upon the person engaging in such attempts. Our culture has naively assumed that “getting even” is an acceptable response to wrongdoing — that one bad-turn deserves another. What we fail to understand is the psychological, emotional, and spiritual impact victimizing others has upon the victimizer. 10. Kindness towards others tends to be rewarded. Kindness to others is a good habit that supports and reinforces the quest for the good life. Helping others bestows a sense of satisfaction that has two beneficiaries—the beneficiary, the receiver of the help, and the benefactor, the one who provides the help. Many of the world’s great religions speak of an obligation to extend kindness to others. But these deeds are often advocated as an investment toward future salvation — as the admission ticket to paradise. That’s not the case for the ancient Greeks, however, who saw kindness through the lens of reason, emphasizing the positive effects acts of kindness have not just on the receiver of kindness but to the giver of kindness as well, not for the salvation of the soul in the afterlife, but in this life. Simply put, kindness tends to return to those who do kind deeds, as Aesop demonstrated in his colourful fable of a little mouse cutting the net to free the big lion. Aesop lived in the 6 th century B.C. and acquired a great reputation in antiquity for the instruction he offered in his delightful tales. Despite the passage of many centuries, Aesop’s counsels have stood the test of time because in truth, they are timeless observations on the human condition; as relevant and meaningful today as they were 2,500 years ago.

IPCC “We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.“ – Timothy Wirth Fmr President of the UN Foundation *** 46 ENLIGHTENING statements by IPCC experts against the IPCC : 1. Dr Robert Balling: The IPCC notes that “No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during the 20th century has been detected.” This did not appear in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers. 2. Dr Lucka Bogataj: “Rising levels of airborne carbon dioxide don’t cause global temperatures to rise…. temperature changed first and some 700 years later a change in aerial content of carbon dioxide followed.” 3. Dr John Christy: “Little known to the public is the fact that most of the scientists involved with the IPCC do not agree that global warming is occurring. Its findings have been consistently misrepresented and/or politicized with each succeeding report.” 4. Dr Rosa Compagnucci: “Humans have only contributed a few tenths of a degree to warming on Earth. Solar activity is a key driver of climate.” 5. Dr Richard Courtney: “The empirical evidence strongly indicates that the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis is wrong.” 6. Dr Judith Curry: “I’m not going to just spout off and endorse the IPCC because I don’t have confidence in the process.” 7. Dr Robert Davis: “Global temperatures have not been changing as state of the art climate models predicted they would. Not a single mention of satellite temperature observations appears in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers.” 8. Dr Willem de Lange: “In 1996 the IPCC listed me as one of approximately 3000 “scientists” who agreed that there was a discernible human influence on climate. I didn’t. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that runaway catastrophic climate change is due to human activities.” 9. Dr Chris de Freitas: “Government decision-makers should have heard by now that the basis for the long-standing claim that carbon dioxide is a major driver of global climate is being questioned; along with it the hitherto assumed need for costly measures to restrict carbon dioxide emissions. If they have not heard, it is because of the din of global warming hysteria that relies on the logical fallacy of ‘argument from ignorance’ and predictions of computer models.” 10. Dr Oliver Frauenfeld: “Much more progress is necessary regarding our current understanding of climate and our abilities to model it.” 11. Dr Peter Dietze: “Using a flawed eddy diffusion model, the IPCC has grossly underestimated the future oceanic carbon dioxide uptake.” 12. Dr John Everett: “It is time for a reality check. The oceans and coastal zones have been far warmer and colder than is projected in the present scenarios of climate change. I have reviewed the IPCC and more recent scientific literature and believe that there is not a problem with increased acidification, even up to the unlikely levels in the most-used IPCC scenarios.” 13. Dr Eigil Friis-Christensen: “The IPCC refused to consider the sun’s effect on the Earth’s climate as a topic worthy of investigation. The IPCC conceived its task only as investigating potential human causes of climate change.” 14. Dr Lee Gerhard: “I never fully accepted or denied the anthropogenic global warming concept until the furore started after NASA’s James Hansen’s wild claims in the late 1980s. I went to the [scientific] literature to study the basis of the claim, starting with first principles. My studies then led me to believe that the claims were false.” 15. Dr Indur Goklany: “Climate change is unlikely to be the world’s most important environmental problem of the 21st century. There is no signal in the mortality data to indicate increases in the overall frequencies or severities of extreme weather events, despite large increases in the population at risk.” 16. Dr Vincent Gray: “The [IPCC] climate change statement is an orchestrated litany of lies.” 17. Dr Mike Hulme: “Claims such as ‘2500 of the world’s leading scientists have reached a consensus that human activities are having a significant influence on the climate’ are disingenuous … The actual number of scientists who backed that claim was only a few dozen.” 18. Dr Kiminori Itoh: “There are many factors which cause climate change. Considering only greenhouse gases is nonsense and harmful.” 19. Dr Yuri Izrael: “There is no proven link between human activity and global warming. I think the panic over global warming is totally unjustified. There is no serious threat to the climate.” 20. Dr Steven Japar: “Temperature measurements show that the climate model-predicted mid-troposphere hot zone is non-existent. This is more than sufficient to invalidate global climate models and projections made with them.” 21. Dr Georg Kaser: “This number [of receding glaciers reported by the IPCC] is not just a little bit wrong, it is far out by any order of magnitude … It is so wrong that it is not even worth discussing.” 22. Dr Aynsley Kellow: “I’m not holding my breath for criticism to be taken on board, which underscores a fault in the whole peer review process for the IPCC: there is no chance of a chapter [of the IPCC report] ever being rejected for publication, no matter how flawed it might be.” 23. Dr Madhav Khandekar: “I have carefully analysed adverse impacts of climate change as projected by the IPCC and have discounted these claims as exaggerated and lacking any supporting evidence.” 24. Dr Hans Labohm: “The alarmist passages in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers have been skewed through an elaborate and sophisticated process of spin-doctoring.” 25. Dr Andrew Lacis: “There is no scientific merit to be found in the Executive Summary. The presentation sounds like something put together by Greenpeace activists and their legal department.” 26. Dr Chris Landsea: “I cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound.” 27. Dr Richard Lindzen: “The IPCC process is driven by politics rather than science. It uses summaries to misrepresent what scientists say and exploits public ignorance.” 28. Dr Harry Lins: “Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. The case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated.” 29. Dr Philip Lloyd: “I am doing a detailed assessment of the IPCC reports and the Summaries for Policy Makers, identifying the way in which the Summaries have distorted the science. I have found examples of a summary saying precisely the opposite of what the scientists said.” 30. Dr Martin Manning: “Some government delegates influencing the IPCC Summary for Policymakers misrepresent or contradict the lead authors.” 31. Dr Stephen McIntyre: “The many references in the popular media to a ‘consensus of thousands of scientists’ are both a great exaggeration and also misleading.” 32. Dr Patrick Michaels: “The rates of warming, on multiple time scales, have now invalidated the suite of IPCC climate models. No, the science is not settled.” 33. Dr Nils-Axel Morner: “If you go around the globe, you find no sea level rise anywhere.” 34. Dr Johannes Oerlemans: “The IPCC has become too political. Many scientists have not been able to resist the siren call of fame, research funding and meetings in exotic places that awaits them if they are willing to compromise scientific principles and integrity in support of the man-made global-warming doctrine.” 35. Dr Roger Pielke: “All of my comments were ignored without even a rebuttal. At that point, I concluded that the IPCC Reports were actually intended to be advocacy documents designed to produce particular policy actions, but not a true and honest assessment of the understanding of the climate system.” 36. Dr Paul Reiter: “As far as the science being ‘settled,’ I think that is an obscenity. The fact is the science is being distorted by people who are not scientists.” 37. Dr Murray Salby: “I have an involuntary gag reflex whenever someone says the science is settled. Anyone who thinks the science is settled on this topic is in fantasia.” 38. Dr Tom Segalstad: “The IPCC global warming model is not supported by the scientific data.” 39. Dr Fred Singer: “Isn’t it remarkable that the Policymakers Summary of the IPCC report avoids mentioning the satellite data altogether, or even the existence of satellites — probably because the data show a slight cooling over the last 18 years, in direct contradiction of the calculations from climate models?” 40. Dr Hajo Smit: “There is clear cut solar-climate coupling and a very strong natural variability of climate on all historical time scales. Currently I hardly believe anymore that there is any relevant relationship between human CO2 emissions and climate change.” 41. Dr Richard Tol: “The IPCC attracted more people with political rather than academic motives. In AR4, green activists held key positions in the IPCC and they succeeded in excluding or neutralising opposite voices.” 42. Dr Tom Tripp: “There is so much of a natural variability in weather it makes it difficult to come to a scientifically valid conclusion that global warming is man made.” 43. Dr Gerd-Rainer Weber: “Most of the extremist views about climate change have little or no scientific basis.” 44. Dr David Wojick: “The public is not well served by this constant drumbeat of alarms fed by computer models manipulated by advocates.” 45. Dr Miklos Zagoni: “I am positively convinced that the anthropogenic global warming theory is wrong.” 46. Dr Eduardo Zorita: “Editors, reviewers and authors of alternative studies, analysis, interpretations, even based on the same data we have at our disposal, have been bullied and subtly blackmailed.” Via : 46 statements by IPCC experts against the IPCC | grumpydenier * BIOGRAPHIES of IPCC SCIENTISTS 1.

African armies continued to defeat the best armies of Europe until the last quarter of the 19th. The Zulu defeated the British in 1879. The Ethiopians defeated the Italians in 1896. Until the invention of the Maxim Gun, Europe could not conquer or penetrate Africa. The Maxim Gun was a real game changer. Many people spent years studying economics and business management but are not at all interested in history. They explain everything in economic or managerial terms. They live in the “here and now” totally unaware of a basic fact: what happened hundreds of years ago significantly affects the present conditions. The present is inseparable from the past, including the distant past. Some people speak of Africa as the cursed continent : vast amount of natural resources but the vast majority of developing countries. The so-called curses of Africa have names and more importantly origins. Curse #1: The Curse of Berlin British explorer David Livingstone had described colonialism in the apparently benign terms of the ‘three Cs’: Commerce, Christianity, and Civilisation. The more malign ‘three Ps’ may, in fact, have been more accurate: Profit, Plunder and Prestige —Adekeye Adebajo Two major events in Africa are linked to Berlin. The Berlin Conference (1884–1885) that sealed the Scramble for Africa.Africa was partitioned and divided like a giant cake among Western powers. The ultimate goal of the Berlin Conference was to keep Africa divided and poor. They succeeded. How? by destroying powerful empires, sophisticated kingdoms, thriving ports, advanced city states and flourishing communities. The Lunda Empire was destroyed by King Leopold, King of the Belgians.by destroying between 50 to 100 cities and major towns. Stanley wrote in his journal that he destroyed 28 major towns in Congo. The Force Publique, the private army of King Leopold destroyed the double.by dismantling long distance trade networks. Pre-colonial Africa was much more interconnected than today. The Lunda had trade partners both in West-Central and East-Central Africa.by ruining local economies and industries. The West and East African coasts were littered with local factories and industries. There was a thriving boat-building industry in the Loango kingdom, in present day Cabinda enclave of Angola.by killing or exiling African rulers. A lot of kings and chiefs were beheaded and their heads kept as trophies. Their skulls can be found in colonial and military museums in Europe. The skull of Chief Lusinga is still kept in a colonial museum in Belgium.by creating colonial states by making sure that ethnic groups that never got along had the same colonial master and powerful empires or kingdoms were divided among different colonial masters. The Kingdom of Kongo was divided between Belgium, Portugal and France.by banning the use of indigenous currencies and imposing colonial currencies (monetary servitude, still imposed through the Zone Franc). There are more than 120 indigenous currencies (pictures and specimens taken) from pre-colonial Congo catalogued in the Tervuren Museum of Belgium.by suppressing indigenous scripts (scriptural servitude). The saddest case with African scripts is the Bamun script of King Njoya in Cameroon. The script was banned by the French who also destroyed his libraries and press.The Scramble for Africa was soon followed by the Scramble for African Art. Huge expeditions were organized to “collect” works of arts and artifacts. Our royal palaces and sacred shrines were looted and burned to the ground. At least 90% of Africa’s cultural heritage sit in colonial museums in Europe and in the America. 2. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the creation of new world order With the end of the Cold Word and the collapse of communist countries, the place and the role of Africa was redefined as part of the whole globalization process The Walls of Africa - Coverage of the Fall of the Berlin Wall The fall of the Wall in 1989 eventually caused the marginalisation of Africa. In his analysis, Adebajo answered more than just the question of what the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 meant for Africa, but commented “Berlin is a metaphor for Africa’s colonial and post-colonial experiences.” Fall of Berlin Wall Had Impact on African Continent Analysts say the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was primarily a symbolic event, but it marked the beginning of changes that would affect Africa and the developing world in many ways. The deputy chairman of the South African Institute for International Affairs, Moeletsi Mbeki, says the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War and East-West rivalries. ""Africa had been at the receiving end of the Cold War with great powers using Africa as a playground to fight its [their] proxy wars,"" he said. An analyst with the Electoral Institute for Southern Africa, Ebrahim Fakir, says new forms of capitalism evolved that widened the gap between rich and poor. ""While 1989 may have signaled greater amounts of freedom, the inception of some kind of democratic regime, it also initiated greater amounts of inequalities, not just between states and regions of the world, but within states,"" he said. Analysts note that the demise of communism also left the world with a single dominant power, at least for a time. And this uni-polar world may have contributed to excesses such as those that led to the banking crisis that affected economies everywhere. Curse # 2: Curse of Ham Africans are cursed and doomed to perpetual slavery because of the curse of Ham. Ham is the biblical father of the African Nations. The curse of Ham was a lie to begin with. Ham was never cursed by Canaan was. Misinformation: Black Race Originated from Noah’s Son Ham 1. Noah imposed a curse upon Canaan, not Ham 2. According to the Bible, Canaan was the name of Ham’s son; this name is also used to refer to Phoenicia. Racist context Over the time, certain religious groups spread fake teaching that Ham had a black skin because he was cursed by Noah. This teaching was used to justify racism and slavery of people with color skin across the world. …. Egypt, the first super-power in world history, is also known as the land of Ham. It is my educated belief that whenever haters focus on the savagery or servitude of the people they dislike, they usually cover up another story of displacement, land grabbing, genocide, destruction and above all a powerful legacy lost, erased, discredited or worse stolen. Three powerful quotes from Quora and Internet users. • Hamites"" cursed as ""blacks"" now become ""white"" and therefore the just progenitors of civilization in Africa, beginning with Egypt. • The Eurocentrics classify Ham as all ""black"" people first (to justify slavery and colonization) then they all magically became ""white"" people after that point so that they could claim Egypt for themselves • Hamites"" cursed as ""blacks"" now become ""white"" and therefore the just progenitors of civilization in Africa, beginning with Egypt. Stolen Legacy: The Egyptian Origins of Western Philosophy: James, George G M: 9781614278344: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more: Books https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2852&context=ocj THE WORLD'S DEBT TO EGYPT. BY G. H. RICHARDSON Africans, we are the elders of the world. In addition, the earliest civilizations on earth were created by people of different shades of brown. Black is a code word for different shades of brown. Paul Gaffarel, an early 20th French scholar said it all as follows (Courtesy of Google Translate) Several races seem to have, in turn, exercised world dominance, and been at the forefront of civilization. The order of succession is now very difficult to determine. However, the black race appears to be the first. The Malays hunted down Blacks in the islands of Polynesia; the Hindus chased them far into the interior of the Deccan and Ceylon. Blacks are represented in Egyptian monuments and easily recognizable by the color of their skin, snub nose and slanted eyes. They were later replaced by invaders. The final triumph of our race (the white race) dates back only from the 16th century when native American tribes were destroyed or absorbed by Europeans. Bishop William Montgomery Brown wrote ""For the first two or three thousand years of civilization, there was not a civilized white man on the earth. Civilization was founded and developed by the ""swarthy"" races of Mesopotamia, Syria and Egypt, and the white race remained so barbaric that in those days an Egyptian or a Babylonian priest would have said that the riffraff of white tribes a few hundred miles to the north of their civilization were hopelessly incapable of acquiring the knowledge requisite to progress. It was southern colored peoples everywhere, in China, in Central America, in India, Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt and Crete who gave the northern white peoples civilization."" (The Bankruptcy of Christian Supernaturalism, Vol., p. 192.) Curse # 3: The Resource curse Africa is plagued by the resource curse. Actually, the resource curse is not a curse in itself but a looting machine that was created more than 500 years ago. The looting machine instills or increases conflicts for oil and minerals. Rebel and militia groups are supplied with arms, particularly when they control oil or mineral rich regions and zones. The Looting Machine: Warlords, Oligarchs, Corporations, Smugglers, and the Theft of Africa's Wealth: Burgis, Tom: 9781610397117: Amazon.com: Books The trade in oil, gas, gems, metals and rare earth minerals wreaks havoc in Africa. During the years when Brazil, India, China and the other “emerging markets” have transformed their economies, Africa's resource states remained tethered to the bottom of the industrial supply chain. While Africa accounts for about 30 per cent of the world's reserves of hydrocarbons and minerals and 14 per cent of the world's population, its share of global manufacturing stood in 2011 exactly where it stood in 2000: at 1 percent. In his first book, The Looting Machine, Tom Burgis exposes the truth about the African development miracle: for the resource states, it's a mirage. The oil, copper, diamonds, gold and coltan deposits attract a global network of traders, bankers, corporate extractors and investors who combine with venal political cabals to loot the states' value. And the vagaries of resource-dependent economies could pitch Africa's new middle class back into destitution just as quickly as they climbed out of it. The ground beneath their feet is as precarious as a Congolese mine shaft; their prosperity could spill away like crude from a busted pipeline. This catastrophic social disintegration is not merely a continuation of Africa's past as a colonial victim. The looting now is accelerating as never before. As global demand for Africa's resources rises, a handful of Africans are becoming legitimately rich but the vast majority, like the continent as a whole, is being fleeced. Outsiders tend to think of Africa as a great drain of philanthropy. But look more closely at the resource industry and the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world looks rather different. In 2010, fuel and mineral exports from Africa were worth 333 billion, more than seven times the value of the aid that went in the opposite direction. But who received the money? For every Frenchwoman who dies in childbirth, 100 die in Niger alone, the former French colony whose uranium fuels France's nuclear reactors. In petro-states like Angola three-quarters of government revenue comes from oil. The government is not funded by the people, and as result it is not beholden to them. A score of African countries whose economies depend on resources are rentier states; their people are largely serfs. The resource curse is not merely some unfortunate economic phenomenon, the product of an intangible force. What is happening in Africa's resource states is systematic looting. Like its victims, its beneficiaries have names. You wouldn't buy a blood diamond, but do you own a conflict phone? Gold, Tin, Tantalum, and Tungsten: The “3TG” There are four conflict minerals legally defined by laws across the globe, including the U.S. and EU. The minerals are dubbed 3TG, for tin, tantalum (sometimes known as coltan or blue gold), tungsten, and gold. The three “Ts” are mostly mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and they’re all used extensively in electronics. The minerals are also mined in other places, like Australia and South America — generally by large industrial conglomerates without as many worker welfare concerns. Mining operations in Africa produce a huge percentage of the global supply of 3TGs and they do it cheaply. The minerals have many uses in electronics and are found throughout our smartphones: • Tantalum is used primarily for the production of tantalum capacitors, which have a comparatively high capacitance per volume and low weight. • Tin is used for solder on most circuit boards on the planet, and in displays, including LCDs and OLEDs. • Tungsten is used for its hardness in wires and electrodes. Smartphones also vibrate via haptic feedback or for notifications by using an off-center motor made of tungsten components. • Gold is more commonly known and used extensively in electronics both directly for electronic contacts, connectors, and wires, and in some chemical compounds used in certain semiconductor manufacturing processes. Huge quantities of gold are sold illegally. Why conflict? And why has it been going on for so long? Speaking on a conference call for TCO Compliance in June, Joakim Wohlfeil, a policy advisor on conflict and justice for international development organization Diakonia, explained the sources of conflict, and the problems facing “artisanal” miners in Africa. The word artisan is generally associated with skilled crafts, but don’t be fooled. This is hard labor: millions of individuals mine in a semi-organized fashion by hand, without modern industrial techniques, to provide income for their families. ….. The armed groups rule through lawlessness and deliberately avoid any kind of active peace. Peace brings laws, regulation, taxes, and customs duties. According to Wohlfeil, who speaks with miners in conflict zones, the armed groups trade the minerals via informal methods, and where gold is involved, often fetch surprisingly high prices. Criminal organizations like the Russian and Italian mobs legitimize their cash by purchasing gold, which can be easily washed into the economy. In the DRC alone, an astonishing 98 percent of mined gold is exported illegally. Tantalum also isn’t traded on a metal exchange like the London Metal Exchange, making movements of the raw ore difficult to track and purposefully obscured by suppliers. The price paid for the material is usually determined solely by negotiations between buyer and seller, rather than a constant market. Chinweizu Ibekwe - Wikipedia The Nigerian scholar Chinweizu Ibekwe wrote the following passage. It summarizes everything. http://www.nigeriavillagesquare.com/columnists/ivan-van-sertima-rehabilitating-the-self-image-of-the-black-african-1.html The pathetic self-image of black African, which was implanted by colonialism, has been a major contributor to our burden of self-contempt and self-defeat, and to our psychological inability to motivate and organize our societies for great achievements. It is a myth that gets us to accept white domination and control down to this day. It has left us psychologically impotent to rebuild our shattered societies; impotent to build viable new societies from the rubble made of old Africa by the hurricane of colonialism. Fortunately for our future, this self-image is false, demonstrably false; and we can erase it and end its damaging consequences by discovering and teaching ourselves the correct history of Black Africa. Thanks to the work of Ivan Van Sertima and Cheikh Anta Diop and their complementary schools of historiography, we know that these claims are not true but were foisted on us by Eurocentric historians, anthropologists and propagandists. And Van Sertima and Diop have left us abundant evidence to correct that false image. Who, you might ask, was Ivan Van Sertima? He certainly was not well known in Black Africa, and certainly not as well-known as he deserves to be. He was an Associate Professor of Africana Studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA. He was the leader of a team of researchers whose work on the Journal of African Civilizations, which he founded in 1979, and edited, helped to rehabilitate the image of the Black African by removing the “primitive” from the center stage it has occupied in Eurocentric histories and anthropologies of the African. “The African we have been dealing with, the African we've been focusing upon, or rather the African that our Eurocentric vision has created, is one-sided and false. The African we were taught to envision as the true African is the peripheral creature of the forest zone or the colonized survivor of the slave trade. The more sophisticated centers of Africa were shattered; the great achievements of mainstream Africans were ignored. So we have a comparison between the mainstream European and the primitive African. Even people of African descent have come to the conclusion that what is special about the African is his simple, raw humanity, his exotic little rituals and costumes, etc. They are not aware, for example, of his scientific tradition. Most people have been made to think that it was the European, because of his so-called theoretical and abstract thinking, who alone learned to master and transcend nature. When we go back in history, we begin to realize that this is not true “Within the last decade alone, evidence has been unearthed in the field of agricultural and pastoral science, architecture, aeronautics, engineering, mathematics, mining, metallurgy and medicine, navigation and physics, that has made the whole ground, upon which conventional studies of Africa have been built, rock violently with the shock of astonishing discoveries. These are astonishing only because the nerve of the world has been deadened for centuries to the vibrations of African genius. Every new revelation has made us realize that the eyes of the anthropologist and historian have been focusing on the edge or periphery of the African world, blind to all that has lain within the heartland of its civilizations. Very partial and limited visions of the African hovering on the fringes of his vast world have come to represent the totality of his capacity and potential. . . . What they mean by traditional is the only kind of culture we have come to accept as African—that of the primitive on the periphery, the stunned survivor . . . Even notable African scholars, in their romantic embrace of this exotic savage, have come to the conclusion that the African invented nothing, explored nothing, but occupied some special sensory or emotional realm in his experience of the natural world. Five centuries of these falsehoods have been exploded in just five years. Not to be inspired by mere hollow chauvinistic boasts, but inspired by a genuine awareness of achievement, so they can emulate that achievement. So their children do not have to feel they only half-belong to the world. . . . People of African descent should become very much aware of what is going on. Very much aware of these developments, of this record of achievement. It is affecting us profoundly. It's not only the ignorance of this that is making people despise us, push us aside and treat us as second-class citizens, but our ignorance of it makes us also treat ourselves in a certain way. It has affected the way we approach everything Africa is not as influential as it was before the slave trade. Remember, Africa is no longer what it used to be. Africa is an exploded world, an exploded star, a shattered continent. It is only in this century, within our own lifetime, that it has started to stumble back into any kind of coherent, independent form. Even independence has not yet truly come to Africa. So bear in mind, you can’t compare modern shattered Africa with the Africa that was. …………………………………………….. Collection of Articles by Professor Chinweizu CHINWEIZU ARTICLES Compiled By Ambakisye-Okang Dukuzumurenyi, Ph.D. The notion that culture is the ultimate backbone of a people, the immune system of a society, is alien to the niggerized consciousness of the populations of PanAfrica. Many of their comprador elite now see African culture as nothing more than a source of fossilized arts and museum pieces to be sold to earn foreign exchange! Others view it as a disgraceful, primitive paganism that should be smashed and consigned to the bonfire. So, everything depends on the education they received, what it moulded them into. If you are educated as a lawyer, your mental framework tends to get limited to what you can do in a law court, or within the existing legal and constitutional arrangements If your education is such that you think from the point of view of your conquerors, if it moulds you into a black European, that is mis-education, not education. If you take a rat and train it to see the world in the way the cat sees the world, you have not educated the rat, you have mis-educated it for life in a world with rat-killing cats. You have actually made it an easier prey for the cats, because the natural instincts of a rat would have told it how to deal with cats, or how to avoid cats. But after you have given the rat the education of a cat, it would lose those instincts. It might even think of itself as a cat! And that is what this colonialist education has done to Africans for the last two centuries. We have been fundamentally mis-educated, and we cannot even see the world from our own point of view, let alone in our own interest The Japanese rulers launched their Meiji revolution in 1868, and were determined to make Japan an equal power with the foremost western powers. In this project, they sought to modernize but not Westernize Japan. They sent emissaries abroad to study their white enemies thoroughly. And they were interested in finding and adopting only those aspects of European civilization that would help in building Japan‘s national power. They united the energies of the entire population to achieve absolute national independence from foreign capital and foreign rule; accordingly, they regarded foreign help as proof of national weakness. They were focused on building enough Japanese power to prevent their being conquered, and to wipe out their national humiliation by foreign encroachments and tutelage. Such cannot be said for any of our Black African countries—with their unselective aping of all things European, their lack of a sense of humiliation at having been colonized, their pathetic addiction to foreign aid, their abject craving for foreign investment, and their absolute disinterest in industrializing themselves into economic and military power The crucial point is that the movements that liberated Japan were led by people who did hard thinking about their reality, and who applied some ideological perspective to illuminate the problems of their society. They did not allow that ‗crisis of knowledge ‘that afflicted the Black African movements to ever arise. As yet no Black African country has pushed ahead to attempt Japan after 1868. National liberation is manifested when you run your economy and society and culture entirely in your national interest. No foreign companies dominate the Japanese economy--that is the crucial point. As Cabral maintained, until we have mental independence—―absolute independence in our way of thinking and acting-- and apply it to control our territory and economy and culture, we are not independent. So, the independence that Black African countries claim is fake, because they do not control any of these vital aspects of their existence. ………………………………… The average intelligent person looks both ways before crossing a street or risks being hit by a truck. Africa is in bandages because most of its leaders looked only one way— at the external—George B.N. Ayittey, Applied Economics for Africa by George B. N. Ayittey, PhD - African Liberty. “He who does not know where he came from, does not know where he is going,” says an African proverb. We are lost in Africa because we do not know where we came from, which is why we copy everything foreign by heart. It is either because we have no faith in our own or we lack knowledge of our own. Africa is lost and wandering because many of its leaders do not know where they came from. They have been copying alien systems and institutions, instead of building upon their own. For example, they have been building Confucius Institutes across Africa, not Ubuntu Institutes. We need to continue championing “African solutions to African problems” and arguing that the salvation of Africa does not lie inside the corridors of the World Bank, the IMF, or the US Congress. Neither does it lie in the inner sanctum of the Chinese Politburo or the Russian presidium. It lies in Africa’s own backyard—in her own indigenous institutions. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Africa’s indigenous economic system. But the indigenous system was roundly castigated by the ruling elites as “backward and primitive.” They then proceeded to copy all sorts of alien and unworkable models from abroad to impose on the African people. The continent became littered with the putrid carcasses of failed imported systems Traditional Africa, the home of the real people of Africa, works—albeit at a low level of efficiency—and has sustained its people for centuries. The natives may lack formal education, but they are hard-working and enterprising. Using their raw native intelligence, ingenuity, and skills, they have been able to produce some of the world’s most beautiful cloths (kente, for example) and great works of art. The sculptures of Yoruba, Ibo bronzes, the beads of the Maasai, Fang masks, Zulu headrests, and Sotho snuff containers are recognized as masterpieces. There were free village markets, free trade, and free enterprise before the advent of colonialism in Africa. Timbuktu, for example was one great market town. Free-trade routes crisscrossed the continent with the trans-Saharan being the most famous. Politically, decision-making was by consensus at village meetings But much of this knowledge, as Mr. Soyinka rightly complains, has been hidden. Myths about Africa came to replace these truths, and the problem was compounded by the failure on all sides to distinguish between form and substance. The institutions of democracy, free markets, money, marriage, and justice, can take many forms. Just because there were no ballot boxes or supermarkets or white-wigged judges in pre-colonial African villages doesn’t mean Africans had no conception of those institutions. African tribal cultures aren’t in conflict with the West; only the forms of institutions are different. There is still much mythology about Africa’s indigenous economic system. The myth of “hunters and gatherers” persists, giving the impression that Africa had no economic institutions or culture before contact with the Europeans. Inexorably tied to their ancestral land, Africans supposedly eked out a living from primitive agriculture. Trade and exchange were supposedly un- known, since self-sufficiency and subsistence farming were the operative goals. Books on pre-colonial Africa dwell excessively on the “backwardness” of African technology. But Africa did indeed have economic institutions Africans engaged in a variety of industrial activities in the pre-colonial era. In Benin, “the glass industry made extraordinary strides” (Diop 1987, 136). In Nigeria, “the cloth industry was an ancient craft. Kano attained historical prominence in the fourteenth century with its fine indigo dyed cloth, which was traded for goods from North Africa. Even before the discovery of cotton, other materials had been used for cloth. The Igbo, for example, made cloth from the fibrous bark of trees. The Asante also were famous for their cotton and bark cloth (kente and adwumfo). No effort was made to build on Africa’s own indigenous institutions; only Botswana did this. The indigenous systems were castigated as backward and primitive that could not be relied upon to achieve the rapid transformation the leaders desired. Foreign systems and paraphernalia were blindly aped and transplanted into Africa. As such, no organic development took place but rather “development by imitation.” ……………..",2021-03-06T15:23:06.078Z,"Why are African countries so underdeveloped even though they have a vast amount of natural resources and labour force more than most western countries?

It’s a delicate balance of building excitement, making the best product, satisfying shareholders, and achieving the best sales numbers possible. Case in Point: Cyberpunk 2077 Let’s begin the story in 2012. CD Projekt Red (CDPR), a video game company based out of Poland, started planning their next big game based on the “cyberpunk” genre. Development began in 2016 after they released The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015. According to analysts at Polish bank BOS, it cost CD Projekt RED about 1.2bn złoty ($330m) to make Cyberpunk 2077, making it one of the most expensive games ever made. After 8 years in development, the game went gold in October. The game was released for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on December 10th, with an announcement for next-gen console support due next year. If only things went smoothly from there. While PC players gave good reviews for the game on Metacritic, the console players were displeased. Despite the hype and hope from gamers everywhere, the game received heavy criticism from console players for a high amount of bugs. It got so bad that Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store 8 days later until “further notice.” They even issued an apology:  One of the most hyped games of the decade crashed on consoles and forced the developer to issue a return policy! It’s still too soon to know the ramifications of what happened, but this seems like a worst-case scenario for Cyberpunk 2077’s release. So, What Went Wrong? The Hype CD Projekt Red announced this game back in January of 2013, with trailers at E3 2018 and 2019 (famously starring Keanu Reeves in a “breathtaking” performance). The game even won over a hundred awards at E3 2018, building an incredible amount of excitement for this unreleased game. Why did it get so much hype? Well, the setting helped. The “cyberpunk” genre of sci-fi has captured the public’s imagination ever since movies like Blade Runner, Akira, and Ghost in the Shell came out. Add in the interactivity of video games with high-resolution graphics, and you’ve got endless possibilities for stories and missions. The game practically sold itself, so people were on board for it. At E3 2019, they announced the game’s release date to be April 16th, 2020. At this point, they’ve hyped up the game astronomically, reporting ports of the game to most game consoles, Windows/ Steam, and Stadia upon release. People were ready. Then Came the Delays. They announced a delay on March 16th. They delayed the release date from April 16th to September 17th, then to November 19th, and finally to December 10th. They kept pushing the game off, but everyone understood. There was a global pandemic in the way, and so they waited. They even issued a rare “crunch time” scenario at the studio, giving a mandatory six-day workweek to hit their latest deadline. Night City’s Pest Problem The public wasn’t ready for the number of bugs on the console releases. People have reported frame drops, crashes, buggy NPCs, glitchy objects, and many more gameplay problems. It’s still a disaster to play on a console, with the PS4 version of the game deemed “completely unplayable.” Here’s my theory: On the one hand, video game publishers need to start advertising their games as soon as possible to reach the most people. The marketing team for any given game needs to keep the public interested in it. People don’t tend to focus on one game at a time. This attention span is why I understand the need to advertise for multiple years, but here’s the big problem. On the other hand, people get hyped for your game, so you set unrealistic development goals. If you begin pushing hard to reach the finish line, it still runs the risk of game-breaking glitches and crashes on last-gen consoles. If the product needs more time, you have to be able to adjust your initial goals. But then comes the stockholder expectations. CDPR is part of CD Projekt, a publicly-traded company. They probably had told their stockholders that it would release during the 2020 fiscal year, and they didn’t have enough time to delay the game any further. Now, maybe CDPR thought they’d finish in time for the first release, and that’s fine. However, I think it’s a good lesson for us to learn, especially when figuring out the best window to release a project. It’s a delicate time when customer enthusiasm aligns with stockholder satisfaction. Finding that moment takes time and research, especially with a medium like video games or websites. While a video game about a cyberpunk world is intriguing enough to garner attention from the general population, you might not have that interest so quickly. Even when you’ve done the research and figured out the best time to send it out, you still risk failure. Here’s the thing, though; that’s the hazard when you decide to make something new. People might not like it, but at least you tried your best. Fortunately, there’s good news: it wasn’t all a total loss. CDPR already made back the development costs for the game, with over 8 million pre-orders. I’m still of the opinion that they could’ve postponed the game and made it exclusively for next-gen consoles, but I understand their need to release the game after keeping the public waiting for nearly a decade. Video games do have an advantage in this regard; you can send patches to the game to make them better. I would disapprove of doing that for your game, but it is a way to make a game better over time. Most notably, the game No Man’s Sky has had multiple patches since its release, turning an unplayable game into a great experience. Though there are fixes you could make to your project, you still need to have it finished. It helps neither your customers nor your reputation to release something unfinished. Though this story’s end has yet to be determined, it does provide us a valuable lesson in giving our media the best chance to shine. Don’t be afraid to release your ideas out there. Just know when it is best for your product, and people’s hands will be wide open for you. I hope that makes sense. Why are so many games being delayed right now? Think about it from the publisher’s perspective. It could be too tempting to press “publish” on a project, especially too early. Until this point, the process is like climbing a mountain; this final press of a button is sticking your flag at the top. However, this moment is just as important. You need to pierce your banner in the right place at the right time, or else you may trigger a catastrophic avalanche. You need to pick the right time to send your product out to the masses. It’s a delicate balance of building excitement, making the best produc Continue Reading",2021-03-06T15:23:42.083Z,"Why are so many video games being delayed right now? ",Quora

Australia is within its right in not disclosing the reason behind this action but Chinese media became loud in criticising the action saying Huang has fallen victim to a renewed wave of anti-China hysteria, aimed at increasing fear mongering and hatred toward China and Chinese business throughout the Australia. Earlier, Australian Department of Defence banned employees from using the Chinese app WeChat citing security issues and the app could be used to sabotage an election. Australia also banned Huawaei for 5G testing. In 2010, the then head of Australian mining company Rio Tinto’s iron ore business was jailed for 10 years on charges of corruption and stealing commercial secrets. Stern Hu, an Australian citizen of Chinese origin, was released earlier in 2018 after serving eight years. His incarceration came as Rio Tinto and China were engaged in a heated negotiation over the iron ore benchmark price. Detention of Wang Weijing, Huawei’s sales director in Poland, showed the US-China rivalry over technology pre-eminence has spilled over into Europe. Although Huawei sacked the arrested sales director, its position became worse after detention of its CFO Sabrina Meng Wanzhou (also daughter of founder of Huawei who had PLA links) in Candada’s Vancover on 1 December 2018. The founder Ren Zhengfei of Huawei Technologies says the tech giant would reject requests from the Chinese government to disclose confidential information about its customers but the reality is all Chinese companies, as per law must comply with Chinese government requests. Chinese smartphones are claimed to have been fitted with chips that collect personal data and buses in the US are alleged to have listening devices in seats. Hiding one's military background is believed to facilitate the overseas visa process. International suspicion about Chinese activities abroad has been growing this year, pushing Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S. — a group known as the Five Eyes alliance — to increase cooperation against potential Chinese interference in their respective markets. Recently a German media report quoted an anonymous official saying that there are 250 Chinese spies in Brussels. Some sensitive persons were even warned to avoid going to specific restaurants and cafes. The intelligence service of Lithuania, a country with a population of less than 3 million, released an annual report saying Chinese espionage has become a threat to the country's national security. Lithuania's report makes us Chinese feel the country is playing up to Washington and following the West's steps in preventing ""China's penetration."" The Lithuania report was issued after a similar one by Norway. Many Chinese military scientists working on strategic research at Western universities have deliberately concealed their ties to the army, according to new research. In a report, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) said it discovered two dozen new cases of scientists from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) — the umbrella term for China's ground, naval and air forces — traveling abroad ""using cover to obscure their military affiliations."" ""These scientists use various kinds of cover, ranging from the use of misleading historical names for their institutions to the use of names of non-existent institutions,"" the Canberra-based think tank found. Most were Australia-bound and studied topics such as hypersonic missiles and navigation technology. The majority came from top Chinese military academies such as the National University of Defense Technology, which is led by the state-run Central Military Commission. Other popular destinations included the European Union and the United States —countries that view Beijing as an intelligence adversary. These nations, however, may be oblivious to their inadvertent role in China's military advancement, according to the report's author. ASPI's findings come amid widespread fears of Beijing using education, spying, political donations and people-to-people diplomacy to gain a greater clout abroad. The issue threatens to further strain relations between China and Western economies at a time when Beijing is dominating the global trade conversation. The Chinese army encourages its academics, who are civilians, ""to work on areas of interest to the military while they're overseas"" in order to leverage foreign training to develop improved technology at home, Joske wrote. The process is described by the PLA as ""picking flowers in foreign lands to make honey in China,"" but it risks ""harming the West's strategic advantage."" Chinese military researchers may also engage in espionage or steal intellectual property while overseas, he warned. That's a particularly sensitive topic in the current U.S.-China trade war, with Washington accusing Beijing of pilfering technology. Many universities, however, have defended their partnerships with PLA scientists because the funding they get from China. But Chinese student in US universities are caught under cross fires of US-China trade war. Since the start of the China-US trade war last year, Washington has tightened visa restrictions for graduate researchers in hi-tech fields such as robotics, aviation and artificial intelligence. Several Chinese citizens working in these fields in the US have been arrested for allegedly spying on engineers and scientists. Chinese students see job opportunities for them dwindle in both countries, Chinese science students at American universities are wrestling with a dilemma: should they stay, or go back to China? The are feeling the heat as they felt anxious about what they perceived as an increasingly hostile climate towards Chinese students in the US. The Trump administration’s tough China policies have added to the difficulties some Chinese students were having in adapting to Western schooling. Amid employment and visa uncertainty, some had extended their graduate studies’ time limits to improve their chances of winning jobs or US citizenship. More than 360,000 Chinese nationals study at American higher education institutions. Trump’s policies, however, may well be reversing the influx of students from China – and that could be good news for Indian students. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautioned U.S. allies on 11 February 2019 against deploying equipment from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on their soil, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to ""partner alongside them"". The United States and its Western allies believe Huawei Technologies' apparatus could be used for espionage, and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the EU market. ""We have seen this all around the world, it also makes it more difficult for America to be present,"" Pompeo told reporters during a stop at the U.S. embassy,"" referring to Huawei equipment. ""If that equipment is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them."" US-China cold war on technology has just begun and China is to be blamed for this as they were secretly stealing or arm-twisting other developed countries to handover technology. PLA Air Force fighter jets are, for example, reverse engineering copy of Russian jets. The March 2018 report on Section 301 investigation running into nearly 50 pages says China fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies and practices relating to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation, and ""indeed appears"" to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months. The report reiterates that China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture requirements and foreign equity limitations, and various administrative reviews and licensing processes to require or pressure technology transfer from US companies. Further, China's regime of technology regulations forces US companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market based terms that favour Chinese recipients, it alleged. The report said that instead of accepting the USTR request for consultations on its 30-1 investigation, China expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the US and decried the investigation as ""irresponsible"" and ""not objective"". The USTR said China shows no signs of ceasing its policy and practice of conducting and supporting cyber enabled theft and intrusions into the commercial networks of US companies. This illicit conduct provides the Chinese government with unauthorised access to intellectual property, trade secrets, confidential business information, technical data, negotiating positions and sensitive and proprietary internal business communications, it said. In recent months, the Department of Justice has indicted a dozen individuals and corporate entities directed by the Chinese government to obtain commercial secrets from 15 companies, predominantly in aerospace and high-technology sectors. The facts alleged in these indictments reflect China's ongoing determination to obtain trade secrets and other valuable commercial information in support of China's industrial policy. But going forward, Western governments must deepen discussions on PLA collaboration ""to determine how it relates to national interests"" in addition to enhancing scrutiny of visa applications by foreign military personnel, the report recommended. A well-known case is high-speed rail and Chinese government called the theft the paradigm example of indigenous innovation. In 2004, China’s Ministry of Railways tendered for bids to make high-speed trains reaching 200 kmper hour. To win the contracts, foreign companies had to form joint ventures and make significant transfers of technology to their Chinese partners. Alstom of France, a Japanese consortium led by Kawasaki, and Bombardier’s German subsidiary won parts of the contract. Bombardier-Sifang and Kawasaki-Sifang transferred technology to subsidiaries of China South Rail and Alstom-Changchun transferred technology to China North Rail. Both China South Rail and China North Rail were state-owned enterprises. In 2005, Siemens of Germany won a contract with China North Rail’s Tangshan Railway Vehicle Company to supply technology to build 60 passenger trains for the high-speed railway linking Beijing and Tianjin. The ﬁrst three trains were constructed in Siemens’ German plant, while the remaining 57 trains were made at China North Rail’s Tangshan plant in Hebei, China. Over a thousand of China North Rail’s technical staff were trained at Siemens facilities in Germany as part of the deal. With all the technologies acquired and learned, China has become a strong rival to the world’s high-speed train producers. By 2014, China’s premier Li Keqiang was considered salesman of China’s high speed rail (or bullet train). He went to many counties to sell Chinese bullet train including India (New Delhi-Chennai route). China now has 60% of global bullet train routes and expanding agressively. Chinese hackers have breached U.S. Navy contractors to steal a raft of information, including missile plans, through what some officials describe as some of the most debilitating cyber campaigns linked to Beijing. Victims have included contractors of all sizes, with some of the smaller ones struggling to invest in securing their networks, as hackers over the last 18 months have conducted numerous breaches to gather intelligence, sabotage American systems, and steal intellectual property, the Journal reported. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The Journal's report was based on information from experts and officials, who said that Navy Secretary Richard Spencer had ordered a review of cybersecurity weaknesses that led to an initial assessment validating concerns and laying groundwork for a response by the Navy. Officials in the Navy called the breaches troubling and unacceptable, the Journal reported. National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said on Tuesday that in general Chinese cyber activity in the United States had risen in recent months. The digital attacks have targeted the U.S. energy, financial, transportation and healthcare sectors, and gone beyond efforts to spy and steal intellectual property into disrupting critical infrastructure. Chinese officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment but have denied they engage in cyberattacks. Hackers behind a massive breach at hotel group Marriott International Inc left clues suggesting they were working for a Chinese government intelligence gathering operation, according to sources familiar with the matter. Marriott said in December 2018 that a hack that began four years ago had exposed the records of up to 500 million customers in its Starwood hotels reservation system. Private investigators looking into the breach have found hacking tools, techniques and procedures previously used in attacks attributed to Chinese hackers, said three sources who were not authorised to discuss the company's private probe into the attack. That suggests that Chinese hackers may have been behind a campaign designed to collect information for use in Beijing's espionage efforts and not for financial gain. While China has emerged as the lead suspect in the case, the sources cautioned it was possible somebody else was behind the hack because other parties had access to the same hacking tools, some of which have previously been posted online. Identifying the culprit is further complicated by the fact that investigators suspect multiple hacking groups may have simultaneously been inside Marriott computer networks since 2014, said one of the sources. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return requests for comment. If investigators confirm that China was behind the attack, that could complicate already tense relations between Washington and Beijing, amid an ongoing tariff dispute and U.S. accusations of Chinese espionage and the theft of trade secrets. Hackers working on behalf of Chinese intelligence breached the network of Norwegian software firm Visma to steal secrets from its clients, cyber security researchers said, in what a company executive described as a potentially catastrophic attack. The attack was part of what Western countries said in December is a global hacking campaign by China's Ministry of State Security to steal intellectual property and corporate secrets, according to investigators at cyber security firm Recorded Future. China's Ministry of State Security has no publicly available contacts. The foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment, but Beijing has repeatedly denied any involvement in cyber-enabled spying. Visma took the decision to talk publicly about the breach to raise industry awareness about the hacking campaign, which is known as Cloudhopper and targets technology service and software providers in order reach their clients. Cyber security firms and Western governments have warned about Cloudhopper several times since 2017 but have not disclosed the identities of the companies affected. British analysts briefed EU counterparts at a meeting on January 28 2019, offering evidence of both software and hardware attacks by the group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, or APT 10. They would not give details of the alleged hardware attack, claiming the information was classified. Officials at the meeting discussed potential responses, such as sanctions or a joint warning. The issue might be discussed at a scheduled EU-China Summit in April 2019. The focus on APT 10 is part of a broader clampdown by Europe and the United States on alleged espionage and intellectual property theft by China. The hacker group was at the centre of charges in December 2018 by the US Department of Justice, which accused Chinese officials of orchestrating a decade-long, since 2006, espionage campaign that involved infiltrating companies in the US and more than a dozen other countries. US prosecutors also unsealed indictments against two Chinese men, Zhu Hua (aka ‘Godkiller’) and Zhang Shilongin, for their alleged involvement in the group since 2006. They have been charged with “conspiracy to commit computer intrusions on corporate servers of IBM, HPE (now merged with Perot Systems to for DXC), NASA etc. with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft”, the indictment from the US Justice Department states. Both men worked at Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company and “acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s Tianjian State Security Bureau”. So the suspect over Huawai was emerging over a decade. China, however continue its one word denials as ‘baseless’. “Some countries’ accusations against China on the cybersecurity issue are unfounded and groundless, driven by ulterior motives,” the Chinese mission to the EU said in response to the allegations. “We urge the relevant parties to stop defaming China, so as not to undermine their bilateral relations and cooperation with China.” For any response against China linked to cyberattacks, the EU’s members would need to agree unanimously that the country was responsible and not all EU members agreed, a source said. Britain is expected to leave the bloc at the end of March. The EU is developing protocols to respond to malicious cyber activities, for instance by imposing sanctions, but it can be difficult to clearly attribute actions to individuals or a nation state. The British foreign office in December 2018 joined the US in pressing the accusations against APT 10, claiming that the group acted on behalf of the Chinese government “to carry out a malicious cyber campaign targeting intellectual property and sensitive commercial data in Europe, Asia and the US”. The US justice department claimed that the group used a technique known as spear phishing, in which emails that pretend to be from legitimate addresses are sent with attached documents and files that secretly install malware if opened. That can give hackers access to a subject’s computer and allow them to steal usernames and passwords, files and other information. US cybersecurity firm FireEye, which has been tracking APT 10 since 2009, said the Chinese cyber espionage group had targeted construction and engineering, aerospace and telecom firms, as well as governments in the US, Europe and Japan in an effort to support Chinese national security goals of acquiring military and intelligence information. Taiwan is investigating six current and former employees of BASF's local operations suspected of leaking corporate secrets to a rival Chinese company. Five employees were detained and one had been granted bail by a court, Lu Sung Hao, Taipei-based director of Taiwan's Crime Investigation Bureau, told Reuters. The prosecution has not filed any charges against them. The case comes amid fears among officials and executives around the globe about industrial espionage by China. The Bureau said in a statement that a senior manager was suspected of stealing electronic manufacturing processes, technology, and other trade secrets, and leaking and selling them to a competitor in China for a high price. The company that paid for the information was identified as China's Jiangyin Jianghua Microelectronics Materials Co., which had offered 40 million yuan ($5.8 million) to the current and former employees in return for the technology transfer to build a factory in China, Lu said. The employees had received a series of payments totalling T$40 million ($1.30 million) late last year in two bank accounts, Lu said. The company, which also said that it owns 58 patents, says on its website that it manufactures and supplies wet electronic chemicals that are used in products like semiconductors and flat panel displays. German chemical company BASF said that only one of the people under investigation is a current employee and that the individual's contract had now been suspended. ""We have taken immediate steps to support the investigation led by local law enforcement officials and protect the relevant information,"" BASF said. The company and the Bureau both declined to provide any estimate on financial losses. Officials in Taiwan and the United States have been accusing Chinese companies of intellectual property theft amid China's multi-billion drive to cut reliance on foreign chips and build up its own semiconductor industry. Taiwan has vowed to defend its chip industry, the island's economic backbone, by tightening its regulations and penalties on corporate espionage.

The answer to that question shows who you are!!!!!!! This is an article by CNN from today It shows how all the activists nations do not care about human lives: Thousands are trapped in a desert settlement in Syria, near a US military base By Alessandria Masi, CNN Updated 0932 GMT (1732 HKT) August 1, 2019  A Syrian refugee from the informal Rukban camp, which lies in no-man's-land off the border between Syria and Jordan in the remote northeast, walks in the rain. (CNN) Shukri Shehab and his wife have not slept in two nights. Their three-week-old granddaughter will not stop crying. She needs simple medicine for bloating, Shehab says, but it is nearly impossible for them to find. Shehab lives in Rukban, an informal settlement for Syria's displaced people in a US-protected zone in southern Syria, roughly 10 miles away from an American military base. Shehab has been communicating with CNN over the last four months. For more than 1,200 days, Shehab says he and his family have lived in this cluster of shelters sprinkled along a stretch of desert on the Syrian-Jordanian border. Activists dubbed it the ""Triangle of Death."" The United Nations called conditions ""desperate,"" ""catastrophic"" and ""no place for a child."" For years, the displaced in Rukban have been at the mercy of proxy powers and political players, leaving them with sporadic access to humanitarian aid and no safe way home. And for the past five months, the Syrian government has blocked humanitarian access to the encampment through its territories.  An aerial view of the informal Rukban camp, between the Jordan and Syria borders. ""No side is taking responsibility for these people,"" says Aron Lund, a Syria expert and fellow at the Century Foundation, a non-partisan think tank. A State Department official tells CNN the US is ""pursuing every possible avenue to deliver aid to Rukban."" But so far Washington has not directly provided aid to the tens of thousands stuck in the settlement, even though the US has protected the area since 2016. The US has pinned the blame solely on the Syrian government and its Russian allies. Damascus has denied requests for aid deliveries to Rukban since February, pushing instead for civilians to return to regime-controlled areas. ""Rukban is another example of the Assad regime's consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,"" Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson told CNN in a statement. In Syria, aid is delivered either cross-border, with the consent of the neighboring country, or through the UN and other humanitarian groups based in Damascus. But Jordan halted regular cross-border deliveries years ago, leaving only the Syrian government in control of approving UN humanitarian aid convoys to the settlement. Experts say the US can do more to help. Unlike other areas where the regime has denied or prevented humanitarian access, in Rukban ""you have, within the besieged area, a US base and US access. At some point it doesn't really work to say this is (only) the Syrian government's fault. Yes, it is, but then what?"" says Lund. The US ""could do things for Rukban and they're not doing it. The US could absolutely bring food and especially medicine to Rukban,"" Lund says. ""There is definitely US culpability in this. Is it only the US? No, absolutely not. But it's a situation where the US has grabbed a piece of Syria and says it is not responsible for the people in that part of Syria, which is wrong."" Trapped in the desert Most in the settlement fled ISIS, the Syrian government, or both, over the course of Syria's conflict. Many were hoping to cross into Jordan, but the country has denied entry since 2016. They wound up in limbo in the desert encampment. Today, nearly 25,000 are ""trapped ... languishing in a wasteland,"" Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, told the UN Human Rights Council earlier this month, according to Reuters. An estimated 80% are believed to be women and children. ""Me and my family are like everyone else in the camp, just waiting for a kind of solution,"" says Shehab, who is also a member of the Rukban local council. Related: US citizen released from Syria They've been waiting so long that his two eldest sons got married in Rukban. His three grandchildren were all born there. The family lives in one shelter with three mud rooms: one for each young couple and their children, and one for Shehab, his wife and three other children. About a month after ISIS declared its caliphate in June 2014, UN satellite images identified at least 90 makeshift shelters in Rukban. By March 2019, there were nearly 7,800. Inside Rukban access to drinking water and healthcare is limited. There is no sewage system or formal education. Aid deliveries have always been sporadic, but for the past five months, they have stopped. ""Food, basic medicine, and other life-saving supplies are no longer available,"" Pinheiro says. Only two deliveries have reached Rukban since early 2018. Damascus denied the UN's March 17 request for a third convoy, without citing a reason. The UN made another request on May 9, but the government has not responded.  Syrian refugees from Rukban line up to visit a UN-operated medical clinic on the Jordanian-side for checkups, on March 1, 2017. When asked earlier this month why the US has not provided aid to fill this gap, US Special Representative for Syria Jim Jeffrey said at the Aspen Security Forum: ""If we feed them, it will look like we're going to stay there forever and there may be other options for them."" ""We can't commit to a long-term presence in al-Tanf or in any place else in Syria,"" Jeffrey added. According to Lund, ""the US policy ... in Rukban is not to get involved. If you start feeding these people and taking a governance role toward them ... the presence in Syria that you insist as the US government is not an occupation starts looking more like an occupation."" Elsewhere in Syria, the US has previously pushed to improve living conditions for displaced people. In 2017, former US coalition envoy, Brett McGurk, deployed ""experts and diplomats from the State Department and from USAID"" to increase humanitarian access for those displaced by fighting against ISIS in the north. But for a host of political reasons, US policy towards Rukban is unique, shaped by the mission of its base there. Area is a 'political football' Rukban's humanitarian crisis is deeply entwined in Syria's fraught geopolitics. The settlement is near the strategic intersection of the Syrian, Jordanian and Iraqi borders, and it is within an area that currently hosts some 200 American troops at a US military base at al-Tanf, considered key to countering Iran's influence in Syria. ""The US presence there was first about anti-ISIS. Now it's about anti-Iran, and the camp is caught in the middle,"" says Neil Hauer, an independent security analyst. The US continues to support a local rebel group in and around Rukban, Maghawir al-Thawra, which claims to be fighting ISIS. As recently as July 29, the group posted a video on Twitter of what it called a ""successful training"" carried out ""with coalition forces"" to ensure the area ""remains safe from #Daesh,"" referring to ISIS. ""The camp's presence makes the entire area another political football in that turning it over to Russia and Damascus is something else the US don't want to do, at least for free,"" says Hauer. Rukban is also located within a US-Russia ""deconfliction zone,"" meaning Russian and Syrian government-aligned forces are not supposed to enter. Almost by default, this means the two are keen to regain control of the area as battles elsewhere end.  This picture shows an aid convoy of the Red Crescent arriving at Rukban on February 06, 2019. The displaced in Rukban have not received aid since. ""They see it as a US controlled zone. It's like if Russia occupied part of Texas, then the US would be angry about it,"" Lund says. Since the beginning of this year, Moscow appeared determined to deal with Rukban. Syria and Russia set up two ""humanitarian corridors"" in February for civilians to leave. In March, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote a tweet, later deleted, that read: ""We appeal to the entire international community to support the idea of liquidating the Rukban camp, this hotbed of violence, crime..."" More than 17,000 people -- some 42% of the initial 41,700 -- have left since late March, the UN says. Russia and Syria have accused the US of blocking the departure of the rest, with Moscow slamming the US presence in the area as an ""occupation."" The US has denied these claims. People are leaving ""in part because Russia and the (Syrian) Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs,"" Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson says, adding that the displaced ""must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation."" Living within the US deconfliction zone has provided de-facto cover from the aerial bombardments, ISIS attacks and arbitrary arrests that have been reported in other areas outside the government's control, experts and those in Rukban say. Nearly everyone in Rukban wants to leave, a recent UN survey found. But ""there is a trust issue,"" says the World Food Program's Marwa Awad, who was in Rukban in February. ""People are afraid of coming out because of the process that might unfold afterward."" Many fear arrest if they return to regime areas, according to Shehab. Families worry ""about their young guys because there are rumors, they have been conscripted."" 'From bad to worse' Since the last aid convoy reached Rukban, life has gone ""from bad to worse,"" Shehab says. Shehab's granddaughter's health has improved since those sleepless nights, weeks ago, but he now faces new hurdles. Her mother has been unable to make enough milk for her, putting Shehab on the hunt for one of the settlement's most coveted and rarest commodities: baby formula. Related: Syrian girl dies after saving sister's life in airstrike photo After much effort, Shehab says he secured two boxes for about 30,000 SYP ($60) each. Food enters Rukban via smuggling routes, and the prices are high but ""the most important thing is that it's coming in,"" Shehab says. All sides eschew their responsibility by claiming those in Rukban have the choice to leave. But for civilians in Syria, there is very seldom a good way out of their problems. I will not leave the camp because I refuse to return to the areas controlled by the Assad regime. Shukri Shehab In areas previously under Syrian government siege, the choice given to civilians was surrender or starve. During US-led offensives against ISIS, people could flee or risk becoming collateral damage. In ISIS-held territory the choice was often between allegiance or death. Shehab has faced these choices before. He fled ISIS and the regime in two cities within a year before arriving in Rukban. ""I will not leave the camp because I refuse to return to the areas controlled by the Assad regime,"" Shehab says. ""Unfortunately, there is no hope for a solution anytime soon.""

It is certainly less efficient that the Germans 6 million in about 3–4 years (not to add the others) or in Rwanda, where they butchered (with machetes) 600.000 in six months.

They conjure up visions of large, sophisticated investors with an inside track making millions on a single stock transaction. For better or worse, that's more the “TV version” of IPOs than the reality. True, some IPOs succeed in creating overnight millionaires. But it's likely most of those investors were already close to becoming millionaires before the IPO. For the average investor, IPOs may prove to be only a little bit more profitable than ordinary stock investing. Maybe you'll make a lot of money on a single trade, and maybe you won't. But is an IPO Investment worth your time and money? What Is an IPO? An initial public offering is the first sale of shares on the stock market by a formerly private company. It's when a company “goes public.” Investing in an IPO is a lot like playing a video game — you need to hit the right button at just the right moment. And unfortunately, for most of us, the right moment is before the actual IPO takes place. A company's founders and private equity investors usually make some of the most significant gains from an IPO. That's because, within the first few minutes of trading, a stock can spike by 20% to 50% — or more. That means, even if you placed a buy order before the market opens, you'll still be getting in at a higher price. How Do I Invest in an IPO? You'll need to work with an investment brokerage firm that handles IPO transactions. Not all do, so you shouldn't assume the broker where you currently trade offers them. E*TRADE and TD Ameritrade, are some of the brokers we like that offer IPOs. You'll need to have your account up and running before the IPO hits the market.Because IPOs are somewhat more complicated than trading existing stocks, you'll want to be sure your account is in place, and you're familiar with the process of purchasing IPOs. We highly recommend a phone chat with a representative of the brokerage firm.It's also important to understand that it's unlikely you'll get the initial offering price on the stock. That price will go to the very first investors who get in on the IPO. But once the trading starts, price action can get wild. The price may go higher or lower, and dramatically so in either case.Should the stock begin running up immediately out of the gate, you may pay $60 for a stock that opened at $40 — on the very same day.What could've been an excellent investment at $40 may not be so attractive at $60. You can protect yourself by setting a limit order at, say, $45. That way, you don't get caught chasing the stock up to an unrealistic price level. Where Can I Find Out About Upcoming IPOs? Be careful in getting caught up in rumors of IPOs. They abound, but they're mostly media speculation. Often, it's an analyst citing the benefit of a particular company going public. The media then picks up the story, and inertia takes it from there. Do Your Homework Before You Invest in IPOs A lot of hype surrounds many IPOs, and that's exactly what you need to avoid. The hype is nothing more than speculation about miracle moneymaking activities that have no place in reality. Remember that those companies looking to go public are still in some phase of early growth. While that growth might be rapid early on — often due to the lack of competition — they can easily run into unexpected headwinds following the IPO. What looked like a can't-miss opportunity could quickly turn into a financial disaster. Make sure you perform due diligence on any company you're considering investing in. The fact that it's an IPO makes it no different from any other company you would consider buying. Information leading up to IPOs can be notoriously scarce precisely because the company is private. But the company will issue a preliminary prospectus, sometimes referred to as a “red herring.” The issuer and lead underwriter provide the prospectus. It includes the typical information available on a publicly-traded company. You should also view any IPO with a healthy respect for reality. No matter how promising a company may look on paper or by presentation in the media, its stock can still crash and burn following the IPO for reasons no one anticipated before the fact. Why Do Companies File IPOs? A privately-owned company can grow only so big before capital for continued growth becomes scarce. For example, their main capital sources during the early growth phase may be venture capital or even bank loans. But there's a limit to how much money can be accessed through those sources. What's more, bank loans require loan payments. And venture capitalists expect a certain return on their money. It's just a question of time before a fast-growing company needs to consider going public to obtain the capital they need. By going public, the company avoids the debt obligation that comes with bank financing and the control factors that may be imposed by venture capitalists. This is the basic reason companies go public. Virtually every one of the companies listed on public exchanges had to make that transition at some point. The ability to raise capital through the sale of stock is the reason so many companies have gotten as large as they are. Historical Returns of IPOs The screenshot below, created by iPreo, shows the performance of IPOs versus the S&P 500 between 2009 and 2018. Risks of Investing in an IPO Before even considering investing in an IPO, you should be aware that they don't always have a happy ending. One celebrated recent example is Uber. The stock went public in May 2019, at $41.57 per share. It climbed as high as $46.38 on June 28 but then began to struggle. It reached a low of $21.33 on March 20, 2020, then recovered. As of July 27, 2020, the price is $30.99. Had you pounced on Uber when it opened, you'd be sitting on a loss of approximately 25% over a space of just 14 months. And that even includes the general stock market rebound that's taken place since late March. If you want to invest in IPOs, be sure to learn all you can about the company before it goes public. The fact that it's going public doesn't give it value, but it's very easy to get caught up in that misguided belief. You should also avoid the temptation to get caught up in the excitement of the moment. IPOs can be overrated — if a company is a good investment, it'll be a good investment well after the IPO. In fact, it may even be better to wait until after the IPO, when the price of the stock stabilizes or even drops as the excitement dies down. Also, make sure you don't get carried away with IPO investments. Limit participation to no more than 10% of your portfolio. That way, if the IPO goes against you, the loss won't be catastrophic. IPO Investment is Risky, So Do Your Research With any stock investment, you need to understand the fundamentals of the company's business. An IPO Investment adds the wildcard factors of the somewhat arbitrary offering price, the volatility of the opening minutes of trading, and the effects of those first-day price changes. But for most of us, an IPO investment is just too risky. And there's currently an added challenge to IPO investing. Simply put, the IPO calendar is relatively empty. This has resulted in investors and investment dollars chasing fewer opportunities, adding to the volatility. More companies are choosing to be acquired by another company rather than becoming an independent public company. Others are choosing to stay private much longer than they could, partly due to the variety of investors they have attracted.",2021-03-06T15:27:31.332Z,"Should I apply for all upcoming IPOs? ",Quora

And everything is supported by the principles of basic physics!  The well known 97% Cook study is “not needed anymore”. Several newer studies finds an even higer consensus:  The consensus among publishing scientists is demonstrably not 97%. Instead, five surveys of the peer-reviewed literature from 1991 to 2015 combine to 54,195 articles with an average consensus of 99.94%. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/... During 2013 and 2014, only 4 of 69,406 authors of peer-reviewed articles on global warming, 0.0058% or 1 in 17,352, rejected AGW. Thus, the consensus on AGW among publishing scientists is above 99.99%, verging on unanimity.[...] The peer-reviewed literature contains no convincing evidence against AGW. http://www.rescuethatfrog.com/wp... List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations  There is no cohesive, consistent alternative theory to human-caused global warming, Some blame global warming on the sun, others on orbital cycles of other planets, others on ocean cycles, and so on. There is a 97% expert consensus on a cohesive theory that's overwhelmingly supported by the scientific evidence, but the 2–3% of papers that reject that consensus are all over the map, even contradicting each other. The one thing they seem to have in common is methodological flaws like cherry picking, curve fitting, ignoring inconvenient data, and disregarding known physics.  Those 3% of scientific papers that deny climate change? A review found them all flawed If any of the contrarians were a modern-day Galileo, he would present a theory that’s supported by the scientific evidence and that’s not based on methodological errors. This study Climate variations analyzed five million years back in time shows that the interglacial periods, like the one we are in now, are ALWAYS stable. So the rapid warming we see now in the OPPOSITE direction to the natural slow cooling trend, is very very unnatural. It got human fingerprints all over it.  If the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. A very clear human fingerprint.  Annual global temperature change (thin light red) with 11 year moving average of temperature (thick dark red). Temperature from NASA GISS. Annual Total Solar Irradiance (thin light blue) with 11 year moving average of TSI (thick dark blue). TSI from 1880 to 1978 from Krivova et al 2007 (data). TSI from 1979 to 2009 from PMOD. Its basic physics. The signals are coming from the planet itself: There are OBSERVED data from pollen, tree rings, ice cores, corals, glaciers withdrawal, polar ice melting, sea level rise, ocean temperature, ecological changes, Co2 levels in the atmosphere, the undeniable temperature increase globally. Do you think there is a another explaination for global warming which just happen to have exactly the same characteristics as an increase of C02 and the other greenhouse gases? The other factors can’t make all the check marks.  Natural cycles can only move heat around, as heat exchange within the oceans or from the oceans to the atmosphere. But now we see adding of heat both in oceans and the atmosphere. So the adding of heat to the energy budget we see now must come from somewhere else than natural cycles. Look at the spike to the right. Thats because of us.  This is the scary smoking gun: THE HUMAN INFLUENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IS SO STRONG WE ARE MAKING THE PLANET RAPIDLY WARM IN A TIME WHEN IT SHOULD BE SLOWLY COOLING!! We see very rapid warming, in the OPPOSITE direction of the natural slow cooling trend. We have ocean level rise, and the sea is getting warmer, the surface temperatures are getting higher, the Greenland ice is melting, the Arctic sea ice melts, even in Antarctica there is a record low on ice. It can only be one explanation; Human influence is now the dominant factor for climate change.

Fight for clean water and less pollution, but you cannot fight the sun and climate change as they are bound together. We are not at war with the climate and we are an insignificant force. Solar cycles and cloud variability are far more relevant to climate change. Our industrialization with the power of fossil fuels has only a local and minimal effect on the weather and the climate and that effect is mostly cooling, not warming from the dimming effect of pollution particles. Temperatures are not rising and the alarmist predictions all run too hot. There is no evidence based climate crisis. Here is a chart with temperature data over 300 years and the result his ho hum from 1700 until today.  All the alarmist predictions run too hot and to make a case for a crisis the leaders stooped to data manipulation with Michael Mann exposed by Tim Ball and James Hansen tampering to change history the most guilty culprits.   It is very relevant that many scientists working for the UN IPCC are skeptical of their own organizations shoddy science claiming that human emissions of CO2 plant food are making the climate too hot.

IPCC “We’ve got to ride this global warming issue.Even if the theory of global warming is wrong,we will be doing the right thing in terms ofeconomic and environmental policy.“– Timothy Wirth Fmr President of the UN Foundation *** 46 ENLIGHTENING statements by IPCC experts against the IPCC : 1. Dr Robert Balling: The IPCC notes that “No significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise during the 20th century has been detected.” This did not appear in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers. 2. Dr Lucka Bogataj: “Rising levels of airborne carbon dioxide don’t cause global temperatures to rise…. temperature changed first and some 700 years later a change in aerial content of carbon dioxide followed.” 3. Dr John Christy: “Little known to the public is the fact that most of the scientists involved with the IPCC do not agree that global warming is occurring. Its findings have been consistently misrepresented and/or politicized with each succeeding report.” 4. Dr Rosa Compagnucci: “Humans have only contributed a few tenths of a degree to warming on Earth. Solar activity is a key driver of climate.” 5. Dr Richard Courtney: “The empirical evidence strongly indicates that the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis is wrong.” 6. Dr Judith Curry: “I’m not going to just spout off and endorse the IPCC because I don’t have confidence in the process.” 7. Dr Robert Davis: “Global temperatures have not been changing as state of the art climate models predicted they would. Not a single mention of satellite temperature observations appears in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers.” 8. Dr Willem de Lange: “In 1996 the IPCC listed me as one of approximately 3000 “scientists” who agreed that there was a discernible human influence on climate. I didn’t. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that runaway catastrophic climate change is due to human activities.” 9. Dr Chris de Freitas: “Government decision-makers should have heard by now that the basis for the long-standing claim that carbon dioxide is a major driver of global climate is being questioned; along with it the hitherto assumed need for costly measures to restrict carbon dioxide emissions. If they have not heard, it is because of the din of global warming hysteria that relies on the logical fallacy of ‘argument from ignorance’ and predictions of computer models.” 10. Dr Oliver Frauenfeld: “Much more progress is necessary regarding our current understanding of climate and our abilities to model it.” 11. Dr Peter Dietze: “Using a flawed eddy diffusion model, the IPCC has grossly underestimated the future oceanic carbon dioxide uptake.” 12. Dr John Everett: “It is time for a reality check. The oceans and coastal zones have been far warmer and colder than is projected in the present scenarios of climate change. I have reviewed the IPCC and more recent scientific literature and believe that there is not a problem with increased acidification, even up to the unlikely levels in the most-used IPCC scenarios.” 13. Dr Eigil Friis-Christensen: “The IPCC refused to consider the sun’s effect on the Earth’s climate as a topic worthy of investigation. The IPCC conceived its task only as investigating potential human causes of climate change.” 14. Dr Lee Gerhard: “I never fully accepted or denied the anthropogenic global warming concept until the furore started after NASA’s James Hansen’s wild claims in the late 1980s. I went to the [scientific] literature to study the basis of the claim, starting with first principles. My studies then led me to believe that the claims were false.” 15. Dr Indur Goklany: “Climate change is unlikely to be the world’s most important environmental problem of the 21st century. There is no signal in the mortality data to indicate increases in the overall frequencies or severities of extreme weather events, despite large increases in the population at risk.” 16. Dr Vincent Gray: “The [IPCC] climate change statement is an orchestrated litany of lies.” 17. Dr Mike Hulme: “Claims such as ‘2500 of the world’s leading scientists have reached a consensus that human activities are having a significant influence on the climate’ are disingenuous … The actual number of scientists who backed that claim was only a few dozen.” 18. Dr Kiminori Itoh: “There are many factors which cause climate change. Considering only greenhouse gases is nonsense and harmful.” 19. Dr Yuri Izrael: “There is no proven link between human activity and global warming. I think the panic over global warming is totally unjustified. There is no serious threat to the climate.” 20. Dr Steven Japar: “Temperature measurements show that the climate model-predicted mid-troposphere hot zone is non-existent. This is more than sufficient to invalidate global climate models and projections made with them.” 21. Dr Georg Kaser: “This number [of receding glaciers reported by the IPCC] is not just a little bit wrong, it is far out by any order of magnitude … It is so wrong that it is not even worth discussing.” 22. Dr Aynsley Kellow: “I’m not holding my breath for criticism to be taken on board, which underscores a fault in the whole peer review process for the IPCC: there is no chance of a chapter [of the IPCC report] ever being rejected for publication, no matter how flawed it might be.” 23. Dr Madhav Khandekar: “I have carefully analysed adverse impacts of climate change as projected by the IPCC and have discounted these claims as exaggerated and lacking any supporting evidence.” 24. Dr Hans Labohm: “The alarmist passages in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers have been skewed through an elaborate and sophisticated process of spin-doctoring.” 25. Dr Andrew Lacis: “There is no scientific merit to be found in the Executive Summary. The presentation sounds like something put together by Greenpeace activists and their legal department.” 26. Dr Chris Landsea: “I cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound.” 27. Dr Richard Lindzen: “The IPCC process is driven by politics rather than science. It uses summaries to misrepresent what scientists say and exploits public ignorance.” 28. Dr Harry Lins: “Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. The case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated.” 29. Dr Philip Lloyd: “I am doing a detailed assessment of the IPCC reports and the Summaries for Policy Makers, identifying the way in which the Summaries have distorted the science. I have found examples of a summary saying precisely the opposite of what the scientists said.” 30. Dr Martin Manning: “Some government delegates influencing the IPCC Summary for Policymakers misrepresent or contradict the lead authors.” 31. Dr Stephen McIntyre: “The many references in the popular media to a ‘consensus of thousands of scientists’ are both a great exaggeration and also misleading.” 32. Dr Patrick Michaels: “The rates of warming, on multiple time scales, have now invalidated the suite of IPCC climate models. No, the science is not settled.” 33. Dr Nils-Axel Morner: “If you go around the globe, you find no sea level rise anywhere.” 34. Dr Johannes Oerlemans: “The IPCC has become too political. Many scientists have not been able to resist the siren call of fame, research funding and meetings in exotic places that awaits them if they are willing to compromise scientific principles and integrity in support of the man-made global-warming doctrine.” 35. Dr Roger Pielke: “All of my comments were ignored without even a rebuttal. At that point, I concluded that the IPCC Reports were actually intended to be advocacy documents designed to produce particular policy actions, but not a true and honest assessment of the understanding of the climate system.” 36. Dr Paul Reiter: “As far as the science being ‘settled,’ I think that is an obscenity. The fact is the science is being distorted by people who are not scientists.” 37. Dr Murray Salby: “I have an involuntary gag reflex whenever someone says the science is settled. Anyone who thinks the science is settled on this topic is in fantasia.” 38. Dr Tom Segalstad: “The IPCC global warming model is not supported by the scientific data.” 39. Dr Fred Singer: “Isn’t it remarkable that the Policymakers Summary of the IPCC report avoids mentioning the satellite data altogether, or even the existence of satellites — probably because the data show a slight cooling over the last 18 years, in direct contradiction of the calculations from climate models?” 40. Dr Hajo Smit: “There is clear cut solar-climate coupling and a very strong natural variability of climate on all historical time scales. Currently I hardly believe anymore that there is any relevant relationship between human CO2 emissions and climate change.” 41. Dr Richard Tol: “The IPCC attracted more people with political rather than academic motives. In AR4, green activists held key positions in the IPCC and they succeeded in excluding or neutralising opposite voices.” 42. Dr Tom Tripp: “There is so much of a natural variability in weather it makes it difficult to come to a scientifically valid conclusion that global warming is man made.” 43. Dr Gerd-Rainer Weber: “Most of the extremist views about climate change have little or no scientific basis.” 44. Dr David Wojick: “The public is not well served by this constant drumbeat of alarms fed by computer models manipulated by advocates.” 45. Dr Miklos Zagoni: “I am positively convinced that the anthropogenic global warming theory is wrong.” 46. Dr Eduardo Zorita: “Editors, reviewers and authors of alternative studies, analysis, interpretations, even based on the same data we have at our disposal, have been bullied and subtly blackmailed.” Via : 46 statements by IPCC experts against the IPCC | grumpydenier * BIOGRAPHIES of IPCC SCIENTISTS 1.

Photo: NASA, public domain At Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site, the two experts have reviewed the recent literature on CO2’s ability to warm the globe, which we call CO2 climate sensitivity. Their conclusion: estimations of CO2 climate sensitivity are “in a free-fall”.=================================================== CO2-climate sensitivity in a free-fall: New from the scientific literature By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin) Numerous new studies show that the previously assumed estimate value used by the IPCC of 3.0°C warming per doubling of CO2 is far too high. In 2013 a publication by von Otto et al. suggested 2.0°C, a thunderbolt. […] Today again we have a collection of newly published results that vary over a broad range in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and the short-term Transient Climate Response (TCR). The usually given quoted values are the ECS values. ECS: Equilibrium climate sensitivity Up to 6°C Proistosescu & Huybers 2017Press release here; A truly alarm-fraught paper that is trying to be the quoted in the 6th IPCC report and to drive the mean value of all studies upwards. Nic Lewis dismantled the paper in detail at Climate Audit. 3,7°C Brown & Caldeira 2017This one as well is an upper range outlier. It draws the research funding. 2,8°C Cox et al. 2018; limitation to 2.2-3.4°CPress release here. The German press reported on this energetically: FAZ, Tagesspiegel, Spektrum 1,79°C Mauritsen & Pincus 2017Also see post here at Die kalte Sonne. 1,4°C Orssengo 2018 1,3°C Spencer 2018Scenario: only 70% of the warming of the past 150 years is anthropogenic. The possible climate impact by the sun in most calculations of climate sensitivity is not included at all. By comparison in our ‘Die kalte Sonne’ book we present a 1.5°C scenario. That’s in the lower range of the IPCC AR5 report, 1.5-4.5°C. TCR: Transient Climate Response 1.32 °C Mauritsen & Pincus 2017See Die kalte-Sonne post here. 1.29°C Bosse 2017 1.10°C Christy & McNider 2017See report at WUWT. By comparison: the TCR average of all climate models in the IPCC AR5 report was 2.31°C. “Seismic shift” All this points to a seismic shift in the understanding of CO2 climate sensitivity in the now being drafted 6th IPCC Report. The ‘best estimated value’ will in any case move considerably downward. That of course is already causing a lot of bellyaching among the climate warriors, and so the world is preparing in advance for the changes. For example Knutti et al. 2017 wrote in Nature Geoscience, that in any case greenhouse gas emissions will have to limited, no matter if the CO2 climate sensitivity value is possibly lower: Beyond equilibrium climate sensitivity[…] Newer metrics relating global warming directly to the total emitted CO2 show that in order to keep warming to within 2 °C, future CO2 emissions have to remain strongly limited, irrespective of climate sensitivity being at the high or low end.” Here the authors are not mentioning that values at the lower end of the spectrum represent a less dramatic situation than a value at the higher end of the spectrum, which probably would have really supported a climate catastrophe. The time for justification has already started. Also just a few months ago Millar et al. 2017 had to admit that the climate models indeed had been running much too hot and that the 1.5°C target can be reached as well with a tripling of CO2 emissions. Others, however, simply just do not want to accept the new reality. A team led by Kate Marvel (among them also the known climate activist Gavin Schmidt) claimed in February, 2018, in the Geophysical Research Letters that the real temperature trend of the last decades are not suitable for calculating CO2 climate sensitivity. Much more correct would be the theoretical computer simulations. This left some speechless. Nic Lewis analyzed the paper and discovered a number of problems. WOW reality is wrong and theoretical computer models are right - such audacity or ignorance? (Hopefully rare to the climate science rogues?) Let the climate sensitivity bazar open! The run-up to the IPCC 6th Report is already seeing much wrangling. Both sides are going full throttle in the effort of getting their view documented for future quoting. Now the most absurd publications can make their way through if peer-reviewers with similar views can be found. “Seismic Shift” In Climate Science… IPCC CO2-Induced Warming Estimate “Far Too High”…”In A Free Fall” This just in from South America -  Huge cold coming to South America, Chile in particular has seen severe cold.

Hakkarainen gives us the conventional wisdom and it is wrong and this matters to disproving the greenhouse gas theory. Hakkarainen wrote: “Carbon dioxide is indeed well mixed in the atmosphere. This means that if we look at the CO2 concentrations globally, the value is about 400 ppm everywhere.” (That's 400 parts per million.)Dec 5, 2016 NO. Wrong Wrong Wrong. Also Hakkarainen admits: The human fingerprint in any given year is relatively small. “Human emissions within the past year may add only something like three parts per million to that total,” . Evidence is overwhelming that Carbon dioxide was not in equilibrium at 280 ppm and that it does not mix well and concentrations vary enormously around world. “3.2. CARBON DIOXIDE. Climate scientists think that by tucking the problem of water vapour under the carpet as a “feedback” it then releases them to place all their emphasis on the minor greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.. Beck (2007) has documented some 90,000 measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which have been made using chemical methods, since 1812. All of these were in respectable, peer-reviewed scientific journals and some of the authors were Nobel prize winners. They indicate that the concentration is highly variable. Trying to calculate “greenhouse forcing” from such a poorly characterised distribution is impossible. Figure 23 gives an example of atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements between 1800 and 1960 (Beck 2007) Figure 23 Atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements documented by Beck (2007) The IPCC has chosen to suppress all observations between those of Arrhenius (1865) and 1958.

Callendar, and Charles Keeling, on the importance of CO2 as the major driver of climate change. The linchpin in the IPCC argument is the assumption that prior to the industrial revolution, the level of atmospheric CO2 was in an equilibrium state of about 280 parts per million (ppm), around which little or no variation occurred. This presumption of constancy and equilibrium is based upon a selective review of the older literature on atmospheric CO2 content by Callendar, and later Keeling, of the University of California at San Diego, which essentially discounted all data not conforming to their preconceived notions of historical CO2 levels. (See Figure 1.) The truth is that between 1800 and 1961, more than 380 tech 180 Years of Atmospheric CO2 Gas Analysis by Chemical Methods Ernst-Georg Beck First Published March 1, 2007 Research Articl https://doi.org/10.1177/0958305X0701800206 Abstract More than 90,000 accurate chemical analyses of CO2 in air since 1812 are summarised. The historic chemical data reveal that changes in CO2 track changes in temperature, and therefore climate in contrast to the simple, monotonically increasing CO2 trend depicted in the post-1990 literature on climate-change. Since 1812, the CO2 concentration in northern hemispheric air has fluctuated exhibiting three high level maxima around 1825, 1857 and 1942 the latter showing more than 400 ppm. Between 1857 and 1958, the Pettenkofer process was the standard analytical method for determining atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and usually achieved an accuracy better than 3%. These determinations were made by several scientists of Nobel Prize level distinction. Following Callendar (1938), modern climatologists have generally ignored the historic determinations of CO2, despite the techniques being standard text book procedures in several different disciplines. Chemical methods were discredited as unreliable choosing only few which fit the assumption of a climate CO2 connection. Carbon dioxide fluctuates with the seasons, as plants and phytoplankton soak up more carbon during spring and summer and less in the winter. This Beck graph 2007 debunks the linear graphing of CO2 with only the reconstructions at the Mauna Loa observatory. 2. Climate science (UN) “permits” only the following variations in CO2 content of air. The left picture is erroneous. UN published a distorted view of history of natural science and postulated that there were no accurate measurements prior to 1958. This study is able to prove that there are more than 90 000 direct accurate measurements of CO2 used to reconstruct the real CO2 contour over the last 200 years.

Satellite Detects Human Contribution to Atmospheric CO2  180 YEARS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2 GAS ANALYSIS BY CHEMICAL METHODS by Ernst-Georg Beck “A major issue regarding the IPCC approach to linking climate and CO2 is the assumption that prior to the industrial revolution the level of atmospheric CO2 was in an equilibrium state of about 280 ppm, around which little or no variation occurred. This presumption of constancy and equilibrium is based upon a critical review of the older literature on atmospheric CO2 content by Callendar and Keeling. “The data accepted by Callendar and Keeling had to be sufficiently low to be consistent with the greenhouse hypothesis of climate change controlled by rising CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning. “Natural concentrations are assumed to have been in equilibrium until mankind disturbed the natural situation. In this way, any long term observations that might display decadal to centennial natural variations in atmospheric CO2 are ruled out a priori by Callendar and Keeling. Their most egregious error was perhaps the dismissal of all data which showed variations from their presupposed average.” The truth is that between 1800 and 1961, more than 380 technical papers were published on air gas analysis containing data on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Callendar [16, 20, 24], Keeling, and the IPCC did not provide a thorough evaluation of these papers and the standard chemical methods that they employed. Rather, they discredited these techniques and data, rejecting most as faulty or highly inaccurate [20, 22, 23, 25-27]. (See Table 1.) Although Callendar and Keeling acknowledge the concept of an “unpolluted background level” for CO2 , these authors examined only about 10 percent of the available literature, asserting from that, that only 1 percent of all previous data could be viewed as accurate, specifically that of Münz [28-30], Reiset [31], and Buch [32]. During my own review of the literature, I observed that the evaluation of the work of Reiset and Münz by Callendar and Keeling was erroneous. This spurred me to investigate carefully the criteria used by these and other authors to accept, or to reject, such historical data. The stated intent of these authors was to identify CO2 determinations that were made using pure, unpolluted air in order to assess the true background level of CO2 1 however, Callendar set out the actual criteria that he used to judge whether older determinations were “allowable” in his 1958 paper [20]. There, Callendar presented only data that fell within 10 percent of a longer yearly average estimate for the region. He rejected all measure CarbonDioxide - Climate Realism Canada  Beck data on CO2 shows “there is a big problem with the Keeling curve beginning in 1960.” Ned Nikolov, Ph.D. It does not represent reality.

UCILIA WANG DECEMBER 15, 2009  NASA Releases New CO2 Data, Refutes Conventional Wisdom 7SAN FRANCISCO -- NASA has released the first-ever set of carbon dioxide data based only on daily observations by a satellite instrument, a new tool that will help researchers study climate change and improve weather predictions. The data came from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) that NASA launched aboard its Aqua spacecraft in 2002. Since then, AIRS has amassed information about carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, methane and temperatures in the mid-troposphere (see multimedia presentations). The mid-troposphere is about three to seven miles above the Earth's surface. For carbon dioxide, AIRS measures and tracks its concentration and movement as it moves across the globe. Observation data is critical for scientists to validate their models or adjust them to better predict the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the weather and climate. The data have already refuted a long-held belief that carbon dioxide is evenly distributed and do so fairly quickly in the atmosphere once it rises from the ground, said Moustafa Chahine, the science team leader of the AIRS project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in San Francisco Tuesday. WHITE PAPERS The Need and Opportunity to Enable Flexible Demand Response in the U.S. DOWNLOAD > Leveraging the Cloud for a Resilient, Secure, and Customer-Centric Utility DOWNLOAD > ""Contrary to the prevailing wisdom, carbon dioxide is not well mixed in the mid-troposphere,"" Chahine said. ""You can see the jet stream splitting the carbon dioxide clump."" AIRS data shows instead that carbon dioxide, which has seen its rate of increase accelerating from 1 part per million in 1955 to 2 parts per million today, would require about two to three years before it blends in, he said. The atmosphere currently has about 400 parts per million. How well and how quickly carbon dioxide blends in is important for understanding how much and how long carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere and affects the climate before some of it is scooped up by Earth's natural scrubbers, such as the ocean. And by extension, that knowledge would be crucial in determining what humans must do to minimize their emissions or use technologies to capture and sequester their carbon dioxide pollution before it escapes into the atmosphere. Chahine said several climate models have assumed an even distribution because researchers didn't have adequate data to show how the carbon dioxide is vertically transported through the atmosphere. NASA Releases New CO2 Data, Refutes Conventional Wisdom 2. Temperature data for the past century does not support unusual global warming. Temperatures always precedes rise in CO2 so there is no correlation essential to show that CO2 causes warming.  Many scientist cling to Michael Mann’s unethical erasure of Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age because it contradicts their global warming narrative that lacks recognition of climate variability and temperature oscillations. 3. Will electric cars reduce CO2 emissions? No they are worse now than even diesel transportation and there is no future where is can be reasonably predicted to improve. German Public Television Report: “Electric Cars A Swindle” …”Rolling Climate-Killers” By P Gosselin on 1. July 2018 Germany is a country that madly rushed in all earnest into green energies without any planning and thought some 10 years ago. Electric cars of course were envisioned as being a key part of the green energy transition, dubbed the Energiewende. Fortunately, since then, some are beginning to wake up to the harsh reality of “green” energy. 10 years later, despite the now 56 gigawatts of installed wind capacity and 40 gigawatts of installed solar capacity, the country still relies on fossil fuels for more than half of its energy supply. That fact and all the batteries needed make e-cars a fake green dream. “Eco-Swindle E-Auto” This all means that over the long term electric cars in Germany are still more CO2 intensive than regular gasoline powered cars, according to a recent report titled “Eco-Swindle E-Auto” on DW German public television: According to moderator Thomas Spahn, e-cars in Germany are not living up at all to the promises of being environmentally friendly. Quite to the contrary. “It’s a pity that this climate friendly vision still fails the test of reality,” he says. Worse than diesel automobiles According to Spahn of DW, the Stockholm Environmental Research Institute (IVL) calculated that just the production of the batteries for a Tesla S car spews some 17 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere and that this is just as bad for the environment as a diesel or gasoline engine after being on the road 200,000 kilometers! What’s worse, according to Spahn, is that in Germany the CO2 performance of e-cars is even worse because more than half the power that is needed to charge the e-vehicles is generated from coal or gas fuel, and thus he calls e-cars “rolling climate killers”. “Illusion” and “self-delusion” According to Spahn, e-cars won’t be clean until all electric power in Germany gets produced exclusively by green energies. But that will take decades. Until then, climate-friendly e-cars unfortunately will remain an illusion. But let’s be honest, self-delusion is indeed the nicest when you can share it with many others.” German online daily SHZ here wrote: Raw material processing and the production of batteries in plants account for about 80% of the total environmental burden.” German Public Television Report: “Electric Cars A Swindle” …”Rolling Climate-Killers” The role of firm power in deep decarbonization  George Hagstrom, works at Princeton University Posted Sep 24 The falling cost of renewable power capacity has been in the news lately. While these cost decreases are very encouraging for our ability to decarbonize cheaply, the reporting on this sector has lead many to draw the wrong conclusions about how we should decarbonize our power sector. In particular, politicians and journalists alike do not appreciate well enough how much variable renewable energy (VRE) differs from firm/dispatchable energy sources like nuclear power or fossil fuels. Thus, much of the public discourse surrounding decarbonization focuses on the idea that we should build a power grid based on 100% VRE power. If this were in fact feasible, it would make economic arguments against building and developing nuclear power compelling.While appealing, this 100% VRE plan puts too little emphasis on stochasticity and the different properties of power sources, and therefore risks making decarbonization more expensive, more resource and land intensive, and more dependent on technological breakthroughs which may not be forthcoming.Here I link to some excellent research which explains the difficulties of integrating large quantities of VRE into power grids. These studies find that the total system cost increases dramatically as VRE penetration approaches 100%. Using firm low carbon such as nuclear power in combination with VREs leads to significantly lower total system costs, even assuming high costs for nuclear power (even their cheapest nuclear scenario is above the cost of nuclear in places which build a lot of it like South Korea or China, though it is perhaps a good conservative estimate for how cheap nuclear can get in the US) . An aggressive pursuit/buildout of nuclear power thus helps cheapen decarbonization and acts as a technological hedge.I will link to a research article and a podcast. The podcast is simpler to understand, and the research article contains all the details. Plenty of similar research exists, but I chose to link to the most well known/reasonably recent study. Broader knowledge of these ideas should help improve the intellectual level of the debate around how different countries should decarbonize. Firm low-carbon energy resourcesThe Role of Firm Low-Carbon Electricity Resources in Deep Decarbonization of Power Generation The alarmist scientists have been guilty of fudging and tampering with climate data always in one direction to make a new and warmer fake reality. Isn’t this a hint that there is something rotten going on? THE EARTH IS COOLING ACCORDING TO NOAA DATA  But here is detailed temperature research based on data from NOAA’s own data base that exposes a clear decline in temperatures around the world. If the climate catastrophe is so darn obvious, as alarmist like to paint it, then shouldn’t the website of one of its main proponents support the claim? Because, despite all their data tampering, NOAA have failed to hide the fact that the past 5 years have seen a significant COOLING TREND ACROSS THE PLANET. The agency hasn’t officially reported it, of course, and have no-doubt minimized the extent of the decrease, but at the same time, they have been unable to hide the decline, which is telling. Earth is suffering its weakest solar cycle of the past 100+ years (with the next one -25- forecast to be the lowest of the past 200 years). This sharp decline in solar activity is now, after a brief 10-or-so year lag, beginning to show-up on the global thermometer record. Using the same data tool NOAA cites in its latest report (released Jan, 2020) as well as the same 5-year time-frame, it is revealed that global temperatures declined at a rate of 0.13C per decade between 2015-2019. This is a substantial drop–one at almost TWICE the official avg. rate of increase since 1880, according to the NOAA report: “The global annual temperature has increased at an avg. rate of 0.07C (0.13F) per decade since 1880.”  Global Land & Ocean Temperature Anomalies 2015-2019 (Climate at a Glance).  The rate of cooling is even faster when you remove Ocean Temperature Anomalies from the equation and instead look at just the Land Anomalies — the global cooling then is a staggering 0.30C per decade: Global Land Temperature Anomalies 2015-2019 (Climate at a Glance). This makes sense given temps in the vast oceans shift slower than those on the land. However, when it comes to ocean temperature reporting, NOAA’s past is a particularly checkered one, so who really knows… The Northern Hemisphere Land and Ocean temperatures are dropping, too — at 0.20C per decade: Northern Hemisphere Land & Ocean Temperature Anomalies 2015-2019 (Climate at a Glance). With the Land-only cooling at a staggering 0.50C per decade: Northern Hemisphere Land Temperature Anomalies 2015-2019 (Climate at a Glance). And the decline is even more dramatic across other regions of the globe: · North America, 2.03C decline  Atlantic MDR, decline of 0.72C  Caribbean Islands, 0.73C decline  East N Pacific, 1.64C decline ·  The Earth has been substantially cooling for half a decade now, with even the most warm-mongering of official datasets saying so. And looking ahead, the coming years will undoubtedly deliver more ups and downs, as always; but for those who monitor the Sun, the trend is expected to be one of continually-declining temperatures in line with historically low solar activity, cloud-nucleating Cosmic Rays, and a meridional jet stream flow. Don’t fall for bogus political agendas from government agencies that have had their day — our future is one of ever-descending COLD. Crime Doesn't Pay - NOAA's Budget to be Cut by 31%, as Global Average Temperatures Take a Tumble - Electroverse Climate alarmism versus integrity at National Academies of Science Charles Rotter / 6 hours ago June 29, 2020 Reposted from CFACT  By David Wojick |June 28th, 2020|Climate National Academies of Science should speak out against climate alarmism, not support it. This is the major message in a recent letter from Professor Guus Berkhout, president of CLINTEL, to the new head of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. The integrity of science is at stake. This letter is a model for how all alarmist National Academies should be addressed. For example, the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is painfully alarmist. Even worse, NAS has been joined in promoting alarmism by its two siblings, the National Academies of Engineering and Medicine. The fact that these Academies have become a servant of supranational political organizations such as IPCC shows how serious the crisis in climate science really is. The Netherlands Academy is called KNAW, from its Dutch name. KNAW was established in 1808 as an advisory body to the government, a task it still performs today. NAS was established by Congress in 1868. Both NAS and KNAW derive their authority from their high profile members, rigorously selected top scientists from a large range of scientific fields. Professor Berkhout is a member of KNAW. The letter is addressed to Prof. Dr. Ineke Sluiter, President of KNAW. It begins with a clear statement of the issue: “I am addressing you in your capacity as the new President of the KNAW because the climate issue is escalating. The IPCC and the associated activist climate movement have become highly politicised. Sceptical scientists are being silenced. As an IPCC expert reviewer, I critically looked at the latest draft climate report. My conclusion is that there is little evidence of any intent to discover the objective scientific truth. Though IPCC’s doomsday scenarios are far from representative of reality, they play an important role in government climate policy. Only courageous individuals dare to point out that the predictions of the IPCC’s computer models of climate have not come to pass, in that contemporary measurements contradict them. IPCC’s confidence in its own models does not match the real-world outturn. In the past, scientific societies such as ours would have sounded the alarm. (Emphasis added.) In your interview with Elsevier Weekblad (6 June 2020) you say: “Dutch science should be proud of itself” and, a little later, “A hallmark of high-quality research must be a wide variety of viewpoints – fewer dogmas, more viewpoints.” I agree. Unfortunately, your observations do not seem to apply to climate science. There, diversity is suppressed and the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) dogma is promoted. That is why I am writing to you.” After discussing the well known problems with the IPCC science, Professor Berkhout states his case: “Why do scientific institutions not warn society that all these climate-change doom and gloom scenarios have little or no scientific justification? I know that there are many scientists around the world who doubt or disagree with the IPCC’s claims. I also know from my own experience and from correspondence with colleagues that there is much pressure on researchers to conform to what we are told is the climate “consensus”. But the history of science shows time and again that new insights do not come from followers but from critical thinkers. For valid new insights, measurements trump models. The KNAW, as the guardian of science, must surely take action now. The more governments invest in expensive climate policies in the name of climate science, the more difficult it becomes to point out that climate science in its present state falls a long way short of providing any justification for such policies. There are more and more indications that things are not right. If the scientific community waits for the dam to burst, the damage to science will be enormous. Society will then rightly ask itself the question: why were the Academies of Sciences silent? Surely there has been enough warning from scientific critics of the official position? The KNAW must, of course, stay clear of politics and focus on excellence in finding the truth. But I repeat that the KNAW is also the guardian of science. In climate policy in particular, science is abused on a global scale. How can one plausibly state, on such a highly complex subject as the Earth’s climate, that “the science is settled”? That is not excellence: it is stupidity.” There is a lot more and the letter ends with a specific proposal from CLINTEL: “I propose to organise an international open blue-team/red-team meeting together with the KNAW, in which both teams can present their scientific views†. These discussions could be the start of a new era in climate science. Audiatur et altera pars.” The US National Academy of Sciences is a lot worse than KNAW in this regard. Not only does NAS not speak out against the anti-scientific climate movement, it openly supports it. I know there are skeptical members of NAS, probably many. They need to speak out, just as Professor Berkhout has done. Nothing less than the integrity of science is at stake. Failure to acknowledge the scientific climate change debate is making science look like a political tool. This can only turn out badly for science.

When she married, for her honeymoon trip my father drove a small British sport-car from Hungary to Saint Moritz, Switzerland (5 day trip) with the suitcases carried by the Rolls Royce her aunt loaned …it was the largest model of R & R while Yugoslavia’s queen could only afford a medium sized RR. Then WW2 happened, with Nazi persecution of all Jews and Communist persecution of all capitalists…surviving was already a miracle and the loss of all our belongings totally unavoidable. My father left first for Italy, believing in a job that fizzled out, and when my mother with her two kids (12 and 10 ) followed him, we were lucky to be able to squeeze under the the fast closing iron curtain. In 1948 Italy was anything but prosperous. Our family had neither a source of income, nor any cash reserves except for a golden bracelet. We sub-rented a small part of an apartment the owner of which had been compromised with the previous regime. Our share was the entrance, and a small corridor where folding sofas could be placed…in the appartment there were 3 other under-tenants and the owner slept with his wife in his kitchen. One single bathroom and toilet for all, that implied that in the morning ring signals would indicate to each when the premises were available… My father was already over 56 and poorly suited to adjust to the new situation. My mother on the contrary had an exceptional background - for those days when women enjoyed only limited educational opportunities. She spoke fluent Italian and English (as well as 4 other languages) and had a good knowledge of the Italian Renaissance art. Getting a job ? Hopeless, unemployment was rife. She sub-rented part of a coffee shop in the centre of Florence (Via Tornabuoni) and opened the country’s first foreign tourist guiding office. At the time the only tourists were Americans and some had interest in the city’s art treasures…others in visiting and shopping. Florence has a long tradition of handicrafts, in post-war Italy textile, leather etc. stalls were the first to open. The stores were too happy to lend her clothes so that she would have the upper class look her job entailed…and also to pay her a commission whenever she brought a client. This kept the family above water…but when my father seemed to have landed a job in France, our 2 year Italian stay was over. The French 1950 situation was quite different. A law prevented the landlords to increase rents (called 1948 law) so when my father managed to rent a room in a small hotel, for himself and his two children, we were safely out of the street. Bathroom and toilet was available, one per floor…no kitchen facilities. My mother refused this situation. She rented in a four star hotel an attic location, usually reserved to house the staff…so when she met some upper class contacts, the lobby were she received them was far from shabby ! Again she had recruited some luxury stores, that would lend her clothes and pay a commission on whatever tourist customers she managed to bring/ To be able to survive this situation she resorted to a unique strategy : she pretended to herself that she was living in a masked bal, or in some kind of a nightmare and that she would awaken to her true previous prosperity. With on going years the financial situation improved somewhat…but for 44 years she kept up the illusion that her new condition was not for real. Daily she would walk to my father’s hotel, cook us a meal on a petrol stove, clean the dishes in the washbowl … and face the angry hotel owner who had prohibited all cooking in the rooms. (Sometimes she would be summoned by the police station, where they wanted to know why she did not obey the rules of the hotel : “because I need to feed two hungry children” ! was the answer…And the police would advise : “try to cook less smelly dishes !”) My father suffered in short order three strokes, so ha was of little help… As the years went on, she became in a luxury store first sales attendant, then sales manager…having been one of the best dressed women of Budapest, often featured in gossip magazine, she was able to build up a clientele. She had decided to ignore that she had become an employee who needed to follow whatever the owners would tell her to do. The motto my mother was very proud of, sounded : “To be nouveau-riche is no great feat, all it takes is money. To be nouveau-pauvre is not for everybody, it takes class !”",2021-03-06T15:31:20.311Z,"Why does the nation suffer from poverty? ",Quora

Economically it is getting there but I think they need to show more action and aggression than they currently they are, if they are to overcome those who bully them. Military is half decent compared to others but needs more R&D than imitation. Needs to be more transparent to most, if not atleast to its Allies. Transparency won't hurt them as much as some might think, it will alternately increase trust among Allies and others. We all know or at least we think we do about what goes on in Xinjiang, so you may as well show and tell us to just get with it or even correct us if you can. What can even the joke that is UN can do, impose another nonbinding resolution, oh please! All in all without another Great War or otherwise the fall of the current hegemony and its superpower leader, no one can take the place. So if you want China to have a chance to become “Earth’s Next Top Power” in a few years, you gotta pray either for the fall of the US and the Western hegemony or otherwise even worse, another Great War!

By contrast, China has problems, but we see and hear other things about China. Russia has problems, yet we see and read other things about Russia. That same standard should apply to Africa."" Outstanding Technologies in Africa By Sidee Dlamini, Class of 2015 To the unaware, Africa is still known as the Dark Continent; however, numerous trends continue to show how much progress has been made on the African continent. More importantly, there has been a lot of technological advancement that the majority of the world is unaware of. It is my belief that most of the issues faced by the continent will be solved through the use of technology. I envision technology being deeply implemented in government procedures such that efficiency is increased ten fold and corruption is greatly. Of course, technology isn’t the answer to all problems, but it has the capability to solve a few if not most. How might these visions be accomplished you might ask? Well, I myself am in pursuit of that answer, but for now, I would like to explore a few outstanding technologies on the African continent. 1. M-pesa has been a life changing innovation for the remittance world. It has eliminated the need for bank accounts, bank charges and the inconvenience of depending on a public transport driver to deliver money to the village. The most significant thing about M-pesa to me is the fact that it is a reminder that you have to know your environment very well in order to create lasting and useful solutions to the existing problems. 2. SEACOM is one of the leading undersea cable companies. They have created a great opportunity to boost Internet connectivity on the continent. Like M-pesa, Seacom has provided access to areas that were previously unreachable. In 2012, the United Nations deemed Internet access a basic right. I have no doubt that access to information will improve the lives of many individuals; I also hope that there will be more positive outcomes than bad ones produced by the wide access to internet. 3. GSMA mHealth has brought the mobile and health care industries together by bringing solutions to long-term health problems. Patients are able to access basic health information through their mobile phones. The main advantage in this technology is that it allows access to people in rural areas where people have been typically neglected. 4. JoziHub Kenya is one of the leading technology innovators, however this noted hub is in Johannesburg, South Africa. The JoziHub incubator helps kick start and accelerate innovation in the tech and social spheres. These locally based hubs are particularly exceptional because they have the ability to adapt to the local needs. Many technologies and innovations have failed because they were a great idea in one environment and not the other i.e. there was a lack of external validity in these innovations. …….. Africa is an opportunity for the world: Overlooked progress in governance and human development While narratives over the past few decades have painted a wide range of views of Africa—as a child in need of development, a rising economic power, an imminent threat, a tinderbox of terrorism, poverty, forced migration, and disease—the truth is, as always, more nuanced. One thing is certain: the transformation that Africa has undergone in recent decades has been remarkable. Africa is shaping its own destiny and should be referred to as the “African opportunity” instead of the “African threat.” …. IMPROVING HEALTH AND REDUCING THE IMPACT OF DISEASES Significant public health improvements have been made in Africa over the past several decades. There have been substantial declines in maternal and child deaths, and the incidence of chronic malnutrition among children under five has decreased by almost 10 percentage points from 1995. Most countries are making good progress on preventable childhood illness and communicable diseases. HIV/AIDS and malaria continue to have a widespread detrimental impact on Africans, but treatment options are improving. Across the continent, life expectancies and healthy life expectancies are rising. To view Africa solely as a hotbed of disease and hunger is to ignore the significant strides that countries and communities have made. African governments and health workers are committed to preventing illnesses, especially neglected diseases that often tend to get short shrift, improving access to treatments, and finding better ways to deliver quality health care. There is now scope for businesses and emerging partners to join governments in the fight against disease through technological innovations and health systems strengthening. ……………………………………………. Governance progress but concerns remain | ALB Article The African Governance Report from the Mo Ibrahim Foundation has seen positive steps taken towards the continent’s development goals, but there are some worrying trends to address. The quality of governance in Africa has improved over the first five years of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 transformation plan, but there is a growing divergence between the continent’s best and worst countries, according to the African Governance Report, released by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. The full Ibrahim Index of African Governance across the 54 African countries is released on alternate years and will next be released in 2020, but this year’s report focused on progress at the halfway point of the first 10-year period of Agenda 2063, which runs from 2014 to 2023. MEASURING PROGRESS The report called for greater attention to be paid to education, which it linked to economic and development goals, noting a worrying decline in quality on average across the continent since 2014. Mauritius and Seychelles, traditionally strong performers on the index, perform particularly well for education, along with Kenya, Algeria and Tunisia, while Chad, Libya, Gabon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Somalia performed worst. Health, another area monitored, has improved across the past decade, although progress has slowed since 2014. Mauritius, Libya, Seychelles, Cabo Verde and Rwanda all scored well, while Sierra Leone, Madagascar, South Sudan, CAR and Somalia were the weakest performers. For women and youth inclusion, which the report described as a critical development area “to create and foster inclusive societies and inclusive governments”, there had been similar progress and a similar slowing of it. There has been a big improvement in female education and socio-economic opportunities, but the growth in the female population with employment has been lower. Rwanda, Madagascar, Seychelles, Uganda and South Africa led for gender inclusion category, while Guinea-Bissau, Sudan, Egypt, Somalia and Libya were poorest. The security and justice category had seen the most uneven progress, ultimately ending up in a better place than 10 years ago, but suffering from a significant drop around 2013, from which it recovered in 2016. Mauritius was best for rule of law, with Ghana and South Africa, while Eritrea, Libya and Somalia were at the bottom. For transparency, it was Rwanda, Botswana and Mauritius, while Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and South Sudan fared the worst. National security forms an important part of this category and here Somalia and South Sudan were significantly worse than any other country, while Cabo Verde, Mauritius and Seychelles all received the highest possible score. In the final category – prosperity and economic opportunity – the one most obviously linked to economic progress, Mauritius, Rwanda, Morocco, South Africa and Seychelles were again the top five, while Eritrea, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, South Sudan and Somalia were last ————— Many people spent years studying economics and business management but are not at all interested in history. They explain everything in economic or managerial terms. They live in the “here and now” totally unaware of a basic fact: what happened hundreds of years ago significantly affects the present conditions. The present is inseparable from the past, including the distant past. Africa is the cursed continent. Most African nations are so corrupt with bad leadership. The so-called curses of Africa have names and more importantly origins. Curse #1: The Curse of Berlin British explorer David Livingstone had described colonialism in the apparently benign terms of the ‘three Cs’: Commerce, Christianity, and Civilisation. The more malign ‘three Ps’ may, in fact, have been more accurate: Profit, Plunder and Prestige —Adekeye Adebajo, Two major events in Africa are linked to Berlin. The Berlin Conference (1884–1885) that sealed the Scramble for Africa.Africa was partitioned and divided like a giant cake among Western powers. The ultimate goal of the Berlin Conference was to keep Africa divided and poor. They succeeded. How? by destroying powerful empires, sophisticated kingdoms, thriving ports, advanced city states and flourishing communities. The Lunda Empire was destroyed by King Leopold, King of the Belgians.by destroying between 50 to 100 cities and major towns. Stanley wrote in his journal that he destroyed 28 major towns in Congo. The Force Publique, the private army of King Leopold destroyed the double.by dismantling long distance trade networks. Pre-colonial Africa was much more interconnected than today. The Lunda had trade partners both in West-Central and East-Central Africa.by ruining local economies and industries. The West and East African coasts were littered with local factories and industries. There was a thriving boat-building industry in the Loango kingdom, in present day Cabinda enclave of Angola.by killing or exiling African rulers. A lot of kings and chiefs were beheaded and their heads kept as trophies. Their skulls can be found in colonial and military museums in Europe. The skull of Chief Lusinga is still kept in a colonial museum in Belgium.by creating colonial states by making sure that ethnic groups that never got along had the same colonial master and powerful empires or kingdoms were divided among different colonial masters. The Kingdom of Kongo was divided between Belgium, Portugal and France.by banning the use of indigenous currencies and imposing colonial currencies (monetary servitude, still imposed through the Zone Franc). There are more than 120 indigenous currencies (pictures and specimens taken) from pre-colonial Congo catalogued in the Tervuren Museum of Belgium.by suppressing indigenous scripts (scriptural servitude). The saddest case with African scripts is the Bamun script of King Njoya in Cameroon. The script was banned by the French who also destroyed his libraries and press.The Scramble for Africa was soon followed by the Scramble for African Art. Huge expeditions were organized to “collect” works of arts and artifacts. Our royal palaces and sacred shrines were looted and burned to the ground. At least 90% of Africa’s cultural heritage sit in colonial museums in Europe and in the America. 2. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the creation of new world order With the end of the Cold Word and the collapse of communist countries, the place and the role of Africa was redefined as part of the whole globalization process. The Walls of Africa - Coverage of the Fall of the Berlin Wall The fall of the Wall in 1989 eventually caused the marginalisation of Africa. In his analysis, Adebajo answered more than just the question of what the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 meant for Africa, but commented “Berlin is a metaphor for Africa’s colonial and post-colonial experiences.” Fall of Berlin Wall Had Impact on African Continent Analysts say the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was primarily a symbolic event, but it marked the beginning of changes that would affect Africa and the developing world in many ways. The deputy chairman of the South African Institute for International Affairs, Moeletsi Mbeki, says the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War and East-West rivalries. ""Africa had been at the receiving end of the Cold War with great powers using Africa as a playground to fight its [their] proxy wars,"" he said. An analyst with the Electoral Institute for Southern Africa, Ebrahim Fakir, says new forms of capitalism evolved that widened the gap between rich and poor. ""While 1989 may have signaled greater amounts of freedom, the inception of some kind of democratic regime, it also initiated greater amounts of inequalities, not just between states and regions of the world, but within states,"" he said. Analysts note that the demise of communism also left the world with a single dominant power, at least for a time. And this uni-polar world may have contributed to excesses such as those that led to the banking crisis that affected economies everywhere. Curse # 2: Curse of Ham Africans are cursed and doomed to perpetual slavery because of the curse of Ham. Ham is the biblical father of the African Nations. The curse of Ham was a lie to begin with. Ham was never cursed by Canaan was. Misinformation: Black Race Originated from Noah’s Son Ham 1. Noah imposed a curse upon Canaan, not Ham 2. According to the Bible, Canaan was the name of Ham’s son; this name is also used to refer to Phoenicia. Racist context Over the time, certain religious groups spread fake teaching that Ham had a black skin because he was cursed by Noah. This teaching was used to justify racism and slavery of people with color skin across the world. …. Egypt, the first super-power in world history is also known as the land of Ham. It is my educated belief that whenever haters focus on the savagery or servitude of the people they dislike, they usually cover up another story of displacement, land grabbing, genocide and above all a powerful legacy lost, erase, discredited or worse stolen. Three powerful quotes from Quora and Internet users. • Hamites"" cursed as ""blacks"" now become ""white"" and therefore the just progenitors of civilization in Africa, beginning with Egypt. • The Eurocentrics classify Ham as all ""black"" people first (to justify slavery and colonization) then they all magically became ""white"" people after that point so that they could claim Egypt for themselves • Hamites"" cursed as ""blacks"" now become ""white"" and therefore the just progenitors of civilization in Africa, beginning with Egypt. Stolen Legacy: The Egyptian Origins of Western Philosophy: James, George G M: 9781614278344: Amazon.com: Books https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2852&context=ocj THE WORLD'S DEBT TO EGYPT. BY G. H. RICHARDSON Africans, we are the elders of the world. In addition, the earliest civilizations on earth were created by people of different shades of brown. Black is a code word for different shades of brown. Paul Gaffarel, an early 20th French scholar said it all as follows (Courtesy of Google Translate) Several races seem to have, in turn, exercised world dominance, and been at the forefront of civilization. The order of succession is now very difficult to determine. However, the black race appears to be the first. The Malays hunted down Blacks in the islands of Polynesia; the Hindus chased them far into the interior of the Deccan and Ceylon. Blacks are represented in Egyptian monuments and easily recognizable by the color of their skin, snub nose and slanted eyes. They were later replaced by invaders. The final triumph of our race (the white race) dates back only from the 16th century when native American tribes were destroyed or absorbed by Europeans. Bishop William Montgomery Brown wrote ""For the first two or three thousand years of civilization, there was not a civilized white man on the earth. Civilization was founded and developed by the ""swarthy"" races of Mesopotamia, Syria and Egypt, and the white race remained so barbaric that in those days an Egyptian or a Babylonian priest would have said that the riffraff of white tribes a few hundred miles to the north of their civilization were hopelessly incapable of acquiring the knowledge requisite to progress. It was southern colored peoples everywhere, in China, in Central America, in India, Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt and Crete who gave the northern white peoples civilization."" (The Bankruptcy of Christian Supernaturalism, Vol., p. 192.) Curse # 3: The Resource curse Africa is plagued by the resource curse. Actually, the resource curse is not a curse in itself but a looting machine that was created more than 500 years ago. The looting machine instills or increases conflicts for oil and minerals. Rebel and militia groups are supplied with arms, particularly when they controlled oil or mineral rich regions and zones. Curse # 3: The Resource curse Africa is plagued by the resource curse. Actually, the resource curse is not a curse in itself but a looting machine that was created more than 500 years ago. The looting machine instills or increases conflicts for oil and minerals. Rebel and militia groups are supplied with arms, particularly when they controlled oil or mineral rich regions and zones. The Looting Machine: Warlords, Oligarchs, Corporations, Smugglers, and the Theft of Africa's Wealth: Burgis, Tom: 9781610397117: Amazon.com: Books The trade in oil, gas, gems, metals and rare earth minerals wreaks havoc in Africa. During the years when Brazil, India, China and the other “emerging markets” have transformed their economies, Africa's resource states remained tethered to the bottom of the industrial supply chain. While Africa accounts for about 30 per cent of the world's reserves of hydrocarbons and minerals and 14 per cent of the world's population, its share of global manufacturing stood in 2011 exactly where it stood in 2000: at 1 percent. In his first book, The Looting Machine, Tom Burgis exposes the truth about the African development miracle: for the resource states, it's a mirage. The oil, copper, diamonds, gold and coltan deposits attract a global network of traders, bankers, corporate extractors and investors who combine with venal political cabals to loot the states' value. And the vagaries of resource-dependent economies could pitch Africa's new middle class back into destitution just as quickly as they climbed out of it. The ground beneath their feet is as precarious as a Congolese mine shaft; their prosperity could spill away like crude from a busted pipeline. This catastrophic social disintegration is not merely a continuation of Africa's past as a colonial victim. The looting now is accelerating as never before. As global demand for Africa's resources rises, a handful of Africans are becoming legitimately rich but the vast majority, like the continent as a whole, is being fleeced. Outsiders tend to think of Africa as a great drain of philanthropy. But look more closely at the resource industry and the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world looks rather different. In 2010, fuel and mineral exports from Africa were worth 333 billion, more than seven times the value of the aid that went in the opposite direction. But who received the money? For every Frenchwoman who dies in childbirth, 100 die in Niger alone, the former French colony whose uranium fuels France's nuclear reactors. In petro-states like Angola three-quarters of government revenue comes from oil. The government is not funded by the people, and as result it is not beholden to them. A score of African countries whose economies depend on resources are rentier states; their people are largely serfs. The resource curse is not merely some unfortunate economic phenomenon, the product of an intangible force. What is happening in Africa's resource states is systematic looting. Like its victims, its beneficiaries have names. You wouldn't buy a blood diamond, but do you own a conflict phone? Gold, Tin, Tantalum, and Tungsten: The “3TG” There are four conflict minerals legally defined by laws across the globe, including the U.S. and EU. The minerals are dubbed 3TG, for tin, tantalum (sometimes known as coltan or blue gold), tungsten, and gold. The three “Ts” are mostly mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and they’re all used extensively in electronics. The minerals are also mined in other places, like Australia and South America — generally by large industrial conglomerates without as many worker welfare concerns. Mining operations in Africa produce a huge percentage of the global supply of 3TGs and they do it cheaply. The minerals have many uses in electronics and are found throughout our smartphones: • Tantalum is used primarily for the production of tantalum capacitors, which have a comparatively high capacitance per volume and low weight. • Tin is used for solder on most circuit boards on the planet, and in displays, including LCDs and OLEDs. • Tungsten is used for its hardness in wires and electrodes. Smartphones also vibrate via haptic feedback or for notifications by using an off-center motor made of tungsten components. • Gold is more commonly known and used extensively in electronics both directly for electronic contacts, connectors, and wires, and in some chemical compounds used in certain semiconductor manufacturing processes. Huge quantities of gold are sold illegally. Why conflict? And why has it been going on for so long? Speaking on a conference call for TCO Compliance in June, Joakim Wohlfeil, a policy advisor on conflict and justice for international development organization Diakonia, explained the sources of conflict, and the problems facing “artisanal” miners in Africa. The word artisan is generally associated with skilled crafts, but don’t be fooled. This is hard labor: millions of individuals mine in a semi-organized fashion by hand, without modern industrial techniques, to provide income for their families. ….. The armed groups rule through lawlessness and deliberately avoid any kind of active peace. Peace brings laws, regulation, taxes, and customs duties. According to Wohlfeil, who speaks with miners in conflict zones, the armed groups trade the minerals via informal methods, and where gold is involved, often fetch surprisingly high prices. Criminal organizations like the Russian and Italian mobs legitimize their cash by purchasing gold, which can be easily washed into the economy. In the DRC alone, an astonishing 98 percent of mined gold is exported illegally. Tantalum also isn’t traded on a metal exchange like the London Metal Exchange, making movements of the raw ore difficult to track and purposefully obscured by suppliers. The price paid for the material is usually determined solely by negotiations between buyer and seller, rather than a constant market. The average intelligent person looks both ways before crossing a street or risks being hit by a truck. Africa is in bandages because most of its leaders looked only one way— at the external—George Ayittey https://www.atlasnetwork.org/assets/uploads/misc/Applied_Economics_for_Africa_2018.pdf by George Ayittey “He who does not know where he came from, does not know where he is going,” says an African proverb. We are lost in Africa because we do not know where we came from, which is why we copy everything foreign by heart. It is either because we have no faith in our own or we lack knowledge of our own. Africa is lost and wandering because many of its leaders do not know where they came from. They have been copying alien systems and institutions, instead of building upon their own. For example, they have been building Confucius Institutes across Africa, not Ubuntu Institutes. We need to continue championing “African solutions to African problems” and arguing that the salvation of Africa does not lie inside the corridors of the World Bank, the IMF, or the US Congress. Neither does it lie in the inner sanctum of the Chinese Politburo or the Russian presidium. It lies in Africa’s own backyard—in her own indigenous institutions. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Africa’s indigenous economic system. But the indigenous system was roundly castigated by the ruling elites as “backward and primitive.” They then proceeded to copy all sorts of alien and unworkable models from abroad to impose on the African people. The continent became littered with the putrid carcasses of failed imported systems Traditional Africa, the home of the real people of Africa, works—albeit at a low level of efficiency—and has sustained its people for centuries. The natives may lack formal education, but they are hard-working and enterprising. Using their raw native intelligence, ingenuity, and skills, they have been able to produce some of the world’s most beautiful cloths (kente, for example) and great works of art. The sculptures of Yoruba, Ibo bronzes, the beads of the Maasai, Fang masks, Zulu headrests, and Sotho snuff containers are recognized as masterpieces. There were free village markets, free trade, and free enterprise before the advent of colonialism in Africa. Timbuktu, for example was one great market town. Free-trade routes crisscrossed the continent with the trans-Saharan being the most famous. Politically, decision-making was by consensus at village meetings But much of this knowledge, as Mr. Soyinka rightly complains, has been hidden. Myths about Africa came to replace these truths, and the problem was compounded by the failure on all sides to distinguish between form and substance. The institutions of democracy, free markets, money, marriage, and justice, can take many forms. Just because there were no ballot boxes or supermarkets or white-wigged judges in pre-colonial African villages doesn’t mean Africans had no conception of those institutions. African tribal cultures aren’t in conflict with the West; only the forms of institutions are different. There is still much mythology about Africa’s indigenous economic system. The myth of “hunters and gatherers” persists, giving the impression that Africa had no economic institutions or culture before contact with the Europeans. Inexorably tied to their ancestral land, Africans supposedly eked out a living from primitive agriculture. Trade and exchange were supposedly un- known, since self-sufficiency and subsistence farming were the operative goals. Books on pre-colonial Africa dwell excessively on the “backwardness” of African technology. But Africa did indeed have economic institutions Africans engaged in a variety of industrial activities in the pre-colonial era. In Benin, “the glass industry made extraordinary strides” (Diop 1987, 136). In Nigeria, “the cloth industry was an ancient craft. Kano attained historical prominence in the fourteenth century with its fine indigo dyed cloth, which was traded for goods from North Africa. Even before the discovery of cotton, other materials had been used for cloth. The Igbo, for example, made cloth from the fibrous bark of trees. The Asante also were famous for their cotton and bark cloth (kente and adwumfo). No effort was made to build on Africa’s own indigenous institutions; only Botswana did this. The indigenous systems were castigated as backward and primitive that could not be relied upon to achieve the rapid transformation the leaders desired. Foreign systems and paraphernalia were blindly aped and transplanted into Africa. As such, no organic development took place but rather “development by imitation.” Ancestral culture and modern survival: The example of Meiji Japan (2) - Businessday NG Ancestral Culture and Modern Survival: The Example of Meiji Japan Written by Chinweizu Chinweizu Ibekwe - Wikipedia Chinweizu (born 26 March 1943) is a Nigerian critic, essayist, poet, and journalist The notion that culture is the ultimate backbone of a people, the immune system of a society, is alien to the niggerized consciousness of the populations of PanAfrica. Many of their comprador elite now see African culture as nothing more than a source of fossilized arts and museum pieces to be sold to earn foreign exchange! Others view it as a disgraceful, primitive paganism that should be smashed and consigned to the bonfire. So, everything depends on the education they received, what it moulded them into. If you are educated as a lawyer, your mental framework tends to get limited to what you can do in a law court, or within the existing legal and constitutional arrangements. If your education is such that you think from the point of view of your conquerors, if it moulds you into a black European, that is mis-education, not education. If you take a rat and train it to see the world in the way the cat sees the world, you have not educated the rat, you have mis-educated it for life in a world with rat-killing cats. You have actually made it an easier prey for the cats, because the natural instincts of a rat would have told it how to deal with cats, or how to avoid cats. But after you have given the rat the education of a cat, it would lose those instincts. It might even think of itself as a cat! And that is what this colonialist education has done to Africans for the last two centuries. We have been fundamentally mis-educated, and we cannot even see the world from our own point of view, let alone in our own interest. The Japanese rulers launched their Meiji revolution in 1868, and were determined to make Japan an equal power with the foremost western powers. In this project, they sought to modernize but not Westernize Japan. They sent emissaries abroad to study their white enemies thoroughly. And they were interested in finding and adopting only those aspects of European civilization that would help in building Japan‘s national power. They united the energies of the entire population to achieve absolute national independence from foreign capital and foreign rule; accordingly, they regarded foreign help as proof of national weakness. They were focused on building enough Japanese power to prevent their being conquered, and to wipe out their national humiliation by foreign encroachments and tutelage. Such cannot be said for any of our Black African countries—with their unselective aping of all things European, their lack of a sense of humiliation at having been colonized, their pathetic addiction to foreign aid, their abject craving for foreign investment, and their absolute disinterest in industrializing themselves into economic and military power. The crucial point is that the movements that liberated Japan were led by people who did hard thinking about their reality, and who applied some ideological perspective to illuminate the problems of their society. They did not allow that crisis of knowledge ‘that afflicted the Black African movements to ever arise. As yet no Black African country has pushed ahead to attempt Japan after 1868. National liberation is manifested when you run your economy and society and culture entirely in your national interest. No foreign companies dominate the Japanese economy--that is the crucial point. As Cabral maintained, until we have mental independence—―absolute independence in our way of thinking and acting-- and apply it to control our territory and economy and culture, we are not independent. So, the independence that Black African countries claim is fake, because they do not control any of these vital aspects of their existence.

Social science is the scientific study of society's interaction considering how various communities interact socially based on their religious, economic, cultural, national and habitual circumstances.

This science observes how these interaction effect the groups invkolved in short and long terms usually in order to collect information to address the needs or identify possible prooblems and their sources as it relates to social interactions. How this works in epidemiology is extremely important. Social science is one of the main components of epidemiology. Epidemiology is the method used to find the causes of health outcomes and diseases in populations. In epidemiology, the patient is the community and individuals are viewed collectively. In this demography and ethnography are very important in identifying an effective diagnosis as well as prescription. The entire community becoming one patient means that all the groups and their overlapping interactions with other social groups in the collective are a priority and must be included in the body of the sjingular patient which is collectively the entire community, Any part ofthe community that has been overlooked can damage the entire patients chances of properly being accessed. So social science is one of the most necessary elements in providing masterful epidemiology. It enables researchers the ability to comb through the hidden links and identify them and their cohesive shared liknesses which bring their different paths together in commonality. This could be dangerous and very illusive. Epidemiology is the medecine that corners and treat the patient by identifying the patient's anatomy and how it functions socially.

It combines empathetic altruism with an analytic focus on cost-effectiveness. See Effective altruism - Wikipedia. Secondly, this is not an anti-Semitic troll question as Allan Glass has claimed. I assume that whoever asked this was genuinely curious. If anything, the fact that Jews have contributed so much to the effective altruism movement should be considered pro-Semitic. With that out of the way, I will proceed to answer the question to the best of my ability. But first, a historical diversion. (Skip to the part in bold if you just want an answer to the headline question.) It is worth pointing out that many of the founders and prominent members of the effective altruism movement are ethnic Jews. The philosophical foundations of EA are usually traced back to Peter Singer’s 1971 essay “Famine, Affluence, and Morality,” which argued that it is immoral to spend money on luxuries when we could instead use that money to save lives. Peter Singer is an atheist utilitarian philosopher of Jewish descent whose grandparents died in the Holocaust. Even though Singer penned his argument in the 1970s, the EA community did not come about until the 21st century. There were a few key factors which together led to the formation of the EA movement as we know it today. The first factor was the creation of the charity evaluator GiveWell, which analyzes different global health interventions in order to find the most cost-effective donation opportunities. GiveWell was founded in 2006 by hedge-fund analysts Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld, both (ethnically) Jewish. The second factor is the community formed around the website LessWrong. This website is dedicated to the “art of human rationality,” i.e. how to form accurate beliefs and effectively achieve your goals. It is easy to see the idea of rigorously analyzing charities for cost-effectiveness would appeal to this crowd. The LessWrong community also took a particular interest in reducing catastrophic risks that threaten human extinction, mainly focusing on risks due to advanced AI. Global catastrophic risks (including AI risk) remain a key focus area of EA to this day. Oh, and by the way, the founder of LessWrong is Eliezer Shlomo Yudkowsky. Enough said. The third factor is the emergence of Giving What We Can at Oxford University. To the best of my knowledge, the key people involved in this project were gentiles, but I could be wrong. Finally, the philanthropist funder who is most closely connected to the EA movement is Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. After reading Peter Singer’s book The Life You Can Save, he became convinced that he should use his fortune to most effectively help those in need. He reached out to GiveWell for advice on how to use his money. This collaboration resulted in the Open Philanthropy Project, which has donated over $928,000,000 as of November 2019. Now, to answer the headline question, I will draw on the 2018 Effective Altruism community survey and the 2019 Slate Star Codex survey. Slate Star Codex (SSC) is a blog that is connected to the LessWrong and effective altruism communities (and also happens to be written by a secular Jew). The EA survey asked people for their religious affiliation. In total, 41 of 2,607 respondents (1.57%) identified as religious Jews. If restrict the results to respondents who claimed to be religious at all, we get 41 out of 387, or 10.59%. I would guess that the number of secular Jews in the community is much higher than the number of practicing Jews. The EA movement as a whole tends toward irreligion, with a majority identifying as atheist, agnostic, or non-religious. Unfortunately, the EA survey does not provide any further helping information for identifying the proportion of secular Jews. Luckily, the SSC survey does provide that info. It asked separate questions for “Religious Denomination” and “Religious Background”. It turns out that 12.3% of SSC readers who currently practice a religion are Jewish. Furthermore, 9.6% of SSC readers have a Jewish family background, whether or not they are practicing. However, not all SSC readers are effective altruists. So I downloaded the public SSC dataset and restricted my query to those who answered “Yes” when asked whether they identify as an effective altruist (other options were “No” and “Sorta”). The results are stunning: 18.89% of religious EA SSC readers are Jewish, and 13.94% of all EA SSC readers have a Jewish family background. Note that this is not necessarily representative of the entire EA movement, as SSC tends to attract a certain type of person. Nonetheless, it is pretty interesting. If I had to guess why so many Jews are involved with the EA movement, I would hypothesize that it is because the EA movement tends to attract intelligent, well-educated, and middle/upper class individuals. Jews tend to score highly on all of these metrics. Continue Reading Nancy Dills",2021-03-06T15:34:10.622Z,"What proportion of effective altruists are Jewish? ",Quora

Innovation strategy consultants like us can help you focus on the right questions for your specific challenge. BIC India can work with you to come up with the right blend of strategies and technologies in sync with the future. When such innovation strategy structures are implemented, the companies gain tremendously to chart new growth trajectories. Continuous improvement is the underlying reason for every company. However, different companies will have various reasons for hiring an innovation strategy consultant, but the below-mentioned reasons are the more pronounced ones that every company looks forward to: Helps to think out-of-the-box Employees working in any company are so engrossed in the mundane routine tasks that they are left with no time or motivation to see things from a new perspective. You cannot expect them to think out-of-the-box. Here, innovation strategy consultants can significantly help as we are trained to shake up your typical ways of doing things. Most companies have definite practices that have evolved over the years. Companies tend to find themselves entrenched in these practices, forming a kind of legacy even if it does not serve the purpose. We can come in and help you look at what you should be doing rather than how it's always been done. The outsider's perspective means you're less inclined to follow the well-worn paths of your organization. Pronounce your vision Many companies find it too difficult to get out of the mould of daily routine and articulate their innovation strategy or bring forth a clear picture of their plans. We as innovation strategy consultants can help deliver a document charting out the story and the vision about where you would like to go and the same reasons. We will also pronounce what it accomplished through a prototype that will help you get your team together and get things done. To benefit from the specialists Top-notch innovation strategy consultants have seasoned professionals who are specialists in their fields. By engaging with BIC India, the company gets access to a top-notch talent pool, which otherwise might not have been feasible for the company to engage on the payroll. When a company is looking for solutions to the profound challenges, it makes sense to have specialists through innovation strategy consultancy firms like us. To avail the best practices Top innovation strategy consultants invariably have a rich and varied experience, which, when coupled with the latest scientific tools, leads to its success. Just like we offer cutting-edge consultancy based on well defined, laid-down methodologies that begin with gathering the relevant data to determine the business's existing portfolio to finally offering outcome-based solutions. We always focus on creating value for the company by incorporating the best practices and latest technologies. Learn by doing One of the unsung benefits of hiring an innovation strategy consulting company like BIC India is that you and your team will learn new ways of working through the process. It is not uncommon these days to see many companies having their teams train in design thinking. But unfortunately, they undergo training for the heck of it without actually knowing how to put that in practice. Your team can learn a lot by watching your innovation strategy consultant at work.

What DFA seeks to do is: 1. Educate college students in the design process2. Through hands-on involvement with the local community3. To make positive impact. Project topics might seem similar (many project teams take inspiration from OpenIDEO challenges), but groups are encouraged to narrow their scope to their local community in order to have a more relevant experience. Even if #3 fails, #1 and #2 are experiences that will help the students throughout their entire lives and make impact beyond DFA as an organization.  Very few DFA projects go on to become full-time projects beyond the scope of the local community (eg, Jerry the Bear, SwipeSense, MeloSense), some get handed off to a local organization, many are experiments just to dip toes in the design process. It's about being agile and being adaptable and to find out what's the smallest change that can make the most impact. DFA projects can get away with lo-fidelity executions or no concrete deliverables in a way that consultancies—whether for profit or not-for-profit—cannot. (Note: This is changing as studios become more experienced in the design process and running a studio. Additionally, HQ has more pressure to deliver results than individual studios.) The challenge for the past few years at both the national level and at local studios is figuring out how to effectively mentor and lead students through the design process. You have to realize that most of these kids have little to no social design experience, but they are young, bright, and passionate about making lives more meaningful. Through the DFA experience and network, many alumni go on to be leaders in social enterprise and human-centered design in all industries. It is the training ground for creating potential innovators and companies like IDEO. Eventually, all students ""graduate"" from DFA, and there are too many problems to solve both globally and locally that there is certainly room for both types of organizations.",2021-03-06T15:59:12.795Z,"Are non-profit organizations like Design for America going to disrupt breakthrough innovation consultancies like IDEO?

I was part of the initial management team at Groupon India and have been working in one of India's most successful e-commerce start-ups for the last 2 years. Here's my take: Shifting from consulting to start-ups requires a HUGE mindset shift. You go from working in an extremely structured environment to working in an extremely chaotic environment and your access to resources and guidance drops drasticallyYou become less cocky. As a consultant, you are pretty used to being in meetings with C-level execs who respect you due to the McKinsey tag and develop a certain streak of arrogance, believing yourself at the top of the food-chain. Start-ups teach you humility in a way very few other jobs can, especially when you are trying to calm down irate customersExecution is more important than strategy. Working in a start-up means you can go for trial-and-error (and learn valuable lessons regardless of the outcome) whereas consulting is chiefly about getting the strategy right on paper at first go.As a derivation from 3, you get really good at reverse engineering based on your experiences and the outcome you wantBeing creative is not as important as being persistent. Creativity gives you 10 ideas, not all of whom are executable. Persistence makes you see product launches to the end and make tweaks so that they work.It's important to be flexible. You need to take hard calls day in and out, and dump projects that won't bring bang for buck for projects that might not be as challenging/cool but will help the topline. There are no good to haves in start-up, unlike consulting.So, to summarize, it's probably a bad idea to think of consulting firms as a launch pad for a career in start-ups if you are planning on working in a start-up long term. You'd probably be better off working at an Amazon/Facebook/LinkedIn instead.From a hiring standpoint, consultants would be worse than start-up employees/employees at new tech firms like the ones I mentioned above but slightly better than Fortune 500 employees; mainly due to their ability to handle pressure situations better and willingness to work extremely hard.

I owe a lot to it, as it gave me chance to come to Bangalore - 'City of opportunities' I don't hate TCS, but I would say it's not an employee friendly company. I would like to share my experiences with TCS, which made me quit this Giant. 1. Training: Good. An excellent start for non IT background fresher's. But, doesn't not match with what actually you are going to work on.I was still okay, because I like challenges and to learn new thing everyday. 2. Salary:  Rs. 12k in hand during training, and Rs. 22k after that. But without complementary food, transportation etc. With this salary in a metro you can only afford a basic food, shelter and clothes. No savings. Not much of recreation.I was still okay because it was not that bad. 3. Non-ethical behavior of HR: After my training in Gandhinagar, Gujrat I was posted to Bangalore. I was told that as Bangalore was not my choice of working location post training, I can reimburse the travelling and 3 day accommodation in Bangalore. My total expenses were around 4k. Even after 100 e-mails exchanges, I didn't get a single penny.I hated it because with salary I received during training it was very difficult to spend 4k. 4. Non-professional behavior of managers: My first project manager released me from the project while I was on vacations. He didn't inform me formally. I joined my office back, sat on my designated seat for three days without any work and still my manager didn't tell me anything. I got to know from my ""new"" manager.I hated it because its not at all accepted to me to be at a place - uninvited. 5. Inhumane behavior of managers: I asked for leave stating my mom might undergo an operation. In stead of sympathy and support the manager was explaining that stone operation is not a ""big deal"".Made me feel sick. 6. Bonus: Rs. 500 per quarter. LOL. I pay a bonus way more than this to my cook and maid. 7. Project: As stated before, no relevancy to what you learnt during training. At technical end, mostly all the projects are support. No innovation. No new coding. Only debugging. No new logic. Not much learning. I hated because my learning was negative. My job was to maintain GIT (maintaining the log of changes made by other developers). Create installers on Fridays and send it to on-site. I didn't see a single code for at least 9 months. 8. Policies: Though TCS claims that they have flat hierarchy and open door culture its exactly opposite. During customer visit we were not allowed to talk to the customers. Same during the client call. For single day leave approval I had to pass through multiple levels. And mind that we were not allowed to go directly to the manager. The leave policies were not at all employee friendly. For example if weekend falls between your leaves then those two days (sat and Sunday) will be considered as leaves and effectively you will lose two more leaves.Please note that leaves were more precious than salary. 9. Employee Entertainment: Once a year all the project people were taken out for team lunch under employee entertainment policy. I hated it because the lunch was ""Dutch"". Each employee had to pay their own share. A buffet of 500-600/- with that salary is ""extravagant"".BTW did you know that every year top managers in TCS hosts an extravagant party (disguised as corporate meeting) at exotic locations as Taj, Goa etc. 10. Appraisal: As I mentioned earlier my job was to create installers of all the work done by developers and send it to on-site. It wasn't my choice to do that. It was given to me. During my appraisal discussion I mentioned that how I have worked late nights on Fridays,  learned things apart from my regular job, how I helped testing team etc. The argument from my manager was - "" your tasks were not major task to gain a good hike"". I was raged because the tasks given to me were their choice not mine.  11. Opportunity: My learning graph was approaching the lowest ever. No learning technically, logically, business subject, soft skills nothing. In spite of me asking constantly for more and varied job so that I could learn something. 12. Inequality/ Partiality/ biases/ contacts: Growth in TCS depends largely on language, region, how good you are at flattering, how good contacts you have in top management. I would like to state an example of one my colleagues. In Indian IT industry, on-site or expat roles are very important for securing your future financially. And almost everyone looks forward for it. As I mentioned earlier, my job was to create installer and send it on-site for ""consultants"". One of the consultants, job there (my colleague) was to run the installer in production environment and see that the installation was ""successful"". If not then notify team in India. That too once in a week. So basically the consultant's job was of 2 hrs per week against a salary 5-6 times than mine. 12 months. 12 reasons to quit TCS. And I did. In spite of all this I want to thank recruiters' of TCS to give opportunities to several thousands engineers every year. To give them a head start. To give an exposure of corporate. To give them a reason to come to bigger cities from small towns of India and to learn more. And most importantly to make each and every frustrated engineer learn a lot of PATIENCE.",2021-03-06T16:11:52.904Z,"Why do people on Quora seem to hate Tata Consultancy Services?

Of course, a business looking for this sort of consulting must be very careful to not make assumptions about any given consultancy.

While the consultant himself may not appear to be doing anything innovative for the client (or within their own business practices, as they may follow a fairly standard operating procedure), the good consultant is helping the client to gather good ideas and determine a path forward to solve their problem, which can certainly be very innovative.

I am assuming, you mean sustainability in terms of the global sustainable development agenda, the one popularized by the tripartite synchronization of economy, ecology and human welfare.  Before issues of sustainability became international matters of concern, innovation tended to be driven by the desire for better infrastructural amenities, improved technologies, enhanced systems of production, inventing new machines that make human everyday life easier - more and more of material wealth. Of course, innovation has always been part of human history from the time human beings learnt to make fire to cook food to the invention of the first printing to the modern search to find life outside Earth. A key factor driving these innovations was the quest to make human life easier, more manageable and more comfortable so that the bulk of the work could be done by machines leaving leisure time for human beings. The underlying idea was More material wealth = Better human life. The cost to produce them, long-term impact or social influence etc was not given any consideration.  But with the coming in of the sustainability agenda, innovation today is driven by a number of factors - new and better products of course but also their impact on the society, the carbon footprint on the planet, the social harm inherent within the production process, etc. Innovation is about creating new services and products that serve to balance the social, economic and political inequities that benefits a small privileged section from the exploitation of the majority poor . The sustainability movement aims to correct these differences through innovations that create fairer economic practices that benefit the poor, safer workplaces, improved product designs to reduce energy wastage, disabled friendly buildings, cars, daily use products, gadgets to improve living conditions in poor communities, etc.",2021-03-06T16:21:35.492Z,"Is there a relationship between sustainability and innovation in the consultancy industry?

While rapid changes are indeed leaving far too many SMEs behind, there are many large and fertile fields of discussion on said topic. The far less-discussed question is how consultants can position themselves to help at all. In my experience, it’s fitting oneself to the right company in the right role that’s the truly tricky bit — which is where lots of folks go wrong. As it concerns SMEs specifically, we have to bear in mind that small enterprises are wildly unequal at the level of their DNA. While the same toolkits can solve problems across the business spectrum, the real difference is in how the shape of each enterprise determines how clients synthesize any counsel you give them. Using rough categories, we can divide SMEs into four large buckets: StartupsFamily BusinessesFranchisesGrowth Companies(There’s some messiness here, but I’d argue that all enterprises ultimately fall more into one bucket that they do any of the others.) #1: Startups While every new business is technically a startup, what I really mean here are those following the Silicon Valley playbook — i.e., solving for scale first, then solving for everything else down the line. Startups usually bring on consultants via networks (referrals from peers, from VCs, from board members, from senior staff, etc). If you want into this game, you’ll want to make yourself known for solving a specific category of problem. Word will get around. (You’ll also want a polished elevator pitch that explains the ROI of whatever it is you’re bringing to the table.) What you’ll rarely need to do in this scenario is solve multiple kinds of problems. You’re not being brought on to be the smartest person in the room, and you’ll find that your energies are best spent adding value in one particular column or another (which, with respect to the question asked, will often have far less to do with innovation and far more to do with growth). (If this is your ideal area, you should write a lot on Quora. Most underestimate how valuable that can be. If you can bring clarity and ingenuity to the right subjects, people will take notice and you will get offers.) #2: Family Businesses These are often begun spontaneously. Maybe a neighbor was selling their business. Maybe an employee got to thinking they’d make more money if they were the boss. Maybe the neighborhood didn’t have a hair salon. Maybe someone followed their dream to bake full-time. Maybe someone’s parent died and the business changed hands. The unifying feature here is that most of these owners aren’t very good at growth. They’re often specialists at their end service, while things like developing a brand and utilizing technology and standardizing workflows just don’t come naturally. The family with one location and the family with forty are most often separated purely by this generalized attitude/aptitude towards scaling/growth. The good news is that loads of the former are willing to hire consultants (most often in the form of business coaches). The bad news is that most of them are going to end up wasting said consultants’ time. When trying to help with growth, you’ll inevitably fall into one of three “roles”: Teaching/coaching on big picture stuff.Providing specialist advice.Executing a specialist plan under the advice of #2.You might do #2 and #3 in concert (where you manage/contract a bunch of specialists under your purview). It’s hard. If you can pull it off at scale, you’ll have endless demand and endless thanks (mostly because it’s really hard). What you don’t want to do is #2 or #3 in the absence of #1. I did a lot of that early in my career, and it’s hell. Unless the owners are really groking the big picture principles, nothing will stick. Yes, you can still command hefty fees. But you won’t always get paid on time (you won’t have generated winnings that make your value obvious), your contributions won’t change much, and you’ll have a much lower quality of life (meaninglessness + frustration). Plus you’ll degrade your own brand, as you won’t have as many clear success cases to point towards. The ultimate clarifying question to ask these clients is “how much could your business grow before service levels were negatively affected?” Their answer to that will tell you everything you need to know about how well they’re doing with #1. Either it’s something they’ve thought about a lot, or it isn’t. If coaching them on that is your thing, their response will confirm who needs your help. But if you’d rather be a #2 or #3, a bad answer is your cue to keep looking. (I can’t overemphasize how important it is to walk away where the client either doesn’t get #1 or hasn’t demonstrated a strong curiosity towards that end. No matter how much you like them or want to see them succeed, some owners will only ever run lemonade stands. That is what it is. Projecting your ambition onto them is the cardinal sin to be avoided.) #3: Franchises Most hew close to their mother corp’s playbook, and only have use for consultants in niche areas (efficiency coaching, local marketing, financial management, etc). From the little work I’ve done with them, you pretty much have to get to the franchise owner directly. You’ll then have like 15 seconds to make a compelling pitch before they tell you they’re too busy. You can work with them via referral too, but my observation (not sure how accurate) is that most people who have the personality type to run franchises rather than their own businesses aren’t people likely to go and hire a lot of consultants. As a rule of thumb, if they only have one or two franchises and they spend most of their time working in them (vs. on them), it’s probably not worth it. Even if you can convince them to give you a contract, you’re going to have a lot of delays and they’re never going to give full focus to anything you suggest. Plus there are just natural limits to what franchises can do in general. Good exceptions might be people who own multiple franchises and are using them as springboards towards something else (franchises can be reliable cashflow machines). These people are great to work with. If I were looking for one, I’d find the smartest accountants in town and work to win referrals from them. They’ll know who these people are (and often enough they are those people). #4: Growth Companies These are enterprises in the transitional stage from SME to larger corporations. Some are run by the type of people described above (ambitious cashflow kings), but more are led (in the day-to-day, at least) by MBA types who’ve been hired in various C-suite roles. If you want to help, you have to work with the right person. Regardless of how egalitarian a company seems, there are the deciders and everyone else. If you’re working for anyone other than the key decider (relative to your workstream), you want to make really sure that the key decider has a personal knowledge of (and appreciation for) your work. Get this early. Otherwise everything you contribute will probably go up in a pile of smoke, soon or late. (The exception being short contracts where you’re just there to educate and then fly out.) Growth companies engage loads of consultants. Kimanzi Constable posts super valuable guides to this market on Facebook (will have to get him on Quora at some point). Basically, his posts will teach you to pitch a structured product to the right point-of-contact. That structure is important, as growth companies with enough revenues often act like startups in that they often contract for narrow/specific/limited needs, else they’d just hire in-house. You can build very lucrative independent consultancies here (of the one principal and an admin type). If you aren’t a junkie who needs the high of working with startups, it’s the way I’d encourage most to go. You can spend 200 days a year traveling while building a significant bankroll. You just have to be the type of person OK with the grind. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T16:29:44.408Z,"How can consultants best help SMEs to innovate and grow in rapidly changing markets? ",Quora

The reason is simple - it is not worth the hassle for the firm.  Most of the top consulting firms (MBB, ATK, Booz etc.) have well-defined and long-running (compared with their overall history in India) recruitment programs at undergraduate campuses. It is logistically much easier for these firms to recruit through such programs because they can hire in bulk in one go. At such programs, they get tons of resumes at the same time (and some of the best resumes, at that) and can arrange for all interviews to happen on the same day with the required interviewers and interviewees all present. For a lateral recruitment process, they first need to find enough good resumes to be able to run a program. Then comes the hassle of arranging timeslots suitable to both the interviewers and the interviewees (for multiple rounds, no less), and even then there's not a lot of certainty of finding the right people. From the firms' point of view, all this hassle becomes tolerable at engagement manager and above levels, where a lot of specialized candidates are required and where there's no 'ready talent pool' to dig into. At junior levels, they can afford to have a couple of additional (or fewer) resources on their rolls without straining the finances (or the smooth functioning) of the firm so much.  There is some hope though. A couple of firms have been known to recruit laterally (Parthenon Group, e.g.), and that was because their growth warranted them to hire additional pre-MBA level consultants.

For instance, getting top grades at a top university (bonus points in a quantitative and/or relevant discipline like engineering or economics) and maybe adding an MBA after that. Good internships and a great network will also help. However, these things are unlikely to be in the immediate control of you reading this right now. Probably you have finished or almost finished your education. Your grades are as they are and to change those or your employment history you would need a time machine. The more salient question then is, what can you do from this point to move forward and actually get a consulting job? Landing a Consulting Job Ultimately, becoming a management consultant is a matter of making it through the selection process. Importantly, no specific educational or professional background is a strict prerequisite. Firms are after high calibre individuals with specific skillset and will look wherever they have to to find them. So, how can you show a firm that you have these skills and land yourself a job? Let's go through the various stages of the selection process to find out what you will need to do to get past each. On the way, I'll point you to all the resources you will need, including free sources wherever possible. Application Your first step in the actual selection process will be to put together applications. The temptation here will be to fire off applications without a great deal of thought, assuming that the real bottleneck is at the interview stage and that their education or employment history alone will get them that far. However, this is a massive error, as over 50% of candidates are rejected at the initial application phase - so the application of the largest single driver of whether you land a job or not! Consulting resumes are very different to the generic ones you might already have on file. Recruiters will focussed less on specific qualifications or past experience and more on making sure you have the required consulting skillset. (This skillset will come up throughout selection, not just in the application.) Firms will publish slightly different lists of skills which they are looking for, but these lists all elide very heavily and fundamentally boil down to something like the following: · Analytical - have high cognitive capacity and an analytic mindset · Problem solving - able to apply your intellect to generate effective solutions to complex problems · Delivery of results - be able to put your ideas into action to generate positive outcomes · Leadership - have the ability to take the lead on projects · Entrepreneurial spirit - have a strong personal drive and be prepared to take individual initiative · Functional expertise - be familiar with the business world and understand how it works at a practical level · Teamwork - be able to manage relationships and work productively with others Crucially, recruiters will not take it for granted that you have any of these skills. You cannot simply state that you did a job or held a position and expect recruiters to assume that you have the skills usually associated with it. Thus, having been a team leader won't on its own show you have strong leadership skills. Think about it - we have all met people who are terrible at their jobs. Your recruiter can't be sure you weren't one of them - you could have been a lousy team leader! Rather, you will be required to prove your skills via reference to real achievements you have made which clearly demonstrate these abilities. We discuss how to identify and write up appropriate achievements in our resume guide. You might feel the need to go off and do some work to shore up your proof of some of these skills. Personal development is always great, but we also tend to find that candidates have more relevant achievements than they imagine, as experiences from outside the workplace are just as relevant. Captaining an amateur soccer team will be just as relevant to demonstrating leadership as leading a team in the workplace. Your cover letter continues in the same vein, highlighting certain skills and areas where you have particularly strong abilities (""spikes"" in consulting lingo). The cover letter also shares a function with any subsequent fit interview (discussed below) in conveying your motivation to work not only in consulting in general, but also in the specific firm/office to which you are applying. For this reason, cover letters must always be unique to the specific job you are applying for. As such, an ideal cover letter will be based on significant previous networking with current and recent staff at your target firm (where this is possible), as well as in-depth research on recent projects - especially where your own background might give you some insight. We discuss this more in our cover letter guide. Generally, you should get started now, if possible! Writing consulting resumes and cover letters is actually much more involved than most candidates anticipate and very much requires that you know the ""rules of the game"". This is both in terms of the requirements I have just outlined as well as the need to stick to strict industry guidelines on formatting etc to be considered at all. I have only scratched the surface of what is needed here, but you should see our FREE comprehensive consulting resume and cover letter guides. If you do put in the effort to draft a decent application, you will likely want to have it reviewed properly by a real consultant, rather than rely on the opinions of family and friends. We offer a fairly priced service here if you are interested. Interviews If you follow our resume and cover letter guides diligently, you will maximise your chances of being invited to interview. Consulting interviews obviously have a reputation for being incredibly tough - so how should you prepare? The very first thing you are going to need to do is have a clear plan for your prep. Consulting candidates tend to be hard workers and many make the mistake of just jumping in and ""getting on with it"" without a plan of attack. However, this leads to them wasting time on areas they are already strong on and ending up with blind spots in certain other essential skills which they wholly neglect. The specifics of what you need to cover and in how much detail will vary depending on your specific background. However, to get you started, let's run through a general outline of what you will need to get through. 1. General Skills Straight off, candidates almost invariably neglect their mental math. This is a crying shame, as it is something you can be practicing right now for free without leaving your desk. We have a free mental math tool on our website to make sure your skills are sharp. You will also find a lot of useful material - including lots of invaluable ""hacks"" to make your calculations much more time efficient - in our consulting math article. The video lesson in MCC Academy then expands this material significantly as the gold-standard source on this most critical of consulting interview skills. Note that, even if you have a strong foundation in academic math, do not assume that this will carry you through interview. As we explain in our math article, consulting math is a very different beast to the academic variety. Beyond math, depending on your background, you will need to make sure you are up to speed on fundamental business concepts. You can try to do this by yourself by getting a few textbooks out of the local library. Good luck with this unstructured approach, though, as you are likely to waste time ploughing through a lot of irrelevant material and then miss crucial elements which you need. By contrast, our MCC Academy course has a set of video lessons which give you all the foundational knowledge you need to perform in interview and do so as efficiently as possible - the lessons are fully comprehensive without wasting your time on irrelevant material. 2. Case Cracking You are going to need to make it through case interviews to land any consulting job. As such, you will need to both learn how to tackle case studies and then practice as much as possible to make sure that the method is second nature to you by interview day. You will very probably have encountered the old fashioned ""framework-based"" case cracking systems, such as Case in Point. However, these will not get you very far and I cannot caution strongly enough against basing your prep around them. Framework-based approaches rely on a fundamental assumption that all business problems fit into one of a small, finite number (usually 12 or so) of schemes. In reality, you already know that this cannot be the case, as, if all business problems could really be solved by applying the contents of one book which is already in the public domain, then there would be no need for consulting firms to exist at all! Given that your interviewer will typically base your case study on a recent project they were involved with - and that this was therefore a difficult enough problem to merit bringing in consultants - you can expect that your case will not be one that can be solved with simple frameworks. MyConsultingCoach's founding mission was to offer a better alternative to dysfunctional framework-based approaches. By contrast, we teach you how to flexibly approach every case on its own merits, employing the same techniques as a working consultant. Thus, with our Problem Driven Structure method, not only will you be able to tackle whatever your interviewer throws at you, but you will be doing so in exactly the way they want to see. Our MCC Academy course teaches you the fundamental consulting skillset and before explaining how to employ those skills within our Problem Driven Structure method. 3. Fit Interview A lot of candidates spend all of their time prepping for case studies, thinking that they are ""the important bit"". This is an enormous and very damaging misconception. In reality, firms absolutely take fit interviews juts as seriously as case interviews. Fundamentally, the fit interview is a test of more ""soft"" skills, which cannot be easily assessed in a case study, but are still absolutely essential to the day-to-day work of a real consultant. What is more, no ""average"" is taken between case and fit interviews. A consultant will need the entire skillset they assess so - if you want to get the job - there is no alternative to performing well in both case and fit interviews. The fit interview is also a test of your motivation to work in consulting. Consulting firms have big problems with losing talent, and many new recruits drop out because they can't handle the demands of the job or because they always intended to parachute into another industry after gaining the minimum useful amount of consulting experience. Your interviewer is looking for someone whose backstory makes consulting the natural next step and who has the determination to stick with the job for the long haul. You can read more about the details of fit interviews and how to prepare in our article here. We created the first fit interview course, which is now also contained within MCC Academy (indeed, this is the component that completes the MCC Academy as a true end-to-end course, giving you everything you need for interview success). Given that so many candidates fail to prepare for fit interview, this is a place where you can really steal the march on the competition, so it makes sense to actually put the effort in for fit prep! 4. Practice makes Perfect As you are learning how to approach cases, you will want to first run through worked cases (available at our free case bank) and then practice solving case studies by yourself. As you become more confident with the relevant techniques, you will want to start practicing with peers to better simulate the real interview. Similarly, you will want to practice fit interview questions with real people. MyConsultingCoach has you covered here, with a free meeting board which allows you to find and quickly schedule meetings with fellow applicants partners from all around the world. Whilst it will never be a service that is for everyone, you should also seriously consider case practice with an experienced consultant. Realistically, there is only so much decent feedback non-consultants can give one another. After this point, it is simply a case of the blind leading the blind. By contrast, nobody will be able to more quickly identify your points for improvement and generally provide as useful feedback as a real consultant. Whilst these individual's time will never be cheap, when costs are balanced against even just the increased chances of your receiving an MBB salary, you can quickly calculate that it is a very worthwhile investment (we have actually done the math on this here). If you are interested, we offer coaching with experienced MBB consultants. Anyway - I hope that all helps!

This trend, the democratization of technology, is responsible for driving digital transformation by moving technology decisions once strictly managed by IT departments to the hands of managers, project leaders and other workers who need fast solutions to operational problems. According to IDC research released earlier this year, more than 56 percent of technology budgets are now controlled outside of IT departments. One reason why 56.5 percent of technology spending now happens outside of IT is because the vast majority of business leaders believe they can make better and faster decisions on technology without the involvement of IT. Perhaps not surprisingly then, Forrester Research predicts the IT department could disappear as soon as 2020. While that may be a stretch, it’s still clear IT will need to keep evolving to stay ahead of new technologies and incorporate agile solutions to keep organizations competitive, connected and collaborative. A means to that end sweeping across organizations is known as bimodal IT or agile IT. Traditional IT and agile IT are not mutually exclusive. Instead, both are needed for balance and to create a flexible way to work with both containing a distinct set of needs. Yet many enterprises still heavily rely on traditional approaches, such as legacy code, which take time and money to connect to a more modern infrastructure. As more business leaders are tasked with drawing out operational inefficiencies across organizations, they are starting to generate conversations around important technology decisions. Their unique perspectives and understanding of a specific area of the business makes them equipped to come up with innovative solutions to keep their companies competitive.",2021-03-06T17:36:13.557Z,"How big a deal is the citizen developer phenomenon?

In a nutshell, citizen development enables businesses to reduce their application development backlogs, by permitting non-technical users to create and modify business applications. But, how are companies expanding their citizen development initiatives, whilst maintaining application quality and preserving organizational security? To be successful, organizations should: Leverage Citizen Development to Reduce Development Time-Frames:According to a Filemaker, survey that was profiled in a recent Home - DevOps.com article titled, “Meet the Citizen Developer,” 71 percent of citizen developer respondents had their new applications up-and-running in fewer than three months, and 15 percent were able to do so in less than a week. The most effective organizations leverage citizen developers to reduce development time-frames, improve organizational productivity and empower business units to invest a high level of ownership in their IT projects. Consider Utilizing Low-Code/ No-Code Platforms:Low-code/ no-code platforms leveraged by many citizen developers make frequent use of drag-and-drop technology. Drag-and-drop technology permits end-users to easily develop or update applications, autonomously. And, since IT departments are aware of the business units’ platform usage, relationships between IT departments and business units can remain symbiotic. This is in stark contrast to contentious relationships that frequently result from “shadow IT” initiatives. Educate Citizen Developers about the Importance of Application Security:Citizen development efforts won’t be successful, if the software code that’s being developed results in security breaches. So, citizen developers should be exposed to the same level of security training as full-time developers in your organization. Citizen developers also need to be cognizant of the potential consequences of security breaches on their organizations’ brand equity, financial results and regulatory/industry compliance efforts. To learn more about effectively protecting the mission-critical applications that are developed by your organization, check out our entertaining and informative YouTube video. Consider Performing Application Security Testing in the Cloud:One of the core tenets of the citizen development trend is personal freedom. So, you should consider allowing your security team to have more flexibility and convenience in testing all of the applications that your organization creates. For example, IBM Application Security on Cloud permits your security team to perform convenient Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), open-source component testing and testing of iOS and Android mobile devices, all in the Cloud.

So, I subscribe to the notion that there should be open-source software and that there should be a sort of software profession in the same manner as teachers, lawyers, doctors, policemen, etc. There would be a tremendous advantage. This advantage has more to do with the widening gap of inequality. We have to keep in mind that large companies have managed to corner the market on some of our most popular applications. Things like the WEB are supposed to be marketplaces for everyone, but they have become the property of such companies as Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, etc. These large companies are working hard to use AI in those applications that we, the consumers, seem to be most addicted to. As a general populous, we get less and less say about how AI is used in relation to us. What is it for? Who benefits from its use? I worked at Google last summer. What I saw was a crowd of people becoming less and less diverse. If you want the world run by Braman Indians and for the rest of the world to be considered untouchable then you should think like the managers I encountered at Google. As untouchables, or Dalits, how would AI be used in relation to us? Would it be to control us and make us keep our place? Yet, if we abandon Google and other like companies and create our own AI and applications that would be based on our AI, we would not have to worry about the next supremacist group to come along and use some part of our infrastructure to control us. Keep in mind that as I say this, that only a small number of Germans started the Nazi movement. But, the country remained divided between those who follow and those who refuse to follow. The same holds true in India with its newfound nationalism as well as with communist China with its newly self-appointed eternal ruler.

With citizen developers working everywhere together, we gain significant advantages. Embrace our FreedomEnsure jobs for all races in all forms of work.Diversity results in better products and other work results. (You can see this now in many places. For instance, Open Street Map performs considerably better than Google Maps.)Decentralize the pile of money for investment (win back some equality).Recognize and accept the capability of our own people. (Our current visa programs for workers are bringing in people less qualified than our own high school graduates. But, our own graduates feel inadequate and expect lower pay than people who come to us with a sense of entitlement given to them by birthright.)In our country, all people are born equal with certain unalienable rights. (this should remain so).Finally addressing AI. A general understanding of AI for all will help us get a feel for the use, limits, and hazards of AI.For the last point, we should recognize that in any town people have some sense as to how cars work, some sense as to how to deal with medical problems, a sense about public works, a sense about education, a sense about the practice of law, etc. Not that everyone is an expert, but they have some general knowledge or feel for these things. For instance, many people know when it’s good to call up a professional and when not to. Or, they can do some fixing of their own if they have to. Since AI could be pervasive and could interfere intimately with people's lives, people should know about it in the same way they know about other professions. Right now, I am a little upset about a traffic ticket for running a red light. I ran a yellow light, but the machine got confused. I know that when I go to the courts, I will have a hard time getting anywhere with my small case, which has as its purpose to take a chunk of money out of my pocket. So, here we are with the simplest automated justice. And, we are having some problems with it. What about “broken robot justice”? You begin to see the problem. What if we had robot storm troopers all programmed by a group of Indians (or folks from some other country that might also be trying to take over all of the information technology in every city on the planet) who thought that all of our citizens were beneath them. What happens when we let the robots make decisions and what if some of those decisions are about hanging people in the town square? If the robots start making incorrect decisions, could we expect people who persecute people in their own country to come to our aid? I just saw the movie, “Jojo Rabit”. That movie reminds us that Nazis left it to local thugs to decide whom to hang in the village square, which they did, leaving the dead for all to see with signs hung on them. I recall the first time I heard a story about the hanging thing it was from a man from Yugoslavia who told us of coming out of his house as a small boy to see the village backer, the butcher, the banker, and family friends hanging from telephone poles. (His parents put him on a boat to our country by himself when he was a small boy. I remember he told us the story about eating a banana for the first time and having some strange man who was nice enough to show him how to peel it.) Should we trust one racially prejudiced group to provide us with robots that can take the place of Storm Troopers? What if Stalin had access to an army of robots that were provided by his special troops to all the villages in Russia? As it was, he had enough humans willing to do his dirty work resulting in more Jews killed in Russia than in Germany. And, also he sent many ethnic Russians to gulags and their deaths for not being in total agreement with him. But, to err is human. In all those countries, not everyone could be mean enough to follow through in harming their fellow men. But, with working robots intended to do the same mean tasks, there would be more follow-through. But, on top of that, if the robots broke and started persecuting the most ardent followers of the broken version of government, who would stop them? If they do their job hurting the sensible people who resist, it might not be too bad for the leaders of such a country if some followers were hurt as well. So, most people can tell when justice is broken. And, they can tell if their car is broken. Most people will be able to tell if robot justice is broken. In order to fix it, it will take the people who are most apt to be harmed by the broken robot justice. That would be the citizen developer who has to come to the rescue.

It was in the 1980s and he was about to get released after a rather long sentence. In Denmark there are several kinds of prisons. Initially, you go to what is called a closed prison with small cells for the inmates, barred windows, limited time outside etc. The living conditions in terms of access to food, clean water, shelter, healthcare etc. is still quite good compared to a slum in a developing country but in general life in a closed prison is miserable with no personal freedom, limited access to society outside and a lot of bullying and violence going on often related to drugs. If you behave well and as a preparation to getting released you move to a semi-open prison with more personal freedom. You are able to move around inside and outside the prison and can (and should) attend a school or similar training completely outside the prison. All this is done in preparation of your release to give you a better start and hopefully avoid that you commit crimes in the future. The semi-open prison still has locks on the doors, surveillance and guards but staying there is a lot less miserable than in the closed prison. After the semi-open prison you might get into an open prison which is more like an institution preparing you for your release. Life in an open prison is still somewhat controlled but as long as you do not break the rules about being home at a certain time, going to school as agreed etc. you have quite a bit of personal freedom. Now, this fellow who told me the story was staying in this institution with some other high profile convicts that were about to get released. They were staying at an old farm located in a big open area to not offend any neighbors. One of the pastimes of these soon to be ex-prisoners was to fix their motorcycles in the courtyard. At this time there were terrible wars going on and many people caught in the crossfire fled to countries like Denmark to avoid getting killed. There was a huge pressure on the authorities to house these people and one interim solution was to build tent villages but finding suitable space for these villages was not easy. It was decided to erect a tent village in the open area around the prison institution and a fence was put between the tent village and the institution. When the refugees started arriving after a perhaps grueling escape via hellish prisons in transit countries they were curious about their very strong and healthy looking neighbors in the old farm fixing badass motorcycles in the courtyard. Chatting through the fence they asked what kind of place the old farm was and the inmates replied that it was prison. The refugees did not believe them. This story does not fully answer the question but there seems to be at least some anecdotal evidence that a Danish open prison provides surprisingly good living conditions when seen from the perspective of a refugee.",2021-03-06T17:51:54.303Z,"Are the living conditions for prisoners in Scandinavian countries better than those of ordinary citizens in developing countries?

To be frank I think this is caused by the differences in the problems that are dealt with in the two streams of (web) development and how the kind of people you are surrounded by view the problem spaces. Fundamentally, imo, the problems in front end programming aren’t really intellectual in nature. What they require instead is intensive domain knowledge. Eg: when asked to implement a large UI change a great FE developer will be able to apply their expert knowledge on the frameworks and tools that can expedite development, how to apply them and whether or not they are supported (by browsers) - or may be how to support them if necessary. In summary: these problems are hard only because you are missing pieces of domain information. Assuming (near) perfect knowledge of the domain (browsers, frameworks etc) the solutions are trivial. If you have intermediate programming ability and know css, bootstrap, jquery, gulp/grunt, babel and how to use Selenium and Mocha you can create a good front end product - period. If you are taught these things by a person who knows them and has a good handle on teaching you’ll pick all of this up in a few weeks. This includes (sass/less, es5/6, polyfills yada yada). There is nothing innately difficult about understanding them. Once you sift pass the buzzwords there is no depth to the complexity of what these frameworks/tools do. What this also means is that with basic programming ability and a few months of bootcamping to gain domain knowledge you can become a successful Frontend developer. The only reason FE developers still command respectable salaries at the entry/mid level ($75,000+)- as opposed to maybe ($40,000–50,000) which is what this level of intellectual rigour might merit, is the demand (which I’d argue is temporary up until dot com 2.0) Ergo in FE: Knowing more -> better solutions Backend development (BE) is where you face problems that are essentially puzzles. Even if you have perfect information on the domain (algorithms + frameworks), on its own that knowledge will not directly deal with your problems. You will not be able to pick up data structures and algorithms and start applying them in a few months on any project that needs to scale. And you certainly wouldn’t be getting optimal results in terms of load bearing and response time. Even the most trivial backend problems start becoming complex once you append “for 4 million active customers across 4 continents” to it. By and large scalability is not a requirement in FE - since 4 million customers = 4 million browsers on which your FE will run) This is why you will have a harder time (not impossible ofc) getting into backend development with no university creds at demanding companies (where backend is more than basic CRUD). Basic programming and bootcamping will not be enough to solve backend problems - you really do need theoretical chops to do a good job. In BE: being smarter -> better solutions But on the other hand since backend does not normally have the same development velocity as frontend you wont need 1 FE: 1BE. As a result, lower demand offsets the fact that fewer people are up to this task: salaries of FE and BE are mostly the same at the moment. However I think there is a debate to be had about which of these two streams is a foundation for a more secure position post dot com 2.0. In my opinion, FE is a place where people of average intelligence like myself can level the playing field by working harder at it. Nevertheless, you are also expendable which means getting noticed and moving out of the junior levels is of critical importance to ensure your future in the field/workplace.

India is a rapidly developing country but at the same time it is facing lot of problems both internally & externally & India can become a developed country & a world Super Power only if these problems are eradicated.

India has the potential of becoming a super power & it can become so if the following fifty steps are taken by the Indian government. India is a rapidly developing country but at the same time it is facing lot of problems both internally & externally & India can become a developed country & a world Super Power only if these problems are eradicated. Following are some of the ways which can make India a developed country & a super power – 1) By controlling rapidly increasing population Rapidly increasing population is the biggest menace which India is facing currently as over population is the root cause of most of the problems like poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, pollution, crime etc. India is the second most populated country of the world after China & unless India takes some effective steps to check population India can’t become a super power as it is the biggest hindrance in the progress of country. 2) By eradicating poverty In India still millions of people live below the poverty line & as long as there is poverty in a country it can’t become a developed country. So Indian government must take some serious steps to eradicate poverty from the country so as to make it a super power. 3) By increasing literacy rate Illiteracy also acts as a hindrance in the development of a country as an illiterate person can’t contribute in any way in the progress of a country. So illiteracy should be eradicated from the country by providing free & compulsory education to children as well as to uneducated adults. 4) By checking unemployment Unless problem of unemployment is addressed by creating more employment opportunities for the people India can’t become a super power because unemployment means lot of human resources of the country remain under utilized or unutilized which could have been used for the progress of the country. 5) By eliminating pollution Pollution is also an impediment in the progress of a country whether its air, water, noise or radioactive pollution since pollution affects the competence of an individual through various forms of illnesses like headache, high or low blood pressure, asthma etc. & an unfit person can’t contribute effectively to the progress of a country. 6) By checking the crime rate A peaceful country can progress much more than a country with a high crime rate. So, efforts should be made by the Indian government to check the crime rate in the country by making some effective laws & equally effective implementation of those laws so as to make India a super power. 7) By adopting zero tolerance against corruption Corruption is also a big obstacle in the development of a country as it badly affects the economy of a country. Corruption is rampant in India & India is placed 87th in the international corruption index. So, unless corruption is eliminated from India by adopting zero tolerance approach towards corruption & by making some effective laws India can’t become a super power. 8) By bringing back the black money stashed abroad Thousands of crores of black money of India is stashed abroad in the foreign banks by various influential persons of India which is badly hampering the progress of Indian economy. Unless serious efforts are made by the Indian government to bring back that black money India can’t become a developed country. 9) By becoming self sufficient in food grain production A country can’t become a super power unless it becomes self sufficient in the production of food grains i.e. capable of feeding its population through its own produce & without any foreign aid. India hasn’t reached to that level as yet. So to become a super power India must increase its production of food grains that can only be done by bringing new & latest agricultural techniques. 10) By proper storage of food grains Since it is a well established fact that only that country can become a super power which is self sufficient in food grain production & there are two ways to reach that level. First way is by increasing the production of food grains & the second way is by proper storage of such food grains. In India millions of tons of food grains are destroyed every year due to lack of proper storage facilities in India. So, if Indian government can build enough storage houses to store the food grains India can become self sufficient in food grains which in turn will make India a developed country. 11) By maintaining good relations with foreign countries A developed country is one which maintains good & friendly relations with all the foreign countries of the world. So to become a super power India must keep good relations not only with powerful countries like USA, Russia, France, England & Germany but also with hostile countries like Pakistan & China. 12) By strengthening democracy Although India is the most happening democracy of the world yet it must make constant efforts to strengthen that democracy since only a democratic country can become a super power because only a democratic government enjoys the support of its people since it is elected by them & without the whole hearted support of people a country can’t achieve the status of super power. 13) By countering terrorism Terrorism is the biggest threat to the stability of a country since an unstable country can’t become a super power. So to become a super power India must make serious efforts to eliminate terrorism from the country whether it’s the terrorism in Kashmir or the Naxalites & Maoists operating in various other parts of the country. 14) By political accountability Politicians in India enjoy vast & unrestricted powers which are not enjoyed by any other politicians of the world. There is nothing called political accountability in India because of which politician indulge in various kinds of illegal & corrupt practices like crime, anti social activities, corruption etc. which seriously hampers the development of the country. So there is need of strict laws in India to put a curb on the unrestricted powers of the politicians & to punish them for their misdeeds. Unless this is done India can’t become a super power. 15) By judicial accountability Apart from politicians if there is anyone else who enjoys such vast powers in India it is the Indian judiciary. In India there is lack of not only political accountability but judicial accountability as well because of which several judges also indulge in various illegal & corrupt practices which in turn hampers the progress of the country. So some strict laws must be made to check the vast powers of judges & to punish them for their illegal & corrupt practices. 16) By performing fundamental duties Twelve fundamental duties are provided under Article 51A of constitution of India for Indian citizens. If these duties are performed by the citizens it can help a lot in the development of the country so as to make it a super power. 17) By adopting proper Income tax policy Income tax policy of India should be little more lenient & must not put extra pressure on the citizens. A good income tax policy can encourage the people to pay the taxes & refrain from tax evasion which in turn would put a check on black money which is one of the biggest hindrance in the progress of India. 18) By equitable distribution of natural & other resources of the country A country can become a developed country only when all of its states are developed & this is possible only when the central government equitably distributes the natural & other resources of the country between all the states. 19) By developing under developed states Since only a developed state leads to a developed country. So it is the duty of the government of India to invest more money & efforts in those states which are under developed & backward so as to make them more advanced. In India several states are developed while few are under developed which should be given special treatment to make them developed states if India wants to become a super power. 20) By becoming self sufficient in the field of defence India still largely depends upon countries like Russia, Israel, USA & France for its defence equipments whether it’s the aircrafts, tanks, spy satellites & so on. Unless India starts manufacturing all its defence equipments itself it can’t become a super power. So, Indian government must make some efforts to become self sufficient in defence equipments. 21) By overcoming shortage of electricity In India there is acute shortage of electricity due to less supply & more demand. Electricity is needed not only for household purposes but also for industries & other commercial purposes. Unless enough electricity is provided to these industries they can’t increase their output which is necessary for the development of the country. Moreover there are various villages in India where there is no electricity & unless electricity reaches all the Indian villages India can’t become a super power. 22) By organizing big sporting events India can show the entire world that it is a rapidly developing country & a potential super power by organizing mega sporting events like Olympic Games & Football world cup which are a great international platform to showcase the entire world the might of a country. 23) By improving the standard of living of people People of developed country have a high standard of living as the governments of those countries provide lot of basic facilities to their citizens. Indian government must do the same to improve the standard of living of people of India & thereby making India a developed country. 24) By rapid Industrialization A country can become a developed country by establishing new industries & factories as these industries are a major contributor to the national income of a country. So, industrialization is another way to make India a super power. 25) By space exploration A country can show its power to the entire world by way of space exploration. Although India has sent a man in space i.e. Rakesh Sharma & an unmanned mission Chandrayaan 1 on moon but these efforts are not enough. So, India needs to send several manned missions to moon & other celestial bodies to show the entire world that India is a fast emerging super power. 26) By resolving the Kashmir issue Kashmir is an international dispute between India & Pakistan because of which thousands of people are loosing their lives in Kashmir every year due to terrorism. The government of India has to spend thousands of crores of rupees to maintain law & order in Kashmir. So, if the Kashmir issue is resolved the same money can be utilized for development works in India. 27) By repayment of international debt India is still under millions of dollars of international debt which is badly affecting the progress of Indian economy. So, unless that debt is repaid by India with interest Indian economy can’t be strengthened & India can’t become a super power. 28) By strengthening its nuclear capabilities Although India became a nuclear power a long time ago but India needs to make continuous efforts to develop its nuclear capabilities by developing new nuclear weapons which is absolutely necessary to become a super power. 29) By international trade International trade not only improves the relations of a country with foreign countries but it is also a good source of national income. So, India can become a developed country by increasing its international trade with other countries. 30) By controlling fundamentalists In every country there are certain sections of people who are called radicals or fundamentalists. These persons are the biggest obstacle in the development of a country since they are opposed to every change whether it is beneficial for the country or not. So, if India wants to become a super power it must check those radicals & fundamentalists operating in the country. 31) By checking human rights violations A country can be called a developed country only when there are no cases of human rights violation in the country or even if there are such cases they are strictly dealt with. So, India must put a check on human rights violations in the country & must strictly deal with those cases if it wants to become a super power. 32) By abolishing reservation Reservation is another major factor which is hampering the progress of India. In India preference is given to caste over merit in the matters of public employment which not only hinders the development of the country but also leads to class conflicts. So, India must abolish reservation completely if it wants to become a super power. 33) By putting a check on election expenses In India thousands of crores of rupees are spent by candidates in the national & state elections which badly affects the economy of the country as it is a completely wasteful expenditure. The same money can be utilized to develop the country. So, India must curb the election expenses of the candidates by making some stringent laws so as to make India a super power. 34) By controlling inflation Price rise or inflation is the biggest factor which badly affects the economy of a country as it diminishes the value of Indian rupee in the international market & puts the essential commodities out of reach of a common man. So, India must take some effective steps to control inflation if it wants to become a developed country. 35) By proper utilization of natural resources Various natural resources are found in India like petroleum, coal, iron etc. but the same are not properly utilized. If India wants to become a world super power it must make sure that all its natural resources are properly & fully utilized as these resources are scarce & for that India must use the latest technology to extract & utilize those natural resources. 36) By encouraging renewable sources of energy India must encourage the use of renewable sources of energy like solar energy, wind energy etc. to satisfy its needs of power & electricity since these resources are unlimited in supply & can help in solving the problem of power shortage in India so as to make India a super power. 37) By having hi tech army, navy & air force If India wants to become a super power it must provide the latest & best technology & equipments to all the three wings of its forces i.e. army, navy & air force since only hi tech force can defend a country effectively against all kinds of dangers. 38) By increasing the forest area Indian government must make efforts not only to increase the forest area but also allow plantation of trees in all public places as trees help in reducing lot of problems which India is facing currently like pollution, floods, earthquakes, soil erosion etc. & if these problems are solved India can become a developed country. 39) By having a strong democratic government If India wants to become a world super power it must have a strong democratic government which should not come under anybody’s pressure & must not hesitate in taking bold decisions if such decisions are beneficial for the country. 40) By providing some freedom to its artists & scholars Artists & scholars of a country like painters, writers, actors, directors etc. bring lot of name & fame to the country at the international level through their work & thereby project a powerful image of the country. So, India must provide some freedom to its artists & scholars by saving them from vexatious & frivolous litigation if it wants to become a super power. 41) By promoting harmony & universal brotherhood India is a multi religions country where people of different religions live together like Hindu, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians etc. So, there is need to promote the feeling of harmony & universal brotherhood among the people if India wants to become a developed country. 42) By eradicating unnecessary customs, traditions & superstitions India is gripped in lot of unnecessary customs, traditions & superstitions which are prevalent in India since time immemorial. These customs, traditions & superstitions are hindering the progress of the country. So, India needs to eliminate such fruitless customs, traditions & superstitions if it wants to become a super power. 43) By eradicating gender bias In India despite of lot of advancement in every field of life a girl is still considered to be a liability while a boy is considered to be an asset. That’s why the sex ratio of girls in India is continuously falling. Therefore, if India wants to become a super power it must eradicate this gender bias from the mind of people. 44) By revamping the judicial system Indian judiciary is over burdened with work because of which people have to wait for years to get justice. That’s why people lose faith in the judiciary as justice delayed is justice denied in many cases & a country can’t become a super power unless it enjoys the faith of people. So the Indian government must do something about this problem by opening new courts & employing more judges. 45) By protecting the fundamental rights of citizens Fundamental rights provided by the Indian constitution to the citizens & non citizens are the basic rights for the existence of a human being unless the same are properly protected by the government India can’t become a super power. 46) By privatization of various public sectors Efficiency of private sector is much more than public sector & that’s why private sector can contribute much more than public sector to the national income of the country. Therefore if India wants to become a super power it must privatize all the public sectors to improve their efficiency except defence and law & order. 47) By improving transport & communication throughout the country Good transport & communication facilities like roads, railway tracks, telephone, internet etc. play a great role in connecting & developing the whole country. So in order to become a super power India must develop its transport & communication facilities. 48) By proper implementation of government plans & schemes The duty of government is not limited to making development plans & schemes rather it is also the duty of government to ensure that those development plans & schemes are properly executed at the grass root level & unless this is done India can’t become a developed country. 49) By revamping the education system The education system of India is quite monotonous as various subjects which are taught to students are useless. No innovative subjects are introduced for the students that can help them in future. So if India wants to become a super power it must completely revamp its education structure by providing the students facilities to choose only those streams which they like as that will help in their overall development. 50) By encouraging poor but bright students Indian government must provide proper facilities to the poor but bright & brilliant students in the form of scholarships, financial assistance etc. as these students can contribute a lot in the future to develop the country & make it a super power.

Our wealth comes, by a large percentage, from not having been involved in a war in more than 170 years. Meanwhile, the USA has more or less been in a state of war since Pearl Harbour.Considering all the wars the US have been fighting, none of which they have won in decades, despite being the 'biggest, strongest, toughest, most modern and best army in the world’, the US freedom comes at a very, very high cost, in lives, socially and financially. US citizens should thus enjoy the most liberties of any nations citizens, by far, but they don’t, not even close, not even top ten. https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-11-29/these-are-the-freest-countries-in-the-world (https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2016-update-3.pdf) 2017 Index of Economic Freedom Now, that’s just legally. Factually, in real everyday life, this looks even more trist. First of all, the average American doesn't understand that freedom goes two ways: you grant others the liberties you take for granted, this should be clear for anyone with basic ethics and morals, but is not to say that Americans have no ethics, it only shows the degree of misinformation, distraction from reality by media and ‘fake news’, as well as indoctrination of a false sense of identity. Regarding specific liberties. Freedom of speech, ask your employer, he can check what you post or like online and fire you for it, not legally, but factually (too many legal loopholes allowing him to do so). In schools and at the workplace, you can get seriously mobbed for speaking your voice. Often, your fellow citizens don’t grant you the rights your Constitution does. A woman who posts beautiful, tasteful nudity online is professionally screwed for life and may even become a social outcast. Your laws are sexually prohibitive. If you have sex in your bedroom, and the neighbour's 8-year old watches, you may get fined for indecent exposure. - Try burning your flag, nothing but a symbol, a colourful towel, you’ll get death threats. So much for freedom of speech, or right to privacy. It is legal to do all kinds of really nasty things, sexually, to an 18 year old girl, you can pay her too, if you film and post it online and call it porn, but prostitution is illegal. - You still teach sexual abstinence to teens, in Europe we teach them how to use a condom at the age of 12. As a result, the US has +- 5 times more teen pregnancies than the EU. Abortion is still problematic in the US though, because your irrational, intolerant and ignorant religious right can’t grant women the liberty to decide over their own body, which is a cause for your higher infant mortality. Religion, what about freedom ‘from’ religion, or religious freedom for children who get indoctrinated so they never get a chance to decide for themself? Furthermore, in the US, you or your loved ones are free to get killed, fighting wars for the purse of your richest and the profits of the defence industry and the lending banks. On the flip-side, it’s illegal for you to decide that life isn’t worth living and to end it yourself, so even your bodies ‘belong’ to the ‘ruling class’, not legally, but actually. Marketing, lobbying, advertising in general and digital media have lead to a complete dystopia. Of course Americans are free to travel, yet only 35% of American Citizens own a passport, and, most likely, they can not afford to travel, and/or they might lose their jobs if they do. If or when they do take a vacation, or during their deserved off-time, their boss may disturb them via telephone or e-mail without repercussions, so employees are never really able to truly relax, get away from all the stress. This leads to a mediocre US GDP (per capita), a lower life expectancy of the middle and lower classes, higher health care expenditures (that Americans mostly pay out of their pockets) less job security, and a greater fear of job los. I could go on with the Pharma industry costing American citizens two times as much as it does us Europeans, and we have complete coverage for everyone and a 7 year higher life expectancy. - I wouldn’t rant like that, if Americans, who have never been outside their own country, and don’t inform themself in any form, would not keep blasting about ‘Their Freedom’, as if the US had a monopoly on it. The same goes for Democracy. Democracy is ‘ruling by majority’, those times have come and are long gone in the US. I am sorry for being so blunt. I love the American people. You are the most helpful people I know. Come on, you can do better, I know so, I lived with you for more than a decade.

Fix the broken, taxation-without-representation laws? Nope. They jacked up the renunciation fee like 500% so that it’s harder than ever to renounce.Rule of law - our criminal justice system is… not particularly equitable. Civil Asset Forfeiture is a gross injustice, poor people and minorities tend to get the shaft disproportionately, and we have more of our population per capita incarcerated than virtually anywhere else in the world (thank you for-profit prison industry).Freedom of movement - partly because of citizenship-based taxation (above), among other things, it’s actually quite difficult to leave or even travel internationally. “Love it or leave it?” Good luck.

In Russia, my host mother half-filled a grocery bag with one week's garbage. In the U.S., most people can create that much in 12-24 hours. Because people in developing countries have less, they create less waste. By observing what they eschew, someone from a developed country can make adjustments to the way they live their lives and use resources. 3) Language. This may seem rather obvious, but the more time you spend with locals, the more likely you are to learn a language. In a lot of developing nations, English isn't widely spoken, and you have more of an opportunity to pick up the local language than you would visiting a more developed country. 4) Cultural sensitivity. In a less-developed country, where people are less likely to see wealthy foreigners, your actions are likely to be projected on your entire culture. One loud, drunk American in a provincial capital is likely to be gossiped about for years to come. Spending time with people in a developing country is likely to make you examine your own behavior and consider how it could be adapted or modified to reflect better upon yourself and your culture.  5) There's not enough to say about how valuable learning about another country- developing or not- can be. If you've had personal interaction with people in a country, they've elevated your experience and taught you more about the place you've been. Aside from personal knowledge and development, teaching others about a place you've visited is both gratifying and spreads knowledge about it to other people.

And finally some just pay for things like healthcare and social security through general taxes like New Zealand.  Then we could look at tax per person or tax by GDP.  Ok. According to Wikipedia. GDP numbers for tax as percentage of GDP.( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP ) The USA taxes at 26.9% of GDP, Korea 26.8%, the UK at 39%. But then you have developed countries like Singapore at 14.2% of GDP, Taiwan at 12.4% or Hong Kong at 13% of GDP. But as I said before one reason tax rates are different is because of what nations buy with their money. Korea has to buy a large army. The EU like to fund their welfare states, but in the USA you buy healthcare only for the old and the poor (And pay too much as well to boot). Hong Kong and Singapore are low tax places because well you know there is very little welfare or support. You are expected to look after yourself.  The question I ask you is are you getting value for money from what your taxes buy you versus benefits of low taxes? Now how about absolute numbers (in USD).

GOI is still not serious on these high level scams and procedure to close loopholes but still try to squeeze the neck of tax payer who pay taxes perfectly like employees. They have fixed income but they can make max of some duplicate rental receipts so that they can gain 10K in the taxes.

Max to max branch manager and audit manager may get some jail term after they were thru years of hearings. So India wil never become developed until its people stop taking everything as granted. IAS aspiriant whose parents are government officials and stays in city like delhi but still takes reservation for granted. She married an muslim so her childeren can have selection for their caste and she may practice another religion but on paper they can select caste as her and their children can enjoy reservation but a person whose father cannot have an earnings of 5K to 10K per month cannot have scholar or reservation because he is not from reserved caste. In government office more than 70% donot work until they get their share even though we donot want to pay we give them money because we want our work to be done and he takes it as granted.

The UK and parts of Europe, especially with the waves of Syrian ""refugees"" are starting to see their crime rates soar.  Raw crime is not the main factor however. In the UK for example you are several times more likely to be robbed, stabbed, raped or assaulted than in the US. It's not that people survive because of inferior weapons. It's because they are attacked by street level criminals who do not want to risk a murder charge in the commission of the crime, nor are they mentally seeking to kill anyone. Gang members by contrast go in with the intent to kill. While many gangs sideline with other crimes, typically gangs have a meal ticket and avoid other crime. They often engage in extortion, drug trafficking, prostitution, White collar rackets and similar crimes. Holding up a liquor store or mugging granny Jones is a low profit and high risk activity.  Murder victims in the US are more often than not gang members killed by other gang members. Take away gang related murder and the US murder rate is right in the middle of developed nations.  If you look at nations with the worst murder rates, they are also the nations with the worst gang problems. South/Central America in particular has a murder plague going on. Yet almost all of those nations ban private ownership of guns or highly restrict them. Russia, if you count it as a developed nation has a far greater murder rate than the US, and also a bigger gang problem.  In fact there is a 1 for 1 correlation between gang activity and murder rates.   By contrast if you examine gun ownership concentrations and murder rates, it's a scatter plot. If restrictions on gun ownership worked, then there would be a direct correlation with murder rates and gun ownership concentrations. There is no such correlation. In particular in the US. Gun groups have long cited the fact that the areas in the US with the highest gun ownership are also the areas you are least likely to be murdered. This however is a side effect. Those areas are also the least likely to have gang activity. Some rural US areas where there are more guns than people have gone decades between murders. Murders when they do happen in those areas are usually committed by an outsider and the victim is often an outsider as well. The crime just happened in that particular region.  Gun restrictions not only do not guarantee safety, they seem to have an inverse effect. Most of the nations with total or almost total bans on private gun ownership also have extremely high murder rates. There are exceptions. Japan for example doesn't just ban guns, they ban just about anything more lethal than a pencil. Japan typically has very low murder rates, but also very low gang activity. What gang activity there is in Japan is low key and established. There are no power struggles as Japan makes it almost impossible to immigrate to their nation. As such no influx of new blood to challenge the old authority in the underworld. The US by contrast has seen wave after wave of new immigrants rise to the top of the underworld, then assimilate leaving the next wave of immigrants to assume the mantle.  Unassimilated immigrants or poorly assimilated immigrants again has a strong correlation. The better assimilated immigrants are the less likely they are to engage i gang activity. The less gang activity the less murder there is. Ethnic enclaves are natural breeding grounds for gangs and crime. The poverty, lack of opportunity, poor assimilation caused by surrounding oneself with other unassimilated people and the physical proximity to others in the same plight is a perfect environment for breeding gangs.  Something Europe is discovering the hard way in recent years. A lesson they could have learned from the US but did not.  As for accidentally. A large part of that is that Americans handle guns hundreds of times more than Europeans. Americans are at least a dozen times more likely to die in a car wreck than most Europeans as well. That is because Americans drive far more miles. While a European is far more likely to die in a ferry accident or mass transit accident than an American. That is because per capita they use mass transit and ferries more often than Americans. Most European nations, which is what you mean by ""developed"". Russia and other developed nations are conveniently left out of such biased studies. Europeans in general do not have a strong history of owning guns, in many European nations it's nearly impossible for a private citizen to own one. If they do they have to keep it at a club. Yet nations like Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Lithuania, etc which do have high, sometimes higher ownership rates than the US typically have very low murder rates, but will logically have more accidental shootings than other developed nations because there are simply more guns and gun usage.  The US probably leads the world or is at least in the top ten for lightning strikes as well. Why? Because Americans are more likely to be out in open areas when lightning storms strike.  The Irish and UK have far greater rates of alcoholism and deaths because of drinking than the US. Why? Because they have more access to alcohol and a culture which promotes drinking.   Regulating or banning booze won't solve the problem.

I agree with you that we, the citizens, also need to change our habits and ethics significantly, for this to work. But how does citizenry (both the public and businesses) change its habits and ethics? There is the gradual change but good leaders can catalyze a lot of social change. Such changes are sometimes through rules and their enforcement - at other times it can go as far as social engineering. And then there is Nudge (Behavioural Insights Team). Worldwide and within India, there is good evidence to support both these points - that one leader can indeed bring change and that the population can change its habits and ethics in a short period under leadership of such an individual. To name only a few, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore,  Margaret Thatcher of UK, and Sheikh Al-Maktoum of Dubai come to mind. In India, Nitish Kumar of Bihar and Chandrababu Naidu of AP are good examples, among others. I am leaving aside Narendra Modi of Gujarat consciously because of how polarized some people become when that name appears (another habit we must change as a society!). Let me elaborate on a couple of these examples.   Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore This statesman is credited, rightly so, as the Father of Singapore. Malaysia kicked out Singapore in 1965, who had to leave involuntarily. They had almost zero water, zero energy minerals, zero metallic minerals, hardly any land and at that time not well-educated population. The GDP per capita was $511. Today it is more than that of the US. This country is even cleaner and safer than most of the developed world.  So who should the credit go to? Of,course the people themselves. But LKY's role, who was PM from 1965-90, is considered instrumental. Why? Because he took tough decisions and was single-minded in his focus to transform Singapore.  On national security, something particularly non-trivial for a small country, he started compulsory male conscription, which is not an easy decision. On economy, he ""opened"" Singapore decades ahead of when India did so in 1991, which required ideological courage especially given Singapore's geographical and cultural proximity with communist China. In Civil Service, he decided that they must pay high salaries - another hard decision - to civil servants but expect zero tolerance to corruption in return. And so on across many issues. Should Singapore thank LKY - yes and they do so wholeheartedly. But, back to your question, could LKY do all this without the society changing its habits and ethics? No. But LKY also proved to be a catalyst for social changes, which brings me to other set of hard decisions.  Singapore has 3 ethnicities - Chinese (76%), Malays (16%), and Indians (8%). LKY had the foresight that this country without any resources would be nothing if the people frighted among themselves. He decided English to be the lingua franca - a wise decision both for social cohesion but not an easy decision. He also decided against ghetto-isation i.e., all government housing in Singapore (which is 80% of all housing) host all ethnicities as a policy. There was also social engineering of simpler variety like very high fines for minor offences like littering, ban on chewing gum and encouragement for Citizens to pick up etiquettes. The citizens of Singapore, to their credit, worked hard and sacrificed a lot in the process and are reaping rewards today. One leader did bring change.   Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar Well the context is that Lalu Prasad Yadav was the Chief Minister of Bihar for 15 years, mainly voted in due to caste politics, led the already poor state to absolute misery where quality of life, crime and human development indicators of the state became worse than most of sub-saharan Africa. The state is land-locked and without port. The mineral resource rich region of Jharkhand was separated from Bihar in 2000. There was hardly any modern industry. Agriculture was strong given the fertile basin of Ganga, but it could barely support a state of 100+ million people. Enter Nitish - a hero who is now unfortunately beleaguered. Nitish first focused on crime. He put 70K criminals in jail in his first term. He then went on building roads and bridges all over.   Then he stepped up efforts on education and women empowerment. Nitish really made strides regarding women empowerment much before the recent fad among national politicians. He started special incentives for sending girl children to schools; implemented reservation of women in local government and also in village school teacher recruitment. Those who study development know the positive effects on family and society when a woman is educated and has a small regular earning.  Quoting from Brookings: Better roads also made it easier for kids to get to school— which Nitish says is his passion. He provided free mid-day meals, uniforms and bicycles to increase attendance. Perhaps more importantly, he hired 150,000 new teachers. That’s 50% more than next door in Uttar Pradesh, a state with twice as many people. Illiteracy approached 30% of the general population, and 70% among women.  He placed special emphasis on girls’ education, cutting female illiteracy to 40%. That included not just teaching “the girl child,” but also targeting adult women illiteracy.  He is also putting efforts for wealth creation. There has been significant change in electricity situation, agriculture productivity, and Buddhist tourism. They are trying heavy canvassing of investors where success has been more elusive.  The mainstream media makes it look like the current corruption movement as the only effort in India historically or geographically - both of which are false. Nitish has implemented confiscating properties of several corrupt government officials and has already converted them into schools!  Again to your question, the leader can be a catalyst for change in people. Nitish has been strict about attendance of government employees in educational institutes and in healthcare. Nitish has given hope to people in even more fundamental ways - pride and hope are back. Bihar Institute of Economic Studies estimates that migration is down 25%-30%. One leader is brininging change.   One complain that many people have with LKY, Thatcher, and even Nitish is their supposed ""authoritarianism"", even though these places are democracies. And Sheikh al-Maktoum is a monarch. I will just say that world is full of dictators and despots. But very few could transform their land. Arab  world is not short of countries with a lot of oil and gas - but Dubai, which now hardly has any oil income, is still unique among Saudi, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Emirates of UAE, let alone the more ravaged Iran, Iraq and Yemen. One good leader at the helm matters.

There's no excuse that so many of them go hungry.

But these people often need to pay huge sums for bodyguards, security and converting their houses into fortresses, always being on edge, because family members might get kidnapped.  But still: I married into a farming family from Northern Mexico who by the most part, still live very, very marginated. While living there, we helped out as much, maybe too much, as we could. But my wife's uncles out on that desert farm did not complain. No running water, no sewers, many times no electricity, no health care, not even a church nor a paved road. Only one channel on the TV and no cell phone or internet access until very recently. No police, of course and no government. One little school to sixth grade. Next rural town about 45 minutes on a dirt track. People were happy to eat twice a day every day the same, not having to work too hard or at least not every day, not having a boss to deal with and getting a feeling of accomplishment when selling the meager harvest in fall, splurge a little in December and going back to corn tortillas, rice and beans in January. You learn how to fix your pickup with wire and duct tape and some used spare parts, build your own house and eat your own food. And believe it or not: People live to be very old there, never retire and seldom see a doctor. (Our task was paying for him quite a few times and bringing some food out there, like fruits and dairy.) We spent about a weekend per month out there, for many many years, sometimes the whole  Christmas holiday season, sometimes also buying part of the harvest at store-price for our own consumption. Best pinto beans of the world. No fertilizer, no pestizides no genetic engineering. I never felt that these people were missing out on life, and we might have moved out there ourselves if it was not for that other uncle nobody got along with. But they gladly guided me through the barren landscape, a mixture of Death Valley and Big Bend, finding great joy in the ways, this foreigner liked the life at the ""Rancho"". Conditions are extremely rough, you get 15 degrees C below in winter and 50 above in summer, no rain for 12 months or some epic flood. And snow. And duststorms. But no, they did not suffer out there for the most part. Lots of storytelling instead of TV and Facebook. But I certainly do think, many of my newfound co-workers here in Switzerland (we moved back 2011; we did not wish to continue living under drug-war- conditions) here are missing out of life. Working 25 years in a warehouse for instance. Even when getting a 2 week stint per year at a beach somewhere, this life still sucks. In Mexico, we never really went on a vacation, maybe once, but we felt that we were leading a full life not known to ""First Worlders"" It felt a little like in ""Back to the Future"", in the Old West-sequel, even when not having to learn to use a six-shooter. But this is just myth anyway. People out there are not usually violent, even when no police is watching - unless the cartel moves in and declares your farm off limit to you. (You get a deal that you should gladly accept) Yeah, I do miss ""El Norte"" quite a bit sometimes, even when this year the Swiss winter weather is quite similar to theirs. Meaning crisp cold, clear nights and almost balmy, sunny days. I miss the smokey smell of wood fires in somewhat leaky stoves, the rattling by the wind of the flimsy windows, the doubts at two in the morning if it is worth the trek to the outhouse some 80 yards away with no lights. And the nights with more stars above you than you ever would see in a Star Wars movie. The taste of untreated well water. (Do not drink the water in northern Mexico, if you do, you might want to stay there!) My first try at the axe under the worryful watch of my young wife and a crafty smile from that other uncle! Not really. At least I do not. It of course depends WHAT kind of difficulties you mean. Starvation, rampant disease and war no one likes, not even the people in the so-called third world. And then are differences. Third world also might include places, where you actually can live quite well, when having either some land, a craft or earn a decent salary. It is the abysmal social differences, that make life difficult there, for all classes! Take Mexico.

With respect to Telangana, Haritha Haaram (A program to improve the green cover of the state) and Mission Kakatiya (Restoring and conserving Tanks and Lakes) are two major programs where the participation of the public is required on a large scale : Haritha Haaram : The main objective of this program is to make the state Green in the next three years. It is roughly estimated that the entire state requires 210 crore saplings to bring 33 per cent of the area under green cover. Saplings are being distributed free of cost at selected places and interested persons can make use of this wonderful opportunity. The govt will officially kick start this program on Friday, 8/7/16.Mission Kakatiya : The main aim of this ambitious project is to restore around 45,000 lakes and ponds in the state. As Telangana is situated on a higher terrain, the availability of groundwater in many districts is low and the irrigation facility is highly dependent on monsoons. So the govt has taken a task to save 9000 lakes per year. At many places individuals and voluntary organizations are helping to conserve lakes. In the long run conservation of lakes will not only help to increase the ground water levels, but also act as a buffer in case monsoons are not satisfactory !!In a nutshell, not only the above two.

Males live around four years less  than their Swiss counterparts, and females 5.5 years behind the  Japanese. And the gap is widening. British females had a lower life  expectancy than Americans in 1980; now they can expect to live 1.6 years  longer. British males have gone from being roughly level to being more  than two years ahead. (As we note in this week's issue, men are closing the longevity gap with women,  thanks in significant part to a big drop in smoking rates. But as we  note in our innovation package,  despite all the medical innovation, American longevity improvements  have slowed.) The table shows the data from some (but not all) of the  OECD countries.  If we rank OECD nations by the improvement in female life  expectancy at birth between 1980 and 2009, the difference is  particularly striking. America ranks equal bottom (with the  Netherlands), having seen female life expectancy increase just 3.5  years. The median OECD country has enjoyed a 6 year gain for females, or  around two years per decade. (The median gain for OECD males has been  7.3 years; American males have gained 6.) Again, this is not just a  question of other countries catching up; Japanese females were already  living longer than Americans in 1980 and have gained another 7.6 years  since then.An equally telling statistic emerges from a look at life  expectancy at age 65. Life expectancy at birth has been give a boost by  the reduction of childhood diseases, but what is interesting is that  more people in the rich world are living into their 90s and beyond. The  gains for American female retirees between 1980 and 2009 were just two  years, placing the US 26th out of 29 (the median gain was four years).  American 65 year old women had the third longest life expectancy in the  OECD in 1980; not any more, they are below the halfway mark.At  least American male retirees have done slightly better. The gain in  their life expectancy since 1980 has been 3.5 years, just below the 3.9  year median, and they are still (at 17.6 years) in the top half of the  OECD table.What might be the reasons? It is hard not to lead to  the conclusion that the huge US expenditure on healthcare has been  wasted (see the daily chart here).  Perhaps the difference is in primary care; the benefit of a free health  service is that no-one is discouraged from visiting the doctor. One of  the key factors in the European longevity improvement has been lifestyle  changes. British 65-year olds now live 5.5 years more than their 1980  counterparts, the second best improvement in the OECD, and that seems to  be down to a very sharp fall in smoking rates, encouraged by public  health campaigns.Americans have given up smoking too, but as is  well known, their obesity rate has soared. Among the least obese  Europeans are the Swiss and the Italians, and they are near the top of  the post-65 longevity league. As the saying goes, there are old people  and fat people but few old, fat people. The Swiss have listened to Mr  Spock's advice. Another reason, inevitably, involves money.  Like it or not.

Brief answer: Individuals cannot save this world by its own individual efforts in this natural order domination to save this world but only when all individuals start to join forces to establish a rationalist party and build a rationalist social system to realise rational order-run rational social system, they can succeed. Establish rationalist theory, organise into a disciplined party, educate people with rationalist theory, action in establish rational social system and run it with rational order. While leave the natural order to run the social system but individual just picking some rubbishes, plant some trees, save some animals… will never save this world. These are effects. To solve the problem, we have to deal with the fundamental cause: order-system contradiction. And we have to be organised into a disciplined organisation to becoming a political entity. More explanation: Depend on individuals to voluntarily act according to individual free choice to do what they can to save this world? No, that wouldn’t work. That is because natural order is the stable behavioural strategy that has natural stability therefore it spontaneously will rule: suppose the whole world is born rationalists but only a few randomly mutated into the little demons of natural order of the everyone act according his best of present individual interest, and if you let them act freely, by time, they will biologically and mentally spread out their genes and meme (their ideology and behavioural strategy) to overrun this world. Don’t even say in reality, it is the natural order is the born absolute majority but the rationalist order practitioners are the absolute minority. Though the fundamental solution that can solve the problem is to tackle the fundamental system contradiction that require every individual unite in the thoughts and actions in establish rational system and rational process runs in it. Sustainable development is a rational process that requires downscale economy while upgrade economic rationality level, that means rationally shrink economy and use less resources, produce less products and services, while maximize the production of effective information (discovery, creation, invention). At the present moment, we can do two things at the same time: 1. Restrict ourselves to live a simple, national, scientific and healthy life style to minimize our resources consumption and pollution. The truth is that it is a good life that suits to anyone: rich, poor or middle if you want to live healthy, live long and happy. Many people are practicing it right now. It is the first generation is the hardest time, after that, situations will get better and better. 2. And in the meantime unite our thoughts and actions to create this rational system and force the rational process into running it. Because it is not a natural process and it doesn’t spontaneously happen, it needs human rational thinking directed rational effort to actuate it and maintain it. It is very difficult thing to do. It is not natural, it is rational. Maybe even the most powerful organization in the world will find it very difficult to achieve. However this thing not only need rational thinking but also power. These two things must unite to even try to start this process. When people’s opinions are prepared and the organization be united under the rationalist principles --- actually we have to create a new organisation (rationalist party) which is dedicated to practice rational order and establish rational social system but not addicted to vested interest that depend on natural order to maintain. Conclusion: Therefore, the only individual action that can save this world is to establish and join your local rationalist party branch and act according rationalist party principles to struggle for human endless future.

It is true it is infinitely more comfortable to book cinema tickets online rather than go to the theatr hours before the show and stand in the unruly queue to buy them. But development is also the one that improves Quality of Life, not living. Thus mere recognition of Individual Freedom and constantly extending its limits does not take us to enhanced Quality of Life just because you have ‘unshackled’ citizens from all constraints. For, the essence of Quality depends upon how you use the Freedom. That’s the reason why the model of development should be such that it should be able to create a socio-cultural environment that leads citizenry to assess in what does consist human dignity and whether they are living or allowing others live in conformity with the ideal of human respect. But what happens at present is a dichotomy. Technological progress, economic planning do make possible more and more comfortable living, materially speaking. But the way we live, again under the distorted Western concepts, is akin to schizophrenia. We are gradually being accustomed to develop a smokescreen of a respectable image behind which we indulge in despicably debasing life-styles. And worse, we form cartels to collectively impose debased life-styles on soft, upright people, if necessary holding them to ransom. This is the reason why I was rather pained to see that the Central Government has been non-committal in the matter concerning abolition of IPC Section 377. For, the Supreme Court's review of the issue provides a good opportunity to do social audit of not just the exception (377), but also of the nefarious British-India Law of 1881 on Consensual Sex as a whole! After all, when addiction itself is bad, piloting people towards many times more devastating sex-addiction is calamitous. For, it simply destroys one's integrity and irretrievably pushes one into Western orbit. These people need not leak defense secrets. It is enough that they stand against the Indian ethos, talk against it, block its wholesome transmission, deride it as primitive, heckle its followers as orthodox, superstitious, and tacitly maintain such people at the margins of the society… This in fact what is happening these days rather unabashedly. The models of development we borrow, the assistance we get are conditioned upon such an acceptance, be it tacit. That is why it is shuddering to notice a political party ideologically casting itself in the role of upholder of Indian Culture, remains mum , as a ruling party, at crucial junctures and allows the same form of inimical development destroying the very human quality of life..

I dare to say that this is a very shallow and limited explanation that people from developped countries bring and the worse, most people from the developping countries accept it too. Such common sense-shalow-limited explanations present in the average-joes-shalow minded people of such developped countries, but even among their elite, do not take in account the following: The opportunities available in the last 500 years were not só vast. Somehow such opportunities were grasped by those who presently form the developped countries. Such opportunities partially happened just by chance as: a) Before all this happens, agriculture 10 thousand years ago, appeared somehow by chance in the middle east b) Wheat an eadible grain easy to be domesticated instead of corn at ancient Americas that would be eadible just 300 years later c)Geographic conditions helped in wheat to migrate from Asia to Europe. d)Fom Asia to Europe, animals that fit to be easily domesticated e) Iron ore available close to surface. Good for making weapons which would be decisive to size other people. Basically this approach is based on the book by Jared Diamond : Arms, Germs and Steel. A Fate of Human Societies Let´s get shorter this history. Soon such people from Europe started to dominate other people. Things were not só clear, untill another happening appeared partially by chance. The Industrial Revolution. Why chance was involved?. The fuel. Could you imagine IR at Britain with no coal, and later at Germany and France?. For example, Brazil had virtually no coal. Oil just on deeper waters, what took centuries to an available techonolgy to be ready. Brazil has Iron ore, but under a deep thick of earth, covered by an impenetrable forest. Such native people would be bounded to be in stone age for ever. So, getting much shorter. So, such white plague colonized other parts of earth, mainly Africa and Latin America( as well Asia, as India, but I focus more at Africa and Latin America). So, the pale faces started their predating colonizing. Even presently the deals with such people are not fair enough( presently is not only the pale faces, but those with shunt eyes too). To summarize a bit more: Presently deals are made under the conditions such people offer as saying: take it or leave. I´m gonna to exploit your oil, but as I need a quick return to my investments( to pay revenues to my pale-faces or shunt eyes shareholders, etc) I can´t provide you neither the same infrastructure we built to our people nor the educational system, etc. So, the deal is done. Even in a while, a leader gets revolted and say, no we need better conditions. Soon this leader is removed by a plot and a corrupt one who is easier to deal is brought. So, this is essentially how things work But it´s easier to the former conquerors´s descents labeling other people as lazy, corrupt, etc. In the other hand the sons of such exploited lands, getting desperate start migrating, some join radical movements. At the end they know. Such former conquerors are powerfull but they can bleed too. And so we are going. Never ending conflicts as well the shallow-limited- explanation-average-joes -mindset ever present. As an international serious agreement is not in the foreseen horizon, it seems at least some vengeance can be carried out. As I wrote, even powerfull people bleed. Much more of our people are going to be destroyed, but we´re too many.

Unfortunately these two things are not under the control of citizens to change. But citizens can be better prepared for these kind of floods. Few of my tips would be:1. During rainy season make sure that you stock rations for at least a week. 2. Build rainwater harvest tanks on the rooftops (if you are living in a house) which will give access to clean water during the situation of an emergency.3. If you are staying in ground floor make sure that you constantly monitor the rains and find a high rise area to shift in case of a flooding.4. Always keep some liquid cash and candles with you. You cannot rely on technology during a natural calamity.5. Learn swimming. It might help.6. If you are living in a low lying area, Shift to an elevated area.(if its possible)7.

Curently people have been educated to start at the bottom and work their way up. Wrong procedure - Starting at the top - the meaning of the most precious item in our entire universe - Human Life. The ability to bring human reason forth. What defines a ‘good’ citizen? What does it mean to be a good member of the human species that occupies not just a country, but the entire planet? By what criteria is the understanding why the human species is on our planet? What are we supposed to do with our precious life? What are the inner most defining reasons to be a human being…. that acts consciously, along with the principals our universe has developed, and continues to develop? The ‘common’ message given to people is that we are simply an advanced animal….not true. We may have common physiological characteristics as animals ( totally different from trees), but it ends there. Humans have the means to be creative - go beyond the enviroment we were born into. Animals stay inside the enviroment they were born into - perhaps somewhat changing over thousands of years growing or diapering as the continuous weather patterns on our planet change over millions of years, but Humans can use their creativity to put people into totally different physical areas by their curiosity - their creativity - even on the surface of the moon! Our singly defined creative species (even with divisions in race, color, size, culture, nationality) all have this power of creativity - where does it com from? Any religion, any culture, any theology that advocated the development - the nurturing of this creative factor is a ‘good’ place to start. The Primary Creative Power that is (as defined in the judical/christian terms as God) anointed every single one of us with a soul that has the tendency to do good. And the agapë [love of all mankind] to bring forth discoveries in the arts such as poetry, music and painting, and also the scientific discoveries that add to the progression of better and higher, or beauty in our lives along with the technological innovations to bring more energy forms that produce the means to go beyond the ‘limits’ of our natural environments. A space ship that traveled to the moon cannot be built out of wood. About 50 years after the first powered airplane carrying a human, our species was placing satellites circling the earth and then 5 years later our species placed a human being onto the moon - creativity begets higher creativity when the funds are allocated to do so. That is the key. Funds to do so. Funds in some form to do so - to free up the physical exertion and ‘invite’ the mental exertion that is contained within the genius of our soul to do so. There is a group of people that is advocating to do this on a global scale - an international criteria where by each sovereign country, - nation state, with it’s own culture contributing to carry our entire species forward into a continuously developing future. A harmony of interests where each unique culture can contribute to the whole to define the paradigm necessary for continued advancing - developing the development. The curent financial system - ‘owned’ by the Oligarch system - the money hungry grouping that wishes to enslave all and only continue to ‘loot’ the profits of what they believe “the herd”produces for their own pleasure. Keep the herd on scanty rations, in poor health - focusing on food, scarce water supplies, no health care or education only by that criteria is their notion of how th control their planet. Yes - many have pushed past that to put people into space but American Presidents that funded that advanced technology have been assassinated or thrown out of office. The continuing collapses of the Oligarch financial system is bailed out at the expense go taxpayers, and the curent looming massive crash about to occur is now with the Oligarch new ‘Great Reset’ financial funding of only the Grean Energy of windmills and solar power will cut the energy requirements necessary to sustain only about a billion people on our planet - what happens to the other 6 billion? Genocide! All in the name of preserving the ‘natural resources” - forgetting it was the creativity of our species that developed the coal/oil/ gas/ nuclear power production that can grow the population globally, and actually provide clean water, health care to all and fund the manufacturing into every country for self sufficient production of the physical necessities requires to bring the creative genius of their people to the surface can cary forth continuously wit new discoveries. China has done so by using the economic principals of the American process of development long ago established by Alexander Hamilton after the U.S. constitution was formed to end the British colonialism in that territory “discovered by Columbus. China puling 800 million out of poverty and allowing it’s population to engage in rapidly developing their country using the type of funding that Hamilton established is an example the The LaRouche Organization of advocating world wide to bring self development to all countries. The Oligarchs, headed by the arisocry of the British Empire is visciously opposing it. If Russia, China, India, and the U.S. join into a new Brenton Woods agreement, they could destroy the financial power of the Oligarch’s Empire. Hamilton type national funding into physical development (not monetary speculation [the Empires notion of creating wealth]) and the Glass Steagall legislation protecting the integrity of the National Bank funding would put the Empire out of business - their evil business especially with the now occurring financial crash about to be the worst crisis in the history of humans on the planet. Time for people to know that each and every human life id unique - of all the lives of the past and all to come, each will never be the same - have the same unique creativity. There hasn't been, nor will ever be another YOU! Bring your talents to The LaRouche Organization and become a good citizen in the development of your country that can work in harmony to help develop all as China is now doing with it’s “Belt and Road Initiative” (which Helga LaRouche was the catalyst for China doing so) is helping over 150 other countries develop. And hopefully, with a little struggle you can help do the same for your country if done using “the big picture” required at this time in human history. You can start by spreading this idea to all you know and the more advanced of your friends will join in and soon join into the process of fulfilling the responsibilities of being truly human - opening our souls to the genius inside all on what ever level it can manifest, continuously, into the future. Enjoy your ability to bring beauty to the entire world, a new top starting point that resolves the problems at the lower levels. As the great scientist Einstein said - only by going into a higher level of thinking then the level that created the problems, can the way be opened for the positive future. One key to this is a new funding system - human based - the Hamilton economic principals, applied that can resolve the old old history of why the world is in the wretched shape it curently is in.

[1] In the late 2000s, India's growth reached 7.5%, which will double the average income in a decade. [1] IMF says that if India pushed more fundamental market reforms, it could sustain the rate and even reach the government's 2011 target of 10%. [1] States have large responsibilities over their economies. The average annual growth rates (2007–12) for Gujarat(13.86%), Uttarakhand (13.66%), Bihar (10.15%) or Jharkhand (9.85%) were higher than for West Bengal (6.24%), Maharashtra (7.84%), Odisha (7.05%), Punjab (6.85%) or Assam(5.88%). [2] India is the sixth-largest economy in the world and the third largest by purchasing power parity adjusted exchange rates (PPP). On per capita basis, it ranks 140th in the world or 129th by PPP. The economic growth has been driven by the expansion of the services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the economic growth. [3] [4] Favourable macroeconomic performance has been a necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991) [citation needed] . The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6). [5] The progress of economic reforms in India is followed closely. The World Bank suggests that the most important priorities are public sector reform, infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, reforms in lagging states, and HIV/AIDS. [6] For 2018, India ranked 77th in Ease of Doing Business Index. According to Index of Economic Freedom World Ranking an annual survey on economic freedom of the nations, India ranks 123rd as compared with China and Russia which ranks 138th and 144th respectively in 2014. At the turn of the century India's GDP was at around US$480 billion. As economic reforms picked up pace, India's GDP grew five-fold to reach US$2.2 trillion in 2015 (as per IMF estimates). India's GDP growth during January–March period of 2015 was at 7.5% compared to China's 7%, making it the fastest growing economy. [7] [8] [9] During 2014–15, India's GDP growth recovered marginally to 7.3% from 6.9% in the previous fiscal. During 2014–15, India's services sector grew by 10.1%, manufacturing sector by 7.1% & agriculture by 0.2%. Indian Economy Grows at 7.6 & 7.1 in FY 2015–16 and FY 2016–17 Respectively as Major Reforms had Been Taken Place like Demonitisation and Implementation of GST in FY 2016–17 the Economic Growth has Been Slow Down in 2017–18 as it is Expected to Grow at 6.7 and Forecasted to Rebound by 8.2% in 2018–19 Continue Reading",2021-03-06T19:17:14.607Z,"Are large industries helpful for true development of citizens of a country like India?

High inequality prevails in terms of economic opportunities. So govt needs to steps take to reduce population such as by making one child policy, use of contraceptives , bringing awareness among people and by empowering them towards making conscious choices. 2)Corruption: India is very well known for Corruption practices in the world.

In this situation govt and citizen participation is require to reduce Corruption to significant level. And by making things transparent at each level ,there will be no opaqueness in the system and there will be less chance of Corruption practices. 3)Social structure : People of India is very resistive towards bringing any kind of change according to the modern line. They still live with century old ideas , tradition and distorted culture. They do not have any kind of scientific temperament. But with the advent of technology this situation is taking reverse shape anyway. So education is the only tool to develop scientific temper. 4)Poverty and malnutrition is the decades long problem for India and Its economy. Despite having efforts from govt since long time we've been able to do very less to reduce Poverty. So egalitarian society is the only solution which is only in the hand of individual of the country and not in the hand of govt. 5) Governance: Strong governance of any nation creates a drastic change in any economy. Despite having 3 tier govt and thousands of institution for public grievances , very little outcomes we get and this shows worse poor governance. So it is in the hand of govt to take stringent action via Digital technology and transparency in governance.

While almost all the other people there, mainly Pakistanis, shrugged off the suggestion, I always thought that the brilliant Dr Grant had hit the nail on its head. Pakistan has always looked at its larger, and now more prosperous, neighbour for comparison. For Pakistan, India was the ‘other’ and had to be reacted against. Hence,  ·       Just because India celebrates its independence day on August 15, Pakistan has to show it one up and celebrate it a day earlier; ·       Just because India has nuclear weapons, Pakistan needs them too; ·       Just because the US signed a civil nuclear agreement with India, Pakistan needs the same deal too and so on.  It seems that Pakistan’s existence is almost inextricably tied with an eternal competition with India, no matter what the cost to its exchequer and people.The relationship between India and Pakistan is a paradox. ""At the individual level, it turns into a whole level of camaraderie. And at the political level, it is akin to hate,"" The people of Pakistan are no different from the people of India except that they are born into Islam. This unfortunate difference gave birth to Pakistan, which has the dishonor of being created as the world’s first religion-based country. I personally believe that Pakistan should never have left India because forming a country based on religion tells the world that we are hateful people. To prove my point I would put an example below:An excerpt from a Pakistani women on PakistanIronically, my own life has been one where the differences between Indians and Pakistanis have been buried. After leaving Islam, I searched for spiritual peace and met a wonderful man who is a Hindu from India. Today, he is my husband and I find that I have a lot of freedom. Women in Islam do not have any freedom and four women are considered to be equal to one man. I realize that I would not have had the opportunity to meet my husband had I not come to America and got my freedom. There are many women like me who long for freedom. I sincerely wish I could do something for my sisters or that America would liberate my sisters but without hurting the people.~Meher   What makes India and Pakistan special, however, is how much they hate each other. Seven decades since independence from the British they have moved in the opposite direction, strategically crafting national identities and policies along a singular concept: Rivalry. What has been the outcome of this obsession is:  ·       Three wars ·       A game of proxies inside Afghanistan.·       A nuclear arms race, as well as a smattering of disputes over territory, water, and trade. ·       a competition between secular and Islamic states, territorial disputes, power politics, ""psychological abnormalities,"" and the influence of outside powers.One of Pakistan’s ""India problems"" is its belief that India wants to wipe the Pakistani state out of existence. On the other hand Among India’s ""Pakistan problems"" is lingering resentment towards partition. It is no wonder that the Pakistanis see India as an existential threat.However having said that I would like to bring to light the ironic perspectives of  both countries prove to be two faces of a single entity, both divided and unified albeit unhappily.Most British Indian army generals believed the division of India into two states was not really necessary. This existence is proof that the legacies of colonialism and the trauma of partition still linger, not just in the form of anger, but also as sadness, fear, and regret. ""Pakistan is what India does not want to be… both a double and the final rejected self… the ultimate symbol of irrationality and fanaticism."" As Imran Khan once said, “Many people in his generation grew up hating India on account of the traumatic events that took place during the Partition”. Khan’s own misconceptions about India only changed after he visited the neighboring country to play cricket. Realities of everyday life led most others to modify their stand. Major Turning Factors Fueling this Obsession: 1.   During the Cold War, Pakistan accepted millions of dollars in U.S. aid to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan, while India became a mouthpiece for nonalignment and other socialist principles. The Americans and Soviets were able to use India and Pakistan in their cold war fight, while the Indians and Pakistanis used their external allies to strengthen conventional military capabilities against the other.Mr. Holbrooke U.S Diplomat wanted to host a ""quadrilateral"" dialogue between the United States, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan that would be similar to the trilateral dialogue he had initiated between the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Despite minor fits and starts until the day Holbrooke died in December that year, the talks never happened. Part of the problem went back to White House who were unable to reconcile opposing viewpoints and took on client-like relationships with the countries they worked on. There was another reason the Indian government couldn’t be too forward leaning on any dialogue with Pakistan: the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The dastardly attacks which were ""designed to disrupt the dialogue,"" and that’s exactly what they did. The memory of the attacks lingered, and lethargic legal systems in both countries meant justice was slow 2.   Only the killings of the Muslim community are highlighted while discussing the 1947 riots. The fact that thousands of innocent Hindus and Sikhs were also brutally slaughtered as madness gripped both sides is totally ignored. It is conveniently forgotten that soon after the creation of Pakistan Jinnah had stressed the need to forget the past and develop friendly relations between the two countries.  It is also ignored that despite many more Germans, Britons and Frenchmen dying while fighting one another in the two World Wars, there is no desire for revenge among them now. European countries are living in amity since the end of hostilities 1945. 3. Journalism in Pakistan inciting hatredMajid Nizami (April 3, 1928 – July 26, 2014),was a chief editor and publisher of Nawa-i-Waqt Group of Publications of Pakistan who is the most well known India hater, was particularly concerned about Kashmir which he considered a part and parcel of Pakistan. The issue, he maintained, could not be resolved through talks. Kashmir will have to be wrested from India through war. Nizami was the most outstanding supporter of Pakistan acquiring nuclear weapons. What is more he advocated use of nuclear weapons against India. He in fact volunteered to be tied to a nuclear weapon and dropped on Indian soil.Nizami warned successive governments against establishing trade relations with India until the resolution of the Kashmir issue. At one point he urged the government to forfeit the pension of Air Marshal Nur Khan for advocating peace and friendly relations with India. One argument from this fringe states  that the Muslims are treated in India as untouchables instead of equal citizens. It is conveniently forgotten that Muslims have held key constitutional posts and important ministries in India while they have served on important positions in the civil service and the armed forcesAnother argument given by the fringe is that India being militarily more powerful it would subjugate Pakistan if left in peace. The “Hate-India” brigade in Pakistan is the mirror image of the Sangh Parivar. It counters Hindu nationalism with Muslim nationalism and Hindutva with Shariah. Its views about the minorities are the reflection of the Sangh Parivar’s attitude towards the Muslims and Christians. In case Modi fails to rein in the extremist tendencies unleashed by his parent organisation, the hate-India fringe in Pakistan will only be further strengthened. What need to be done on Both sides:First of all let us come clear on the fact that Pakistan Army did not oppose peace with India, the reason I juxtapose this point is because the three years that top diplomats of both countries have spent on reaching the framework of the Indo-Pak Kashmir Peace deal could not have happened without their support.However, the undeniable fact that obstructs the peace process is that the Pakistan Army would never settle for a secondary position in any negotiations. Pakistan’s India-centricism has not only created a false image of Pakistan but has also prevented them from focusing on things which would improve the lives of people in our country, like education, health and sanitation. It is indeed very sad that only Anti-Indianism brings the country together — I surely hope, there is more to Pakistan at times like these when Pakistan as state is sliding into chaos.Pakistan is yet to make a major transition into regular democratic rule; I hope that it learns two lessons from the past. First, that there are no permanent friends or enemies in International affairs. This is something which every student of international relations learns on the first day, but it is still an alien concept in Pakistan. Pakistanis still divide the world into ‘friends’ and ‘foes’ and base their foreign policy on this precept, which is obviously flawed. States formulate policy on interests. The improvement of Sino-Indian relations is a prime example of this. India has been an ‘enemy’ to Pakistan but it can also be a “FRIEND”.

If it’s going for full-throttle – ie, that the U.S. government released fully weaponized biological agents over large population centers – then the answer is, “No.” Risking the destruction of Chicago with anthrax would be counterproductive to keeping a secret weapon, well, secret (although such a brazen act against the populace could have served as a massive psychological weapon against the Soviets). But if we scale the question back to the limited release of supposedly “harmless” or benign pathogens that could be a component (or facsimile) of a bioweapon, and we make a point to consider military personnel as citizens, then yeah, the government has done that. Most of these tests took place under the-not-at-all ominously-named Project 112, which began in the 1960s and continued until 1974 to gauge the U.S.’ vulnerability to biological and chemical attacks. The tests conducted under Project 112’s auspices were largely done without test subjects’ consent or awareness – such as the release of biological agents and simulants at major Washington, DC, transportation hubs and the New York City subway, and the targeting of livestock in rural states. Another major component of Project 112 was Project SHAD – an operation designed to assess the vulnerabilities of ships to bioweapons and to develop decontamination procedures. Ships were towed just off the coast and then sprayed with various agents and simulants – with crews supposedly shielded, although anecdotal evidence suggests that wasn’t always the case, or that the protection was functionally insufficient. In testimony before Congress in 2002, the Department of Defense summarized the risk to service members: In those instances when potentially harmful substances were used, there is no evidence that any of the service members involved were exposed to them without proper protection. Service members were vaccinated before testing that involved live biological agents. If actual chemical agents were used they were confined to airtight sections of their ship. When appropriate, protective clothing was also worn. While some service members may not have known all the details of these tests, it is likely they knew that they were participating in testing due to use of precautionary measures. We have learned that the scientists involved informed senior leaders about tests using simulants. Like other operational activities, service members were not informed of these tests. While initially intended to test the U.S.’ vulnerability to biological and chemical warfare, Project 112 and similar programs expanded to develop the U.S.’ biochemical offensive capabilities by repeatedly testing dispersal techniques (to include mosquitos). These programs hit their zenith in the late-1960s, until President Nixon disavowed biological warfare and committed to dismantling the U.S.’ capabilities (made effective with the Biological Weapons Convention, ratified the year after Project 112/SHAD officially ended with the closing of the Deseret Test Center). So while - strictly speaking - these tests were not conducted to test the potency of any particular bioweapon, the military's assessment of the viability of dispersal vectors had a very human element. The existence of Project 112 was kept secret for almost 30 years, until investigative journalists broke the story in 2000. In 2002, Congress directed the declassification of Project 112 materials in order to identify servicemembers who may have been affected so that they could receive VA benefits, and subsequently required VA to sponsor studies by the Institute of Medicine into possible long-term consequences of testing. Somewhere around 6,000 personnel have been identified as having been possibly exposed (mostly via Project SHAD). Although IOM found no conclusive evidence that exposure to these tests resulted in a higher prevalence of diseases than among non-participating veterans, Project 112/SHAD veterans are included in a specific priority status among VA’s enrolled health population along with other veterans who may have been exposed to environmental contaminants. At the same time as Project 112, the military was running Operation Whitecoat, in which several thousand volunteers (mostly conscientious objectors) allowed themselves to be injected with various biological agents that could be weaponized in order to test their effective dose levels. But whereas Project 112 participants had a mix of informed consent and follow-up treatment, Whitecoat participants were better monitors and treated for their exposures - although only over the short-term. Possible long-term consequences to the participants are not as well studied. The question needs a little bit of definition. If it’s going for full-throttle – ie, that the U.S. government released fully weaponized biological agents over large population centers – then the answer is, “No.” Risking the destruction of Chicago with anthrax would be counterproductive to keeping a secret weapon, well, secret (although such a brazen act against the populace could have served as a massive psychological weapon against the Soviets).

Salesforce is a hot topic right now and will probably stay that way for at least the next 5 years.  I worked in the Siebel/Oracle CRM space before and Salesforce is a refreshing change. The user interface is very clean and simple and it takes very little time to make changes and have something to show. A lot can be done via button-click administration, even automation such as automatically creating tasks, sending emails, or making field updates. The next step is Visual Workflow, which still is button-clicky, but allows you do a little more advanced programming, such as looping through records, creating, updating, querying, and even deleting records. The more hard-core developers can use Salesforce's Apex programming language.  If you know other object-oriented languages, it is not that big a leap.  Some of the quirks of Apex include governor limits, which forces you to be more efficient in your coding.  Also, code cannot be migrated from a development environment, until you have reached at least 75% test coverage. This is another checkpoint to ensure your code is efficient. The beauty of Salesforce also lies in its user community.  There is a lot of help out there, from Salesforce's own developer community and user forum to a gazillion blogs by Salesforce administrators and developers. Between the developer community message boards and Youtube and Salesforce blogs you're really just a few Google searches away from solving any issue. The community is more than happy to chime in with suggestions or entire solutions, even when it comes to coding. Another nice touch is that anyone can get a free developer org set up that comes with 2 user licenses and *full functionality*.  That means you can build everything and anything and test it out and dump it. Being a developer org there are some limitations, of course (e.g. number of mass emails to send, available storage space), but it makes for a great playground.

But why was there military rule in the first place? It is due to the martial pride of the country, a pride that stretches centuries back, at least for a select choice of people.  The Tatmadaw, the armed forces of Myanmar. Picture acquired from ‘The Irrawaddy’, ca. 2018. The military established itself as the primary institution of the land with a justification that they safeguard the country from foreign aggression and influence. Such justification rooted from the fact that Myanmar, or Burma as it was used to be called, was a feared regional military power that was able to forge the largest land empire in Southeast Asia and was known to successfully wage wars with its neighbors — no least this was true than its wars with Thailand, then called Siam, even China which during the 1700’s possesses the largest armed forces on earth, and even Portugal and France which attempted but failed to conquer the country during 1600s and 1700s — before its phase-by-phase subjugation by Britain in the 19th century. The then-newly arrived British colonial authorities introduced things that were alien to the Burmese populace, such as Christianity, railroads, electricity, and the European style of governance. This didn’t sit well with the local populace very much, which they saw as an affront to their old traditions and way of life and who still couldn’t accept the fact that their once proud nation which defeated the mightiest army the world has ever seen that has come from the mountains of southern China and defeated two powerful European colonial empires is now at the hands of the British “heathens”.  Burma during the 16th century, under the Taungoo Dynasty. It was the largest Southeast Asian empire in terms of total land area to have ever existed, and during the era one of the largest in the world.  A battle between the royal armies of Siam (later Thailand) and Burma, ca. 1766 AD.  China invades Burma with an army of 500,000 — half a million — men, ca. 1765 AD. This invasion later becomes a disaster as the huge army, not used to the hot tropical Burmese weather, was destroyed in the field by the far tinier Burmese royal army.  The royal army of Burma sacks the million-inhabitant Siamese (Thai) capital of Ayutthaya, ca. 1767. This is the ultimate magnum opus of the royal Burmese military, so atrocious that to this day the relations between Myanmar and Thailand remain somewhat sour.  The first step towards the eventual British conquest of Burma, shown here are the British redcoats advancing against the rudimentary royal army of Burma. Painting by J. Moore, ca. 1824. The Burmese suspicion of the presence of Westerners, and foreigners in general, in their country was only increased during the Second World War from 1942 to 1945, when the whole of Burma became a legitimate battle front between the armies of Britain, Japan, China and the United States. Civilians all over Burma suffered immensely as they become collateral damage. Whole villages were burnt, and hundreds of thousands of Burmese died as casualties of war. Different rebel organizations across all parts of Burma that were formed prior to the war made their presence known to the disaffected communities across the country, setting the first step towards the nation’s eventual re-attainment of their independence in 1948, and unfortunately the beginnings of a deadly civil war that only ended in 1960.  Burma during the Second World War. From 1948 to 1962, there was a talk that Burma will never survive in one piece, as ethnic separatist groups from the country’s north and west try to secede from the country, and disastrously divisive party politics were ruining the country. Mayhem was the everyday way of life among the locals as all sides fight it out. Civilian governance in the country was no better, as corruption and economic mismanagement are at the tip of the mountain’s summit. Thus, the civilian government, in a desperate measure, asked for the military to take over temporarily.  The Tatmadaw, during the military coup of 1962.  The Burmese populace relying on the protection and governmental guidance of the military as indicated by this picture, ca. 1962. And thus begins the half-century long military rule in Burma and Myanmar that was supposed to last only 2 years as a caretaker government. Rooting from the country’s suspicion of foreigners and neighboring nations and hatred of people who are not Burmese that stemmed from the country’s centuries-long martial pride and history, the military government then banned foreign aid and placed complete emphasis on agriculture and eschewing industrialization aside from diplomatically isolating the country from the world stage out of fear that foreign influences would deprive them of national pride and identity. This is just like the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia only much tamer because it didn’t kill millions of people, but still the Burmese people suffered as a result of economic slump that the military government’s isolationist and traditionalist policies caused, and still thousands of people were killed by the military due to dissension. The country’s economic growth, once the highest in Southeast Asia, stagnated and even declined. And it lasted for more than half a century. After then, it was the poorest nation in all of Asia and one of the 20 poorest nations on earth according to the United Nations.  The severely economically marginalized people of Myanmar form the vast majority of the country. The military stayed in power for so long because it saw itself as the protector of Burma and Myanmar from foreign encroachment. Hypocritically, while the majority were toiling, the high military officers were enjoying the wealth of the country as evidenced by their opulent lifestyles.  The woman, the bride, on the right is the daughter of the country’s military dictator and strongman Than Shwe. Notice the jewels and diamonds on her neck and head? Those alone costed an excess of 500 million US dollars. Economic recovery is still underway after 2011 when the country finally returned to democratic governance, but it was still painfully slow. But even with democratic governance the hatred of non-Burmese by the Burmese remained, as evidenced by the plight of the Rohingya Arakanese natives of western Myanmar, which led to the country’s sanctioning by the United States. Those sanctions remain currently in place, causing economic slowdown of the country. Long story short — the economic plight of Myanmar is caused by its people’s xenophobia and past pride that resulted in their isolation by the past military government, or at least a majority of them. The military, entitled on their ‘status’ as the guardians of the country, exacerbated the plight by plundering the vast wealth of the country for their own gain.",2021-03-06T19:34:56.865Z,"What do individual Myanmar citizens need to improve to make their country developed?

I will talk about a country who's citizens discipline & hardwork helped their country to bring out from their difficult situations. I am talking about Japan [ Robotic country]. Japan has seen a lot of troubles, faced a lot of orders since long ago, whether it was the rule of the dictator Tojo, the atom bomb disaster, tsunami or the frequent earthquakes. The country is a living example of how a unity of the nation can lead it to the top in every field. The indefatigable spirit of this country is commendable and the world MUST know what sets this nation and its people apart from the others. These points bring out why Japan has such a successful modern history and is a great inspiration for the world. Not only the discipline & hardwork. Other key factors like spirit of the people, punctuality, politeness, No error attitude helped them to stand still with a great influence in the world. Discipline The country is very blessed to have evolved as a disciplined nation where the citizens bet, respect and follow the rules and regulations, and honor the rule of the law. The people do not talk on phones on the train, help a differently abled person first, and do not litter in public places, these are the basic instances which reflect the sincerity among the people, and prove, that all it takes for a nation to prosper is the cooperation of its citizens in keeping the country clean, it functions smoothly and efficiently. Punctuality The nation is famous for their meticulousness about time and giving importance to managing time wisely and productively. The young and the old alike carry a schedule diary with them to plan their daily, monthly tasks and events and make sure to accomplish them all within the given time frame. It is a fact that the yearly delay of trains in Japan is on average about 7 seconds. This is a proof of how precise and accurate the nation and its people are, making every nanosecond count and making the most of it. Spirit The country has always put up bold and brave faces even in the worst of times, like after the atom bomb dropping or Fukushima nuclear disaster, and has defied all odds and risen to the top every time, both man-made and natural disasters have tested people’s endurance, patience, and perseverance. Politeness Bowing every time when greeting others, being soft-spoken, generosity towards others, helping nature – are the traits which reveal that the Japanese people are extremely polite, helpful and humble beings. No error attitude The aim for maximum efficiency and striving for zero errors is extremely impressive. All the processes and systems in Japan are absolutely smooth and hassle-free. People and technology go hand in hand to ensure this level of perfection and precision in every field. Ensuring no error/mistake/defect, making every product/service of the top-notch quality and motivating everyone to strive for nothing but best, is a characteristic trait of the country and its people.

With the revival of global economy things will gradually fall in line in our economy too. Certain measures which government should take to improve Indian economy are:1. Revise and broaden the basket of sources of revenue and curtail public expenditure by doing away with subsidies and delegate some developmental programme to as compulsory CSR activity to be done by corporates. This will to an extent help to contain fiscal deficit. 2. To do away with inflation revise the basket of goods in WPI and CPI .add services also to it to have a better feel of inflation. Reduce demand supply mismatch by not just focusing on agriculture but also infrastructure creation like warehouse, transportation facilities, access to market, better price offerings to farmers for their produce. The primary essential commodities are the main drivers of inflation so the focus should be those commodities. If these bottlenecks are removed, the buffer stock can be kept safe and used for PDS as well as contingent situations like poor crops ( which india is facing currently).So whenever there will be such situation demand supply mismatch can be handled by administrative and physical policies. This can help contain inflation and black marketing. 3.

What I remember of their visit is they could not figure out how poor Chilean women could come out of a shack looking like a fashion model. Imagine if they had visited Rio. In 20 years I never saw the same bikini twice, or the same woman in the same outfit twice, in a place with millions of people on the beach or at Carnaval or at New Years. Poor people pay $5000 for a Carnaval outfit they only use as often as a wedding dress. My theory on the bikinis is each girl must have a wide network of friends and they trade or borrow. Then there is the difference that Brazilian bikinis are actually in use on the beach in Brazil but not in the US. Most Americans are too fat. I knew a lady who lived in Atherton who seldom went to a clothing store, the store came to her. Her idea of fashion was to copy the Queen of England or the US First Lady. By an amazing coincidence my 2 aunts had exactly the same idea.

Then one can move on to one’s place of work e.g. if one is a teacher, bring up your students/pupils to disprove corruption in their lives. The underlying theme to all the above is that we need to influence the young to view corruption in a negative light and by every individual influencing the young around him/her to fight corruption, only then can this vice be gradually removed from society.

Getting the US carbon footprint down to that of, say, the Netherlands (7.8 T per capita) would take a huge sea-change in the American economy. We would have to retrofit suburbia for walkable shopping and schools and mass transit, we’d have to embrace congregate housing, and we’d have to do away with all the tax benefits given to single-family houses. People would have to do things like ride bicycles for shopping and errands. It would take a century to move American carbon footprints down, and we don’t have a century.

First, I believe that the bedrock of a good education is with a great teacher who inspires you, cultivates exploration, inspiration and confidence. So to develop citizens to solve problems we need excellent teachers. We need great pedagogy. One of the fundamental problems we have today is with the learning environment itself, where groups of 20-30 students are pooled into a single classroom with an arbitrarily selected teacher and expected to be able to learn. Besides the fact that each student has a different learning style, background, interests, etc... The teacher practically only has the opportunity to apply a 'one size fits all' teaching method. Invariably, students will be left behind or pulled back. Excelling in any field is stymied from day one. Even at college, where students have the opportunity for one-to-one sessions with professors/TAs, there is still only a limited chance that there is an optimal student/teacher fit. On the positive side, over 50 years of research into the science behind a student/teacher fit exists, and with the rise of private education it is possible for each student (for at least a few hours of the day) to receive individualized attention. So the challenge becomes: how can we apply dozens of years of cognitive neuroscience and education psychology to help teachers and students match and produce optimal outcomes (however you define those outcomes). My belief (and my company's) is that the answer lies with new, Machine Learning technologies, which can factor in dozens of algorithms to help sort data points through all of these studies' frameworks and produce continuously better matches. But that's only step one. Once we have a great teacher-student fit, the question itself becomes one of optimizing learning and teaching techniques, selecting content to teach, and refocusing education on problem-solving and skills acquisition.

Despite claiming to have enough money to finish the game, their financials indicate that they have burned through most of their $210 million of backer money and have been operating at a loss since 2016. They’ve had to take out bank loans and sell off 10% of the company to outside investors. Three of the executives cashed out some of their private shares and pocketed £2.7 million of backer money. They have something like 15 shell companies. For what purpose, we don’t know. Their use of backer money has been questionable, with considerable money spent on celebrity actors, their own annual convention, and a lavish studio in one of the most expensive places in the US. They've changed their Terms of Service half a dozen times so that customers can't get a refund or sue them for not delivering a game. In the past, the authorities have had to step in to facilitate refunds. They've made a business out of monetizing scope creep, and sell anything and everything they can before actually delivering it. Game packages range from $45 to $27,000, and the in-game economy heavily favors pay-to-win. Many of their long time backers have been groomed into accepting these prices, which are totally atypical for a video game, through years of hard-sell marketing tactics. These backers have often been called a “cult” due to their steadfast belief in the game, and their hostility towards critics. They're trying to make an MMO using Cryengine, which they chose for it’s cutting-edge graphics, but which is woefully unsuited for an MMO. They're currently being sued by the makers of said engine for breach of contract. The game in it's current state is broken and incomplete even after $200 million in funding and 6 years of development. They are 4 years past their estimated November 2014 release date, with no end in sight. CIG as a team has never shipped a game before, let alone a AAA game. Their CEO Chris Roberts hasn't shipped a game in 15 years. Freelancer, his last project, suffered the same scope creep and lack of progress, and was bought out by Microsoft, who finished the game for him. So is it a scam?

Developing citizens, or developing this kind of individuality, is inherently necessary for every kind of social progress, and not just modern society. We have always been always taught to obey during our time growing up. Firstly, we obeyed our parents, then we obeyed our governments and bosses. Most parents, and most governments exercise extreme violence against their people, and implement unfair rules, improper policies that undermine the people’s talents. For example, most governments believe equality of outcome is a virtue. However, the question remains that what equality of outcome are they fighting for? Equality of outcome, in this sense, is rather the inability for the brightest to achieve higher education, and the less brights to be equally as “successful” as the brightest ones. It is not absurd to most that equality of outcome is necessary for social development, however, equality of outcome is rather necessarily equity of outcome for it to work. For example, the brightest, of course, should receive the highest education to give them the highest opportunities to develop, while the less brights should go to “less bright” schools, which help them understand as much as the brightest ones do, and are able to achieve as much as brightest ones do. However, in this system, that is not the case, despite the fact that governments have huge programs to encourage everyone to go to schools at their specific levels, this hierarchy is inevitable, however, the problem is another kind of hierarchy that nobody can deal with, as long as this system still exists. This hierarchy is, unsurprisingly, money. Money allows the unbright to attend schools for the brightest, money also disallows the brightest from attending bright schools. Money first appeared as the irreplaceable currency of trust, and progress, however, it has also always inherently been the chains that bound development, and in modern society, that chain has become more visible than ever. Developing citizens equals creating a future for everyone, where everyone has enough fortune, and materials to satisfy their needs. However, developing citizens also means radically changing the system, and progressively maintaining what is radically achieved. Radicalism has always been the key to development, however, most people struggle to recognize it. Eventually, it is the general trend of development humanity currently, and inevitably faces.  Somewhere in the corners of your street, the next Einstein of humanity would live, however, you will never know, and they will never be able to know you as well.  “In a board game, you cannot be either the king or queen, but the player, the player is most powerful.” ~Belaventoni Rhohidrit.

POSITIVE or NEGATIVE- the choice is yours, which sort of reflection you want!” Often people say that Positivity brings a false hope along with it. I respect their views. But in my opinion, negativity doesn’t do us much good either. Positive & negative attitude are just two different visions towards the same thing. You can choose either lenses to look over the facts and events! The difference lies in one's behaviour. How one responds to her surrounding circumstances defines her attitude. I agree that one can't always stay happy and normal. Emotions like sadness, anger, frustration or even hatred often do visit the realms of our thoughts. Indeed, life is a journey, a process, where you try different inputs in order to bring a valuable output. However, everything is unique and imperfect in their own ways. If you will look towards the optimistic facets of it, you will never feel disappointed. And if you will keep checking upon the flaws and figures, you will never be satisfied. Somehow or the other, you will miss something or the else. In fact, you will often feel a sense of void in your life. And to fill that void, you need happiness, love, humility & contentment in life- that can only be achieved when you possess a peaceful state of mind. To quote the difference between the two, I would like to explain you the point with the most layman example. Let's say, you have an exam. You studied for a while and then, you recklessly roam all around thinking that ‘I know all the answers’, ‘I will surely crack it’ or ‘God will help me' and, the most common thought is- ‘We’ll see whatsoever happens’. My dear, it’s not a positive attitude. It’s an irrational way of thinking. Instead, when you are unable to figure out one of the solutions of the question paper, then at the very moment, “believing in yourself & attempting the question as per your knowledge”- is actually an attribute of a positive attitude. It's simply about not giving up on fractured things, when you can easily mend them with your intelligence, love and care. It’s not just about thinking or expecting the best things that will happen to you one day, but it emphasises more on bringing out the best from everything that happens to you! I know the above example is bit absurd; Cause’ when life actually comes to a test, people have to suffer even from the extreme severity of life, that one can’t even imagine in their wild dreams. But, mark my words, a positive frame of mind has such a vigorous power that could possibly help you in healing your inner-self. Look, I am not saying that one should live on a false hope. Like, thinking that- I will achieve all the great things one day OR, imagining yourself in the highest position irrespective of how lethargic and carelessly you work in your space OR even, expecting your loved one to return when you both have decided to split-up. It's not an optimistic attitude. To create a positive attitude, one should have a positive approach towards their work & responsibilities too. And, The simple rule of Positivity is that one should keep moving on, in & along with the life. Sitting & sticking back to old things (certainly, hardships) is not a sign of a positive mindset. Again, Positivity isn’t a casket of commitments and assurance. But, it’s like a divine force that gives you inner strength to fight in the most challenging times. And, if you are truly devoted towards a meaningful purpose, then you’ll surely overcome all your obstacles. Just believe in yourself and have faith in the Almighty. Keep moving on & Keep doing your deeds!

Omotayo Fakinlede To understand why Nigeria is underdeveloped, we first look at some nations that have developed and the circumstances, challenges and responses that caused them to develop.

Take a look at Scandinavian nations and Finland. Here are sparsely populated countries, in extremely cold locations. They are challenged by the weather and low population density. Up to the late ‘70s, telephony - derived from physical infrastructure, cables, etc., over hundred of kilometers, could not be supported by such isolated populations, made large portions of some of these countries relatively underdeveloped compared to their more populated southern neighbors. Over the next 40 years, they led the world in Cellular Telephony creating brands such as Ericsson, Nokia, etc. After solving their own problems, the same technologies were sent overseas to make more money for them. Japan. Arising out of the ashes of defeat in WW2, they needed a fresh start. Moved away from making war machines to the continuation of pre-war efforts to build automobiles - seizing the moment of oil price increases and built more efficient cars, brand names in electronics and transportation. Turned their overpopulated island into a bastion for production of goods despite the absence of virtually all the necessary raw materials. Israel. Surrounded by neighbors that would rather have them swimming in the Mediterranean. They developed a compact and potent force that has withstood all wars since inception. They have now turned deserts into fertile lands, become exporters of fresh fruits, security systems, weapons, etc. The very same things they needed to survive, in a time of peace, the war- making machine becomes an economic machine. We can go on! Nations do not develop because they have natural resources. They develop because they have thinkers that show great concern about the well being of the community; mobilize the people, to work hard, for a better tomorrow. It is NOT the farmer making the cassava that becomes rich; rather, it is the restaurateur making ten times the cost of the cassava on each plate of food! Development is not about raw materials. It is about value addition. Any nation that does not add value will continue to go down. There are nations, having little oil deposits of their own, that have oil companies prospecting oil beyond their shores; there are also nations that have oil, and spend sixty years collecting royalties without necessarily developing the know how to mine oil by itself! Nations do not prosper because they have no challenges. It is the response to challenges that makes the difference. Today, the UK is in a mess because of the drive to exit the EU. But, they are looking for solutions. It may take a while, I am confident that, in a few years, the best minds would have gotten the best outcome and things will be fine! China and India have been burdened with large populations for decades. Yet, Nehru conceived the IITs nearly 70 years ago. We used to laugh at the over production of graduates in India. China and India are turning the huge populations to productive assets that no Western nation can match in a thousand years! Indonesia has innumerable Islands that are often difficult to reach. That has greatly improved their ocean-going capabilities. Don’t even start to talk about Singapore! Problems and challenges! Yet, they are the most developed nation in that part of Asia! There are nations that can look for electricity, bad policies, incompetent helmsmen, succeeding one another, for 70 years! Rwanda emerged from the worst tribal conflict on our continent. See where they are now! You could almost say that the troubles of the past was a blessing! Nations that never learn that the best minds, like or hate them, must be challenged to find solutions, are doomed. Nigeria. Always a country of the future. For ever promised tomorrow will be theirs. “Housing for all in 1990”, etc. Meanwhile, we are either bereft of deep thinkers, or ensure that great thinkers NEVER reach office, nor survive, if they ever get there - tantamount to the same thing. Ruled by largely indolent people who have no community well being (beyond family members) in mind. The stealing is enormous; yet that is not the worst problem. Our rulers run effete governments incapable of understanding or tackling the existential issues and the nation’s well being. Problems that caused other nations to think of solutions only make Nigeria think of importation. There is no electricity: Buy generators until you become the highest importer of generators! There is nobody to say, Wait a minute, why cannot we make these generators here since we need so many of them! No good roads. Look for foreign companies to build the roads. No orchestrated plan to create local road builders. Ministers have short time frames to work. They want turn-key projects - regardless of the implications on the nation’s ability to develop technology! Nigerians even import entertainment and sporting activities. They are “Members” of Manchester United - a much easier thing to do after all the recreational areas in the cities have been illegally converted to private lands! The poor children play soccer on the streets while their parents watch Barcelona play Inter Milan on “Better Pass my Neighbor” power supply! Educational system is poor. Look for the best schools in the Western world. When you cannot afford that, start shopping for schools in Ukraine, Turkey, Ghana, Togo and Benin Republic. Never realize that those places are made of people like yourselves and never arriving at a community decision to reverse the rot. Hospitals are poor, travel to Western Europe, America, or India for treatments or checkups. We assume angels from heaven run those systems, not human beings like us! The late Professor Chinua Achebe once claimed that there was no high office in Nigeria that was occupied by someone because he was the most able person to perform the task. Each office is given, not as a public trust to be discharged, but as the “share” of this or that group like an entitlement. Governing Councils of serious national Institutions are composed and chaired by people with no other qualifications than they were good party people that must be rewarded! “We asked Bola Ige to come and chop …” Then we are surprised that the functions are not properly executed! Election time. Most people forget they have youth unemployment, poor infrastructure, poor social structures. These and other things are things you use the political process to fix by putting competent and able people in charge of your destiny. The concern is “where is he from”? Is he Hausa or Yoruba? Can we trust an Igbo or Edo? Nigerians prefer to have their brother piloting the plane even if it crashes! The experts can get lost! Elections Over. We suddenly remember again that we have no jobs, etc. When a people behave the way we do, they can remain underdeveloped for a thousand years. If anything will change, our attitude must first change!",2021-03-06T20:42:36.014Z,"What is it like for same person to be citizen of both underdeveloped country and developed country? ",Quora

I don’t mind leaving my country for Brazil! Because wherever you go here, you’ll definitely find a place to fit in. The United Arab Emirates The oil-rich country is one of the easiest countries you can reside into permanently. The country is in need of massive manpower to fill the gaps of high employee demands. It mostly attracts Asian overseas workers who later on decide to settle down in UAE. With all the high-rise buildings and overshooting businesses, can we dub UAE as the ‘concrete jungle’ of the Middle East? Sweden Sweden offers a sweet deal when it comes to education. Do you want to know how? They provide free-cost education and students in high school are paid monthly to go to school with an amount of US$ 185! This serves the top reason for the huge amount of migrants who wish to be a part of Sweden someday. The immigration process is so easy in Sweden that you can just do the application over the internet. This applies to applicants who have connections with a Swedish or any legal resident of the country. And of course, if you’re in a legal age of 18 and possesses a valid national passport. 6. Italy If you’re ready to be a part of a rich and unique cultural history of Italy, go ahead and make a move. All you need is to process your visa and necessary documents and you’re up as a legal migrant. Establish yourself by buying or renting out a house. Italy is the tourism melting pot in Europe. But it hasn’t really bounced back yet from the 2008 crisis. But think about the gelato, and the authentic pasta and pizza, a shot of espresso, cute hunks, and gypsies! Italy, here we come! Norway If you want to live in a place where you’ll meet happy and easy going people who don’t shoot or steal, Norway is the perfect country for you. With a picturesque landscape, high standard of living, yet free tuition fee in schools, I don’t think you can ever go wrong in picking Norway as the country you’ll immigrate to. Not to mention that Norway is the modernized wonderland. 4. Australia The Land Down Under is not only one of the countries you can easily migrate to but also a safe place to call your home. It’s the land of your ‘goals in life’ rather than dreams. Pristine education, premium pay even for the apprentice, top medical facilities, and the adorable Aussies, I could not ask for more than Australia!

New Zealand New Zealand is looking for younger population of workers. That’s probably their reason for allowing immigrants to move into the country. For its country size, New Zealand still has a small population of only 4.5 million compared to other countries such as Australia that houses 23.1 million people. Owning a land in New Zealand is cheaper. If you intend to put up a business here, there’s a big possibility that it’ll work out for you. As per a report by Foreign Policy in 2010, New Zealand is one of the best countries to immigrate to for its booming economy. 2. Belgium You didn’t see that coming, right? Belgium is the second most accessible country for immigrants that grant the most citizenships per capita in the world. It is also the number 1 distributor of chocolate and diamonds on Earth. So, why would anyone not want to move to Belgium? Anyway, you can easily process a residency visa in Belgium as long as you have a working permit. If you’re still looking for a job, the immigration office will grant you a temporary visa. Belgium may be a tiny country yet it offers you the best of both worlds- chocolate and diamond anywhere. 1. Canada Yes, Canada is still the favorite place on Earth for immigrants for it’s the easiest country to immigrate to ever since. As for most of the countries on the list, as long as you’re a skilled person and is willing to learn, employers would take you in to be a part of their business and eventually, lets you move into Canada.

My guess is your question, if you have one, is: “If the tariffs posted by the United States fill the minds of citizens of developed nations with hatred, is it worth it?” My answer is twofold: There is no evidence that the US tariffs fill the minds of citizens of developed nations with hatred. The tariffs are directed at nations that do trade with the US, and are doing it unfairly, in the mind of the current president of the US. You may dispute whether the current president is right or wrong about whether the trade practices of other nations are unfair, but it is not for you to determine until you are the president of the US.Even if it were filling the minds of the citizens of developing nations with hatred, it is worth it. Depending on the nation you use as an example, there is a strong likelihood that the citizens of that nation already hate the US and everything it stands for. Changing the “tariff issue” won’t change that. And since the trade imbalances are so obvious to even the casual informed observer, and cannot be allowed to continue unchecked, there is great value in the current tariffs. They will force nations, developed or otherwise, to recognize that the United States has trade rights too.

If you use a “hotspot” with an internal battery for 24x7 use, you will burn the device and the battery out quickly. They are just not built for always-on use.Step 1: Figure out which carrier(s) are on your local tower(s). If you have at least one 4G tower somewhere within a couple of miles, you can almost certainly get a good coverage. If you are further away, but you have an unobstructed line of sight, you are probably good as well. A word on carriers and their data plan offerings: Verizon does not offer unlimited plans. There are some MVNOs who offer unlimited plans on the Verizon network, but they are quite expensive.AT&T does not offer unlimited plans. There are some MVNOs who offer unlimited plans starting at about $60/month, as of when this answer was written. I am using OTR Mobile. Others include Lamb Wireless and Gypsy Wireless. Typically, you should plan to bring your own device and new sim card. There are additional MVNOs that sell similar service for more including UbiFi and Unlimitedville.T-Mobile is offering a 50 Mbps plan for $50 to help get their merger with Sprint approved. I have a friend who has this, and it works well for him. This might be an option for you, if you have good T-mobile coverage.Ignore Sprint for now. They are merging with T-Mobile.Step 2: Figure out what kind of external antenna you want. To use cellular for Internet service, you almost certainly want directional antennas. Pointing at a particular tower gives you better signal from that tower and less noise from other sources. If you are extreme distances from the tower (say 10 miles) you might be able to get a connection with a pair of carefully pointed Yagi antennas. Look on Youtube for more information on “Extreme Networking”. If you are within a few miles of the tower something like this Proxicast 4G / LTE Cross-Polarized (MIMO) 7-10 dBi High-Gain Fixed-Mount Panel Antenna will work well for you, even if you are blocked by folliage. This is the one that I selected because it is directional, and has both antennas properly oriented within one package. Step 3: Pick a device. The MoFi 4500 SIM4 has a lot of fans, and it is a reasonably good device, but it has some shortcomings: It is a wireless router, wired router, and cellular modem in one package. That means that if either part fails you throw it all out and you buy another one.It also means that you get to EITHER put the device close to the cellular antenna, OR you put it where the WiFi signal will cover your house best, OR where it is convenient to collect the wires for wired devices. This is almost certainly 3 different places.The wired internet ports on the device are only 100 Mbps. That will limit your throughput, because a modern cellular modem can sometimes push more than that.I got a MoFi4500, and I sold it to a friend. I later found the http://microhardcorp.com/BulletCAT11.php which I have found to be superior in almost every way. It is ONLY a cellular modem. That eliminates all of the concerns above about the MoFI 4500. It has some useless ports on it, but the useful ones are:Antennas (main and diversity)One 1Gbps Ethernet portPower In.Note that the 1 Gbps port is faster than any cellular connection you can get over 4G, so it won’t slow you down. You plug this into the WAN port of a router of your choice, and then you get all of the security features that you choose to get.It is built in a solid metal enclosure. (Ties with MoFi on this.)It is very compact.BulletCAT11 does 3-way carrier aggregation. I think the MoFi does 2-way.BulletCAT11 handles all 4 major US networks. Ties with MoFi on this.It doesn’t (as of September 2019) have a Band Scanner application on it, but I hear they might be working on one.So, what does all of this get you? In my area, my neighbors are struggling with Fixed wireless (low speeds, high prices), Satellite internet (Reasonable service until you hit the monthly cap, and then effectively nothing), or mobile hotspots. One neighbor admitted that he has a STACK of mobile hotspots and he uses them in rotation until he hits the monthly cap. When that happens he turns that one off, and switches the then next one in the stack. The best anyone else has is at or below 10 Mbps down. Thankfully, I am quite close to a tower that has good AT&T signal on it. With a MoFi4500, I was able to pull down up to 87 Mbps on a Saturday morning. Later when I switched to the Microhard BulletCAT11, I was able to get speeds up to 175 Mbps down, 44 Mbps up, and latency numbers in the 60–75 ms range. I am not thrilled about the latency, but everything else is better than I am getting in town on XFinity! This is an optimal setup only 0.6 miles from the tower, with unobstructed line of sight. (Typical speeds are 120–150 Mbps down and about 20 Mbps up.) UPDATE: After I switched from a Proxicast MIMO panel antenna to 2 Wilson Electronics Yagi antennas, my downloads got a bit faster, and my top test was 202 Mpbs down. This is looking at the tower through double pane glass. I have also tested this at a friends house. He is between 2 different towers about 1.5 and 2 miles away in different directions. Both towers are blocked by trees. He was able to get 60+ Mbps down and 15 Mbps up. His latency was similar to, or slightly better than mine. He will be upgrading from his DSL connection where he sometimes gets as much as 1.29 Mpbs on a good night. So, is the Microhard BulletCAT11 the best cellular device for rural internet? Quite possibly. If it isn’t, it is great and it is better than anything else I have found. PS: If you prefer to have one device that does it all, Microhard also makes a BulletAC device which includes a wired switch and wireless router. It is also a CAT11 device, so it should do similar speeds. If you have to go with an all in one device, this is the one that I would pick, though I have not used it personally.",2021-03-06T21:32:39.519Z,"What mobile hotspot options are available for citizens in developing countries?

This is one of the few countries that require both education and experience. Use the SAT tool. You can actually apply for your own VISA. You can, however, get a TSS for Australia if you can obtain letters for 5 years experience. The bad news is you cannot be a permanent resident in any of these countries. SELF ASSESSMENT TOOL Note: there are those with Master of Science in Computer Science degree obtained in Europe whose EP application got rejected. I know because I worked with one who experienced that. The Employment Pass can be a lottery even if you have both experience and education. They are a lot more strict now. Which country can you consider with skill and maybe dumb luck? I don’t know. The United States requires more than a Bachelors degree for permanent residency or green card. For Australia, if you don’t have enough work experience, you need a Ph.D in a top 200 global University to get a permanent resident VISA and you might not make it after 2 years or so. For New Zealand, you need both a Bachelors and a Masters degree in Computer Science plus at least 10 years work experience to obtain the VISA. The most challenging one is actually Singapore. Any kind of VISA is a lottery. If you are dreaming of a permanent residency here in Singapore, stop! 2 months ago, I met a CS grad of Oxford University. He had a perfect GPA. He got rejected more than 7 times! Essentially saying, change your dreams if you think you can stay here with your family. It’s only good for 4 years then you have to move elsewhere. Some of my relatives are Singaporean out of luck. Right now, there is no such thing for a nation that has to be beyond objective and selective. I met over 10 people who cannot get a VISA in Singapore. ANY kind of VISA. They usually come from Europe. They had to consider Hong Kong which only requires 5 years work experience or so. You still need your letters from the companies, and they should be able to call them anytime for verification. Out of curiosity, are you aware of how challenging it is to work in Singapore? I have enjoyed working with Singaporeans only because I am a workaholic just like them. They had to open an office in other countries to hire people because it is incredibly difficult to get a work VISA in Singapore even with education and experience.",2021-03-06T21:33:50.251Z,"Can a Nepali citizen get a front-end web development job in Singapore without any degree?

At 70 plus when insurance may be needed, premium would be 40000–45000 plus with severe exclusions. That's why, generally , lapsation in such policies are huge, really huge. Sale too is highly limited. A cursory glance at the MIS of products available under disclosure norm or annual report( available on Insurer or IRDAI site) will prove my point. Hence academically, HI for senior citizens is ok, but practically, you will hardly find any person aged 68–70 continuing to pay premium. And at this age 68–70 , income has already come down and monthly expenses on medicine on domiciliary treatment (not covered in HI) of BP,Cholesterol., Sugar etc go up. This further reduces surplus money at hand, making it difficult to pay ever increasing HI premium. So, it is better to try to get covered under a group health insurance. It may be economical. In my case, for example, I have a group health insurance offered to account holders of Oriental Bank of Commerce . 5 lakh sum insured , premium 19000 plus for husband and wife. 5 lakh may be adequate, as chances of my wife and myself needing hospitalisation claim at the same time are highly unlikely. If at all such situation arises I have to fall back upon my savings or upon my children for the balance amount. Since, bank may withdraw the product( their call), I have started a SIP of 5000 far last few years. This is to cover my health expenses post my age 70. I know my health. With proper diet and exercise, yoga etc I Know I may not die so soon( touch wood). Hence, I am accumulating for my health expenses. And if my hospital bill exceeds my insurance cover or SIP, I have to fall back upon my savings or upon my children. To me it appears to be a realistic solution.",2021-03-06T21:41:13.276Z,"How does government plan to improve health and health insurance for its citizens in developing countries? ",Quora

No offense, but this is a somewhat strange question. First, I’m not familiar with any accredited MBA program offered in the U.S. that requires only one year of study - perhaps 18 months being the shortest. Most noteworthy MBA programs take each entering class and split them up into cohorts who will study and work together to complete the program over the course of 2 years. It’s not just a matter of completing course work, but learning to work with others. If you want to work specifically as a Software (SW) Developer, you don’t need an MBA, but a Bachelor of Science or Master of Science in Computer Science or Software Engineering would be of benefit. You might even be able to get a SW Developer position without a degree if you can demonstrate depth and breath of skill sets and experience through your portfolio of work. As for getting a position after completing a degree in the U.S., you can not ride a degree straight into an H1-B Visa. In order to get a visa to work in the U.S., you must first get a position, then apply for the Visa.

Along with that, comes the primary factor for any sort of development, that being, economic incapability or rather heavy economic dependence on the developed nations or on the international organizations like the UN. This is accompanied with massive political instability in most of the underdeveloped nations. So, even if, the incumbent government might take certain steps for pioneering any infrastructural project or any policy designing for the developmental process to begin, there is no certainty of the continuity of the process, since, this government might be replaced by some other political representatives with an all-together different agenda or might be, they lack the capability to complete such an ambitious project.  Now, in such circumstances, what can be really done is, citizens taking an active lead in trying to clear out the obstacles in the path of development. That being said, this shall be really tough for these citizens owing to their lack of education at all, or if any, quality education which is a rather crucial part of the present global dynamics. In such sort of circumstances, where the citizens usually lack the basic awareness as to what exactly is going wrong and how it should be rectified and what shall be their apparent role in any sort of rectification, the citizens taking a lead, usually does not come into action. Furthermore, what we need to actively consider is, in majority of such nations, the citizens have been ridden with extreme poverty and malnourishment. Thereby, hunger is the prime agenda. What these nations need is active citizens which can effectively pinpoint to what needs to be done for getting these nations on to the path of development and deal with the crisis they have been going through. Through international co-operation in these nations, what first needs to be ensured is an eradication of the malnourishment and extreme hunger issues. The United Nations has been a constant supporter or rather, a torchbearer in this particular issue. Once the issues of hunger and extreme poverty are subdued, only then can the citizens become widely respondent to education, and that shall be the key force in increasing awareness among them. An aware population has the capability to play an active part in the developmental process, not just directly by being a part of the infrastructure or the projects which might usher in development, but also indirectly, by knowing what is wrong, questioning it and being a part of the rectification process. The presently educated and the aware population in these nations can most definitely play a really pragmatic role in this, by creating awareness, educating their fellow countrymen. This is certainly, a long way ahead, but, this needs to be initiated and propagated at an increasing scale for these nations to at least start their journey towards development.

For those who don’t know officer mess is a highly ritualistic and formal meal style with Enlisted Mess Specialsts serving us on formal table settings. When guests dined with you - the CO or XO sometimes selects which officers dine in the first setting to ensure the conversation remains polite and appropriate. Submarines do not have a separate officer’s mess from the Captain’s mess like bigger ships do. And with only 10 seats there are two sittings the first for the CO, XO, guests and oncoming watch officers and a few chosen officers to sprinkle the conversation with interesting tidbits. When it’s just the ship’s officers it’s much more a family affair- (just like when your mom hosts guests at her house). Of course, a few times, the conversation drifted to the topic of the war. After all how could it not end up at about this titanic struggle that defined the modern era, the US Navy, and created the modern state of Japan. The Japanese Commander said at one point that he was thankful for the war and it’s outcome. He shared that he could not think of any other way to end their social elitism, outward racism and their essentally feudal society than to have had the war end as it had. Which forced the Japanese people to decide to never again resort to militization except for defense. He added that he as the son of a shop owner would never have been anything other than an uneducated worker and an ordinary sailor but by embracing the American idea of opportunity ( his words- blew us away) he was able to aspire to command of a ship and an advanced degree and see his daughter become a doctor. That entire discussion struck me and the other officers as surreal. It wasn’t all roses though , at another dinner we discussed if the war could occur again. He had said “of course, after all the same economic factors are still at play… “ To which I think I said something like. - let’s hope not, after all I’d expect the outcome to be the same, which got me some stern eyes from the COand XO. Separately the CO pulled me into his stateroom and told me he was glad I stood up for my beliefs but we must always be magnanimous to our allies. Having been to Tokyo and several other cities for months at a time - and having seen photos of what those cities looked like in the 1930’s I too cannot imagine another path to that type of industry and modernity from where they were in 1930 either but I always reflected in the Captain’s words.

The Government has to pay themselves with negative population growth and with the industrial bases' negative growth. The manufacturing jobs/exports have gone to Asia. And once the mighty industrial countries have become beggars literally in velvet. The rich retirement plans, universal healthcare, mass-scale abuse, misuse, mismanagement, glorious lifestyles of the past are running on the borrowed money/or printing paper money or selling assets. Sure, in such countries, the people here for a long time do not want to do the lower-level work. Welfare/fake refugees/real refugees get nice paychecks at home, no urgency to work.

""Here in Canada, I would say don't even employ Kulbir,"" Chawla said of customer service jobs. ""Because I still don't have that Canadian way of (speaking) fully."" The most recent federal election saw a small but distinct cadre of people of color and immigrants, such as Chawla supporting and even running for far-right populist parties such as the People's Party of Canada, the National Citizens Alliance and the Canadian Nationalist Party. All of these parties wanted to reduce immigration and scrap Canada's official multiculturalism policy. Despite being an immigrant himself, Chawla says he supports these policies. Chawla, an industrial engineer, came to Canada from India with his wife and daughter in 1999. He currently lives in Nova Scotia and calls himself a Canadian nationalist.

My take is that a Social Justice Warrior is a leader redressing some wrong in some way. If that definition is confined to being a leader with followers on line, or in street demonstrations, we do not have a big population of SJWs, under 5%. Sympathizers keep their heads down, out of fear, or because working multiple jobs to stay afloat leaves them not time to flaunt any beliefs. If the definition includes Social Justice Followers, maybe half the population could be coaxed into that camp if they can overcome their fear. Evidence is scanty, but for instance, polls show that over half the US adult population think that Bret Kavanaugh should not have been voted onto the Supreme Court. Doubtless, all these doubters have various reasons, but a unifying factor is that they did not believe that Kavanaugh could be an impartial arbiter of social justice in his decisions.

Entrance scholarships: Most universities have entrance scholarships for which you will be considered as soon as you apply to the university. If your profile will be good enough, they will offer you the scholarship. ii. Application based scholarships: Now, many universities have application based scholarships as well. You will have to fill up a separate application to get the scholarship. These scholarships can be very specific like scholarships for girls who are studying computer science. 2. External scholarships: There are many external scholarships as well provided by external organisation to students studying abroad. Like Microsoft provides scholarships to international student studying computer science in USA or Canada. Now, it is possible that you can get multiple scholarship if your profile is exceptional. If so, then those multiple scholarships can add up together and cover the cost of your studies completely. Suggestion: Apply for as many scholarships as you can. This increase the chance of getting the scholarship. That’s what I did. Alternative: Now it is possible that you may feel that your profile is not exceptional and you will not get scholarships. No need to feel low. There is other way. Apply to affordable universities. There are number of affordable universities in Canada and their tuition is not very high even for international students. Some cheap universities in Canada are: Brandon university, memorial university, Canadian Mennonite university, South Alberta institute of technology, Kings university college, Concordia university of Edmunton. You can apply in one of them. Please do not think that these universities are not good because they are cheap, they are government funded.

Here, as per Law the Law enforcing agency is responsible. And as a citizen it is equally our responsibility to not to act this way. I wish to place here aquote from our beloved Late President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, To quote from one of his recent writings, Dr Kalam said, “In America every dog owner has to clean up after his pet has done the job. Same in Japan. Will the Indian citizen do that here? He’s right. We go to the polls to choose a government and after that forfeit all responsibility. We sit back wanting to be pampered and expect the government to do everything for us whilst our contribution is totally negative. We expect the government to clean up but we are not going to stop chucking garbage all over the place nor are we going to stop to pick up a stray piece of paper and throw it in the bin. We expect the railways to provide clean bathrooms but we are not going to learn the proper use of bathrooms… I wish to add one more truth. We Indians are highly impressed by the developed countries, their citizens, how they are disciplined and responsible, how they respect the Law of the Land etc. And we don’t fail to discuss it and praise them here with our friends and others. Why developed countries, we Indians in Gulf, say Dubai won’t dare to spit or throw a cigarette but in public place. But that very Indian starts doing it freely and happily the moment he lands on Indian soil. Why can’t he stick up to that discipline he practiced there in Dubai ? Is it so that we get disciplined only if thrashed ? Cleanliness reflects how developed we are socially. It is good for general hygiene. Let us not put the responsibility on the Govt alone.

Although I haven’t tried every dynamically typed language out there (who has?), I can still safely say that dynamically typed languages are rarely a good choice for anything larger than a small project or a decent script. I’m saying this having used some of the more common languages like Python, Tcl, and Groovy. Many proponents of these languages say that eliminating static types helps readability and improves productivity. In my experience, as the project gets larger, the readability of such languages starts to decline and I find myself keeping track of types in my head more often to understand what is going on. This is something other languages and their compilers give me for free.C++ templates are awesome. This one usually gets me a lot of flack as people immediately like to bring up the insane templates used by Boost or the template errors emitted by compilers. While these are certainly reasonable issues to complain about, C++ templates can greatly diminish the amount of code you need to write at zero runtime cost. Many of the most useful templates are not very difficult to write, understand, and use. Consider this example:template <class Iter, class T> // operator++() must be defined for type Iter  // operator+=(T other) must be defined for type T  void accumulate(Iter begin, Iter end, T& init) {     while (begin != end) {         init += *begin++;      }  }  // use case // another template :)  std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4};  int sum = 0; accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), sum);   std::cout << sum << ""\n""; // outputs 10 Not very hard to understand yet incredibly versatile. Now try writing it in Java :) Very few programmers are template metaprogrammers and need to know all the nooks of templates to write 1000-line templates. Templates are often very easy to use and can provide an extreme amount of flexibility in algorithms. Java generics don’t even come close to being as powerful as C++ templates. The best way to learn programming is from the bottom-up. I’ve heard from many computer scientists and coworkers insist that the best way to learn programming is to learn it from the top-down. Instead of implementing binary search, use the binary search algorithm in the library. Instead of dealing with memory yourself, just use std::vector. In my experience though, the best programmers I’ve met have always learned it from the bottom-up. They started with languages like C/C++ and learned about memory models, references, pointers, data type sizes, memory management, object lifetimes, and more. Then, moving on to higher level languages was a breeze. Programmers who’ve put aside learning these details to a later point in time have usually struggled more and end up giving up and going to a “simpler” approach. Besides, I think learning from the bottom-up models software engineering as a whole: spend more time up front to save lots of time and effort later. Great question! Dynamic typing sucks.

Succesful people in politics are not average. They are really smart, educated, strong mentally and physically, as in healthy. My highest IQ score is 155. Some of the people I have met are smarter. Expect to face that kind of opponents. A lot of the people you meet will be less than half of that. Be careful of every word, as they will not understand things the way you mean it. If this will not discourage you, lets move forward. Learn to think before you speak, and then not speak unless its necessary. Learn to respect other people, even your opponents. Try to see something in each of them that would make you take a personal risk to save them. If you do not care about your enemies, you probably dont care enough of anyones well being. Just dont pretend to know what anyone wants. Learn to listen, but dont believe all they say. Often people just want to be heard. Can you do that? Because if you cant, dont go. You want to do something good, and not go the to be corrupt, right? Well, as a politician you have a change to be corrupt and bent like slinky, and not even know it, so take the advice. Ok. The practicals: Join a party. You can go as independent, but thats pretty much a joke. Choose your party carefully. You know everything about everyone? Well you dont know enough. Study more. Theres bound to be somekind of local/regional office. Walk in and start asking questions. Start doing small things in local scale. Be there, meet people, learn everything. There might be some old guy who has been there forever. He knows everyone, and everyone knows him. Learn to know him too. Make contacts, but some are more important than others. Everybody can take part in elections, but not all people can make it inside the party. You need the party, make sure they accept you. You have to get a lot of people to accept you, if people start to take you seriously. Often they dont make the decision themselves, they can ask someone. Usually the one being asked is the old guy. Dont care what job description he has. Even if hes just a janitor. Almost every place has an Old Guy, and if he thinks you are not going to make it, you wont. Be in small local meetings. Take positions like secretary in meetings. It shows you are active. Ask for advice. Gather support from people, within the party structure and with voters. Dont go to elections unless you have a good deal of support already. You are going to have to fight everyone for the votes. If you win, remember your first term is just learning about it.

My best platform is different, these are the requirements for me and maybe for some of you, so I can develop my app very fast and also go deep when things get sophisticated (my experience says, it always gets sophisticated eventually). No blocking when I want to do some advanced stuff,No proprietary languages or technologies,Support favorite UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular etc)Open Source ModelMicro service supportNo pre-compile or code generation, immediate previews and deploymentDeploy anywhere (AWS, GCP, Azure or any Kubernetes cluster) with one clickFull featured web based IDE without any browser plug-insTeam support, Live collaboration and version controlNo code support for basic development (forms, grids, dashboards, workflows, notifications)Advanced Access ControlMobile UI supportSo far, Code2.io (was iCodeBetter) is the only solution that I could find for my needs. Main Page of Code2, you can jump into the wizards without writing any code and you can start building your business app.  You can always see what you’re doing and how the tables, queries, forms and grids are related to each other. If you are developing a big project, it will save your time and mind. It visualizes all the impact analysis for you.  You can always see your ER diagrams and tables. Code2 generates DDL scripts for you, but if you’re an advanced developer, you can customize those scripts and put extra indexing and partitioning parameters.  You can see the wireframes of your forms. You real forms are in your favourite UI framework. Yes, Code2 stores everything in metadata, so you can see your UI in your own choice (React, Vue, Angular or ExtJS) and you change it and its templates anytime you like. You can also manage best practice conditional statements from the wireframe previews.  Every business project requires Access Control List, sometimes it gets very complex, so you need a tool manage those things. In Code2, you can manage everything from IDE and track it visually. Row based or column based ACL is a just few clicks away. Btw, everything you set here applies both for your frontend and backend side.  Although Code2 generates responsive UI pages for you, you can also create more mobile oriented user experiences by leveraging Code2’s mobile UI capabilities. You can also convert these mobile UIs to a native application.  You can also manage your Kubernetes cluster inside Code2. You can monitor, deploy or change its parameters.  Managing APIs and integrations are also realities of all business software. In Code2, you can create your APIs from your business objects, but also integrate external APIs by just importing Swagger (OpenAPI) or Google Discovery Documents with a click.  I cannot say Code2 is for everyone, but if you are looking for a platform that helps you develop really fast and when things get sophisticated and you need advanced deeper interaction with platform, Code2 is the real winner.

So here’s how it looks from the perspective of a Filipino: In the Philippines, if you are rich, then you are very rich. You own at least two luxury homes in exclusive gated villages with 2 garages for all your high-end cars and at least one luxury car. You spend your time managing your business and thinking about how to expand your fortune by having your daughters/sons marry into other rich families or just simply forming new business relations via socializing with other high society individuals. If you belong to the middle-class, then you are probably getting by ok, although you realize that the luxuries that the super-rich can afford will always be outside of your reach and this can be a bit frustrating for you. You might have clawed your way to your current status from being dirt-poor, but now you are doing fine. You live in a mortgaged house that you won’t be able to pay off until the next 10 years, you also own a car on installment, which you’ll finally own in five years — of course, by that time, you’ll sell it off for another car because that’s what all your friends do. You’re thinking about earning your next million so you can finance that European trip and “see the world” before you reach your 40’s or late 30’s. You’re also trying new things such as venturing into the stock market and you use a lot of semi-technical terms such as “diversifying your portfolio” whenever you talk with your peers in English over lunch at the local mall’s food court. Your biggest priority right now is to get together with your crush from the office and settle down and start a family. It’s a good move, because it also doubles your earning capacity. Once you start a family, you’ll be able to pay off your loans much faster and even get invited to high society get-togethers from the rich friends you made at the local gym or tennis court. Being someone who has seen both sides of the coin, you realize that you are in the best place to decide what is right for all the people in the Philippines, and thus, you impose your ideals upon everyone else and insist that everyone should share your political ideals and views. If you are dirt-poor, then you are living on a hand-to-mouth existence. Government support is nonexistent. If you’re poor, you either earn enough for yourself AND your family, or you die trying. There are charities here, but all they exist for is to treat everyone to a single good meal in some charity program for one day so they can add selfies and pretty pictures to their achievement portfolio. You have a job that earns you maybe 2000–5000 php a month (5000 = around 93 USD) and all you can think of is earning enough to put food on the table for your five other siblings who are still schooling. Furthermore, two of your siblings are already in college and relying on you to finance their education ever since your dad was laid off from his usual contractual job at the construction company. Of course, your meager salary isn’t enough for this, so you have to get into debt either from your peers at work or your neighbors. At some point, you’ll have gotten into debt with everyone and you won’t be able to pay them all off, and this is when you might turn to the loan sharks, such as those Indians on motorcycles. When even the loan sharks won’t give you anymore credit, you’ll feel like giving up because it’s really pretty hopeless in your situation. You could try applying at the local call centers for a higher-paying job, but your English needs to sound like that of a native speaker, and this is something that you were denied as a child, not being exposed to American TV Shows. It’s not the same as your rich neighbor Joey who grew up around American TV Shows and who has even spent a few months in the states on vacation. This is when you start to think — oh, maybe there’s an easy way to make cash here. It’s easily accessible for you because you’ve heard your friends have tried it sometime — selling drugs. You have friends with some connections who can easily get you into the business. Of course, you’re no fool. You realize the dangers with the rivers of blood of coming from fallen drug dealers everyday. It is a dangerous option, but it may be the last hope you have… Looking at the stats of the economy of the Philippines gives you a bird’s-eye view, but doesn’t really tell the whole story.

Information technology in India is an industry consisting of two major components: IT services and business process outsourcing with export revenues standing at $108 billion and domestic revenue at $35 billion in 2016. Indian IT exports were $117 billion in 2017 while domestic revenues (including hardware) advanced to $37 billion. According to India Brand Equity Foundation, India IT is expected to reach $350 billion by 2025. Therefore India must promote innovation via research and development (R&D); upgrade the skills of the Indian IT workforce; improve access to long-term finance for India start-ups.  India needs better infrastructure. Projects like the India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway (the East-West Economic Corridor) to link India with Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam needs to be completed by India. Electricity is another major issue India residents and businesses face daily. For electricity consumption, India consumes 1,408,624,400,000 that number is 1,122 kWh per person of electricity per year. The United States 3,911,000,000,000 kwh that is 12,700 kwh per person. India’s energy problems made global headlines when 600 million people were in the dark due to blackouts in 2012. Low cost manufacturers in Vietnam now offers lower production costs than India due to their cheaper and more reliable power supply to manufacturers. Vietnam’s share in global ready-made garment exports increased from 1.7% to 5.3% in the past decade. India saw a plain 0.8%. India decreased in comparative advantage due to infrastructure bottlenecks and inferior logistics. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port, largest container port in India, needs to be upgraded to increase the ports annual container volume from 4.47 to 10 million TEU. The handling of 10 million TEU annually at the port will put it on par with the Port of Hamburg in Germany, Port of Antwerp in Belgium, and Port of Los Angeles in the United States. Develop Progressive Trade Policies. India has a good manufacturing base, great exporter of IT services and strategically located in South East Asia with access to huge markets like China, Japan, Vietnam, etc. But it needs to improve its trade policies to live up to its economic potential. Thus, it is necessary for India to pitch for greater market access in the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) it is negotiating with fifteen countries. The trade gap with ASEAN members, China, South Korea, and Japan in 2017 was $12.9 billion; $62.9 billion; $11.9 billion and $6.2 billion respectively. US-India free trade agreement The case for Free trade Agreement between the two largest democracies in the world (India & United States) is solid. Unfortunately, the U.S.-India trade partnership is vastly under-performing. Bilateral trade in goods was about $74.3 billion in 2017. This sounds good but pales in comparison with two-way trade between the United States and China, which was $636 billion is almost nine times as large The US is India's second largest trading partner, and India is the U.S. 9th largest trading partner in 2017. The US exported $25.7 billion worth of goods to India, and imported $48.6 billion worth of Indian Products. Main U.S. imports from India include information technology services, Pharmaceuticals, machinery, textiles, chemicals, iron and steel products, coffee, tea, and other edible food products. Main India imports from the U.S. include aircraft, fertilizers, machinery, organic chemicals, and medical equipment.

Ofcourse, the Government has some objectives as well like having a politically and economically stable country that is not hostile to us and building up some key infrastructure to access much needed resources for our own nation while making a large revenue earner and job provider for the war torn economy. It would take atleast 20 years for a properly developed skill based economy to take root in Afghanistan. The people have to be settled, educated and trained before that kind of economy can start up. Till then resource growing/extraction is the best job provider and income earner. This is all that India is doing there. Helping people rebuild their lives and nation while getting some much needed raw materials to fuel our own economy. The few policemen (from the ITBP I believe) who are there, are there to protect the Indian engineers and expats working there from the Taliban, Haqqani network and other Pakistan supported terror outfits, not to mention our Consulates which have been routinely targeted over the last decade. None of it is aggressive towards Pakistan in any sense of the word. It’s just that the Pakistani military and ISI along with their associates and cronies are paranoid of India or to be precise, they want the people of Pakistan to be afraid/terrified of India. They want the people of Pakistan to believe that the moment they take the excessive power from their corrupt hands and punish them for their various crimes like corruption, abuse of authority, extortion and worse, then India would swoop in like a giant monster and kill them all. This fear is implanted into the people of Pakistan to keep them under control. Then they will not go for reform of the laws, punishing the criminals and so on as they are seeing a “greater” threat looming outside. This is the most fundamental of all strategies - controlling people using the fear of the “Unknown” - the Other. This propaganda campaign which includes twisting truths and facts to suit a particular agenda, telling carefully crafted lies and other forms of information manipulation are all part of this strategy. So I only request this of you - please use your own two eyes and mind to look at, collect information, analyze said information and make a decision impartially. Then you will see that India has no ill design on Pakistan. We just want to be left alone to improve our lives. You know our situation very well as well.

In India the humongous tree of corruption finds its roots in none other than the very opportunistic mindset of the common middle class man, which is passed on to his child at a very tender age, that he should study and strive not in order to contribute something to the society but in order to get a secure, well paying government job, entitling him/her to a prerogative called “upar ki kamai” (a jargon ironically referring to the bundles of notes exchanged under the table as bribe). As the child grows up watching his elders falsifying his D.O.B. in records of educational institutions, using political influence to get things expedited, furnishing false income/caste based certificates, milking loopholes in the system etc, his own psyche is imbibed with the same opportunism and guile. But then, this common middle class man has such attitude because he is the one at the receiving end of a system full of deceit and inefficiency, where he needs to lock horns with red-tapeism and bribery, on daily basis, to meet even his very rightful requirements. He can teach his child honesty and dedication only at the peril of exposing a gullible child to a reckless world where straight trees are cut down first. Hence, this is a vicious circle with common man being a victim as well as a perpetrator.  To break this vicious circle we have to uproot this from the very mindset of a common man. And this can be done as follows: SELF-CLEANSING: Undoubtedly, the first step of fighting corruption is to fight the urges within oneself to get any undue advantage out of the system. Doing our work sincerely, filing tax returns honestly, electing representatives based on merit, obeying traffic rules, not offering bribe to government officials for doing their job- these small steps from an individual may reflect as a big change if everyone inculcates the same. Charity begins at home.EDUCATING AND SPREADING AWARENESS:Having outgrown pre-embedded notions of oppurtunism, a self aware person can help his relatives and close friends come out of this vicious circle by spreading awareness and positivity among them:* Making them aware about their rights and duties and new innovative ways of fighting corruption. Letting them know how electronic means may be used to record the conversation with an official asking for bribery and may be used against him/her as an evidence. Letting them know of powerful provisions like RTI and whistleblower act etc. i.e. letting them know that corruption can be fought, one doesn't need to kneel down before it. (many people end up giving bribes because they are unaware of their rights and think they have no option but to toe the line)* Ridding them of the myopic vision they have regarding govenment organisations. Letting them know that no longer the Government jobs are synonymous to lethargy and inefficiency. Making them aware of the changing India: the world class achievements of Government firms like ISRO and DRDO. Letting them know that a job as sensitive as Air Traffic Controlling is handled by a PSU.* Giving them positive examples not only in terms of organisations but also in terms of individuals doing exemplary service to the country. * Dissuading them from indulging in caste based politics.USING POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA:With widespread gamut of platforms like Facebook, Whatspp, Quora and Twitter, social media is a great tool in hands of an educated common man to spread awareness and plant a seed in the minds of right ones. It may be used extensively to make people aware of their rights and duties and useful provisions to fight corruption. For example, the useful concept of Zero F.I.R. shown in movie PINK was greatly promoted by social media. However, it is also our duty to not only ignore, but also, debunk and condemn the fabricated facts and propagandizing messages doing rounds on social media with malafied intentions by anti social groups.SUPPORTING DIGITAL INDIA:Making monetary transactions online and teaching others may help in establishing a transparent system by enabling Digital records of all monetary transactions and official proceedings and help in eradicating red tapeism and bribery.And now perhaps the most important social method:SOCIAL REFORMS (ISOLATING THE CORRUPT):Unfortunately, in our country, most people have reservations against having acquaintances with people belonging to lower economic strata, but have no qualms against having friendly relations with dishonest and corrupt people. Rather such people are held in awe by many, for their astuteness, money-making skills and standard of living.If only we (as a society) could start look down upon dishonest (even if he keeps evading legal punishment) and start valuing honesty; if only the social stigmas like ""log kya kahenge"" (What shall people say?) could be associated with illicit earnings, instead of what people wear and sundry; if only we could rid ourselves of all obligations (social or otherwise) to have companionship with dishonest, and isolate him/her in the social circles, only then, a FEAR OF SOCIAL ISOLATION may act as an additional deterrent for people to adopt unfair means to draw an advantage out of the system. Let the notion of reputation and clout one enjoys in society be associated with his/her honesty and not with standard of living.Hence bringing change in our mindset and conduct, and spreading awareness regarding same may bring about a positive change in fight against corruption.

Although this rule does not apply to all the countries where the constitution was result of a careful planning.Now coming to your question, the above views are still holding true even in present notion of constitutionalism. Constitutionalism simply means principle of a limited government. It is important to note that a country may have a constitution but no constitutionalism. China does have a constitution but no constitutionalism because they have an absolute govt. with no limitations. Now take example of India, the constitution provides for Fundamental Rights(Part III of constitution) which are the biggest checks on the govt. It also provides for Equality before law (Art 14) and Supremacy of law( Constitution is the law of land) where no law can go against the constitution. Apart from these the supreme court has time to time expanded the notion of rule of law and has tried to incorporate certain concepts which may not come strictly under the concept of rule of law but nonetheless serves its purpose. Like - (a) right to healthy environment (b) Right to Information which let you know the affairs of the government. (c) Right to speedy trail (d) Right to have a legal counsel. Etc. These are examples of some of the Modern approaches to rule of law which are nothing but indirect affirmation of presence of rule of law in our constitution.

So water cant be an issue. 2) Whether grabbing Land is an issue? Perhaps YES kashmir will provide continuous land for Pakistan, Their Chinese collaborations can be more facilitated. 3) Whether Tourism of Kashmir is the attraction. NO Pakistan does not have any great record of attracting tourists from outside. They have their SWAT valley. mostly controlled by jihadists 4) Whether Religion is an issue: Perhaps Yes The Muslim mindset of Pakistan thinks by adding close to one crore kashimir nuslims their flock will become bigger. But militarily or politically it may mean very little 5) Whether Kashmir issue allows the Pakistani establishment to stay in power. YES This looks like a big reason to me. By convincing pak citizens on “Plight of Kashmiri Muslims” and Islam is in Danger” theory they are able to retain people support. So by feeding Feeding kashmir hype, Pak citizens feels their Govt is doing great. 6) So what India can do about this? I think Modi Government is following right course. First Pakistan is to be fully isolated. Its international trade, and attractiveness as destination for investment needs to decline in big way. The funding of Pakistan by its friends has to be curtailed. Like In India needs to stay on current course, for Oil economy based nations to decline, with this funding to Pakistan will decline. Secondly Balochistan movement has to be activated to make China insecure on its 18 billion CPEC investment. Then from waters flowing from India to Pakistan, India is hardly drawing 20% of legitimate share. India needs to draw its full share. These initiatives will make pakistan a far weaker. Sustaining its over sized military will become a challenge. That is when India needs to force Pakistan to liberate Balochistan and make it an independent country. This will reduce the nuisence called pakistan to an irrelevance. 7) Whether Pakistan is the threat to this world? It is a potential threat. The Cult of Muslim, demands that Muslims to treat Non Muslims as “ Infidels” and they be either be forcibly converted to Islam or be killed. This is a dangerous doctrine. It is this cult minset, which disallows muslim countries to disallow practice of any other faiths in their countries. It is this Cult mindset which brreeds Jihadists. Donations for Jihad( read destroy non muslims). Where they are in minority they demand democracy, and personal laws. Where they are in Majority they practice exclusive islamic state. Such a nation to have nuclear weapon is the biggest threat to rest of the human race. So world needs to lead pakistan to abject poverty, then negotiate for them to abolish nuclear weapons for any support on trade, or technology. 8) Whether Pakistan deserves global Co operation? Partly yes and partly NO we hear modern schools being demolished in mulsim countries. Other than quran studies muslim countries hate any other studies. Then why the world community should share the benefits of education and technology with these people. The major discoveries in Medicine, Automobiles, Energy generation,industrial goods, computers, mobiles and communications all have come from science and technology. Those who hate education, why they should benefit of modern science? Those who preach superiority( of faith), they treat themselves as exclusive. These exclusive people then need to be isolated. Isolated people can then become extinct and spend rest of their life in paradise of their belief",2021-03-06T23:45:53.755Z,"Why does Pakistan want Kashmir? ",Quora

PET bottles also fetch about Rs.10/- a kg.What requires to be done is get a batch of rag pickers or even unskilled laborers, hire a mini truck on a daily basis and get these guys to collect all man made materials that are suitable for recycling. Normally a person collects about 20 kg of waste and carries it on his back over huge distances to reach the trash buyer and sells it. In this case because the workers are followed by a goods vehicle, they can collect roughly about 200 kg of waste a day each.The waste must be segregated. The stuff that is segregated will fetch an average price of Rs.7/- a kg. Assuming that you have 5 persons for collection and another two for segregation, it will cost you Rs.3500/- in labour charges at the rate of Rs.500/- per head per day. The van will cost you about Rs.2000/- for a day because running will be within about 50 km per day. That should leave you with Rs.1500/- as profit. In fact it will be more because when everything possible is collected there will be some metals and other materials as well that will fetch a better price.You will need a place for segregation. You can even ask municipal trucks to dump their waste in your segregation unit and pay them a thousand or two for a truck load. In this case you will get about 20% of recyclable materials and about 80% of organic waste. This organic material can be used to make compost with the help of a bit of farm yard manure, poultry manure and such other animal wastes. Compost sells for Rs.4/- to Rs.5/- per kg.Segregated materials can be sold to bulk dealers and that will fetch you better prices. In my view urban waste will give you a profit of Rs.1000/-to Rs.1500/- per ton of waste segregated.If done efficiently this can be a profitable business as well as serve as a boon to society.

Systems of record are for those processes which don't change, are standard across an industry or all of business. At an energy utility, it's the billing system or at a university, it's the student administration system, in any transacting business it's the accounting system - these are systems which are not subject to rapid change and applying a fast moving BPM toolkit approach won't offer any value add.Next up are systems of differentiation, these still offer off the shelf capability, but start to benefit from having tools to create new processes and features, in a way which you can use to react to changing competitor propositions. These could be a website or a contact centre system.Systems of innovation are really for new business opportunities or urgent requirements which need to be handled immediately.  Some organisations also consider innovation systems when trying to discover new business processes, so the solution is never really viewed as permanent. A good scenario to think of was the Google ""right to forget"" legal ruling. The day after the ruling was made, Google started to receive on average 10,000 requests per day for search result modification. Using a system which took a few months to develop would result in a big problem. Innovation systems can be rapid configuration BPM tools, excel spreadsheets, anything which allows you to create and run an end-to-end process. So being agile is only really needed when you need to differentiate and innovate, and just make sure you pick a BPM tool (if that's what you need) which allows you to drive change at a rate demanded by the problem.

In fact, there are products like googlesites, wordpress and others like those mentioned in previous answers that actually allow you to do it by yourself, but it seems they don't qualify, perhaps because they are template driven, and the look and feel is constrained. All above mentioned products are online, which avoids dealing with problems like hosting, permissions and FTP issues like those who happened with first era software like dreamweaver and frontpage. But the question is a good one, as long as it can help to think on the issue: what for do you want to drag and drop? Or in other words, 'what are customers expecting from web development, and why they don't like current good solutions?' Tipically, it is layout and look and feel what you want when you ask for drag and drop easyness. The tool you mortals are asking about, is also called a code generator: a program that is really making the code for you somewhere in the backstage. Trouble is every two years or so, new web features make old code not bad, not obsolete, but... unsatisfactory because it does not render well in a new gadget or does not fulfil new requirements. Maintenance for the code generator to be up to date is costly. As the web standards evolve, problems arise at both the generated code and the very tool interfaces because they are javascript powered. Current web standards are evolving because the web technology is too young and unfinished. Web standards are not regulated by laws as trade and traffic are, but they are regulated instead by consensus. Consensus is usually broken by both struggle for market and deprecation. Sometimes new trending in mass behaviour also have some play. Browser wars, new versions for programming languages, composite programming (HTML+CSS+Javascript), new gadgets, rise and decline of de facto standards (Adobe Shockwave Flash), growing bandwidth, the next hit (google, facebook, youtube, twitter... you get the point). Everything plays for a changing environment, and a stable one is the only thing you need to have a WYSIWYG drag-and-drop web editor suitable for everybody.  But the real deal here is what customers do expect. For first time customers, a web site is usually something related to design and aesthetics. Beginners usually think on how they would like their website to look. Sometimes, it is even obvious that they pretend to astonish or surprise somebody else with their cool aesthetic senses.  Professionals and experienced customers tend to see a web site as a tool that must make money, or 'convert'. Look and feel is important, but second level priority, conditioned by behavioural standards out of their control. So, instead on thinking how a website should look like, they think on how it should behave and make money (convert). As long as customers and web owners evolve and learn, easy and out of the box solutions tend to be not enough for their needs. That's because that kind of solution is too standard, and as their website matures, their requirements became specific and nonstandard. They end hiring some web developers. Web developers don't like drag-and-drop tools. Developing teams have only a few web designers, and many programmers, and coders, and consultants. So, we are closing a circle here. Current on-line solutions allow everybody to make by their own a website, even if it is a quite simple site, which is good enough for a small business, a solo professional, or a hobby, or a big business with few online needs. As long as the site is able to make more money or be more complex (not big), issues like efficiency, speed, database tuning, complex web forms, upgraded usability, require custom building.

My bias is on the side of actual and complete science, not the pied piper nonsense that has been forced on us. Covid has negatively affected the entire economy. The economy is affecting the housing market. Lose your job for thirty days…. a problem, but survivable Lose it for ninety days ……. a bigger problem, changes need to be made (move to a smaller place, sell the house, foreclose) oops… can’t move because they’re behind on rent and the new landlord will want a deposit and last month’s rent. Stuck in a place that they will probably be evicted from in a few months. Can’t sell either because they’d have no place to go…. if they rent and can’t pay, then they’d be in even more trouble. Will the job come back? Maybe, maybe not. The business owners have been attacked by the covid embracing politicians. Though small businesses employ the majority of people, they are sanctioned, forced to close, fined, harassed and declared public enemies if they try to keep business open. There has been more damage by job loss than by covid. Sure covid was a mystery in the first month or so. Treatments were less than perfect. Then it became less of a mystery and easier to avoid and treat. Lose the job for nearly a year? Very few can survive the economic crush. As people lose income and can’t pay rent or mortgage, the dominoes begin to fall. People lose their homes, landlords lose their properties, prices for rents and houses plummet. If you don’t believe that, look at 2007 when it began last time. The biggest problem was job loss and then the downward price pressure started. People were upside down in their homes so they couldn’t sell and couldn’t pay. At that time, banks and big money had a windfall. They got bailed out and got property as well. Hedge funds bought the properties for rock bottom prices. They thought that was a great test. Let’s do it again. Except this time we can do it and get rid of the orange man at the same time. A diabolical plan was in the making. Diabolical? Yes, absolutely evil. For the early part of covid we saw stable and slightly rising prices. Price pressure is beginning to show. Interest rates are lower for now. Within a few months watch for signs of these changes: Many of htem will affect the housing market in some way. Gas prices will rise to over $4.00 . Taxes will increase by at least 20%. Medical costs will be increased and the cost of deductibles will bankrupt many. You will no longer have authority over your health treatment. (just check out New York which will no longer give vaccines to anyone over 75… get on a list and if there are any left, you might be able to have one). The good news is that the vaccine is not even necessary if you take care of a few measures. You will be forced to account for your whereabouts at all times (in the name of covid). Your social media will be censored unless you are a parrot. Your business will be forced to change in some fashion that will shrink profits….. Am I doom and gloom? If the coming administration gets its way, I see trouble for all. In a very short time, real estate will feel the price pressure from all sides. Joblessness will shrink the buyer pool and it will be a buyer’s market. Unemployed people with mortgages will find themselves in a bind. When the administration tries to take five percent of your savings every year, you’ll begin to feel desperate. All that you worked 80 hours a week to save will be gone in twenty years. The income that you expected to receive from those savings or investments will be gone as well. Now you’re at their mercy. This is not where we are supposed to be. Our country was not built that way and it only got to be the greatest country for its citizens because we respected the citizens. The elite and ignorant in government now are short sighted. They can’t see beyond their own gains. They are willing to sacrifice all of the peons (if you are not one of them, you are a peon) so they can have power. They will give our country to the enemy on the pretext of saving the world from carbon (a basic component of life). They have already sold a major port to the Chinese. Why is that good? The US should not allow sales of any property to China. Now they gave the Port of Savanah to China? Now China has direct access to Georgia and the entire US? What does that say about our ignorance of human nature, ignorance of history? It is indicative of desperation in the State of Georgia that they would rather kill our economy internally and then prop up the facade of normalcy by taking the Chinese money. Do I have a crystal ball? Of course not. If you expect normal interest rates and a return of jobs, you’ll bet on stable real estate. If you expect more job loss, high gas prices, higher income taxes, higher real estate taxes and continued covid Gestapo, bet on declining prices. Pray for justice. Work for the right to free speech, right to assemble, the right to bear arms, the right to religious freedom, the right of personal authority over body, education and all of the other unalienable rights which are under attack. God will help us all if we ask. We can not just sit and complain. We need to find a way to reinvigorate the people so we will stand as more than pawns in someone else’s game. IF you can afford to, buy real estate while the rates are low. You can’t lose. If prices go up, great. If they fall, you still have a property to live in or rent. Just make sure the required income is half of the current rental value…. just in case.",2021-03-06T23:52:59.440Z,"How has COVID positively and negatively affected the US housing market going into 2021?

(if someone, due to their business model or politics, had a different definition of “more”, you could figure that out pretty quickly, and force them to conform by performing a transaction which carries a cost.) if you give someone two objects, one of which is fatter and the other of which is taller, and tell them to pick the “bigger” one, then you have to take some time to tell them what you mean by “bigger.” so there’s contingency and ambiguity that, if left unchecked, could set your switches into an indeterminate state. so, smashing things down to comparisons of numbers buys you unambiguous statements, which help your switches to operate predictably. once you have lots of switches happening though, you don’t necessarily have to stick with words. for example, if you wanted a different reliable result, like getting lots of people to do something like watch season 2 of a show, then you could show them a picture of bernard looking at a tiger, and then you would probably end up with your desired outcome. or if your switching mechanism changed state once every 4 years, and your mechanism of bringing about its change in state consisted of people watching youtube videos, then your method of “programming” is different. words are compact and useful once you are dealing with switching mechanisms, but other aspects of circuits and signal flow might be dealt with using words in combination with other strategies when we think of a “program,” what we usually think is that for a program to be useful, it has to perform some computation faster than a human could, and it has to do it predictably, meaning that if you ran it multiple times with the same input, it should give you the same answer, or if you gave it to someone else and they ran it, they would get the same answer what we currently have that can perform computations fast are switches, that run with electricity. so the switches form a circuit that tells you useful information, like a bunch of them spell out a number, and you interpret that number a Continue Reading",2021-03-06T23:53:19.140Z,"Why do we have to program using words?

In the noughties we had proper 32 bit memory allocation. We had better libraries, a richer dev environment and the GUI was easier to create. .NET appeared! Javascript libraries were pretty embryonic at best. Nowadays, you can define forms in a GUI and drag and drop. You can debug HTML in a browser and look at the styles and even change them in place.

If you divided up the land as well, each person would have such a small plot that they could not generate enough food for themselves, even if they had the seeds, fertilizer and water. The ones who didn't starve would be at war, fighting over the remaining food, until the ammunition ran out (nobody would have enough money to pay to manufacture more ammunition, not to mention acquiring the necessary raw materials).  It's true that well over half of the world's population would have an increased level of income for a short time - from dirt dirt poor to dirt poor - but it would not be enough to lift them out of poverty and would destroy the systems that provide the potential for eventually moving more people out of poverty.  Some would argue that a bartering economy could replace money but I doubt it would work, given the size of the world's population.  A few might do well but most of the rest would starve.  The world would spend another few thousand years getting back to where we are today. Here's an analogy.  Suppose 10,000 people wanted to get across a river and the only available boat could only handle 10 people.  Option 1: All 10,000 people try to get into the boat and the result is that all perish. Option 2: The first ten get into the boat, cross the river, send the boat back with one of them, and take the next 9, and continue this until all 10,000 get over. Of course the second option forces you to give some people priority over others, which means all are not treated equally, but it is the only effective way to get them all across the river.  OK, there's a third option that involves building more boats, but it would still take a lot longer than one crossing of the river and would still involve not treating all people equally..

If a person resides in a healthy atmosphere where people possess good qualities and have positive attitude, person will automatically have good behaviour and be a well behaved person in the society. And if the atmosphere surrounds the negative and narrow minded people the person will develop his natire accordingly. The society also affects the decisions of the other people and also theirs thinking. Today we need a JUST SOCIETY where justice is done in every aspect and there is no discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, religion, colour or gender. Everyone should be treated equal and justice is provided to everyone. But India doesn't have a just society. Many people are not getting justice and even the gap between the rich and the poor is rising day by day. All the facilities are made available to the rich people but the poor are still below poverty line. Many among them are discriminated on the basis of caste, colour, creed and race. They are not justified. The gap between the men and women is increasing day by day in India. This everything needs to be stopped to have a just society. Initiatives are needed to be taken in regard to all such social problems as society is the place which can't be left throughout the life. The person can only prosper if they live in a healthy environment where everyone understands each other and share a bond of equality and love. Government is doing great in regard to this. They have passed many laws and acts which are in favour of the poor low class people. And they helped many farmers with the loan facilities to carry out their work. But it isn't enough for a just society. Much more efforts are needed to make it the better place to live. So to make these changes in the society many NGOs are working to improve the society of India. They have helped alot in improvements. These are non-governmental organisations which are non-probable and work for the betterment of the youth and the society. The Kalgidhar Trust well defines the definition of an NGO. It works in dynamic environment with very humble and patient behaviour. Kalgidhar Society aims to build superior human Character and high moral values as a way to establish permanent world peace. They pay large attention towards the discrimination among the people of the society. They helped alot in tenoving child labour from the society and gave them opportunity to study and educate themselves. They without any restriction of caste and creed opened low-cost schools for mainly rural children who are poor and can't efford education. It helped alot to bring the rural low-class children closer to the urban people which helped alot in minimising the gap between rural and urban people. They also organise many campaigns in the schools which brings the children of various caste, creed and colour together on one platform where they share their ideas and be the strength for each other. They keep nuiaside all the boundaries of their religion and come together to form unity. Tree plantation campaigns is one of the examples of it. Spirituality is something that Akal Academies teaches. It is also a weapon to bring people closer to each other and let them develop good values in themselves. The person who is spiritual is the most respected person in the society. So the spiritual values are very important in person's life. The other thing which the Kalgidhar Trust do to make the society, a JUST SOCIETY is that it removes the differences between the man and the women through empowerment of the women. According to them girl is the main power of the family and have equal contribution in the society. She is not less than anyone and can earn of their own and choose their own way of living life. So the Akal Academies pays large attention towards the education of the girls and women. They provide many pf the rural women and also children with the free of cost education and also in addition they provide them with the opportunities to earn through free teacher training course to the rural women. They also provide many brilliant rural children with scholarships and other opportunities. The free teacher training course for the rural women had helped many women to earn their livlihood as under this they are trained as the teachers and than made capable enough to earn and teach. Then these women are given employment opportunities in their own schools and colleges. Or they caneget themselves employed according to their own choices and preferences. This had helped them alot in employment process and live their own kind of life. They are also helping many widow women as the HOME FOR WIDOW AND DESTITUTE. The Kalgidhar Society, has set up a home for widows and destitute women at Baru Sahib. It give shelter to many unfortunate and widow women who have lost their husbands or have been discarded by their families. The Akal Home for Widows and Destitute Women ensures that the honorable life of these women is safe and secured environment is provided to them and also help them in raising their kids in healthy and comfortable environment. The Kalgidhar Society provides these women various vocational courses and employment opportunities to retain their daily living with honor and self-respect. And these couses includes the free teacher training course. Other than this they also believes in providing the youth with the Value-based education which helps many young children to develop good balues in them and also hepled them alot in having positive attitude in the society. The attitude of the students matters alot in the society and to have a Just Society it is important to have good value in the society and the Akal Academies by the Kalgidhar Trust provide the youth with the best quality education which is value based and makes the person more humble and honoured. The main values which the Akal Academies teaches is spirituality, meditation and sewa. Sewa also helps alot to have equal treatment with all as it is the selfless aervice toards the people without any discrimination and differences on the base of religion. It is a true dedication to the God it is the process of serving others who are the creaters of God. They also provide relief to many farmers too. They give their children with the free education and helps them to earn for their families. They removed child labour out of the society. It have helped many people to come out of the depression and also the people who are involved in drugs have helped them alot in getting rid of drugs. They have 2 de-addiction and rehabilitations centers for them to recover and also they organise many rallies in which the youth is told the bads of drugs and made aware that how it ruined the life of many. The Kalgidhar Trust is working greatly for the society. As the person takes birth in the society and dies in the society.

AIESEC also offers technical internships for recent graduates to work in their field of experience and make a contribution to the professional world while developing their own skills. AIESEC is a student run organization and it is the students who deliver the aforementioned experiences and explore their leadership potential. Personally speaking, for me, AIESEC was a safety net, where I could try out new things and learn new things without the fear of failure knowing that this organization is preparing me for future. I’ve had a beautiful experience spread over 3.5 years. Do feel free to get in touch with me if in case you want any more details, or you can visit aiesec.org. AIESEC believes that there is a global deficit in Leadership and that good leadership is the solution to the world’s problems. With this in mind, AIESEC strives to achieve peace and fulfillment of Humankind’s potential by achieving cross-border and cross-cultural understanding.

Because of the basis of ethics being statistical of the populist instead of moral absolutes based on righteousness. A populist that believes there are no absolutes; that we come from nothingness; exist from a random chance of chemistry in a random Cosmos; that we are therefore considered impersonal; and are basically only a machine. These machines then provide data to where the mass determines what is ethical at the time by statical means. What was unethical yesterday becomes ethical and the past unethical. Just look how California looks at adult men having sex with children who consent. Instead of being labeled as a sexual predator. Do you not agree that evolutionary theory at a basic level has no answer to ethics? Don’t you agree if rational is only defined by science and mathematics that the questions of God existing; love; morals; and the soul are dead to reason and logic? They are considered irrational. But those big questions still remain that post modernism still can not answer. Philosophy no longer can help you. You can thank Hegel for the destruction of antithesis and use of synthesis to compromise truth and absolutes. Classic philosophy is dead. That leaves you with existentialism in the populist and art, music, the culture and even the religious.  Ref. Francis Schaeffer, Trilogy, p.234. No answers there. In fact antiphilosophy grows with Critical theories on gender, sexual orientations, fat phobia, race, and cynical theory. It now is impossible to define justice in any stable form. It will breakdown into chaos. That is by design. You just have to see that some realize it before others. Like Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) who viewed the world to be rationally absurd. Try to authenticate yourself by giving money to a poor man on a street corner as an act of your will. It is absurd. What does it matter. He is nothing. The situation is nothing. But by an act of your will you are authenticated. Really by something with no rational or logical content? All directions of the acts of the will are equal. You could have decided to hit and run that poor man on the corner as an act of your will and have equal authentication. It is a hopeless position to stand on. The trail of a final experience, or feelings of dread, or definition of words that constrains philosophy away from metaphysics all lead to the big questions into a world of anti-philosophy today. They are stuck between rationality and hope in a dichotomy that eludes humanist unity. Where do you think gender expression winds up with 1000s of possibilities beyond male and female? Or elitist Europeans who found a new world via technology they could exploit the indigenous natives not being like those today who acted similarly as elitist who manipulate technology to exploit your personal data to make money, or exploit your vote, or your value rating as a citizen in the collective or state. Colonialism deconstruction social justice would lead to technology deconstructionism today not to 1619 or 1492, but to 2020. It is all absurd and leads to chaos. More riots in the street and killings in the city. You should ask yourself why did man abandon the Reformation basis of rationality and pursue the Renaissance man? When man had found unity between rationality and hope in progressive revelation instead of progressive liberalism. Progressive revelation starts with a Creator who communicates that we were made in His image. Giving us personality, self awareness, a conscience, and a soul. He reveals His brilliance in DNA 🧬 design and our ecosystem that is impossible to self create and that is His point. The whole random Cosmos would turn dark before life would be created. And that is even mathematical. But we get answers by specific revelation in the Holy Bible. Again starting with our human dignity. Then God said, ""Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."" God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them; and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth."" (Genesis 1:26–28 NASB) It should be obvious we were made different from animals with no self image or conscience to bother them. Their soul does not go into a funk when hope is lost. But with Renaissance man views anything supernatural as irrational and thrown out. But the Bible claims to be truth beyond sciences with power and personhood that aren’t necessarily contrary with Sting Theory possibilities with multiple dimensions in time and space. It is better than dark matter. The God who communicates wants man to know His word is true. The LORD said to Moses, ""Is the LORD'S power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not."" So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. Also, he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stationed them around the tent. Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do it again. (Numbers 11:23–25 NASB) The issue is not with God, but men who reject the God of the Bible. People whose the Spirit rested on them to communicate for God felt that rejection also. The LORD said to Samuel, ""Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being king over them. (1 Samuel 8:7, NASB) This rejection is told to us is because of our sin and being a sinner in need of a Savior. It drives man’s deceitful heart to reject the truth from God and minimize it, to rationalize it doesn’t exist. God’s efforts persist as Jesus explained in simple terms that a lowly farmer could understand. ""Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT AND DUG A WINE PRESS IN IT, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey. When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce. The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third. Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them. But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.' They took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?"" They said to Him, ""He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons."" Jesus *said to them, ""Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone; THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'? (Matthew 21:33–52 NASB) Jesus was that cornerstone whose foundation is true on every side. He is the Truth and was that Son who died so man could be free. The Reformation Man recognized it and found unity and peace. The man of the Renaissance world never did. NASB used by permission from the Lockman Foundation Metaphor for finding justice.

Alucard from Hellsing can’t die, even if he desperately wants to. Years of constant bloodshed and murder wore him down. He was abused as a child, fought for his people as Vlad Tepes, lost everything, his family and his empire even though he swore to fight in the name of God, gets executed and then spent the next five centuries walking the earth as a vampire who can’t be killed. Alucard sees anyone who would be willing to sacrifice their soul for immortality as a coward. That’s how he perceives himself. That’s why he has an odd level of respect for humans. Van Hohenheim from Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood received a body that can never die as a gift from the main Antagonist known as Father. He’s constantly tormented by hundreds of thousands of miserable souls trapped inside him. His guilt made their screams unbearable. Father isn’t fazed by such a thing because unlike Hohenheim, guilt and remorse are foreign concepts. That creature doesn’t care for anything other than knowledge, power and self-preservation. Hohenheim's immortality made him fear the simplest of pleasures like human connection or living a simple life like he always wanted.

BRAZIL medical-tourism When you’re looking for a fantastic plastic surgeon, Brazil is the place to go. Not only are the professionals good in what they do, but their services are much cheaper too. Brazil is the world capital for plastic surgery medical tourism, owing to the country’s image-conscious culture. While Mexico is the best known country in the Americas for foreigners seeking care, Brazil stands out as one of the most advanced places in the region. Looking good and feeling sexy is important in Brazil — almost to an extreme — so it’s no wonder the country is home to more cosmetic surgeons than anywhere else on earth. In Brazil, plastic surgery is done in a hospital, not in an office, and doctors are highly trained in such procedures. Up until recently, medical tourism in Brazil was largely relegated to elective procedures. However, the country has the first JCI-accredited hospital in the world outside of the United States — Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paolo — and now has more than 40 JCI-accredited hospitals. Brazil has the least efficient medical system on this list, although it is nearly tied with the United States in that regard. Costs for plastic surgery can be as much as 60% less than in Western countries, and surgeons can handle just about any procedure you can dream up. There are even veterinarians offering cosmetic surgeries on pets! Brazil is home to perhaps the world’s most renowned plastic surgeon, Ivo Pitanguy, and prices for top doctors can be as high as those in the US, so make sure to shop the lesser-known clinics if you want to save money. However, Brazil’s beauty consciousness surely can’t hurt anyone looking to save money on a nip and tuck. 9. MEXICO medical-tourism-mexico Dental services are very affordable in Mexico, which is why so many Americans come here to make sure their smile is flawless. Mexico’s proximity to the United States and extensive crossover in medical training means standards for care are often equivalent to what you would expect “back home” and with far less expense. All major cities in Mexico will have good quality-hospitals. One area of focus for Mexico is also dentistry — for example, the numerous dental practices that line the US-Mexico border and receive countless patients per year coming from the States to Mexico for those procedures. Expats may choose to have private insurance, otherwise much of the health care services in Mexico are government run and may incur small fees. All the technologies, prescriptions, and operations you would expect to be available in the United States are available in Mexico at a fraction of the cost. 8. PANAMA medical-tourism-panama Panama is a good choice for medical tourists since its hospitals are highly recommended, they accept private travel insurance and the country is a great place to visit in general. Panama is not only a top location for retirement or second citizenship, but also for medical tourism. Its private hospitals also offer excellent medical care that may partner with major hospitals in North America that you may be familiar with already. International travelers can get plans that may include coverage not only in Panama but elsewhere and for a reasonable monthly rate. The medical staff is largely English-speaking and Panama is a well-connected and well-developed country in the region. Panama is one of the freest economies in the world and almost any nationality can visit Panama 180 days visa-free. Panama offers significant savings on procedures such as dental implants that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the US. 7. COSTA RICA medical-tourism-costa-rica Whether it’s general healthcare you’re after or you need to get your dental health in check, going to Costa Rica to do that is one of the best things you can do. Costa Rica, like Panama and Mexico, also is one of the most developed and expat-friendly countries in the region. The nation is one of the safest and most popular destinations for retirement, uses the US dollar, and likewise offers excellent choices for medical tourists. Most people choose to make the most of both the government and private options in this country to access the healthcare they need. Costs for major operations or doctor visits are often a quarter of the price they would be in the US. Costa Rica is also one of the best countries for having a territorial tax system. Around 40,000 people visited Costa Rica last year solely for medical tourism, and 15,000 of them for dental care. The dental tourism niche is booming in Costa Rica, where you can expect to pay around USD 4,000 for a tooth-replacement procedure that would cost you minimum USD 10.000 in the US or Canada. Even with plane tickets and accommodation, it is still a bargain. 6. CZECH REPUBLIC medical-tourism-czech-republic If you’re looking for a medical tourism haven in Europe, then the Czech Republic, especially Prag, should be your destination. The Czech Republic is an excellent option for healthcare in the European Union and in a part of Europe that offers many of the highly-developed European services one would expect but at a better value than its counterparts in the Western part of the continent. Prague is considered a haven for retirees and entrepreneurs alike. The Czech Republic is known for being sought out for services like teeth whitening, cosmetic surgeries, and others. You can save up to sixty percent compared to the UK on cosmetic surgeries: a breast enlargement with silicon implants costs £2,120 including one to two nights in a clinic in Prague, and nose reshaping costs £1,610 including one night in the clinic. Prague is one of our best-value European cities for living and in general, the Czech Republic is one of our low-tax European bases to focus on. Whether you are visiting only for medical reasons or would want to seek out opportunities in the Czech Republic from a business and lifestyle standpoint, this country is worth considering. 5. TURKEY medical-tourism-turkey As we’re going further east, we can’t but mention Turkey and their eye health care and how it flourishes with each passing year. Here, practiced professionals paired with affordable prices speak for themselves. Turkey, a country at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, has a growing medical tourism sector that also is worth looking at. World-class health treatment centers, as well as spas, dentist, cosmetic surgeons, and much more, are found in Turkey. Turkey is also known for eye health specialists where the most expensive ocular procedure will cost you USD 5000. As this country grows economically and focuses on its relationship to the EU, pay close attention to how the medical tourism industry will grow. We discussed Turkish citizenship by investment as an interesting option, particularly for investors from the Middle East and elsewhere who want a middle ground and base in the region that is increasingly pro-business and offers great connectivity to the rest of the world through Istanbul. 4. INDIA medical-tourism-india Maybe you’re new to medical tourism and the fact that India is one of the top destinations for serious surgical procedures, but now you know. Yes, really. India has become a top health tourism destination for high-end surgeries at inexpensive prices. India specializes in inexpensive bypass surgeries and other high-end medical procedures for medical tourists. One of the top ten medical tourism hospitals is in India. Stories of Westerners traveling to India and saving 75% over home country costs for large procedures — travel costs included — are not uncommon. India is anticipated to have a $2 billion industry serving the overseas patient, thanks to well over 100,000 patients who visit each year. The Indian government is easing restrictions on citizens of many countries, making it easier for them to travel to India, visa-free and with fewer restrictions (US citizens do need a visa to enter India, which costs $67 plus any agency service fees). India is widely known for its advanced medical services and equipment. Doctors tend to be highly trained, due to large medical tourism cities like Chennai and Noida having foreign patients fill half their hospital beds. Also, the language barrier is lower for English speakers, and Indian hospitals are bringing in translators for non-English speaking foreigners. Health care costs in India can run as low as ten cents on the dollar compared to the US or the UK. Popular treatments include bone-marrow transplants, eye surgery and hip grafting and replacement. India is also a top destination for cardiac bypass surgery at facilities like the Asian Heart Institute; the procedure can cost less than $10,000 as compared to more than $100,000 in the West. 3. THAILAND medical-tourism-thailand Many expats will agree that Thailand is one of the best places to live in if you’re a nomad, and one of the main reasons for it is the high-quality health services they provide. Thailand has long been one of the best medical tourism destinations in the world, with low health care costs and excellent service for expats. So much so that medical tourism is growing by 16% a year. Bangkok is home to Bumrungrad Hospital, where I myself went for a total health check-up after losing a bit of weight, and paid very, very little. The hospital was largely modeled after the Mayo Clinic, and their electronic medical record service impressed Microsoft so much they bought the whole thing. While I’m not a fan of Thailand in general, there is no denying that their medical system is prized for offering a wide range of surgeries and other procedures at cheap prices. One of my expat friends said he’d get “any surgery” in Thailand due to the high quality of care. Many doctors in Thailand have been trained in Western countries or Singapore and speak excellent English; nurses tend to speak English relatively well, also. Ever since the crash of the baht in the nineties, Thailand used its currency crisis to attract medical tourists from around Asia, mainly for cosmetic surgeries. Today, Thailand is a haven for inexpensive plastic surgery, but also non-elective procedures. A facelift that might cost $15,000 in The Land of the Free would cost $2,500-3,000 in Thailand. Meanwhile, bypass surgery could cost around $25,000, an 80% discount over US prices. Experts recommend sticking to Bangkok rather than the coastal resort towns for access to the best doctors and care. 2. SINGAPORE medical-tourism-singapore Singapore has the sixth best health care system in the world, which in itself speaks volumes. World-renowned cancer treatment specialists can be found here, and it’s still much cheaper than in the UK or the US. Singapore, while expensive, has one of the most sophisticated hospital systems in the world. Singapore’s status as one of the world’s freest economies, as well as a highly developed nation, has made it a medical tourism hub for both Asians and Westerners for years. Cancer treatment is a top speciality there. Gleneagles Hospital was ranked among the top ten hospitals around the globe by a health travel group, but many other hospitals offer excellent care as well. The World Health Organization ranks Singapore as the best health care system in Asia, and sixth in the world. And while socialists claim that Singapore’s efficient, rather socialist health care model is a model for the rest of the world, personal responsibility is a key driver that keeps health care costs here reasonably low. You will pay more in Singapore than in places like Thailand, but the quality of life in Singapore is second to none. One US-based grocery chain had a policy of paying the entire hospital bill, including travel costs for two, for employees who got hip and knee replacements in Singapore. Life expectancy in Singapore is several years longer than that of the UK. And, by many standards, the city-state has the world’s lowest infant mortality rate. If you’re looking for the most developed country for less expensive surgery, Singapore might be for you. However, there are stories of excessive costs which, together with rising health care standards in other countries, are causing medical tourism to shift to other parts of Asia. 1. MALAYSIA medical-tourism-malaysia Malaysia has the best of both worlds – strong infrastructure, top-notch services and affordable prices all at the same time. No wonder it’s number one on our list. Malaysia sees well over half a million medical tourists — most from around Asia — each year due to the country’s developed infrastructure and low costs. Malaysia has built medical facilities that rival Singapore at much lower price points. The country has set up agencies to attract hundreds of thousands of medical tourists for procedures for anything from burns to heart conditions. The general consensus is that, as Singapore gets more expensive, Kuala Lumpur is picking up the slack with facilities that are just as good. English is more widely spoken in Malaysia than in Thailand, and infrastructure is better than countries like India. Like other countries in Asia, Malaysia saw medical tourism as a way to diversify its economy during the Asian financial crisis. Prince Court Medical Center, where I easily saved $2,000 when I got sick in Kuala Lumpur, was ranked the number one hospital for “patients without borders” by the Medical Travel Quality Alliance. Malaysian hospitals offer services such as in vitro fertilization at around one-fifth the price of Western facilities, as well as offering sophisticated treatment for burn victims. Malaysian hospitals also offer total physicals that would cost several thousand dollars in the US, including blood work, for a few hundred dollars. CONCLUSION If you are looking for top quality healthcare without wasted money and headache, these countries offer you a start. Apart from this list, other countries are joining in to grab their share of foreign patients, as well. Jordan has seen millions of patients cross into its borders and has received a top-five ranking for medical tourism from the World Bank, while Colombia is fast rising as a medical tourism hub.",2021-03-07T00:02:51.274Z,"What country has the best healthcare system in the world?

Efficient and intelligent but dishonest.2. Honest but foolish and inefficient.Any Indian has thought so far that the biggest crime is to reject the merit with 99.9 point score and select those with 33.99% which is practiced legally as GOI policy?I think that we drop these crimes issues and talk about the destiny of Malaysian airlines for our gossiping purposes!

It should be that the ‘headquarters’ of the Church and the ‘pope’s see are Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the mother church of all Christianity, and the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) the most important church in all Christendom. So why is the Church of Rome (and its bishop) considered to have primacy rather than the Church of Jerusalem (and its bishop)? First - though theologically the least important reason - is that Rome was the capital of the Empire. The City was head and mother of the entire Mediterranean world, so naturally its Christian citizens developed similar ideas. It is for similar reasons that Constantinople, despite not having apostolic foundation, grew to such importance in the 5th and 6th centuries, and that Moscow likewise has claimed such authority for the last couple of centuries - the secular capitol carries certain weight. More importantly, though, both Peter and Paul, regarded as the chief apostles, made their way to Rome and were martyred there. They became like the new Remus and Romulus, co-patrons and founders of ‘Christian’ Rome. Neither were the bishop there, to be sure, but are recognized as ‘founding’ the Church of Rome, and therefore also its line of bishops. The Church of Rome, while small itself, quickly became one of the larger and wealthier local churches early on, earning a reputation for sending aid to smaller or more persecuted/impoverished churches around the empire. It “presided in charity”, in the words of Ignatius of Antioch. (This was not only about its financial support of others, to be sure, but certainly wasn’t about centralized leadership either.) Finally, though, it was the destruction of the Temple and diaspora of the Jews (including the Christians), and the general razing of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD/CE, followed by their building of a Roman colony (Aelia Capitolina) over the ruins a couple generations later that effectively ended the local Church of Jerusalem (though there were stragglers). A temple to Jupiter was built on the Temple Mount and a statue of Venus was built on Calvary. Every effort to wipe out the memory of the city as Jewish (and Christian) was made. Had this not happened, it is likely that Jerusalem, not Rome, would have maintained primacy. At the very least, it may have been regarded as co-equal. Not until Constantine (and his mother) was Jerusalem established as a Christian city, and its bishop was incorporated under the authority of the patriarch of Antioch - one of the three patriarchal sees of the time (after Rome and Alexandria). Only in 451 was Jerusalem recognized as a patriarchal church, by that time fifth in rank after Constantinople had inserted itself after Rome and before Alexandria, for its rank as imperial capital. By that time, the idea of ranking the patriarchates by political as much as ecclesiastical priority was well established, and it would have been hard to convince most of the bishops in those other sees to recognize Jerusalem as having precedence. When it fell to the caliphate in the 630s, that basically sealed its fate, in terms of ecclesiastical precedence. I have often wondered how many, many things would be different had the Church disdained secular prestige and insisted on Jerusalem, the Mother Church of all Christianity, to hold primacy. How different would the Church look if the ‘pope’, the supreme pastor, were the (Aramaic) bishop of Jerusalem rather than the bishop of Rome?

While others become more mainstream a couple of technology trends are becoming viable. However, for me, the one biggest trend that will be thriving in 2019 would be containerization. Virtualization technology has lived for a long time, allowing users to run operating storage, servers, software and systems. This technology is popular, with programs like VMWare being deployed to help IT departments get more out of their hardware automate to scale and reduce back on resources that are unnecessary.  However, virtualization has faced one important drawback: the sheer number of resources it absorbs. Running hardware or software takes a tremendous number of RAM, processing power and hard disk space, requiring virtualization applications to run on high-end machines in order to handle the electricity required. Virtualization platforms have attempted to address this issue by building slimmed-down applications pictures that eliminate unnecessary functions that eat up tools but necessarily require virtualizing an entire operating system in order to make its programs function. This equation is currently changing, all thanks to Containerization technology. Rather than needing an entire machine to run an app containers package an app's runtime, system tools, system configurations, and libraries to operate and share resources. The result is a program that's portable across programs and far less resource intensive. Among the companies on the other side of the drive to containerization is Docker, which assembles software applications for Windows and Linux. With containerization applications or Docker, programs could be deployed across data centers and servers that help their scale increases in a reduce price. So, next time you hire Custom Software Development Company to India, make sure you do discuss this concept of containerization with the developer.

(ii) Less/No corruption - Being governed by the army, there will definitely be less/no room for corruption. The leaders, ruling the nation, would themselves have grown up under strict eyes.

Being governed by the army, to whom discipline is the first thing in life, this is a thing you can surely expect from them. This will definitely be imposed with stricter finer, graver penalties, which would make people think twice before doing anything. (iv) Decline in Crime Rate - This is a follow-up to the previous point. Of course, if people are more disciplined with graver penalties to pay, there has to be a decline in the crime rate. The average Indian can feel more safe in his/her daily life. (v) Less Dependency on Exported Arms - With the Army in power, you can definitely expect this. More budget and brain power will be allocated to the indigenous arms industry and ‘Make in India’ can really then come of age. The army will make this a serious point, as they really know what the disadvantages are in being the largest arms exporter in the world. The Cons - (i) Lose Democracy - With the army holding the power, common mass will lose their democratic power and with it their rite to choose their ruler. This is really a big disadvantage, as they really can’t do much, even if they don’t feel connected to the ruler. They surely will have to make way for this ‘powerful government’. (ii) Probable Rise of Autocracy - With the Army in power, there will definitely be a strong leader, who will call all the shots, probably the Army General. With unopposed power in hand, he might be driven to a path where he becomes an autocratic leader. This will be a disaster really, something which India can ill afford. (iii) Uncertain Political Structure - With the Army taking control, there will be not much to do with the current political structure of the country. There will be uncertainties with the State Structure of the nation and especially the State Governments. They have to be dissolved completely. True is also the case for the Central Government, with the uncertain path that they have to follow.

Here are the things I think are likely, at least for India, in response to your question India feeds a lot of people and emits not a lot of CO2e to feed each of them compared to developed nations. So there’s not a lot of room to squeeze this sector in this country. It is unlikely India or other developing nations can deliver quantities without diesel and fertiliser.A tax on CO2 emissions would have to be a national tax, imposed by India on itself. Other countries importing India’s food could impose tariffs based on the CO2 emitted in the food production. But I think India exports the small minority of its food.If there was a large additional penalty on agriculture in India, it is very unlikely the labour force would change. This is because India would struggle to further automate; there is likely no other work for these workers; and, eating comes before climate change mitigation. Making food “harder” to grow would directly impact a large group of people, many of whom do not get adequate food already. There would be a famine.India has already pledged to convert its energy systems to low-CO2 renewables, even thought this will happen at a very large financial cost. You could argue it should spend that money instead on food and medicine. I think it is incumbent on the developed world (the Global North) in fact to make the energy transition more feasible for India and many developing nations.

Plan every rupee you get extremely carefully.Save 30% of your total salary no matter how hard it is. Just keep the money aside as though it's never yours. This saving is after the PF and other standard deductions.Pay off your loans no matter how hard it is for your survival. This will build the trust and people trust us more. Go hungry but never default on a loan. If you go hungry once then you will learn the lesson.Insure yourself. Keep some amount aside which can be used to pay the insurance premium once in a year.Ensure that the above spends does not cross 70% of your total income. If at all it crosses then you are not planning financially well. Bring down the fixed expenses.With the remaining 30% of your income, don't keep a single paise. Spend it till the last rupee. This is completely meant to spent. Finish off this amount.I had argued that 30% is not sufficient at all. After 12 years of following his advice, I understand 30% is more than sufficient. I religiously followed his advice. The result, I was able to own my own house, a small plot and a car, all within 10 years of working. And I'm a single earner in my family. My salary is nominal. Well within 1lakh per month. Of course I earned some money with my on-site work contracts. But even with this money I followed the same advice which he gave me. Some other gems from him Don't take a loan it if it exceeds more than 35% of your total income.Give highest priority to family spends than personal spends. This way your family bonding is stronger.Save always in the traditional way. It is always government savings like NSC or KVP and FD/RD. No investment in stocks or anywhere where there is risk to the principal amount.Last but the biggest gem of an advice which he gave me right after my marriage. My wife is a home maker. Instead of spending myself for all household things, my grandpa told me to give my wife a “salary”. Increase it as and when my salary increases as well. This made me completely free of thinking about household expenses as my wife started to take care of everything. Believe me she started saving some money in the”salary” which I used to give her. She even buys her own jewelry with her saved money. And gifts me on my birthday as well. By now I understood his secret. It was nothing but financial discipline. When you are financially disciplined everything else falls in place. I still miss my grandfather. He was a great man with responsibility and deeply connected to his family. He passed away peacefully in July 2016. I'm very lucky to have spent a lot of time with my grandfather. He was a visionary in his own way.",2021-03-07T00:10:07.428Z,"What is the best money advice?

It also attracts tourism through festivals like the 'Rann of Kutchh Utsav'This was when Mr. Modi was the just a Chief Minister. Now that he holds the Central Government, he is trying to bring such changes throughout the nation. Some examples:The government plans to supply 24*7 electricity to the ENTIRE NATION by 2019The government also plans to take the entire system of application and clearances for opening retail outlets online. Reducing the whole process to 3 days.High Speed Bullet trains are under wayThere are plans to develop Ganga and Yamuna and use them as waterways for transportation100 smart cities are plannedPMJDY for achieving 100% Financial InclusionGovt loans to citizen to develop Small and Medium Enterprises and nurture entrepreneursDevelopment of renewable sources of energy.There is much and more going on there that common citizens are clueless about.Edit 1: This is in response to all the people rebutting the 24*7 electricity claim.Gujarat did not have 24*7 electricity before Modi. When Congress said Gujarat was 99.9% electrified, it meant that 99.9% villages, towns and cities in Gujarat had access to electricity. Meaning that they have laid transmission lines connecting 99.9% places.Not that they had 24 hour power supply.It also does not include accidental power cuts. For example, when I lived in Udaipur, 8 years ago, there was a 4-hour power cut EVERYDAY. This means that there wasn't enough electricity to supply to Udaipur, so these were planned power cuts. In Delhi today, we have 24*7 power supply, but once in a blue moon, something happens and there's no power for many hours. Such incidents are accidental, not due to power shortage. these accidental power cuts do not mean that Delhi does not have 24*7 power supply. So, Gujarat's claim of 24*7 power supply even to villages means that they have enough power to cater to the needs to all its people, which is true, since Gujarat is a power surplus state.As a past resident of Gujarat:  1. The highly lauded Bus transportation service , BRTS(Bus Rapid Transit System), is one of the major highlights of Gujarat. Inexpensive,cozy rides and a high frequency. 2. I can literally count the number of times light went off on my fingertips during the four years I stayed in Ahmedabad. Gujarat on an average produces more power than it can consume. Even the remotest village gets electricity. Gujarat, as of Aug 2011, was the only state with surplus power among all the states having population greater than 6 crores. 3. You should visit Gandhinagar if you want to see a planned city. I have been to Noida and Chandigarh but I have not seen a planned city like Gandhinagar. Excellent Roads, a VERY green city, 24*7 light(Duh)!4. Unemployment rate is very low. Everyone is either in a job or starting their own business. Fact : Gujarat's unemployment rate is 1% , lowest in all the states. What is even better is that, Gujarat has a very low unemployment rate among females.",2021-03-07T00:11:21.590Z,"Is Gujarat really developing as it is showcased? There are a lot of criticisms.

Good coding plan improves efficiency.Coding. Code is in the question and is the task of writing a program and compiling. A good researcher might code faster than someone who tries to reinvent the wheel. Key efficiency item in this item is following best practices for the language.Programmer running their own tests. Some cannot do this or only test a limited set of inputs. It takes longer to plan for testing and running tests even when a programmer makes a small tweak. However good testing discipline improves efficiency. Always think of this: “If your code fails in production, you could be sued and pick a number that makes your hair stand on end say $100,000 million.” Most certainly you can be fired.QA. Quality Assurance. This involves a test plan for deliverable code that someone else uses to test. Realizing there is a test plan when coding makes this step more efficient as its like passing a test you studied to pass.Fixing testing errors and repeating any or all of previous tests before going to production or pre-production. This kills efficiency and is due to lower quality in previous items.Code updates. This includes the experience of modifying released code or fixing it when it fails in production.

I propose if you want to become a global citizen, that you find yourself a cause. Finding something that peaks your interests and gains your concern is a great start. Once you discover the issue you want to tackle, give yourself over to it. Only then can you truly dedicate yourself and make a difference. Volunteering your time to a nonprofit for example, is an easy way to begin. If you want to think on a larger scale, you might consider creating a startup either on your own or with friends/family. It is finding a social problem and DOING something about it. Practice sustainable methods Global citizenship is not a fad, faze, or fashion statement. It is something one only earns by ensuring the longevity of their dedication. To put it simply: you cannot give up. And once you find those issues you really care about, it is much easier to press on. To make a difference you must remain proactive towards your goals. As they say, Rome was not built in a day. Working toward your goals is great. However, finding long-term solutions is better. Try and be flexible and understand that nothing good comes without hard work and patience. When you create that startup or join that nonprofit to raise money for a cause, try your best to practice patience. The company I mentioned earlier named is great for this as they help people on a budget to travel the world. Start eating I know, I know… you are probably asking yourself what food has to do with this topic. But if you think about it, food has a lot to do with it. One of the millions of things we share with the rest of the world is the love of food. Therefore, food is a huge part of most cultures, including the United States. By trying different ethnic foods, dining out at exotic restaurants, and learning to cook dishes from around the world, we learn about said cultures. Learning to cook ethic, oriental, or just plain exotic foods has more than just a few benefits. For instance, something you might not have considered is the fact that trying new food at restaurants requires reading. Preparing recipes of the lands we have never been to also requires reading. If you pay close attention you just might pick up on the language! Travelling of course will also help with this. Travel abroad While travelling might seem impossible – it is actually entirely possible and within your grasp. Through the resources and services of different affordable travel companies out there, you can take trips with groups and see the world! Venture Road is my recommendation. It is through these adventures that you will start to feel like a true global citizen. Do not think of these adventures as sheer vacations. Think of them as a cultural immersion and learning experience you could not get elsewhere. International experiences can range from group travel to actually staying with a host family. This of course offers many possibilities. If you really want to get involved, try volunteering in another country!

The professional world slowly adopted “additive Manufacturing” Next we come to the expiration of the FDM process. Since FDM is the most “consumer” friendly tech, the maker movement started to take hold with the very first machines, and these adopted the term 3D printer. It is still an additive manufacturing process, but what was once a point of entry that cost more than 99% of the cars available, it wasn’t consumer friendly. The maker movement brought additive manufacturing to the home workshop and office. Today 3D printing is what most of the population know of. Additive manufacturing is what you hear if you work with these technologies on a professional level. But at the end of the day, it’s all the same thing.

Johnson mentioned, the lower middle class will be the one that will be affected due to offshore manufacturing. My discussion will be around this set. My dad has a manufacturing firm in India. We used to employ more than 1000 workers until 2009-10. After that we downsized our operations because imports were cheaper. Currently we shut it down because the math is no longer working out and we are producing at a loss. We are the main source of livelihood to the surrounding 5-10 villages. Since i belong to a mini-society which can be taken as a sample of a larger one, i shall answer the question from my perspective. What happens to the lower middle class? This class belongs to a group of workers who might be aged between 20-50. They work all their lives inside a mill or factory acquiring at the most 1 or 2 skills. If their company gets shut down, a guy aged 20-30 might be able to find and apply himself in a new job. But a person between 40-50 may not be able to do it because their best time was already behind them. Overall there will be a shift of workers from villages to towns and cities in search of job. In a village, these workers can live self sufficiently - they get affordable housing and food, and live their life in their own level of comfortability. Once they shift to a city, they will no longer have their comforts, their living standards get worse and what they earn may not be sufficient for their living. What affect does this have on the society? As someone mentioned, with all these changes, the lower middle class will shrink. But in which direction does it flow? It flows downward. Meaning lower middle class now becomes poverty class. With all these shifts, an uncertainty is cast on the future of the children of such class. There is a chance that a generation of them will lose their future. Why should we care? There was an answer which says words similar to ""lets not complain but move along"". In my opinion we should be more compassionate than that. I know that things like these are beyond my control. But i have listened to and seen the pain and suffering of my workers who are with us since the 90's. I am in my late 20's and i am more than confident that considering my education and work experience in a different country, i can start a new business(imports/exports etc). But same cannot be said about the 500-1000 workers who are now out of work. If my mill affected 5-10 villages, how many villages would 1000 mills affect? The least we could do is voice our concerns and depict their hardships on a wider forum. As Thomas L. Johnson mentioned, the lower middle class will be the one that will be affected due to offshore manufacturing. My discussion will be around this set. My dad has a manufacturing firm in India. We used to employ more than 1000 workers until 2009-10. After that we downsized our operations because imports were cheaper. Currently we shut it down because the math is no longer working out and we are producing at a loss. We are the main source of livelihood to the surrounding 5-10 villages.

Getting started in 3D printing can be daunting, but it can be easier than you might think. Of course, like any skill, mastering it will take more time. Steps to start printing: From my experience, and others in this industry I speak with, here are some suggestions to getting started. Buy a cheap, simple to use printer: I recommend one most or fully assembled unless you like to build your own and learn that way. A material extrusion printer (FDM or FFF) using PLA plastic for the print material is the easiest and PLA doesn’t emit any toxic fumes while printing.Idea: download a design from the internet like thingiverse or myminifactory that you don’t need any design knowledge to print. Or design your own through free software like FreeCAD, TinkerCAD or Fusion360 is free for students and home use.Design: start creating. Design simple ones at first to test the printer out and see what works and what doesn’t.Convert for printing: most printers come with software set up for the specific printer. Save the design as .STL file, upload to the printer software or other specialised software if you prefer.Slice: again, printer software usually can do this now. A 3D printed part is printed layer by layer. The software converts the .STL model into layers so the printer can understand what to printPrint: send to the printer and print your awesome design.By understanding the limitations of your printer, you can print almost anything, your imagination is the limit. Learning about 3D printing: there are plenty of ways to learn about 3D printing. You will first need to decide the use: do you want to do it as a hobby, become a professional designer and sell parts or use it for industrial use. If it is for industrial use with existing manufacturing techniques such as forming, machining and fabrication, speak to existing manufacturing companies and connect with them as much as you can. For hobbyist or designers, learn the fundamentals first. Watch Youtube vidoes, look at manufacturer websites or enrol in courses to learn the basics, tips and tricks. For a beginner, the learning process can be slow and frustrating if you don’t have peers to discuss your trials and tribulations with. Join a discussion group or local design group. In summary: 3D printing is fun and it is exciting to see your designs come to life. It can also be daunting and frustrating. The best way to get involved is to have a go. Buy a cheap printer, or borrow someones to start with if you can’t afford it. Download some proven designs or create your own and get printing. Enrol in an introductory course and connect with others in the field. It is a very rewarding wathing your creative ideas print into something you can hold on to.

Simulation has numerous advantages to engineers. A manufacturer/ engineer can understand the product behavior and life cycle as early as before even building a prototype. what else does a core company wants. hence all the core companies are adapting simulation. in fact all the tech giants like. Siemens, Bosch, GE etc have adopted simulation a decade ago. and the indian companies like TATA, Mahindra, etc.. have employed Simulation few years. Simulation solves problems, saves time and money, Improves product & product development process. Simulation has also proved its importance in the field of bio mechanics, medicine, pharmaceuticals, Aerospace, Automobile, Energy, consumer goods... and every industry. Industry giants like Lockheed martin, Boeing, AREVA, Technip, ABB, Daimler, P&G..etc are relying on simulation. And we have research results from Technavio and Reuters that The compound aggregate growth ratio(CAGR) in CAE/Simulation industry is around 12%.

We might see commercial uses for BCI by the end of next decade e.g. communication, vision etc.Electric Vehicles - With solar power and other renewable sources of energy becoming much cheaper than conventional energy and becoming increasingly accessible; startups in EV sector are destined to grow.Artificial Intelligence - With easy access to computation and data, there will be number of startups providing solutions to problems with AI; which traditionally required extensive human capital.Computation for Machine Learning - A major limiting factor in current machine learning practices are expensive compute hardware required to train the models. Newer edge computing devices which not only helps in inference, but also in training will be available from startups in the next decade.Computer Networking - With 5G & Satellite Constellations providing low latency Internet to remote corners of the world; startups offering new services which weren’t possible due to latency issues in the past such as remote gaming, remote robotics etc. would enter the scene.Faux Meat - Alternatives to meat, such as plant based meat or lab grown meat which retains the flavour & nutrition of meat would address the ethical implications of killing animals for food and also decrease methane emissions from livestock.Wealth Inequality - With rising wealth inequality (1% of the world has 50% of world’s wealth), unemployment due to economic slowdowns and automation; there will be degradation of lifestyle quality and increasing law&order situations incl. but not limited to terrorism. Startups working to address wealth and other inequalities would rise.Climate Change - This is the most important problem, the reason why I included at the end is because it has a role to play in all the other problems discussed earlier. Due to the economic impact of climate change, governments would incentivise startups to work in this area.With Global heating, there will be rise in cancers among other diseases increasing the healthcare expenditures world over.With irregular monsoons, there will be shortage of fresh water supply around the world.Irregular monsoons would force drastic changes in the agricultural practices which could further affect the decreasing soil health.Increasing livestock to feed growing human population is increasing the methane (greenhouse gas) release into the atmosphere.Alternatives for plastics and other hazardous materials are a need of the hour.Post COVID-19 Reality I wrote the above (OCT 2019) before the new COVID-19 reality, I would have loved to be wrong; but looks like Healthcare did turn out to be the most important trend for this decade, although I didn’t expect it to be instigated by a pandemic. Here are some other trends which has accelerated due to our new reality, • Medical Equipment Manufacturing - The reliance of Governments on few manufacturers and certain countries for critical medical gear has caught them off-guard during this pandemic. Local manufacturing of the medical equipments have already started in several countries, many involving their startup ecosystem. The need gap for cost-effective, scalable medical equipment manufacturing is clearer than ever. • Pharmaceuticals - As with Medical Equipments, the dependence of the Governments on pharmaceutical products, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), Vaccines from certain manufacturers and countries has created dire consequences. This has created a need gap for startups to enter Pharma industry which was soon becoming an oligopoly, coupled with lesser compliances and faster approvals for the pharmaceutical products in the future. • Enabling Remote Work - This could anything from video conferencing tools, cloud tools, to startups which provide infrastructure for Working From Home, strengthen home network security and everything in-between. • Enabling UBI - COVID-19 pandemic has clearly shown the need for Universal Basic Income, few countries have already started the process of exploring the ways to implement UBI for safeguarding their citizens. Fin-tech Startups which enable UBI implementation measures will be employed to solve several problems in this area. Edit : Typo with exist.

The companies should analyze their supply chain very thorough to choose if they want to invest in their own 3D printers and software or order these services from external service providers. Not enough expertise Lack of knowledge about design for AM presents a key barrier for many companies, followed along with a limited understanding of production processes, which is an additional hurdle. Effective integration of AM requires special qualifications of engineers or reskilling the experts. There are still not that many niche experts to properly implement 3D printing in the global market. The gap between manufacturer demand and highly-skilled engineers still prevents implementing 3DP while the limited in-house capability of design for AM, and lack of knowledge of production processes are also inhibiting. Few Quality Assurance regulations While AM industry is on its early stage there are still no clear solutions to Quality Control, and no settled standards in the niches of CNC production and 3D printing. That’s why even experts cannot, at times, create a 3D printed product that would be superior in terms of quality to a solution produced via standard technological means. If manufacturers provide a 3D model to print on their own, it is non-obvious to guarantee quality in the manufacturing process.

They also bought out Makerbot which was the largest manufacturer of desktop manufacturing units. This stock had started trading way back in 1994 for about 1.5$, the 3D printing hype reached its peak in 2014 and the stock was valued about 140$. The bubble around 3D printing burst and the stock price dropped the following year and is now pretty stable at about 16.8$. Currently there are numerous FDM based 3D printers and the numbers will only increase, Polyjet on the other had is an amazing technology that is still under patents and If Stratasys is able to get the right product out then this can be a game changer for them.  3D systems: Charles Hull the founder of 3D systems was the inventor of the first 3D printing technology and is also known as the Father of 3D printing. His company that deals with Stereolithography based 3D printing, patents for this technology is now open to the world. Like the story of Stratasys , 3D systems stock shot up during the hype and crashed again when the bubble burst.  Although Stereolithography technology has been opened up,3D systems have a whole host of innovations such as Geomagix 3D modelling software and haptic feedback stylus which are considered as the industry best. If I had the money this would definitely be a stock I would like to buy but only in small quantities. Companies like Carbon3D have dominated the Sterelithography field with improved technology and faster 3D printing. Autodesk: Autodesk is a software giant that creates manufacturing/Design related software. Some of their famous products would be AutoCAD, Fusion360, Inventor, Netfabb, Meshmixer TinkerCAD etc. Their suite of software's have been getting a lot of attention lately and have partnered with many top 3D printing firms to develop proprietary solutions. This is one stock that has been growing steadily over the years and an opportunity I missed in 2014 when I was planning to get into 3D printing investments.  Their subscription system of licensing has gained them a lot of customers, they have also targeted many user groups such as hobbyists, small business and schools. This has helped in spreading their name and improving their brand awareness. Conclusion With the markets going down due to the pandemic many companies will cut their R&D budget meaning fewer 3D printers might be sold worldwide, this could potentially have an effect on stocks as well, Stratasys has closed Q4 at a low and blames the Covid crisis as a reason for low sales. There is a great article from a company called digital alloys that analyses how the 3D printing market will be going forward. To answer your question, yes its a good time invest. The question that I cannot answer is where would you invest ? Edit 1: 24 June 2020 As of today Autodesk has done really well for itself and is currently trading at 233$ and gained close to 50$ per share while 3D Systems and Stratasys have pretty much remained the same.  Many companies are seeing the need to get into 3D printing due to supply chain issues during the lockdown. This could benefit machine manufacturers in some way over the coming years.

Though I loved coding and taking part in programming competitions. Decided to stop doing programming for competition but for my own satisfaction and enjoyment. (One of the best decision of my life) First week of February , talked to someone whom I loved(unrequited love) after a long time, it was a long talk only to realize it later it was a damn mistake. First week of March, coordinated National level competition successfully first time and began a custom in my college since then. Also proposed the person I was in love with (not accepted, knew before hand though). Since then began my darkest time of my life.Also, had the worst birthday of my life. April and may went in complete darkness (complete helplessness and hopelessness). Passed my endsem exams marginally. In the end of may, I got a call for internship in a good company. Totally unexpected. I had my placements in coming August and I had prepared nothing. Took a risk and left for internship to Bangalore thinking that I would prepare in spare time during my intern (which I didn’t). Left within 5 days of call. In June went on to a trek to a forest reserve 200 km away from Bangalore, never seen something more beautiful and scenic. It was heaven, believe me. One of the best experiences of my life. July, my second month of Intern, again had a talk with her. Typed the longest message of my life to make things better which went in vain (again). Returned back to home city, in August beginning. Started out of my preparation for placements. Worked hard for initial first month but later could focus. Just kept on doing minimal on regular basis but not enough to get placed in a good company. I couldn’t focus because of obvious reasons (the girl). On October 26, I got placed in the first company that visited our college. Its the best company that visits our college (it was a miracle again) Since then I have been sleeping. Took break from studies till the end of 2017. Thus to summarize, 2017 has been the most roughest year of my life. Probably I wont even want to remember it. Things learn’t - 1 - Happiness is nothing unless shared.(I got placed but couldn’t enjoy, it was a good one though) 2- You don’t need to burn yourself to keep others warm. 3- The people I cared the most, never helped me during this time.So, I limited my contacts. Probably this is the best thing that happened. I got to know the real them. 4- Unplanned things are the best because it rules out the possibility of expectations which is the reason for pain. Left out lot of other stuff though. Thus, a lot can happen in a year not necessarily good not necessarily bad. It might be the most boring answer and is poorly knitted. But I guess I had to write it. :) I hope you are not looking for an inspiration in the answer relating to this question.

One Year??Not really. It was just in one second. Coming to something that changed my life. I am an Engineer. During my B.Tech, I got backlog in a subject. I tried a lot clear it, till the last semester but I was not having any luck to read - PASS under my backlog result. So, again, after one year, I appeared for that subject exam with full preparation that, even if the university will set a difficult paper, I will clear that. With that preparation and confidence I sat on my bench. The question paper came. I read the full question paper and on the last page (rough papge of my answer sheet) I just note down the options that I am going to write these answers out of the given options. I also note down the formulas for each answer in the rough space (as it was Mathematics paper). By the time I started writing, 15 minutes were spent and now I was having 2 hours 45 minutes with me and I was quite confident that I will finish up the exam at least on time realizing the speed at which I write and 80% of the answers were in my mind. I started writing with my high speed and finished the answer paper up to the last page (I got those page filled unintentionally, by writing precised answers). I checked the time. I was still having half an hour remaining with me. I checked my paper twice, corrected a couple of errors and then submitted the paper. I was in a good mood as the subject was going to leave me forever. Now, I was waiting for result. The D day was there then. I was fully confident and was eager to see the marks I have scored and not whether I have passed it or not. I opened the university page - results - typed my registration number - dhooop!! FAIL. I was like what the hell. If I cannot clear with this quality of paper then I will never be able to do it again and one more year will be wasted. I just failed short of 2 marks. Who the hell the checker was?“When your luck is not there, even if you write as it is from a book, you may not pass”. Chances are there. And the same happened with me. Even after the setback, I was confident that something has been wrong and then decided to apply for RTI and Rechecking of the paper. I was quite sure that I will clear it and said the same to my parents. As I was having a goal to go for masters, I started finding some good course to get in. I contacted a couple of univeristy to get in to it. But, who gives admission to the person who has one backlog even after the result has been declared? No one. And the same response I received from all the organizations. There was one odd out in it. When I contacted him and explained him my condition. He went to the director that whether to admit him or not. After a week I received a reponse that, Yes. you can get the admission conditionally. The condition was, I should submit my provisional degree certificate before the 1st semester exam which normally take place in mid December. If I fail to submit it or I donot clear the subject, I will have to leave and the fees that I have paid will not be refunded. I worked on the conditions and discussed with the parents that this univeristy is giving conditional admission and explained them the conditions. After all, we decided to move forward with the admission. I went there along with my dad and applied there. Paid 1 lac Rs. Yes, 1 lac Rs. (50K tution fees + 50K hostel) in spite of knowing the condition. But, my confidence was something that kept me pushing to apply and study. Move ahead. I did it. After some days, the classes started, I joint on the very first day and had all new people in my life. By face, I was a happy guy but inside I was worrying when the result will be declared after recheking the paper and what will be the result. By the time, it was Diwali. I was having a week of holiday. I came to my home. 4 hours before reaching home, I checked that, whether they have declared the result or not. But nothing was there. I came home, after a bath, we were together for lunch. I ate and was sitting simply. Now read the below conversation. Dad - The result has been declared. (He said, as he knew the website and all) I - No. (Thinking that, he is asking me and not informing me) Dad - No. I mean, the result has been declared. I - Have you checked it? I checked just before 5 hours, nothing was there. Dad - No, I haven’t checked it. I just read that it has been declared when I came to pick you up at railway station. I - I am not going to check it. You check. My confidence was gone and I thought, I will have to go to university and take my all luggage and return back to home. Dad - OK, I am checking it. He was cool and was having confidence on me. He opened the page, typed registration number - Enter Dad- PASS!! (This 1 second) I - Don’t joke Dad. At least first let it open. I have no belief in my university. Dad - Really. Pass. You can see by yourself then. I had no words after seeing that. “I can’t laugh, I can’t cry” type situation. I can just be thankful. They saved my 1 year. They saved my dad’s investment of more than 1 lac Rs. And in addition to that, I will receive my Master’s degree in one and half year. That was the day we fully enjoyed and I slept perfectly on that night. Though the Diwali was after 3 days, but for us, that day was Diwalo for us because I conquered my that subject on that day. :) That 1 second and 1 word saved my 1 year and gave me a lot.

Three topics appear crucial to reduce the cost of your prototype: Keep as much as possible standard parts in your designOptimize your designChoose the right MaterialsReduce Size and Volume of materialsIf you 3D Print, lattice as much as possibleCalculate regularly the cost during the conception phases and compare several manufacturing partnersSOLIDWORKS launched on February three interesting new free features to improve what we call the ‘Design to cost’. You can find those features in a unique add-in 3DEXPERIENCE Marketplace inside SOLIDWORKS, and you access simply with your SOLIDWORKS ID.[1] 1/ Keep as much as possible standard parts in your design  Using standard parts will always be much cheaper than manufacture your custom components. 3DEXPERIENCE PartSupply is a library of 40 million sourceable standard parts from more than 800 different suppliers. You can navigate into various categories, classified eCl@ss or I.C.S, such as Electrical, Mechanical, Manufacturing … and download it directly in your software in one click.[2]  One interesting function for our topic is you can compare your design with the full catalogue to find a similar standard part and avoid the creation of an expensive one.  2/ Regularly calculate the cost during the conception phases and compare several manufacturing partners.  3DEXPERIENCE Make is basically an On-Demand Manufacturing platform with more than 200 service providers available across Europe and the United States such as ProtoLabs, Xometry or Sculpteo.[3] They supply different production processes from 3D Printing, CNC Machining, Molding, Cutting to Forming. You request quote simply within SOLIDWORKS to multiple manufacturing companies, then compare their offers easily, or look at the ‘Instant Quote’ engine to get up to 25 proposals in one second. The solution provides a chat to communicate directly with them about the project, and a secured payment by Card or Purchase order. In this context, you can use the Instant Quote as a guide to improve your design. When you let the add-in open in SOLIDWORKS, a live update of the price happens at each modification of your design. See below how it works.  3/ Optimize your design Choose the right MaterialsMaterial represents an important part of the cost for your design. For example, if you want to create an affordable good, do not make it in titanium. You also have to be careful of the usage of your product. ABS seems cheap, but could remain useless for very hot temperature. Reduce Size and Volume of materials.The more your part stands large and dense, the more you need quantity of materials and the less you would find machines to make it. Consequence, price would be higher. Optimize your design appears a key pillar of a cost-efficient prototype. We call it ‘Topology optimization’. Specialised software could adapt your design automatically considering the materials, the manufacturing method but also the usage (resistance, temperature, etc.). For example, GDE by Dassault Systèmes propose, after a specification phase, various optimized designs per process.[4]  If you 3D Print your part use lattice as much as possibleFor 3D Printing, lattice appears a great method to reduce the cost of your prototype, in changing dense area by a structure of little empty triangles.[5] Only 3D Printers could today handle this method. Advantage is the lightweight arrangements and high strength balance, that means less volume and less material to use, for the same result. You can find multiple software or add-in for SOLIDWORKS to help you on ‘lattice’.  But if you are looking for qualified help on your prototype and its design, 3DEXPERIENCE Engineering is an On-Demand Engineering service providers available in the add-in 3DEXPERIENCE Marketplaces in SOLIDWORKS. It allows you to pitch your project to up to 50 Engineering services companies. It covers all industries and engineering skills like 3D Design, topology improvement, production optimization etc. At the end, you choose in several clicks the best offer.

In the end, if you are really interested in 3D printing, then I would definitely suggest you to get a 3D printer of your own! Better still, to order a 3D printer kit and assemble it yourself! You can do all the courses you want, but only after you get your “hands dirty” by actually playing with the 3D printer, that you will really learn about 3D printing. Hope this helps. Good luck!

One example connecting these disciplines, that comes to mind, is related to IKEA. You would not be surprised to know that there are mathematical 3d graphical design models of their products that are constructed by software. Since 3D printing is not affordable for mass production yet, IKEA produces 3D printed models for internal discussions and also for their vendors. At the same time, these 3d graphical models are used to produce their product catalog and also for their AR application that allows customers to try out the fit of their furniture before the customer orders physical delivery. On the industrial application stage, there is PTC which has acquired AR company Vuforia Augmented Reality (AR) for the Enterprise | PTC as well as 3D print capability company Thingworx PTC integrates ANSYS simulation into ThingWorx IoT platform .

Ceramic 3D Printing: Terms You Need To Know Before we start, here are some terms you need to know when talking about ceramic 3D printing: Green object: the clay object that still needs to be sintered (or fired up) in a kiln.Sintering: the process of partially melting clay particles to obtain a hard ceramics object.Kiln: the oven used for the post processing (sintering) of the green object.Binder Jetting: the 3D printing technology that works by gluing together powder particles to form the object’s slices.Paste extrusion deposition: the 3D printing process. It’s similar to fused filament deposition, where a paste material is extruded to form a green object.Clay: a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter.Ceramic: an inorganic, nonmetallic solid material comprising metal, nonmetal or metalloid atoms. It is usually made from clay sintered in a kiln.Porcelain: is a material made by heating materials, generally including kaolin, in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 and 1,400 °C (2,200 and 2,600 °F).

A house is a very complex assembly of a large variety of materials with a lot of exacting details needed in the assembly for it to perform well. 3D printing is not suitable for printing a house as a complete object. The concrete 3D printing that is currently under development is capable of producing portions of a house’s exterior shell. These are not materially superior to other methods for constructing the shell. But a variety of interesting shapes can be easily reproduced. Very few residential houses these days are being made out of cast concrete. For very good reasons. There are specialty buildings for which this is a suitable method of construction. But for most climates and weather conditions in the US, for houses, it is not optimal. Too expensive. 3d printing might someday be cost competitive with concrete block construction, but in a temperate maritime climate, where I work, in my experience this is an undesirable method of construction. Weaknesses or defects in the resulting material laid down by the printing process is going to be a materials science related question, and will depend on future developments. Not having steel reinforcing in the walls is the first thing that comes to mind. A suitable composite concrete mix with decent tensile strength can probably be devised, but would not be cheap. Concrete materials generally absorb moisture and retain it, and dry toward the warm side, which means in a wet, cool environment, moisture will be driven toward the inside of the building. In an earthquake zone, cementitious buildings are not great because they are low in tensile strength and heavy, so while they resist high winds nicely, they crack and fail when you start shaking them. The main virtue of 3D printing as a process is that it is digitally controlled and can produce a variety of shapes without significant knowledge or crafting skills. And an object can be accurately repeated once the digital design is complete. These virtues do not translate well to home construction. Unless you want lots of curves. To optimize your investment in the machinery used to print the house, you are going to gravitate toward “egginess” in your shapes, so that the house shell contributes as much strength to the structure as possible. So far, no “whole house” manufacturing process translates well to home construction. The demands of fitting the house to the site, and of combining a large variety of materials and systems into the structure works against the strength of manufacturing, which is mass production. There is a huge variety of construction methods and details in different regions of the US alone. These details are adapted to the local climate and weather extremes, the local availability of materials, and local economic considerations. And this variety is there because it optimizes cost vs performance. And the unspoken elephant in the room is the overwhelming efficiency of our raw materials production and delivery processes. Delivering the materials to a factory, building the house, then transporting it to a job site is not a win. It is better to deliver the materials to the site. Site production methods stay as close to factory-like processes as they can, and the ability to optimize production on site is evolving rapidly. Moving a large machine to the job site, for a one-off house, is probably not great. The site will need to be specially prepared to accommodate the machine. In many cases this will not be simple or cheap. It is questionable whether preparing the site, and transporting and setting up the machine there, is going to be more efficient than bringing in the workers and bulk materials needed to produce the house shell. The understanding of how to build houses is progressing rapidly. The level of skill is increasing, as is the technical understanding regarding suitable details and materials. The dream is reducing the costs of skilled labor through automation, in order to bring the cost of a house down. Perhaps someday we will have robots that can be programmed to site build a house without human oversight, but a prerequisite to this is that detailed understanding which only comes from actually building houses, and which is always going to be specific to the locality of the building, and which is probably evolving faster than the robot designers and programmers could keep up with. One size fits all cookie cutter approaches to construction are probably always going to exclude themselves from consideration due to excessive cost and lack of adaptability. But 3D printing may earn its place, in some localities, for some portions of a house. Maybe. If it can evolve fast enough. I am not sure how to answer this.

It will remain for at least the next 5-10 years that 3D printing has the most worth as a professional prototyping and short-run-low-volume production tool for industries which previously had to rely on less efficient methods. Buying a 3D printer is only worth it if you know exactly what you are going to do with it and can justify all the associated costs that come with it. You will be spending money on the printer and consumables, and devoting a lot of time (and frustration) to experiment with the system's limitations and to post-process prints. This of course assumes that the average person, in the first place, has reasonable expectations of what one can print (and wants to print) with the 3D printer. It's like the difference between buying an electric toothbrush or power saw as a present for a grandmother: both might bear some novelty at the beginning, but I'm pretty sure grandmothers would find much more value using/learning about the $80 toothbrush vs the $300 saw. Like power saws, 3D printers for now supply too little value and demand too much from users to make them worth it to the average person. This is not to say that they aren't highly capable tools in the right hands. P.s. Sorry for not replying earlier, I'm new to Quora and didn't know much about this A2A feature.

My first laser was really intuitive… for people with a CAD/CAM background. The learning curve felt more like a cliff and nothing really seemed intuitive to my 3D artist / digital painter self. 3D printing was easier. The thing is, I got that first laser a year ago. About six months later, I hadn't successfully made a damn thing, I'd called tech support a bunch and I learned how to calibrate a laser with an allen wrench adjusting each mirror by hand… and forget dealing with the clunky software… it just wasn't happening. I've been working at Glowforge for six months and I make things at least once a week. Yesterday I was writing a document that I needed a screen shot for so I made a quick wallet… like it was nothing. (And really it was nothing, it took 5 minutes and that included walking to the supply closet for a piece of leather, it was about 40 seconds on the laser.) Getting from A to B didn't take long, it just took being willing to make a lot of mistakes. The hardest skill, for developing my own designs, wasn't about becomming an expert in Illustrator… it was learning how to prototype. My first table design failed pretty badly, and even the 3rd (4th? 5th?) revisionwas prone to tipping over… but that's okay. It's important to give ourselved permission to fail while we learn. This was last night's prototype for a gussetted bag:  That's a fail. The gussets don't actually fit, the tongue isn't near long enough…. Fail. So, I could call it a waste of $30 worth of leather and try again… but, I have a really precise tool for cutting things so today's fail…  Is tomorrow's bracelet.

I've had a 3D printer for a couple of months now (rostock max) and it requires a bit of know how to operate.  Here are some reasons why ""not too soon"" is essentially my answer:  CALIBRATION     There are hundreds of parameters that affect print quality and success.  Some of these include: temperature, type and color of material, print surface leveling, consistency in diameter of filament, slicing software settings (which may be different for each object printed), nozzle diameter, flow rates for melted filament, stepper motor calibration, and bed adhesion (does the part stick to the bed or not) just to name a few. I tend to be fairly techy and my head has been spinning trying to learn all of these things and how they apply to my prints.    COST AND PRACTICALITY     There are some 3D printers out there that will just accept a print command and do what they need to do...If you have $2500 to $20000+ to spend on one.  I don't think Johnny is going to make the investment right now just to print gnome toys for his kids.        Some other posters have mentioned 3D modeling.  There are loads of models available on various websites for download. But, many are just novel items like the gnome toys mentioned above.  The greatest utility for the technology, in my opinion, is that it is a way to develop one's own solutions and innovations.  To make the most of this, 3D modeling skills are essential.        A consumer technology by it's nature tends to require minimal input from the end user.  How practical would Wi-Fi be if the end user had to manually lookup and enter the IP address of the network adapter, router, and server location every time they wished to visit a website? TIME AND COST     3D printing right now is incredibly slooowwww.  Which makes it expensive even if someone else prints your models for you.  The picture shows a part on the left I designed to replace the part on the right.  It is only 39mm wide and took 46min to print not including the time waiting for the print bed and extruder to heat to project temperature...at the rate of 1 euro per min that's a 46 euro ($62.23) plastic replacement foot for a chair...hardly worth it.    If you are prototyping something that will be put into production then the cost is actually very low. But the average ""push-a-button-for-the-magic"" consumer is probably not prototyping for production. ....      There is much hype around 3D printing right now, and it's well justified.  Here is a replacement part that I designed and printed to fix a garbage can, saving myself the trouble of having to purchase a new one.        I wanted to give my answer from a realistic perspective.  3D printing has been loads of fun for me since I'm learning new skills and testing my own abilities at design and function.

DP is, in short, possible because of the advent of personal computers and printers and the range of software readily available such as desktop publishing, which most businesses and households now can have easy access to. Digital printing is increasingly responsible for the creation of very sharp, clear images and text which is essential for the production professional quality documents. One of the ways this clarity of imagery is achieved by the DP process is via the four colour process. This methodology is where four colour separations (magenta, cyan, black and yellow often referred to as the CMYK process) are used to develop a crisp, multi-coloured item. These colours are printed onto the paper as a series of tiny dots which make up the 'blocks' of tint. These colour combinations digitally processed and printed are capable of constructing literally millions of colour shades and tones, enabling the digital printing process to capture true picture. Printers used for the digital imaging process with the CMYK capabilities are vital in order to generate the items required and to replicate the colour intensity needed. When digital was in its infancy, there were many unfavourable comparisons to lithographic printing in terms of quality. However, recent developments have ensured that digital printing quality is now comparable to other, more traditional techniques and in many cases, exceed them in quality and versatility. More complex images are also able to be constructed and the use of photographs, for instance, is becoming more commonly used in digital printing to create bespoke business information. When an image is created on a computer, it is saved into a digital file which converts the piece of work into a digital format. When this file is forwarded to the printer for reproduction, the digitisation process ensures that the printed edges of an image are clear and sharp. Printers used for digital printing can either be an inkjet printer or a laserjet variety. These different types of printers are essential to digital printing and should be chosen carefully. For example, laserjet printers generally print much quicker than their inkjet counterparts but longer-term, inkjet printers are often cheaper to run than laserjets. Laserjet digital printers use small 'jets' of ink, which are bonded to statically charged paper with heat, whilst inkjet printers utilise sprays of ink on the micrometre scale onto the paper or fabric. Digital printing is a very efficient way of printing a range of documents, and is often a much more affordable way of bulk, printing. Using equipment such as a digital camera, a basic scanner and an image manipulation package, digital printing allows the user to create bespoke and high quality items. Each of these tools offers an unprecedented level of sophistication and versatility when it comes to realising your ideas. The author has worked in the print industry for over 30 years.

In conventional manufacturing, designers created designs within limits of manufacturing technology, manufacturers then produced these designs. Like what Apple does with all its products. Apple designs and Foxconn manufactures. So you had two sets of businesses producing the end product. 3D printing pretty much kills the second business. India isn't known for its design work, even in IT. The designs are done in the US and Europe and then passed on to India. Compare indigenously designed Indian products and other products by US or European companies and well they're in a different league.

It is a takeaway outlet that provides no dine in facility. They function as a production unit with a space for the preparation of food. The food can be ordered online or takeaway facility is also available. Some of the benefits of such a business include • Low Cost: Since no dine in facility is provided, many costs are saved like : Space Waiter services Utensils etc • Easy expansion : Expansion is easy by just collaborating with uber eats, Swiggy, Zomato etc or make your own app to take orders and hire more cooks, unlike in normal restaurants where more space has to be created to accommodate more people and hence higher cost of expansion. Disadvantages • No personal touch : Since the food gets delivered home directly, there is no personal touch of the customer with the cloud kitchen, unlike in restaurants where customer is physically present in the restaurant , enjoying the food as well the ambience of the place. • Limited audience : Only people well versed with technology are expected to use these services. Here is the model which states how to allocate funds. A place has to be taken on rent for kitchen, billing space etc If we are opening it in Kamla Nagar market, Delhi , we have to assume a rent of 20000 per month. Let us take for 5 months revenue is not enough to cover the cost hence expenses have to be borne out of initial capital. So total expense on rent will be 100000. Equipment for kitchen have to be bought costing 250000. This is a one time cost. License Cost : Following four licenses have to be purchased FSSAI , GST, Fire safety and MCD trade license. Let us assume the total cost of these licenses to be 25000. Initially we will hire 2 people for work. One at 20000 per month and the other at 15000. Taking it for 5 months we get it as 175000. Before expansion , since in our model we have hired only 2 people, we will not be able to offer variety. Billing Software costing 15000 for preparing computerised bills. Working Capital of 50000 for buying raw materials and other stuff. Marketing : Considering the presence of so many competitors, we have to spend on marketing also. It will be done mainly through banners displaying heavy discounts. Assume cost of marketing to be 100000. Along with discounts we can also claim 30 min delivery for 7-8 km delivery range. If not delivered within 30 mins, discount on food up to Rs 150 Free delivery for orders of 200 or more. And just Rs 10 delivery charge for orders less than Rs 200. Item Expenses (in INR) Rent 100000 Equipment 250000 License Cost 25000 Staff 175000 Billing Software 15000 Working Capital 50000 Marketing 100000 Total 715000 Still we are left with 285000 which we will keep for contingencies. We have left the expenses for delivery as initially we will collaborate with Uber eats, Swiggy and Zomato. Later as business expands we can hire people for delivery. These are initial expenses which will occur until the business is established. After the business starts running smoothly, revenue will overtake the cost. (After a 5 month period) Following would be the monthly costs (Expansion of business is ignored for now) Item Expenses (in INR) Rent 20000 Staff 35000 Working Capital 10000 Marketing 5000 Total 70000 Assuming a revenue of 6000 per day (If food joint is open for 12 hrs, revenue of 500 per hour (average) which is obviously an underestimation, but prudent), we will earn a revenue of 180000 per month (Assuming we remain on Sundays and Holidays also). Hence we would earn a profit of Rs 110000. So even if we assume that some of the costs may rise after 5 months, we will still earn a minimum profit of 100000 per month, hence covering our initial capital in one month profit. This is the monthly expected profit just with one kitchen, earned after 5 months with NO EXPANSION. Once our business grows, we can re-invest our own profit for expansion in other areas like Gurgaon and Noida. This will increase our customers and delivery range. The main focus is to maintain the quality as well as taste of food in order to retain the customers. For expansion, we can also hire a big kitchen and open small kitchens in it for different varieties like Chinese, North Indian etc.",2021-03-07T00:38:00.351Z,"What business should I start? ",Quora

Let's take a look at the issue here. There are actually three reasons a printed gun might be scary - it's purported undetectability, it's ease of acquisition, and it's functionality. Let's start with undetectability. The scanners used by DHS will actually pick up the plastics most often used and highlight the shape so DHS personnel know what to look for and where in your baggage to look. In addition, the plastics used do not have the strength or durability to actually function as springs and firing pins so there will always be some metal to detect for these items (as well as any cartridges). So in reality there is nothing to fear from printed guns in the detectability department. The second scary issue is the ease of acquisition. The fear that anyone can buy (or maybe steal) a printer and start cranking out unregistered guns is one that sets beaurocrats and gun-control types into a tizzy. But the ease with which a gun can be fabricated with supplies bought from your local hardware store (think zip gun) makes this a non-issue as you can already make your own functioning firearm without needing an expensive printer. And for those who want to do it right, the BATFe actually allows an individual the make their own high quality firearms and there are plenty of kits to help accomplish that - legally. The final scary issue is one of functionality. Do you know how most additive printers work? As a rule they heat a thermoplastic material and extrude it in layers fusing the current layer to the previous one as needed to build your item. Note: thermoplastic and heat fused. Now, what do we know about ""fire""arms? They fire a bullet by ""burning"" a propellant to generate gas ""pressure"" to expel the bullet out of the barrel. Do you see the problem here? We have a gun made by melting layers of plastic together and we are going to set off a fire inside of it which generates high pressures. Talk about a risky thing to do. Who knows - you may get one shot off, but most probably not two, before the plastic is heated enough to burst under the pressures generated. I can think of many easier ways to blow my hand off than by using a printed plastic handgun. So, there you are - three reasons printed guns are ""scary"" and each of them isn't worth worrying over.",2021-03-07T00:38:16.682Z,"Why is a 3D printed gun so scary? ",Quora

There are 30,000 of those dots projected onto your face, and the information from the dots ie. the time it takes for those dots to be transmitted to your face and return to the camera take different lengths of time, Like Sonar on a ship sends a signal out and the time it takes for that signal to return enables mariners to see ALL the varying depths of the ocean. In fact this is exactly how submarines are detected. The big difference today we do not measure these distances using analog data we use digital data and all digital data is purely a series of 1’s or 0’s (Zero). Therefore Apple never recieve an image of anyones face but purely a series of 1’s & zeros, for those that don’t understand digital data It looks something like this; 0000100011101111001011 and so on, this digital information is fed into a secure enclave and even Apple cannot interpret that data. However your phone can determine whether the series of 0’s & 1’s match the series of digits above, In the real world the 1’s and the 0’s would contain far more digits than i have used in my example. It is impossible for logic or digital data to understand anything more than a 1 or a 0 nothing else at all. Samsung's attempt at face ID only used “2D” (two dimensional), by measuring only the width of your mouth and the distance from the top of your lip to the tip of your nose (Width x Height). This system can easily be fooled by a photograph of the subject. A sheet of paper (a photo) can never measure the depth because the image produced is all on the same plane. Whereas Apples Face ID uses 3D data this is why when you set up face ID you have to move your head from side to side as well as moving your head in a circular motion, this allows the dots to be projected onto the side of your face by measuring the width of your mouth and the distance from the tip of your nose to the top of your lip, Width x Height (2D). But Apple’s system adds another elevation Depth (3D). By measuring how far back your ears are set back in relation to the tip of your nose producing a 3D image Width x Height x Depth. (This explanation is in very simplistic terms indeed, but I am trying to get the point accross to those who are not necessarily conversant with digital technology.",2021-03-07T00:38:35.897Z,"Can Apple Face ID be fooled by a photo?

This helps in cost reduction and is mostly used when the requirement is less. Soft Tooling for Rapid Prototyping, Silicone, SLS, SLA Product Development The entire setup would involve high investment costs, you require machinery its power requirements and it's servicing , experts, material cost ,additional costs etc. The cases that I have mentioned here are customised products, the time taken to print is high. To go for manufacturing of 3d printed surfboards is not advisable as of now, it's better to integrate procedures like soft tooling or any other process where you can reduce the time in mold making and use it with existing manufacturing process .

Softer metals can be made through ball milling, which is basically putting the stuff to become powder into a tumbler full of ball bearings and rotating it until the powder is powdered enough.

If it was ever alive. Criminals have plenty of guns as evidenced by Chicago’s continued failure to control its gun violence despite nearly every gun control measure known to man. Ditto many other Democratically controlled strict gun control cities like Baltimore or Los Angeles. Guns are easy to make. The IRA made its own in Ireland, same with the VC in Vietnam same with criminals in just about every country in the world. Afghanistan and India have small shops that make AKs with hand tools. The Brazilians have made some out of staplers and pieces of pipe for Pete’s sake. In nations with home CNC mills or routers or home 3D printers plus the internet guns can be completely home made to extremely high standards. Going to ban the Internet? Control access to 3D printing? Guns last forever. Pre WW1 guns are still found on battlefields today. Ammo from WW1 still works (though not recommended) broken parts can be replaced or new ones made to keep very old guns going. Parts for an 1873 Trapdoor (the gun used by Custer’s men against the Native Americans in 1876) are available online. Guns pulled from hundreds of feet under the ice in Greenland where they lay for 40 years worked when fired. Military surplus guns have been sold world wide for a century and a half now, probably longer. And as you may have heard they last forever. Ammo is easily made at home with a very simple press. I’ve seen ammo made using just hand tools and the rifle it’s fired in to seat the primer and the bullet. Not optimal but I’d not like to be in front of the gun it’s in just the same. With a $500 press you can make hundreds in an afternoon. Some guys melt old wheel weights and cast their own bullets.

Whereas cars today are made by just a few hundred factories around the world, they might one day be made in every metropolitan area. Parts could be made at dealerships and repair shops, and assembly plants could eliminate the need for supply chain management by making components as needed. Another implication is that goods will be infinitely more customized, because altering them won’t require retooling, only tweaking the instructions in the software. Creativity in meeting individuals’ needs will come to the fore, just as quality control did in the age of rolling out sameness. These first-order implications will cause businesses all along the supply, manufacturing, and retailing chains to rethink their strategies and operations.

If it's a hobby/passion now, and they want to turn it into a profession, they might lose their love for it. Also, if they just for the money, I think they'd be less successful and more discouraged than someone genuinely interested in the technology and its applications. First, I would recommend reading as much as possible on the subject to get educated. I would try to understand the science of it, like chemistry of materials and the mechanics of different construction methods. I would get exposure to, and try to use if possible, a number of different printers and materials. Understand how the printers operate, how the material behaves thru heating & cooling, what conditions are needed to achieve what quality standards, and what end-item applications different printers & materials are used for. Local hobby shops and/or “maker spaces” often have hardware available for use. Another subject I would recommend someone who’s interested in becoming a 3-D printer is product design, realization and slicing software. There are software packages for creative applications, like 3-D printing a dragon statue. There’s also more computer aided drawing (CAD)-like (or actual CAD) software for the more mechanically inclined. Both types of software have different learning curves and applications. A last type of software I would recommend learning is a slicer. Slicers transform model files into types a printer can understand, such as G-code files for printers that operate per numerical control (NC). Then I would recommend the person drill down into one or two different printing methods, materials or applications based on the reason they decided to go in to it. They should try to become an expert in a particular niche. Along with getting more opportunities in their niche as they develop expertise, they'll be positioned to lend specific, relevant input to the development of future methods, materials and applications. Lastly, as the whole technology of additive manufacturing is evolving so rapidly, I would recommend that a person who's interested in becoming a 3-D printer stay agile and open-minded, lest they fail to grow with the change.

The initial excitement of bringing 3d printers home and producing toys and parts for broken gadgets died down amongst the non-hobbyist market simply because for the less gizmo-inclined the time and effort needed to produce one simple part was way too high ! On the other hand hobbyist market was already being driven by smaller open source players like Lulzbot and Printrbot and the rep-rap brigade lead by Prusa research.And open source is free as long as you can source the components and build it.The major players could not make up for sales with their premium prices and generic product USPs because “You cannot compete with free!” (when the output is the same!) Most of the traditional players have returned back to focus on their primary markets: aerospace, automotive and medical industries. They are also pursuing schools and universities since a large chunk of them get government grants to buy and install 3d printers. Remember when the modern lathes and sewing machines came out during the industrial revolution they were great machines that could be used to produce a lot of things.But not everyone needed an expensive mini lathe machine at home.It’s going to be the same for 3d printers!

If you want to make something like the designs on MakerBot Thingiverse you can. Although its seems slow to print an object, the real wonder of it, is that you can design something on your computer and then make it, then revise and perfect it very quickly, compared to model making by hand. It is still a rapid prototyping technology. Its just there has been a lot of hype around the technology, and it is now called 3D printing as this captures the imagination more. Some of its core ideas may lead onto the ability to print a wider range of objects, but its not the Star Trek replicator yet. I recently did all the prototyping for this company Cupper - The first takeaway coffee heater all the demo units you see there were printed by me, but they have been hand finished to a very high standard in order to look that good. When Cupper start making these things and selling them they will be injection moulded probably in China based on the prototypes they designed and I made. For those involved in 3D printing its mainly an enthusiast hobby, where the skill is designing and making a machine, which can make many of its own parts and perfecting the machine to be more accurate and faster. You can make money from 3D printing by printing things for people, as I did for Cupper above. Most things are prototypes, not production units. Some hobbies lend themselves to 3D printing, radio controlled cars/drones, making models such as cars/trains/planes for example can be 3D printed. Its very educational for children, they can help design and make an object, that you could never go and buy, a train track with their name on for example. I also make and sell a sensor system for 3D printers precision-piezo which uses parts that I 3D print, but only because at present its quite small volume, if someone ordered 1000 units I’d have to look at injection moulding, as it would be cheaper and quicker. 3D printing is just the modern name for rapid prototyping, a technology some 30 years old, that used to be exclusive to large engineering companies who could afford the expensive machines that did it.

An essential future skill would be the ability to process and sift-through data and come up with rapid decisions that are unique / different. Not just data analytics but also a level of comfort and ability to read data and intuitively spot patterns. Math, logic, problem solving, programming, etc. are all complementary skills and will be critical for success.  Designing - A lot of focus on the future will be on shifting man-machine interactions and designing completely new interfaces through which we can leverage the power of cloud and AI. Design will be one of the biggest skills in demand.   Story-telling - Yes, you heard that right. With so much information, the din of numbers, logic and marketing-speak will become so loud as to become irrelevant. People with ability to tell compelling, engrossing stories will catch attention and quickly leverage the power of the internet to build a following.  Managing Time - Its gonna get very chaotic. No stability in what you do on a daily basis. Your schedules will always change and your attention will be demanded a million times a day. Ability to manage time and achieve things will become more important than ever.  Science - Not computer science! Hard science. Yes. It will be a key skill in the future. Chemistry, physics and biology will all come centre-stage as we leverage the power of technology to achieve the next level of breakthroughs in these. Therein, lies the next big revolution.

You don't have to be a lawyer, go to a site like legalzoom or rocketlawyer. For example, rocketlawyer will create the document for you: Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Form You don't have to own a company to use this, basically you want something on paper from the manufacturer stating they will not re-sell or share any information or communication with anyone besides you and the manufacturer. I would also suggest that before you get too serious into patents, try to get a working prototype done for as cheap as possible, create some videos on it and try to get a feel for if there is any demand for it. If you've got a 3D printer, absolutely use it as much as possible. Get as much feedback as early as you can. When you do talk to people, you may decide to go in an entirely different direction which can save you a lot of time and money. Make sure you keep good documentation on the entire process from early designs to prototypes. That really is important, almost more so than having an empty patent before you've even got started. Lastly, if you're serious about selling it you should start thinking about how your customers are going to buy it and what your role is going to be in the whole process. If you can, have your manufacturers handle all packaging, shipping, and customer service claims so that you're not tied down to that. Or, if the manufacturing side is more appealing to you then find systems to automate the sales process so that you don't have to worry about that. Again, figure out what your role is going to be in the process going forward and what you like doing and find other help in the areas you don't want to do so that you don't burn out and waste your time and money. Good luck! Either way you're going to learn a ton by just doing.

The way it goes better & better it opens up lots of opportunity.  Let dive little deeper to see how It works, In convention manufacturing, what we do is we take a Piece of material some what bigger then actual product and cut it down to the required shape. This processes are of substantive in nature. The problem is what about the material we chopped out? It is considered as waste. Yes one can recycle it but it won’t give you exact cost what you paid to purchase it. In 3D printing, the process is exactly reversed. 3D printing is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. It starts with a virtual design of object to be printed. Computer software can scan existing object or allow you to create a unique design. Then computer takes a model and then slices it into a number of thousands of horizontal layers. The printer reads each layer of those slices and print layer by layer to build a complete 3D object. This process of manufacturing is called additive manufacturing. Many early models of 3D printer built objects from plastics, while some machine can use powder metal, glass, ceramics and biological materials.  Following are the most important types of 3D printing technology.

If we only had drones to deliver products...    We will accelerate the adoption of online, we will foster innovation in consumption, but we'll never see the demise of physical retail. The question is akin to asking when Print media will die; we'll essentially kill it but it won't ever die. Though I suppose in that case, when digital screens are as thin, cheap, and flexible but sturdy as paper, we might actually see paper media die.   Why?  Or rather, why not?  More than the tactile, social, and present experience we have with physical retail, there are tech innovations that will simply never replace some tried and true experiences.  Take the digital wallet space, for example; company after company has tried to get us to pay with a mobile device but at the end  of the day, pulling a credit card out of my pocket is easier than pulling out the phone, unlocking it, opening an app, etc.  Tech innovation simply can't replace what physical retail provides and no amount of wishing it so will make it happen.

( Avoid products that may have defect rates, or can get damaged during shipping)The product needs to be brandable (This is what Private labeling is)Not easily available locally (incentivizes customers to buy it online)Warning *The product cannot be Patented! *(I have seen a lot of sellers go through lawsuits for this)Product Market Components : BSR aka Bestseller rank between 2500 -25000 ( you need to know this product sells on Amazon well)Instructions not needed to understand your product. ( customers don't get agitated from your product)There aren’t any big brands selling the products. (avoid this, they normally have a majority of the market)The product cannot be seasonal. ( You want to be able to sell your product all year round. Besides, winter season Amazon changes the rules)Product leads to reorders or can be gifted. ( it’s expensive to acquire new customers. If you can keep the ones that already purchased, more profits to you)Finally, the Sponsored listing appears when you search the product on Amazon.

604423e8ed76476feda3c65c,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-mistakes-when-you-start-selling-on-Amazon-FBA?-,"Joyce Lau, former AMZ Tracker Manager at AMZTRACKERAnswered September 7, 2020 Joyce Lau Big Mistakes Amazon FBA Sellers Make In this article we cover the biggest mistakes sellers make doing business on Amazon. #1 Too Little Effort and Time Whether you’re starting with $1000 or $100,000, the only way to win is to do everything possible to optimize your products, systems and business. The number one mistake sellers make is not putting enough time and effort into their business.

Do you have a fixe Continue ReadingBig Mistakes Amazon FBA Sellers Make In this article we cover the biggest mistakes sellers make doing business on Amazon. #1 Too Little Effort and Time Whether you’re starting with $1000 or $100,000, the only way to win is to do everything possible to optimize your products, systems and business. The number one mistake sellers make is not putting enough time and effort into their business. Instead of trying to get a quick win, commit to doing whatever it takes to build the right team and processes to make big profits. Do you have a systematic process for optimizing your listings? Do you have a fixed day each week when you check the detailed sales and conversion performance of your products? Do you spend at least five hours a week studying how to improve your Amazon business? Do you spend at least one day a week researching potential new products and developing them? If you can’t answer yes to all these questions, how do you expect to win against sellers who are doing this? For any niche the top 1 to 10 products usually make enough sales to generate a decent profit. For some niches it’s only the top two or three products. Yet a single niche could have 1000 or more products. Only the top 1% win. Are you doing what it takes to come out on top? #2 Too Much Stock By keeping your stock level low and delivering just-in-time inventory through careful stock management, you give yourself a competitive edge. If competitors suddenly flood into the market you can quickly adapt because you don’t have to sell out your old stock before updating your product. The competitive landscape of a niche can change overnight. You need to be able to adjust quickly and have the capital to pivot and optimize your listing. Instead of thinking that the product development is done upfront and then you place your order, treat it like an ongoing improvement process. You can update the photos, the packaging and the copywriting any time, so your product can be improved every month. Not many sellers are doing this, but if you want to be in the top 1% you need to focus on constant improvement. #3 Not Enough Capital When choosing a niche, make sure you have more than enough capital to support that product for the next 6 months at least. If it sells well with little promotion, that’s great. But if you expect brutal competition, you’ll be prepared to slug it out over several months. It’s hard to win if you can’t handle investing for 3 to 6 months before you make a profit on the product. You might need to keep the price at break even until it starts to rank for your main keywords. Doing a promotion and then raising the price may get you some sales for one month, but to win over 6 to 12 months you need to invest heavily in the product and run periodic promotions and discounts to bully your way to the top of the rankings. #4 Moving Too Slowly The hardest part and most important task in your Amazon business is selecting the correct niche. It can take some people days or even weeks to build a list of 100 or so products to research. That’s too long in a market that’s constantly evolving. Go to shops, search online, review Amazon bestsellers and pull together a list of 100+ potential products in a day. Look up items that sell for between $15-$80 and keep adding them to your list. You can use the new niche selector from cash cow pro, which has over 100,000 niches each with the sales, profits, freight costs and product costs. It even tells you the competitiveness of each market and keyword. Once you’ve found a list of good products, narrow it down to the best few and move to sourcing them as soon as possible. Go for the items with the biggest returns on investment that are light and small. #5 Quality Issues Invest in your product. Spend 10 to 20% extra to get better materials, labeling and packaging. Ask your factory what you can do to improve it. When it comes to photographing the product and building the listing, if you have a better overall product it will show clearly on the Amazon search results. You get more positive feedback and more sales. Do regular quality inspections. The reason many sellers fail is because they’re trying to sell a substandard product with a poor listing. The level of competition for quality photographs, copywriting and product bundles is increasing week to week. Make sure your product stands out as the best quality of all in your niche. You can do this while still keeping the costs very low, because $.50 spent at the factory adds more than $5 to $10 of value for the consumer. Conclusion Do everything you can to improve your products and business. Play the long game - not expecting to make quick cash.",2021-03-07T00:52:56.385Z,"What are the top 5 mistakes when you start selling on Amazon FBA? ",Quora

Amazon FBA is much like the 2 examples I just mentioned, you will need a significant amount of knowledge to ever get your first set of clients and have them pay you for your services. However, most people open an Amazon sellers account with little to no knowledge around the business and expect to make a bunch of money right out the gate.. This is where a majority of the new sellers die off and never even get a single product in their stores. You need a good solid knowledge foundation in order to build a profitable business on Amazon. Some of the areas you will need to familiarize your self in are: The Amazon sellers account - You will need to know how to navigate your account and how to use the features inside there. Marketplaces - In North America we have 3 choices when it comes to what Amazon marketplace we can sell in, USA, Canada or Mexico. Fulfillment Methods - FBA (fulfillment by Amazon) or FBM (fulfillment by merchant) you will need to understand the pros and cons of each before deciding which is best for you. Style of selling - Wholesale or private label. There are many differences between the two and you will need to know them in order to choose what one is best for you. Identifying winning products - There are several ways to determine a winning product, many factors are at play like: demand, profitability, ranking, competition, reviews, shipping cost, is it a seasonal item? Those are just a few. How and where to source product - Depending on what style of selling you choose, you will need to find a supplier for those products. Certain suppliers in different regions will have better products and prices than others. Other miscellaneous details - Things like shipping to Amazon, stranded inventory, returns and reimbursements, and advertising are just some of the things that fall under the “ other “ category. As you can see there are a number of things that a beginner must familiarize themselves with before they are able to start making money on Amazon.

If you want to succeed, you have to make sure that your inventory planning is on point. Even Amazon itself has an IPI SYSTEM - their own Inventory Planning system that they’ve just recently rolled out last 2018.

And if that continues significantly for a period of time, you won’t be able to make it in FBA.Poor Profit Margin Planning - Profit margin planning is essential to any kind of business - traditional brick-and-mortar as well as e-Commerce. Beyond the Storage Fees aforementioned, Amazon also implements charges for Fulfillment and Marketplace Fee (which is 15%) per unit. Now if you sell products with not enough margins to cover these additional fees, then you won’t be able to make enough profit-- of course in the long run, you won’t be able to succeed in FBA.Poor Understanding of Profitability on a Per SKU Basis - It’s essential for any Amazon seller - reseller, private label sellers, and others - to know all the costs involved (per unit or per SKU) including the fees we’ve mentioned in the first two points, because an Amazon business is a very margin-specific business. You need to learn and clearly understand how much Amazon is taking from your cut, per unit. Knowing how profitable you are based on a single SKU is very important driver of success on FBA.

You don't want to just throw in a bunch of keywords or use a one liner as your product title. 3) Using great product images will help shoppers make a purchasing decision. The only sense shoppers have is Sight so you need to bring other senses such as smell, touch, sound, and taste to life for an unforgettable experience. Just like yourself, shoppers want to know what exactly they are getting, the more details your images portrait, the better it is for shoppers to decide. 4) Great copywriting for your product description makes a huge difference as you want to hit shoppers' pain point with a thought provoking question, then provide a generic solution and your solution as well. Be sure to include product benefits, scarcity, and also call-to-action in your description as well. 5) Running Amazon ads and other marketing strategies (i.e. giveaways, JVs, facebook ads, quiz etc). What better way to do so than offering great discounts to shoppers making the offer irresistible! The above are some of the main techniques to build a successful Amazon FBA business.

Next, you will choose a product to sell. Then, Order some product samples from Alibaba.com.Review them at home, and decide what changes to make or which one to order.Place an order for 300–500 units.

(Do join my Facebook Group for daily tips on how to make money online) Before I begin have a look at my income stats for the last 30 days  As you can see I'm comfortably earning more than $1,000 a day as an Amazon Seller. This is both FBA and other methods, but certainly FBA is a part of this amount. ***What is Amazon FBA*** FBA stands for fulfilled by Amazon. It means that you source products yourself and then you send them to the Amazon fulfillment Centre to be dispatched This is a great time saver - no need for packing, storing, handling returns or any of the other tasks associated with an ecommerce business. But it comes with a price because Amazon takes a hefty cut for that privilege. Having said that, it can be argued that storing the goods yourself in a warehouse, employing packing staff and paying for postage are all overheads that need to be accounted for - in which case the Amazon FBA maths make more sense. ***Here is why I don't believe there is too much competition to make money as an Amazon FBA Seller ( Or as an Amazon affiliate seller for that matter)*** There are millions of possible niches on Amazon.Provided you find one with high demand and reasonable competition ( ie no more than 5 sellers on a given listing), you should be able to get a decent amount of sales. The thing is with Amazon is that they are entirely metric driven. When you sell on FBA (and especially on Prime) you are by definition an extension of their brand. This means that they check how fast you dispatch orders, how efficiently you answer queries and how good is your customer feedback. If your metrics are good you will generally find that your listings will get more exposure and you will make more sales. You can see my metrics just below  They are pretty good…and this helps me greatly. 2. Choose a good niche There are many ways to assess whether a niche is good or not. My favourite is to look at Google Trends and look for upward trajectory which means there is growing demand for that product. This is a good place to start. Another one is Google’s keyword planner which shows how many searches there are on a monthly basis for any given keyword (ie product) 3. Check out the competition One of the best places to start in my opinion is by checking out the competition. This will give you a really good idea as to what sells, and what doesn't. It's not necessarily a good idea to go for the top sellers because competition is going to be stiff. ***Top tip*** - Use AMZ scout (the free version) to give you an idea as to how many units are selling for any given sales rank. If you go for a medium ranking product that sells between 10 to 20 units a day, you are on your way to making a decent income with Amazon FBA 4. Differentiate yourself One of the best ways to combat the competition is to add bundled products to your listing. For example if you're selling notepads and you add a simple pencil to your listing, this will make you stand out from the crowd and will draw people to your listing, even though you might be a few pennies more expensive. 5. Invest in excellent listings Online shopping is all about having high quality listings and Amazon FBA is no different. Invest in good pictures, and make your product sounds appealing without being too salesy. Add as much information as possible - size, weight, dimensions, colours, materials and so on. This leads me onto another point which is to answer questions - many people will be asking about what the product can and cannot do, so do take your time and answer these as they will clarify the best way to use the product and your USPs. 6. Get good feedback Amazon is very strict about buying feedbacks, and so that should not be something which you do. Provide excellent customer service, be realistic in your descriptions and dispatch. quickly. Do these things to ensure that you receive good feedback. One software which automates this process is called Feedback Express (Note - I'm not affiliated with Feedback Express). Although I'm not using it myself, I did hear good things about it. It has an email template which is sent after the purchase asking for feedback, and it will notify you in case of bad feedback so that you can jump on the case and remedy the problem fast. 7. Look after the pennies, and the pounds will look after themselves. Unlike other forms of selling on Amazon - arbitrage for example - Amazon FBA is predicated on holding inventory. This means that you have the ability to influence your price in a big way...and every penny accounts. You need to source well, and also you need to get your stock to the Amazon fulfillment centre in the cheapest way possible. Luckily Amazon have a preferred dispatch program - you can see more here https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201119120?language=en-US&ref=mpbc_201119160_cont_201119120 After you've been successful with FBA for a while you should aspire to having your own brand. This is protected through the Amazon trademark registry but also it means that you rise Above the competition and have a strong USP - this will mean your profit margins are increased (very important in a competitive environment such as Amazon’s FBA). Although I didn't (yet) create a world-changing invention to sell on Amazon, I have quite a few products that are registered as copyrighted with them, meaning that I enjoy higher margins and less competition. *** hopefully you found this answer informative do get in touch with if you'd like me to answer anything else or just get in touch for any other queries you may have.

60442724ed76476feda3cb4b,https://www.quora.com/What-legal-documents-does-an-Amazon-FBA-seller-need-to-sign?-,"I most cases, you as an Amazon seller won’t need to sign anything except that you will need to accept their terms of services.[1] Do you want to make more money selling on Amazon? (Checkout testimonials here.) Here are a few ideas of what you can you do to persuade buyers to buy your product: 1. Choose a good display name when you first set your Amazon account up Your display name is your 'business name' when selling on Amazon, which shows at the top of the listing when buyers search for products. This can be your real name, or a made-up business name. Amazon Marketplace buyers tend to prefer professional- sounding business names rather than personal names. Try and include something that tells buyers why they should choose you rather than just a meaningless name. For example 'FastBargainDVD' might be a good idea if you're selling DVDs. Remember, if you already have an account on Amazon which you've used for buying the name might not be ideal for selling - so change it or open a new account. 2. Take advantage of the option to add extra information to your listing Remember you can add up to 2,000 characters of 'Comments' to your listing. So take advantage of this. Give buyers some reasons why they should buy from you rather than anyone else. Remember, Amazon buyers are hot on product condition and good service. So something like the following can really make a difference: A1 perfect condition. We despatch daily by first class post, securely wrapped in bubble wrap. 3. List new as used This is a real Amazon quirk. Strangely, it can be an advantage to describe new items as 'used'. This pulls in buyers looking for a bargain since they will look at the 'used' listings for a product before the 'new ones - ever if there is very little difference in the new and used prices. Of course, it only works if you can afford to sell your item for much less than the recommended retail price. It is also not such a good idea if your item is likely to be bought as a gift. 4. Aim to sell at the lowest price As with selling anywhere competitive pricing gives you an advantage. But it is particularly important when selling with Amazon because listings are presented to buyers in price order, cheapest first - unlike eBay where they are sorted by listing age. So it is a big advantage to get your listing at the top of the page. Sometimes cutting your price by just a few pence (e.g. £49.97 instead of £49.99) can get you at the top of the page. If you can't price at the lowest price try to choose a price that gets you within the top three listings. Also try and give buyers reasons why they should still buy from you at a higher price, i.e. you do fast delivery or (in the case of a used item) your item is in really good condition. Good tip. If you are the only seller it's still worth pricing competitively. This will discourage other potential sellers from coming in and undercutting you. 5. Send the goods ASAP Because Amazon itself sends goods quickly Amazon buyers tend to be a bit obsessed with fast delivery. Amazon expects you to send goods within two days but you should try to do it the next or even same day if possible. If you can - state that you do this in your listing. It can get you extra sales. 6. Post products reviews On Amazon, buyers can post reviews on the products they buy. These can be seen by anyone thinking of buying that product from any seller. This is a really great feature of Amazon that's often under-exploited. As well as written reviews you can also post photos and videos if you want to. 6 Clever Techniques for Maximising Your Sales on Amazon Footnotes[1] Webinar - Use Keywords To Find Hot Selling Items On Amazon",2021-03-07T01:06:44.159Z,"What legal documents does an Amazon FBA seller need to sign?

Selling in Amazon categories is a different from FBA. The seller “sells” the product while, if in the FBA program, Amazon handles product fulfillment and customer service. (2) Amazon does not list a product in multiple categories. If you’re asking whether you can list one product in multiple categories, the answer is “no”. Amazon assigns its products to a category and subcategory known as a “node” and then uses advanced search technology to show similar items, even those in different categories. As Amazon controls the listings, they’ll even change the nodes from time to time. But Amazon has very sophisticated search algorithms, so Amazon’s search engine will automatically cross-index a product. So there’s less of a need to rely on different categories just to make sure your product gets seen. Note further, unlike eBay where one product can appear in multiple listings by different sellers, Amazon strives to have one listing per product with multiple seller offers. Amazon’s one listing approach makes it doubly hard to list a single product across multiple categories. (3) Amazon has many restricted categories and products. If you’re asking whether, as a seller, one can sell in multiple categories, the answer is yes, but there are a lot of rules. Amazon is far more regimented than other sales portals. While a seller can sell in different categories, Amazon has a number of restricted or gated categories where prior approval is required to list. Additionally, Amazon has many restricted products which require approval to sell, even in unrestricted category. So if you’re planning on selling on Amazon, especially in more than one category, there’s a lot of rules to review in advance. (4) Don’t try to circumvent the system. Disreputable sellers will sometimes deliberately attempt to list in the wrong category to get around the category restrictions. For example, listing a real watch (jewelry) as a “toy”. Such is a sure way to ensure a short career as an Amazon seller. See: Overview of Categories Hope this helps.

But, launching on Amazon is exponentially easier than launching your own eCommerce store. The long winded answer: Yes, Amazon is the place to be, and the dominance of the platform seems to be growing. Amazon’s original business plan to make customer’s trust and loyalty a top priority is massively important. When you sell as a third party on the Amazon platform you are piggybacking on this. The millions of eyeballs that you get along with the good will of people buying from Amazon is unparalleled. The volume you can expect is massive. For example, in non-holiday months I move between 1,300 and 1,700 units of my main product a month. Something that would take blood, sweat, tears and substantial advertising dollars off Amazon. Now, with that said, starting up from scratch is more difficult now than it was 2–5 years ago. That’s not to say that it is impossible, it’s just not as easy as it used to be, and there are some major pitfalls that you have to be aware of: First the general pitfalls. Starting a business solely through the Amazon channel is risky because it is not your business it is Amazon’s. The customers are Amazon’s customers. You don’t have their email or phone number, you can’t market to them through the Amazon system (they will remove all email address and URLs in your message)The listing is Amazon’s listing and they can shut it down with no warning (this has happened to me 3 times in 1.5 years)Amazon changes their terms of service on a regular basis. And they make sweeping changes without consideration of your business. Their first and foremost interest is their customer’s experience not your businessNow, the more specific changes that Amazon has made that make it more difficult to launch a new product: Reviews -(a little history lesson) It used to be very easy to launch a new product. You would put your listing up, get inventory into FBA and then give away a few hundred units for a very deep discount (like 90–100% off). It was then expected that about 30% of the people who received the discount would leave a review for the discounted item. This is known as a “blast” and the point behind it is multi-fold. First and foremost you would focus your blast on main keywords for the listing. The high volume of sales would boost your ranking for the targeted keyword. So you would start ranking #1 for that keyword which (if your page was optimized for conversion) people would see, and organically start buying. The organic sales would keep you in the #1 spot. The organic sales would be supplemented by the flood of reviews that you would get from the people who got your item at a discount. It would quickly give your item social proof and high keyword ranking. That’s all you would have to do to start selling. (I won’t discuss other competitors, price wars, losing the buy box/being hijacked etc. That’s not the focus of this question).Today it is against Amazon’s TOS to give an item at a discount in exchange for a review. If you do this you could lose your listing.They have been changing the review algorithm first it was adding the Verified Purchase tag to reviews. At one point it was if a customer bought at a deep discount their review wouldn’t be tagged as verified. Then it started weighing verified vs non-verified reviews differently in the average star rating. In the past few weeks Amazon has made it so if a customer purchases your item at a discount of more than 20% off the sale price they may not be able to leave a review at all.Beyond reviews, there are some other things that Amazon has done that change customer’s perception and make it more difficult to make a sale. For example, each listing used to have a list price and a sale price, so as a seller you could put a high list price and then call your normal price “sale” and customers would see a big discount percent on your page. This made everyone think they were getting a good deal. Amazon has removed that feature on most listings and you only see the actual price now.After saying all that, there are some really good things that Amazon has done like brand registry the provides additional protection to sellers as well as additional marketing opportunities (i.e. different ad spaces, the ability to upload videos and documents). But to take advantage of this you have to have a registered trademark, which takes 9 months to obtain. So the question is how do you launch a new product successfully on Amazon now? The short answer is: have an audience. Get Facebook followers, or a Facebook group, an Instagram following etc. Once you have these groups of rabid fans built you can launch new products to them, they will normally buy at higher prices and since they feel a personal connection with your brand they will be happy to leave reviews. In addition to an audience (or if you don’t want to build an audience) you can learn how to optimize Amazon’s Sponsored Products (Pay Per Click Advertising). Just allocate a large budget, and realize that in the beginning you may not make a profit on your PPC, but use that ad spend to rank for your main keywords.

But, launching on Amazon is exponentially easier than launching your own eCommerce store.

But, launching on Amazon is exponentially easier than launching your own eCommerce store. The long winded answer: Yes, Amazon is the place to be, and the dominance of the platform seems to be growing. Amazon’s original business plan to make customer’s trust and loyalty a top priority is massively important. When you sell as a third party on the Amazon platform you are piggybacking on this. The millions of eyeballs that you get along with the good will of people buying from Amazon is unparalleled. The volume you can expect is massive. For example, in non-holiday months I move between 1,300 and 1,700 units of my main product a month. Something that would take blood, sweat, tears and substantial advertising dollars off Amazon. Now, with that said, starting up from scratch is more difficult now than it was 2–5 years ago. That’s not to say that it is impossible, it’s just not as easy as it used to be, and there are some major pitfalls that you have to be aware of: First the general pitfalls. Starting a business solely through the Amazon channel is risky because it is not your business it is Amazon’s. The customers are Amazon’s customers. You don’t have their email or phone number, you can’t market to them through the Amazon system (they will remove all email address and URLs in your message)The listing is Amazon’s listing and they can shut it down with no warning (this has happened to me 3 times in 1.5 years)Amazon changes their terms of service on a regular basis. And they make sweeping changes without consideration of your business. Their first and foremost interest is their customer’s experience not your businessNow, the more specific changes that Amazon has made that make it more difficult to launch a new product: Reviews -(a little history lesson) It used to be very easy to launch a new product. You would put your listing up, get inventory into FBA and then give away a few hundred units for a very deep discount (like 90–100% off). It was then expected that about 30% of the people who received the discount would leave a review for the discounted item. This is known as a “blast” and the point behind it is multi-fold. First and foremost you would focus your blast on main keywords for the listing. The high volume of sales would boost your ranking for the targeted keyword. So you would start ranking #1 for that keyword which (if your page was optimized for conversion) people would see, and organically start buying. The organic sales would keep you in the #1 spot. The organic sales would be supplemented by the flood of reviews that you would get from the people who got your item at a discount. It would quickly give your item social proof and high keyword ranking. That’s all you would have to do to start selling. (I won’t discuss other competitors, price wars, losing the buy box/being hijacked etc. That’s not the focus of this question).Today it is against Amazon’s TOS to give an item at a discount in exchange for a review. If you do this you could lose your listing.They have been changing the review algorithm first it was adding the Verified Purchase tag to reviews. At one point it was if a customer bought at a deep discount their review wouldn’t be tagged as verified. Then it started weighing verified vs non-verified reviews differently in the average star rating. In the past few weeks Amazon has made it so if a customer purchases your item at a discount of more than 20% off the sale price they may not be able to leave a review at all.Beyond reviews, there are some other things that Amazon has done that change customer’s perception and make it more difficult to make a sale. For example, each listing used to have a list price and a sale price, so as a seller you could put a high list price and then call your normal price “sale” and customers would see a big discount percent on your page. This made everyone think they were getting a good deal. Amazon has removed that feature on most listings and you only see the actual price now.After saying all that, there are some really good things that Amazon has done like brand registry the provides additional protection to sellers as well as additional marketing opportunities (i.e. different ad spaces, the ability to upload videos and documents). But to take advantage of this you have to have a registered trademark, which takes 9 months to obtain. So the question is how do you launch a new product successfully on Amazon now? The short answer is: have an audience. Get Facebook followers, or a Facebook group, an Instagram following etc. Once you have these groups of rabid fans built you can launch new products to them, they will normally buy at higher prices and since they feel a personal connection with your brand they will be happy to leave reviews. In addition to an audience (or if you don’t want to build an audience) you can learn how to optimize Amazon’s Sponsored Products (Pay Per Click Advertising). Just allocate a large budget, and realize that in the beginning you may not make a profit on your PPC, but use that ad spend to rank for your main keywords.

Just google “Wyoming registered agent” and go from there. Opening a US bank account in the name of this entity is where things get complicated—you’ll generally have to show up in person in the US. I have contacts that can make this process much easier. Note that Wray’s answer is incorrect regarding the US federal income tax consequences here. You won’t be subject to US federal income tax as long as you don’t have employees or other dependent agents in the US working for you.

Let’s pull you out of this sea of negativity. It’s a Business! Selling on Amazon is a regular business at its core, you need to treat and respect it that way. What does this mean?It means that you need to follow some discipline, be organized, have good relations with suppliers, invest time and money on marketing and develop channels to reach your target audience, timely. Product Hunting. There are approx. 480 million products selling on Amazon at the moment and 235 million were added in the last 16 months. If you haven’t noticed already, that’s a lot! We advise you to spend rather invest a lot of time in this stage as product selection will be absolutely crucial and this will mostly be the ‘deciding factor’ in ascertaining sellers’ fate in 2019. Sellable Asset. Your Amazon listing and your inventory is your asset that you can sell off whenever you feel you are done with a product, want to move to a different one or want to quit the game altogether. Valuation of your listing will be based on your monthly profits that you can showcase on Flippa - #1 platform to buy and sell a business. and Empire Flippers - Website Brokers | Vetted Marketplace. Proxy Selling. Increase your selling channels. What is the concept? You can establish a partnership model with established sellers on Shopify or eBay stores and give them access to your inventory. This might be new for some but people are adopting this model and using it as a catalyst to ensure complete sale of their stock. What’s in it for them? Shopify and eBay sellers will have access to readily available inventory already present in U.S. to be shipped to their customers on a margin you guys agree upon. This is a definite win-win arrangement. How will you benefit? Your product will have access and visibility on multiple platforms, you can easily increase traffic, help improve sales velocity and BSR of your product. Why and when would you do that? This will be useful if you fear your inventory will be dead in the future and you foresee a diminishing demand of product. Switch to Brand Selling Model. You need to come out of product selling mindset and work towards making a brand, a private label. Work hard on creating a ‘wow’ effect for the customer in terms of product quality, product information and after sales as this will definitely be beneficial in the long run.Supplier Relations. This will remain as significant as it was earlier. Consider them as your business partners, you can only achieve success if your supplier provides you high quality, low cost products consistently. Your success is in their hands. Embrace Uncertainty. Expect nothing and accept everything. Amazon will continue to change its policies to safeguard and please its buyers and make things, let’s just say ‘interesting’ for its sellers. You can either be upset about it or embrace changes with open arms, it’s up to you. Some will drown some will survive, that will remain the rule of the game.Explore Markets. If you see your product selling successfully, getting positive reviews and you are confident about your product, you might want to jump into new markets like the U.K., Japan, Germany, Australia etc. to test your product luck. Data Driven Decisions. Decisions should be based on data and you are likely to succeed if you will have supporting stats. Data sources should be more authentic, verify same data from different sources and then move forward. Tools Savvy. Market intelligence has changed the game altogether and there will be more tools coming into facilitate at every stage. Sellers that use authentic tools (in terms of accuracy) to extract data will be ahead in the competition for sure and will less likely crash. Reviews Building Strategies. Come up with creative ideas to ask for reviews like placing a leaflet inside product package that requests them to submit a review if they were satisfied or to ‘email to you’ directly in case they faced a problem i.e. to avoid a negative review. Another way could be to put in an extra product if you are bundling and surprise your customer with a bonus article. This way you attempt to drag the customer out of the customer satisfactory zone into a customer delight zone which will most probably yield a review in your favor. Marketing Channels. Explore new and creative ways to reach your customer with a combination of marketing avenues depending on the type of product you have e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube, Vimeo, Press Release, Google+ etc. Optimize Product Listing. Do not ignore the title, product images, bullet points, description, back-end search terms. Catchy Product Descriptions. A+ products are not generating sales due to inadequate and poorly written product descriptions. Think of it this way, you are not present yourself to communicate why a customer should buy your product. Your product only has 2,000 words for its elevator pitch which should include product details, keywords and should be written in a promising language that touches the customer and replaces the need for your presence. High Quality Media Kit. Nothing draws more attention towards your product as effectively as pictures and videos you decide to share with your customers. Media kit should be appealing enough to make the customer want to click and then buy your product. Your video should give the feeling that you are talking to your customers for real and the product can potentially solve their problems.

AMAZON FBA is real money maker to those who are doing it right, but there are also lots of failure stories from people who gave it a try but used the wrong strategy, but do not let this stop you from giving it a try since the reward is really worth it if done correctly. To start your plan of being an Amazon FBA seller you need to have a strong and flexible strategy. Starting an Amazon business will present you overwhelming tasks that will fit a thing or two that might be of your interest. Selling on Amazon is one of the most secure business in the world. Starting an Amazon business will present you overwhelming tasks that will fit a thing or two that might be of your interest. Regarding the search of new products there are lot’s of tools you can already utilize to make your life easier. I’m not saying it will be easy but I’m 100% sure that it will be worth it. To start your plan of being an Amazon FBA seller, you need to have a strong and flexible strategy. Keep in mind that not everything will go according to your plan that is why you need to be flexible but strong enough to hold on to your goal. Once you start executing your plan you need to be sure that it is really what you want to do with no hesitation. I wish you good luck and much success! Like other small businesses out there, there are large numbers of FBA businesses which fail, often in under a year. Poor money management, poor business plan and loss of focus are just some of the reasons why Amazon or any kind of business fails. Many business owners can find that it starts to consume their lives and that stress reaches intolerable levels. Something has to give when the stress becomes too much, and for many it’s their FBA business. You can’t necessarily avoid every circumstance which can lead to failure, but you can learn from how others have failed and put steps in place to mitigate those factors. Make sure you plan well and that your expectations of the business are realistic. What sort of return do you need? How much time and money do you have to invest? Look after your business but look after yourself too. Good luck with your business and I wish you a prosperous life!

To release early 2018 in the UK. No hand waivy, spammy hype you up and leave you high and dry here. Those arm folding suit wearing class teachers make me sick. I like step by steps in an actual framework that's scaleable, customizable, and easy to move on from, and that's exactly what I did for you with microstudio.

How is that possible? Apps of this magnitude sell in the thousands per seat. I really really really care to help the super micro start up, cus that's exactly who and what I am. I started as a college kid just trying to raise a family. I was 18, a senior at UCI when my then wife was pregnant with my daughter (yes there's a lot going on there, conversation for another day :p ). The name of the game was “don't die”, and I never gave up. I practiced and failed more times than I would like to admit, but in the end, though lost my marriage, I made it enough to raise my kids. I made what I use for me, and I've been sharing my tools and methods with friends in e-commerce for years. I decided one day to make my thing available to the world, not for the intent to get rich and famous but so that people just starting out can avoid the pitfalls and mistakes that I faced. Maybe I can help save someone's marriage and family. That's what matters most.. and I'm sharing with the world my battle tested method of, regardless if starting on a shoe string budget, growing into something sustainable, maintainable, scaleable. Until then, here's a shortcut cheat tip for you. Practicing to pass your venture against the ISO 9000 family of requirements, and you'll be far ahead of any flashy hyped up YouTube class watching competition.

Here are some ideas we have been sharing: How entering the online sales world is a good thing in this COVID-19 era Currently we are bombarded 24/7 with COVID-19 news; as we should be due to how serious this pandemic has impacted on the world. Life as we knew it will change because of it. The initial emphasis has rightly focused on various health aspects; social distancing, quarantining, keeping well, getting treatment where needed, and dealing with loss. We have seen companies shut down (both temporarily or permanent), massive unemployment lines, various stimulus packages and various levels of government working together and also with the business world. However, much of the next impact from here will be on the economic factors and that is going to be more of a medium to long term situation. The real financial struggle has already hit though and many are worried about rent, mortgages, car loans, school fees; all the things we had to spend on prior to COVID-19. Basic things just to keep a roof over our heads and to feed ourselves and our loved ones. Many don’t know where that money is going to come from, as not everyone qualifies for welfare or stimulus payments. This current situation has been likened to a “war”, but what a lot of people don’t realize is that there is still a lot of money to be made during a “war”. It’s all about working smarter and working quickly. People are always looking for things to buy; for everyday use, for a special event; even where they are downsizing or shopping smarter to make those $$$ work for them. Everyone has heard of AMAZON and what a massive enterprise they are. They are still shipping goods around the world in massive amounts. You too can be a part of that money to be made through drop shipping; using AMAZON FBA. The drop shopping model involves finding manufacturers who make products you want to sell to your customers. Depending on what you want to sell, the products can be ready to sell as is, or could be customized for “on demand” items. It really is limitless what you can find and sell. You don’t need to set up factories, tooling, warehousing, a sales team, etc. It is all done through online selling with AMAZON FBA. Click on our link and we will show you how our expertise and professionalism can bring you up to speed very quickly. Online-sales is fast moving and in the current situation, that is exactly what people need to keep afloat, and even get ahead of the game. Running a business is about cash flow, not just profit. https://social.seobetter.com/amazonseller Reading our “link” will show you how you could do this at a solo level; but we have already had customers who have pooled resources with other former workmates, or even contacts from other companies they used to do business with. As hard as the current situation is, it has also kick started the fire in many as they are in control and making the decisions, and the money for themselves. We provide free 24/7 online assistance to all of our customers as a follow up to the extensive training. Previous online sale experience isn’t needed. What is needed are products that people want to buy; something that you and each of our customers have the knowledge.

The key to success on Amazon or any place else for that matter is making yourself, your product stand out, apart from all of the competitors./ Go the extra mile and put thought into how you can add value and stand apart. Most new sellers do massive giveaways at launch not realizing they are instantly categorizing themselves as the same old same old. Why? Because it seems at the moment the easy way our, the easy way to rank. The truth of the matter is that it attracts chap buyers that will never purchase from you again. Instead, adding value, creating a unique selling proposition that enables you to stand out from everyone else No not at all, however, it depends on you and the path that you take. There are many many new sellers on Amazon every single day. A full 70% of them never add a product for sale, but still, the remaining 30% is a large number of sellers. Many new sellers have zero experience so they jump into the same old expensive webinars that teach black hat methods. Research whatever form of learning that you choose before jumping in. There are a lot of good mentors and valuable learning courses and methods available, not all are bad.

Learn to program, get a good job. On the side, start up an Amazon FBA business. My two cents… Do you want to work for yourself or do you want to work for someone else? This is rooted more in: Are you a risk taker or are you risk adverse?How confident are you in yourself and your capabilities?Do you want to be told what to do or do you want to find and structure your own path?Many people will choose the programming language path because it is safe. There is a set of expectations, there are rules, it is socially acceptable. Basically learning a programming language equals getting a job. You will have an employer, you will learn and grow in the structure of that language. You will get a paycheck and you will live a comfortable life. Your parents will understand that you have a marketable skill and others will pay you to use that skill. This will make your parents comfortable that you are able to take care of yourself and give your friends a basic frame of reference that they understand. Some people might say that if you learn a programming language it doesn’t mean you have to work for someone else, you could start your own business where you write apps etc. However, if you are an entrepreneur/business owner, in the long run you will not be the one coding. You will be the one hiring the people who do the coding. The other option you put forth was Amazon FBA Building an Amazon FBA business can bring great success, wealth and freedom. But you have to do it right. You have to learn, understand, grow and network within the community. You will be an entrepreneur, you will be the master of your fate and that fate could be in a broad spectrum of outcomes. On the low end you could be in debt and have a failed business or, on the high end, you could build a business that is worth 7 figures, sell it and retire on the proceeds. These are obviously opposite ends of the spectrum, and most people will fall somewhere in the middle. But if you 1) never want to work for anyone ever again, 2) are up for taking risks 3) are confident in yourself and your abilities to grow, adapt and change 4) like to do things your own way, creating structure as you go, and 5) want to have freedom/retirement ASAP… then Amazon FBA is for you. Now, you can do what I am doing which is a hybrid of both, reducing the risks on the entrepreneur side and putting a countdown clock on my time working for others. I work a full time job and I have an Amazon FBA business. I keep the money I make in my salary for my family budget and I keep all profit the business makes re-invested back into the business. This means that the business can grow exponentially, very quickly. The way to accomplish this is through automation. I create very specific Method of Procedure (MOP) documentation, hire Virtual Assistants and automate the business as much as possible with different software packages. This way the business is a fully functional separate entity that can be sold within the next 2–3 years for 7–8 figures. I then plan to take that money, invest it and live off the proceeds for the rest of my life. This will allow me to be a very large part of my children’s formative years and I will have enough money to travel the world with my family to educate them on all of the amazing cultures, people and history that can be found on this beautiful planet. Therefore, my final answer is: do both. Learn to program, get a good job. On the side, start up an Amazon business and keep all of the money for the Amazon business re-invested back into the business. Build the business up until you can make a 7 figure exit and then sell the business and retire to do anything you want. 17",2021-03-07T01:47:58.210Z,"Should I aim to become a seller of products on Amazon FBA or should I learn a programming language instead?

On the other hand, even thoughThe internet has given new businessmen the facility to launch their business with more ease, it can still be difficult to get a strong foothold. Although, there are a huge number of retail websites online, a few major brands carry on dominating, much like the conventional high street retail. At the moment, Amazon is the biggest online retailer of all. The reality is that very few companies will ever be able to fight with Amazon. In this situation, the most excellent thing that you can do if you want to establish an online retail business from home is to get involved with Amazon, and turn it to your maximum benefit. Read on to find out the basics of getting up and managing your own Amazon business. You'll realize that by treating Amazon as a partner, you too can set up earning a great living from home. Understanding how you should sell products in the retail setting means understanding what customers look for when they purchase them. Of course, every customer glances at the highest quality products at the lowest possible prices. If you can put forward something truly ground-breaking, or enter an existing sector with lesser prices, you can definitely attract a large amount of interest in your business. However, this interest is only useful if it turns into revenue. Amazon is the biggest online retailer, in view of the fact that it is a brand that customers trust. If you begin selling on Amazon, they'll trust you too. To start with, you need to sign up for a seller account with Amazon. The standard Basic Seller Account is free, and offered to those vendors that sell less than 35 products a month. Products can be listed in up to 20 special categories, and you will basically pay a fee for each product sold. As your business develops, you would like to upgrade to a Pro Seller Account. This type of account is charged at a minimal fess, and incorporates the ability to create new products, and sell them across up to 25 special categories. For checking the status of an Amazon SEO Company, always read the customer reviews that may have been publicized on their website. If they've made success for a particular product on Amazon, in all likelihood they have the resources to do it yet again.

This is where a majority of the new sellers die off and never even get a single product in their stores. You need a good solid knowledge foundation in order to build a profitable business on Amazon. Some of the areas you will need to familiarize your self in are: The Amazon sellers account - You will need to know how to navigate your account and how to use the features inside there. Marketplaces - In North America we have 3 choices when it comes to what Amazon marketplace we can sell in, USA, Canada or Mexico. Fulfillment Methods - FBA (fulfillment by Amazon) or FBM (fulfillment by merchant) you will need to understand the pros and cons of each before deciding which is best for you. Style of selling - Wholesale or private label. There are many differences between the two and you will need to know them in order to choose what one is best for you. Identifying winning products - There are several ways to determine a winning product, many factors are at play like: demand, profitability, ranking, competition, reviews, shipping cost, is it a seasonal item? Those are just a few. How and where to source product - Depending on what style of selling you choose, you will need to find a supplier for those products. Certain suppliers in different regions will have better products and prices than others. Other miscellaneous details - Things like shipping to Amazon, stranded inventory, returns and reimbursements, and advertising are just some of the things that fall under the “ other “ category. As you can see there are a number of things that a beginner must familiarize themselves with before they are able to start making money on Amazon.

Checkout success stories here. It has developed a platform for individuals as well as businesses that are new to selling. Though selling has become easy to get your foot in the door, there are common mistakes which the new Amazon sellers make. You need to take many things into consideration to survive in your online business. Here are some of them: Neglecting Brand Registry – Amazon brand registry is a program for those sellers that manufacture and sell their own brand products. Most of the small and medium sized businesses do not claim their own brand about their products and are ignorant about the program.Amazon titles are not optimized – Consumers who search for the Amazon product may not be consistent with the product titles in your database on the website. There are many reasons why your products don’t appear on the website. Title optimization is one of the reasons. If you are unable to optimize your title due to technical reasons, you need to inject an interim step wherein you can include appropriate Amazon titles.Neglecting Inventory Management – If your sales are successful, but fail to keep them in stock, your money remains on the table. When your stock is not maintained, you need to quantify the financial loss so you can force attention to sufficient stocking. You need to keep an account of stocks coming in and going out.Wrong categorization – Though Amazon does not prevent the wrong categorization, it is always advisable to upload your products in the right category. The users may not be able to view your products when they type the keyword to search for the products. If the business products fall under the same category, the outliers will have the tendency to ignore them. You may also get penalized for this.Forgetting to collect sales taxes – Irrespective of whether you collect your local sales tax at Amazon or not, you are liable for the tax. This eats away your profit margin. When you log in to Amazon, you need to fill tax settings in seller central immediately before you fix the rate for selling your products. If you are paying the local taxes, the only way to recover them is from the customers.Apart from all these mistakes, poor customer service affects your business in the long run. Amazon is very much particular about that. You need to respond to the customer query within 24 hours. If there are too many complaints, it leads to account suspension. Positive seller feedback is critical to keep your business running. It also leads to positive word of mouth from your customers. To improve your feedback rating, you need to give an accurate product description. What are the top 5 mistakes when you start selling on Amazon FBA?

People who are truly ahead of the pack are starting to think about how they can make money away from Amazon, because Amazon has gotten ridiculous for sellers. Not only do you have all these people falling for the “easy, hands-off” FBA thing and signing up as Amazon sellers, but you go on Amazon and just have too difficult of a time dealing with different issues that confront sellers there. At best, your biggest issue is just how there’s always another seller or two willing to sell the same thing you are at seemingly a loss or seemingly breaking even. Every now and then, you have that golden product that no one else sells or you are the most popular seller for buyers for that product, but most of the time it’s a race to the bottom that is eventually not worth your time and effort. Basically, Amazon and FBA have become products themselves for people looking to make money, in part because it’s now so difficult to make money as an Amazon seller just by selling items. Depends on what you sell, of course, but the vast majority of the products that I price on Amazon in looking at how I want to price items for my business are barely above wholesale prices and are sometimes even below “wholesale prices” from some suppliers. The biggest exception is stuff you get from China. So, the game has gotten saturated, and saturating it even more by coming up with stuff to sell that is like, “Hey, I make millions selling via FBA—you can, too, and I’ll teach you if you pay $497 for my course and my ‘free’ tools that I’ll throw in” and “I am a marketing/SEO guru, and I will teach you how to make more through FBA with advertising” is where a lot of people who are more forward thinking are actually making money online. I’m not saying not to sell on Amazon, though I don’t think I’d ever sell via FBA. I would only sell items that are worth the hassle and will generate enough of a profit once Amazon takes its cut.

You're not building a sustainable business or brand by doing that. Let's say you find a great product that you can get cheaply and resell for a nice profit. You put in a lot of work marketing it and for a while you're making good money. The problem is that pretty soon someone else will discover what you're doing and just piggyback on your hard work, buying and selling exactly the same thing and driving your profit margin down. Rather look for factories that offer OEM (original equipment manufacturer). At the simplest level this can just mean they offer white labelling - so you can put your own brand on something they already make. At the next level it means you can design and build your own products or modify items they already sell. Even if you're just re-branding an item they already sell, it immediately stops anyone from being able to piggyback on your listings. Plus it doesn't normally cost any more than just buying their products. You can get your branding done cheaply on Fiverr or 99designs. Apart from that I recommend using Amazon FBA, especially to begin with. What that means is that Amazon deal with the warehousing, fulfilment and customer service for your items. You just need to get the items to them and then focus on the marketing. The basic steps you'll need to take are: Find a product you like on AlibabaStart conversations with the factoryBuy some samples or prototypesRequest any changes you want madeBuy some UPC codes for your products (Universal Product Code). These are the numbers on the barcodeNegotiate on the price and minimum order quantity with the factory - you'll want to negotiate the price FOB (freight on board), meaning they pay all the costs up to putting the stock on a shipWork out all the fees involved (manufacturing, freight forward, customs, Amazon fees, tax) and see if you can still make a profitSort out a freight forwarder and customs broker to get the stock to your country (someone like Flexport)Create an Amazon Seller Account (start with the free one) and sign up to Amazon FBACreate the shipment in Amazon Seller CentralInstruct your freight forwarder on how to deliver the item to the Amazon FBA warehousesMarket your productOnce you get a nice flow going you can sit back let your business run itself.  Be aware though that your items won't sell themselves. You will need to market them and drive people to the Amazon listings. Start with a smallish order (a few hundred) and then work up if you're successful. If you're still interested, I go into a lot more detail on the process in this post (although using Shopfiy rather than Amazon FBA): Step-By-Step Guide to Creating and Selling a Physical Product.

One thing to watch for: a lot of people tout their sales on Amazon as an indication of success. My sales are around $30,000-$40,000 per month, but my profit margin is only around 10%.

I started selling private label on Amazon about 2 years ago, and I’m currently at between $3,000 and $4,000 per month in real profit. One thing to watch for: a lot of people tout their sales on Amazon as an indication of success. My sales are around $30,000-$40,000 per month, but my profit margin is only around 10%. Note that this does not factor in the significant amount of time I’m currently putting into the business, which you also want to consider. So the first decision (once you decide to try Amazon FBA) is whether to focus on wholesale, retail/online arbitrage, or private label. Wholesale is nice from the perspective that you can usually source from within the USA, so no worries about dealing with factories in China, import duties, etc. Also, you don’t need to spend time building up and ranking a listing, since usually the listing will already be established, and you’re just one more seller on that listing. There are downsides to wholesale though. Firstly, profit margins can be even thinner, since you are really just 1 of x sellers of a specific product. Another major risk is that Amazon decides to sell the product as well. When they do that, they will usually offer it at a price that won’t allow you to make money, and you may have to dump your inventory at a loss. Retail and/or online arbitrage involves finding a product for sale at a low price somewhere (say, Walmart) and then sending it into Amazon and selling it at a higher price. While many people make great money doing this, it’s my least favorite business model on Amazon. With retail arbitrage, there’s a lot of time spent in stores looking for bargains, and then physically having to ship goods into Amazon. All activities that I view as non-scalable and not the best use of my time. Also, arbitrage opportunities tend to dry up, so you are always on the hunt for the next thing. Some people probably love that, but it’s just not my cup of tea. I want to try to build a long-term asset (ie valuable brand(s), highly ranked listings), and arbitrage is more about turning the quick buck. That said, arbitrage is a fantastic way to learn about the mechanics of how Amazon FBA works. You’ll get familiar with shipping into Amazon and using Seller Central. Finally, there’s private label (selling your own stuff.) That’s what I do. I work with factories in China, get stuff made and shipped to a third party warehouse in the US, and then ship goods into Amazon on a regular basis. It’s a boat-load of work. You have to manage the entire supply chain (suppliers, shippers, warehouses, and Amazon itself.) You need to deal with customer complaints and returns. You also need to learn and manage Amazon’s advertising systems if you want to be successful. I decided to focus on private label for several reasons. Firstly, it can be difficult to get access to competitive wholesale goods, since many won’t sell to strictly online sellers. Secondly, I liked the idea of having control of my own brand and my own listing. I don’t have to “compete for the buy box.” No one else can list on my listing. And if I want to sell on Shopify, or some other platform, I can. It’s also worth calling out that all of these business models require some level of cash to invest in inventory purchases. With retail arbitrage, you could literally start with just $50 or $100. Wholesales would require minimum purchase sizes, but those are typically low (often $500 or $1,000 to get favorable terms.) Private label requires a bit more IMO. A typical initial order might be $3,000-$5,000. Hope this helps.

Here are some tips to help you get started: Quitting Job: Many people think of quitting their job and starting a business. However, it is essential to understand that capital, time and patience is required to make a business successful and before you can entirely quit your job.Add a private label: Having a private label for your business can allow you to control brand, features and prices of your products. The private name also helps you get recognition on Amazon. If people find your products worthy of the money, they will only buy products from your label.Look for an all-in-one supplier: Wholesale suppliers are of two types: ones which only provide products and others that handle packaging and storage along with offering products. Once you have selected a supplier, you can ask Amazon to pick up and ship the products and handle the rest like customer service, refunds, and sales. When you pay FBA fees, Amazon takes care of everything from shipping to handling the customers.Research: Regardless of what you’re selling, it is good to research before you buy 1000s of products. You should first examine what people want and manage your business accordingly. The best way to do this is to look on Amazon itself. Amazon displays bestseller, so it’s easy for you to track products that are a hit in the market.Pricing: On Amazon, you’ll see that most products have 5-6 sellers with similar pricing. These are the typical price, and you will most probably offer that product at the same price. However, to stand out, you’ll have to provide something extra to the customers like free delivery to make them buy the product from you.",2021-03-07T02:18:33.959Z,"Which types of Amazon sellers should I choose for FBA?

It is a platform which has millions of people surf for buying products on a monthly basis. Many suppliers want to take advantage of this potential market. This makes becoming successful in Amazon FBA a bit tricky. A few things you could do to give you an edge over your competitors are: 1. Finding the best product to sell: Amazon FBA is a highly competitive marketplace. Finding a product that is not exploited already with multiple suppliers is difficult, but very important to survive. Now you could depend on a brainstorming session with typing keywords on Google or Amazon's website to see how dense that market is, and what the sales and engagement are like. However, this will not only take up a lot of your time, but it also might not even provide you with accurate results. This is why there are many product research tools made specifically for Amazon FBA business to find and identify the right product. Some of these handy tools are: Jungle ScoutKeepaUnicorn SmasherOnce you’re done searching for your product line, make use of any Amazon fba wholesale services to buy those products and start your Amazon selling experience. Ideal products to target should be such products that have high demand but low competition. 2. Find a supplier: To get the right supplier who understands your business module and the product, you should prepare yourself to contact multiple suppliers. Create a template and send it across to numerous companies you found to be good. This helps ease and accelerate the process of finding the right supplier. Now get multiple quotes from different suppliers to understand what works best for you in your budget. It is essential to realize that you can't base the best on the terms of just cost. You have to find the right balance of quality and cost to get the best supplier for your product. 3. Market your product: You might have the best product in the niche you target, and you must be absolutely sure that no one can beat you for your prices or quality. However, merely having such a product is not going to lead to sales or conversions. For any business, you need to market your product correctly and efficiently. Reach out to more potential customers by investing in branding and packaging of your product. Always make a product listing to see what products work in the market and what products could you next target to sell after studying their performance over a period of time. Also, remove the products you think are not performing to maintain a good review standard and ensuring most of the views turn to sales. 4. Focus on keywords: The right keyword, description and use of bullet points are few of the practices to optimize your content to rank better on the various search engines which will increase the chance of your product appearing for people's search results. An excellent tool to do this is keyword scout which gives you a list of all associated keywords to your products. This eases the process. 5. Use optimized, high-quality photographs: Your product photos are the thumbnails that people first see when browsing Amazon. If you don't have an excellent professional picture here, there are fewer chances that people would even click your tab and look at the product further. Hence using high-quality photos is a must. Also, not only high quality but optimized photographs should be used as if your image is too high res it would take up more space. When people load your product, it will take longer time to load compared to others. Hence always optimize size and quality to get the best photograph for Amazon. 6. Run promotions: Don’t shy away from running PPC campaigns and running promotions for your products. First of all, there is nothing unethical about this, it's a genuine service that you pay for to get returns. Besides promoting your products makes it visible to more customers than it usually would have reached out to. This increases your scope of conversion and increases sales. 7. Be prepared for the future: Once you have a good hold on your present sales and planning, always plan a bit more the future. Keep studying trends and make predictions as to what product is going to yield most benefits in the upcoming year and be prepared to take advantage of such trends first hand.

Now, to start selling on Amazon, that too being an FBA seller, is an aggressive move towards selling that will undoubtedly bring you profits. But, for your luck to overturn, it might just take an instance. So, it's always better to keep in mind what you need to do and what you need to avoid being an Amazon FBA seller. #1 Never follow a wrong resource.Just imagine what would happen if every seller is working based on the same advice, impossible isn't it? This situation is where you need to stay awake. If you follow the same advises, and try to become a competition on Amazon, the existing sellers will leave you behind with tons of inventory at your end that becomes hard to sell off. #2 Never follow trendsWell, as you ran away from the wrong advises, do the same with the trendy items. One late movement in opting to sell a trending product, you might never know how long the trend will last, and this may result in a loss. Only get into this if you come to know the trend very early, else it's not less than a gamble with your business.Example: Fidget spinner did let most of the seller make big profits, but it’s demand graph dropped subsequently and thus incurring a big loss to the sellers.  #3 Always research the products that you are to sellThere are certain products which need a proper documentation to be done before they can be sold by any seller on Amazon. For a new seller, it is not at all recommended to hip and jump from one product to another just for documentation. It's always better to avoid such products and choose something that is easy to sell. On top of this, there are products which have a restricted barrier. Make sure you take a note of every such thing. #4 A low-quality product? Forget it!Product something that matters a lot to the customer, and reviews are something that is really hard to earn for a seller. Both these things have one thing in common - Quality. If you are selling something that has a private labeling on it, make sure that the quality of the product is intact. One low-quality product review and it might take you ages to gain the reputation back! #5 Be aware of the hidden costsUnless and until you are through with the selling structure of Amazon, never try to jump into becoming an FBA seller. Being an FBA seller involves its own hidden charges, regarding which you only come to know once you start it. It's always better to understand the entire chain first, and then begin with FBA. You can have a look at the video below to understand more about the charges involved.  These can be some of the useful insights that can be considered before hopping into becoming an Amazon FBA seller. Great lucks with your seller journey! Cheers!Stephen. Hey there! Certainly!

For many categories it’s a standard 15% referral fee. On Feb. 19 2019 there was a reduction in referal fees for several categories. Health & Beauty and Grocery being some of the changes. For products up to $10, the referral fee is only 10%. That’s a 50 cent jump from 9.99 to 10.00. So there’s one way to reduce fees is to see if there’s any jump in referral fee from price to price so you can adjust your product prices accordingly. Sometimes Amazon will also offer you a referal fee reduction if you price below a certain threshold dictated by Amazon. This is found in the pricing/Fee discounts menu on seller central. Outside of that, you’ll want to consider just including the referral fee into the cost of goods so that you know your break even point. I use the following formula to determine our floor price, which is our break even point for selling a product. Floor = (Wholesale Cost + Shipping)/.85 Dividing by .85 gets the entirety of the 15% referral fee. This is the mathematical approach that is correct. Don’t be fooled by multiplying it by 1.15%, it’ll lead you the wrong direction. We sell 20k units a day, those few cents make a difference. 1",2021-03-07T02:24:54.321Z,"What are some tips for reducing category-related referral fees when selling on Amazon via either FBA or Seller-Fulfilled Prime?

Now, when it comes to analyzing what needs to be sold on Amazon if you are an FBA seller, this has become a lot easier compared to earlier days. There are tools which can be used for the same e.g. JungleScout, etc. To begin with, let me first define Amazon FBA in short...Amazon FBA is a streamlined program where a seller stores their commodities at Amazon's warehouses or fulfillment centers. This enables Amazon to handle customer service, shipping, returns, etc. A complete process that provides an ease to the seller.  Now, let’s take a quick glance at how you can decide on what products can be sold on Amazon being an FBA seller… Product Criteria> Price Point: $20-$70> Amazon Best Sellers Rank (BSR): Between 500-5,000 (BSR in the top-level, not a sub-category)> Weight: 3lbs and below-Number of Reviews: Less than 500 reviews What is Best Seller Rank (BSR)?Amazon's Best Sellers Rank or BSR is a statistical figure on ‘Amazon.com’. It is an average calculation based on the selling and ratings. If a seller has a lower BSR (which is good), means that it has more transactions compared to the sellers with higher BSR and same products category. Some basic guidelines to find the best products to sell on Amazon: Make sure that the product is light in weight, smaller in size, and easy to carry. This can be a high-selling product if you are an FBA seller.Planning to sell electronics? Well, they come with a headache of being returned often, comparatively. If you are really serious about electronics, make sure that you have a good product description and a bunch of FAQs ready. Prefer products which have a little-to-no explanation of setup or further maintenance.If at all you are planning to sell something that is consumable, well, even these products carry the same headache as electronics. But yes, supplements are something that can take you towards profitability. But again, you can face severe returns, so be prepared.Now, if you are selling something that is made out of premium quality material e.g. leather, stainless steel, or wood, being an FBA seller you will grab an amazing chance to stand out from other products that are listed. It's simple, list lesser products, and keep a narrower margin of errors.Well, now considering a few observations, I have kept the below products in the category of ‘my favorites’… Kitchen and Dining:This category has been a favorite for JungleScout as well. It's been noticed that the kitchenware is highly sold. There can be plenty of reasons for the same - restaurants, housewives, etc. Not only are there various products related to this category to sell, but kitchenware is something that needs quick replacements (an assumption). Sports equipment:Sports equipment, although, are not selling as high as the kitchenware, but have some amazing pictures to choose from. Toys and Games:Although toys are something that we are all not crazy about, there are exceptions (am talking about myself :P). PC games and board games are trending, and so can be included in your desired list of selling things on Amazon. Well, am seriously hoping that this answer would have helped.

As long as you have a good training and mindset,you can build a sustainable business on Amazon. Here is how almost all you need to know about selling on Amazon: Basics:A.

Just go on over to Google play, download Amazon Seller App and use it while you are scanning. How Amazon seller app is used?  Well. This app is used to scan items in Retail Stores,at your house and for selling purposes like checking your Amazon seller account especially sales (I think every seller likes to do this and you would too if you were selling),… B. Retail Arbitrage: This is where you go to retail stores and find deals (profitable products). You can build a true business by just doing Retail Arbitrage if you know how to do it right. And to know how to do retail Arbitrage is by learning it. Fortunately,you can learn how to Retail Arbitrage from here: C. Online Arbitrage: This is almost the opposite of Retail Arbitrage. You don't go to Retail Stores,but instead stay at home and shop on online stores like eBay, Alibris,..and Amazon itself. To succeed with Online Arbitrage,you have to be constantly updated on what's going on with Amazon ,how many sellers are in stock on the product you want to sell and how many unites do they have. What’s the downside of Online Arbitrage? Unfortutely Online Arbitrage can be very competitive since everyone that has internet access can too get access to deals that you are exposed to. How succeed with Online Arbitrage?  Well. Literally,you need to check the stock to see how many offers on Amazon already before you buy anything so that you won't have your inventory sitting for days at Amazon's Fulfillment centers (remember that you pay storage fees). You can use tools like howmany chrome extension and other tools as well to see Amazon sellers' inventory levels. My best recommended source of learning Online Arbitrage is: D. Wholesale: This is where you can make even more money . Why ? Well. With wholesale,it means that you have accounts with suppliers that are able to give you access to profitable and replenishable inventory again and again. I recommend you take a look to this wholesale training to learn how to do Wholesale on Amazon: Amazing Wholesale Strategies For Amazon Sellers 2. Advanced A. Product Partenering: I mean you can sell other people's products for free and make money for you and for them. You don't have to have any inventory at all,just make sure you know the basics of selling on Amazon and find someone who has a stock of inventory sitting and selling slowly. If you have little to no money or you want to create multiple sources of income streams,I suggest to take advantage of Product Partenering (sometimes Amazon seller accounts get suspended due to some reasons,but if you have product parteners you will make money even if your account is suspended just because you use more seller accounts and only yours is suspended). Fortunately ,I have an article that's talking about this concepts of selling on Amazon without inventory: B. Product bundles: if you can create unique and hard to duplicate bundles and make them rank well,you can make as much money as how many bundles you have . I mean you are unlimited to how much money you can make with bundles and there are an unlimited amount of bundles you can create. Oftentimes,you will see Amazon saying things like : frequently bought together, customers who bought this also bought this,..you should take advantage of these messages and create bundles for those products. Again, another article about bundling is published on my website and you can read it easily: How to Bundle Products on Amazon C. Performance inventory: I mean to use a very proven product research technic. Some sellers say words like “ my inventory isn't selling”,… the point is,they didn't do keyword research before ordering their products from China and they are now concerned when their products aren't selling. They just check how competitive the niche is, what is the average review count and other things,but unfortunately they forget the very important thing of selling a product on Amazon: profitable Keywords. Unless you do keyword reseaech at first and find if there profitable ones to move on or to go with another product,it will be much tougher to build a multi-million business on Amazon. Finding profitable Keywords is very important before you even think about sourcing your product. This steps tells you how profitable the Keywords are and how much traffic they can bring in. This way you are able to know how many unites you need to order in X time period so you don't have to overorder or order less but you use the money to launch another product or pay for sponsored ads.

When you want to ship products from China to Amazon FBA, you have two options. The first is to have the products sent directly from the supplier to Amazon’s warehouses, or to have them sent to you/a US-based fulfillment company first. Each option has its pros and cons and in this post we will discuss both. Pros & Cons of Shipping Directly to Amazon FBA Shipping directly to the FBA warehouses from China offers a few pros, but realistically more cons than it is worth. For example, shipping direct brings less transit time, but also widens the window for errors and quality control issues. We will discuss each pro and con below. Less Transit Time Shipping directly from your supplier to Amazon FBA comes with the benefit of less transit time for your products as they go from manufacturing to customers. This is great if you are in a time crunch and want to get your items to the warehouse and out again as fast as possible. However, by not stopping at a fulfillment company (or yourself) first, you are losing out on critical quality control. Duties & Freight must be Prepaid Shipping hundreds of products can get expensive and Amazon knows this, which is why they pay for absolutely none of those costs. In fact, if you send them a shipment and they get charged any amount of money for it, they will reject the shipment all together and you will still be stuck with the bill (plus all the extra costs). If you are intent on shipping to Amazon FBA directly, you will need to ensure that your products are Delivered Duty Paid (DDP), which basically means you are responsible for all of the costs associated with transporting your goods (shipping, insurance, duties etc.). Unable to Inspect Products prior to Arrival at Amazon The biggest (and potentially most business-damaging) pitfall of shipping from China directly to FBA warehouses is that you are unable to run proper quality control/inspection on your products. While many sellers enlist the help of third party inspection companies, there are still a staggering amount of errors that happen when your products do not have that secondary set of checks. When errors do get through, it could lead to unhappy customers, refunds, and (worst of all for an online business) a ton of negative reviews. Pros & Cons of Using a 3rd Party Fulfillment Company The alternative to shipping directly to Amazon is using a US-based third party fulfillment company or sending the items to yourself first. In most cases however, sellers do not have the time to manually inspect their own products, and opt to use a third party company instead. This saves them time, money, and decreases the chance for errors and rejected shipments; but also increases the amount of time products take to arrive at the warehouses. Shipments take Longer to Arrive at Amazon The biggest con that comes with using a third party fulfillment company to handle your shipments is the added time it will take for the products to reach the FBA warehouses. The time difference occurs because the middleman must first receive your products, prepare them, and then send them to Amazon. In general this will add about a week – two weeks to the time it will take your products to get to FBA compared to shipping directly from China. Increased Quality Control Having an extra set of eyes checking your products before they arrive to FBA can mean the difference between customer complaints/rejected shipments and everything going smoothly. This increase in quality control is one of the primary reasons many FBA sellers choose to use a fulfillment company as a buffer between suppliers in China and Amazon, and is the recommended choice for beginners and those who want a decrease in rejected shipments. Reduction in Rejection by FBA While Amazon’s packaging and labeling requirements aren’t terribly stringent, they do want individual items to have scannable barcodes (FNSKU’s) and each box to have a carton label attached. If mistakes are made, they will generally correct them for you, but you will be charged. Third party fulfillment companies do the labeling for you, which decreases error rate at the warehouses and ultimately will save you money. They also eliminate the need to organize shipping costs, which ensures that products do not arrive at Amazon with an outstanding balance (meaning your shipment will not get rejected from the warehouse). When to use a China to FBA Middleman The decision is ultimately up to you and what is best for your business. Below are summaries of the two options discussed above. Option 1: Ship Directly to FBA Ship directly to FBA if you: Are shipping a relatively low quantity of itemsHave worked with your supplier for a long time (and trust them)Utilize a third party inspection company overseas that does a good jobHave calculated the costs and know it will be cheaper to ship directlyOption 2: Use a Reliable Third Party Company Consider calling a middleman if you: Are new to the industryAre sending large quantities of products at a timeWant to eliminate shipment rejectionWant a structured shipping scheduleConsider eliminating packing errors a top priorityHave calculated the costs and find it cheaper to ship to a middlemanWant a free quote for shipping from China to Amazon FBA?

Smart product selection, choose a good product. Now let me talk about what you need to do in each step. Everyone knows that choosing a good product is very important. How to choose a good product in 2020? You have to choose a product that you can improve or that you are particularly familiar with or that you have a special supply chain advantage. In short, you have to have experience in this type of product. You can spend an hour or two looking for the product after get off work every day. If you do it full-time, you can spend 8 hours a day looking for it for a week or two. Amazon is not a business where you can find products in an hour. At the same time, I use jungle scout to find it. This software is also recommended by me. Based on my 3 years of experience as Amazon, this software is also one of the most accurate data. The product must have a certain demand (higher than 5k-10k sales demand), low evaluation (at most, only one seller can have more than 1000 reviews. Unless you can greatly modify the product) Example (maybe your job is to sell beauty products, you know beauty well, you can focus on beauty products, find some products with high demand and low reviews, and build a good brand around them) 2. Analyze your product opportunities Taking a comprehensive consideration of the opportunity index of this product, is there sufficient demand (monthly sales) for this product? Is this product in the rising period or the falling period? How about the competition, if you join, can you break the market and gain a place? Can you add or modify some special features to make this product better? Is there a patent for this product? If there is a patent, can you find a different or even better look? Does this product have the possibility of expanding other products (under the same brand)? Is this product just a hot product for a while? Can you brand this product well or say that this product is just toilet paper or something, 1 sheet, 2 sheets,-100 sheets, you have no room for branding. 3. Create a good brand. Imagine you are the owner of Apple. How would you build a brand? Create a professional logo, product photo, product built-in card, A+ page You can go to UPwork to find some better part-time jobs to help you do these things. Examples of good brands are：  4.listing and launch While waiting for your product to be produced, you can start listing. Take a look at your first few listings for similar purposes, how they wrote product listings, what methods did they use to write this listing, and whether their copywriting is better for customers to feel substituting. Make sure your title, your bullet points and product photos are perfect Consider the pricing of your product. Compare your listing with your competitors. Your pricing is determined based on the quality of your listing. Does it make customers feel that your product is a high-quality product. You can start to open ppc at the very beginning, and use the early review program to get the first few reviews. After 5-10 reviews, ppc will start to make a profit. Your natural orders will slowly increase (about 3-4 weeks) and now your product sales will slowly increase, and you will slowly reach 300 US dollars a day. Which is 100,000 dollars a year 5. At this time you will start to expand your brand. At this point, your product has 5-10 reviews. Your sales are already good You need more products, knowing that you have at least 3-5 products under your brand. There are many people who don’t know the frequency of listing products, they may use 5 at once. Then panic. The first one you have to do so many listings, so many pictures, so many orders, and then sacrifice the quality of each product, the last product will not succeed. My suggestion is to use one product a month to make sure that all aspects of this product are perfect. Even if you sell 5 products a day, and you have 3-5 products, there are more than ten or twenty orders, and you have several thousand dollars in profit every month.

Once you’ve found a potential product, you need to work out how much it will cost to source/manufacture. Manufacturing - Contact various suppliers and factories on wholesale websites or locally to find someone suitable to make your product. First-timers may want to stick to Alibaba to find suppliers that make the same or similar items already for ease. Selling - Lastly, you need to create a great listing that will attract your customers, think amazing photos and great descriptions that blow your competition out the water.

I have done everything from local businesses to mail order to a wide array of internet businesses. I started selling on Amazon about 6 years ago and it is by far the best business opportunity I have ever seen. That will not change in 2020 and will only grow bigger. Here’s why. Amazon is the Google of e-commerce. The vast majority of consumers go to Amazon when looking to purchase just about anything online. They have built massive authority and having access to sell on their platform gives you a huge advantage as you can leverage that authority for yourself. People trust Amazon. They don’t trust new businesses or brands that they have never heard of. When you sell on Amazon, most people think they are buying from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller. They trust Amazon so they in turn trust you, which is something that would take years to build on your own, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars in branding and marketing. Amazon customers convert ridiculously high. The standard conversion rate for cold traffic that you get from Google, Facebook and other platforms is 1–3%. The worst conversion rate I have with internal Amazon traffic is 10%, with many getting 20–30% and some as high as 40–50%. Let me give you an example of how huge that is for you as a seller. Let’s say your product has a $10 profit per unit and you are paying $.50 per click for traffic. That’s not realistic as it is usually much higher than that but let’s say you pulled off a miracle and got it. Let’s also say you were on the high end of conversion rates at 3%. For cold traffic from Facebook, Google, etc. you would pay $50 for every 100 clicks. You would get 3 sales which at a $10 profit margin would earn you $30. You spent $50 to acquire that $30 profit. Congratulations, you just lost money. Now let’s say that you had a product on Amazon that performed like my worst converting product on Amazon at 10%. You used Amazon’s ppc program to get internal traffic and paid the same rate of $.50 per click. For every 100 clicks you would make 10 sales. At a $10 profit per unit, that would be $100 in net profits. You spent $50 to acquire the traffic. Congratulations, you just made $50. Amazon gives you free marketing. This isn’t always the case but most of the time it is. Let me explain. If you have a successful product that is selling well and converting well, you make money and Amazon makes money. Their algorithm recognizes this and starts placing your product in frequently bought together sections on other product pages, gives out Amazon’s Choice badges, and gives your product placement in many other areas. This costs you nothing and can literally double or triple your sales overnight. Here’s the catch. As with most good things, there is a catch. Selling on Amazon is very competitive. It’s not as easy as it was 2–3 years ago and if you just jump right in without proper training, quite honestly you will probably get your lunch ate, for a lack of a better term. Don’t rely on free information from YouTube and other online outlets. Most of that information is outdated and doesn’t work anymore. Amazon makes changes all the time. You need up to date and current information from a current and successful seller, which is very hard to find as many unsuccessful sellers saw the money to be made in courses and went that route instead. You also need advanced strategies that can’t be found for free on YouTube and other online outlets, so you can get an unfair advantage over your competitors, which is a necessity in 2020 and beyond. I don’t have a course but I recommend this one because it meets all of the criteria I mentioned above and costs about 10 times less than all the others. You might even get it for free if you are already using one of the Amazon seller software suite tools that most successful sellers are already using, including myself.

By increasing the unit price, you can easily increase your ability to earn millions of dollars through sales.Unbranded (with brand potential). Get higher profitability.Low competition. Get the opportunity to enter the market.Low seasonality. Look for products that can be sold throughout the year and not limited to seasonal sales.No legal issues: Avoid picking up products with trademarks or legal issues.These are just the most basic standards, which can help us define a range, and we do not need to conduct research on products outside this range. So beyond that, how should we conduct Amazon FBA product research? 1. Check the Amazon BSR, but what data do we have to look at? The BSR is less than 5000, and the products with low BSR have better sales volume than the products with high BSR, then you can choose the product with a lower BSR. Think about it, if you choose the product with the higher BSR, and do the best, will you sell much more？No！ Or when the rankings are the same, we'd better choose the products with more reviews. For example, we searched on AmzChart for Video Camera products with a recent BSR, and there are many choices in the search results.  At this time, we saw the products that the ranking all rose from 10 to 9, but the number of comments differed greatly. The product with more reviews has better sales. But from the chart, we can see that although the first two have the same number of comments, the number of sellers are different. In comparison, we will choose the product with fewer sellers.  Of course, we still have some other data for reference, such as the BSR change curve, the growing trend of reviews, etc.   2. After you have selected a certain type of product, we can search for it on Google Trends. Take a look at the recent trends of such products. Let's take the Video Camera as an example. From the figure, we can see that this word has been trending higher in the near future. It is a good choice.  3. In addition, you can also check your competitors. Search Amazon to find out how many sellers of this type of product are. If there are too many, it indicates that the competition for this product is too high.  4. Talk to your current suppliers to see if there are any products in their channels that sell well recently. Hope these can help you. First of all, we have to clarify the standard of product selection, and then we can conduct product research.

People want to know their success secrets while clearing their doubts and misconceptions. Without any doubt, selling on Amazon can be a rewarding experience for anyone. You have to understand the policies and strategies to become a successful seller. Amazon offers two types of seller account a professional seller account and an individual account.

After creating a seller account, you may wonder where to start on Amazon. Here are a few strategies that can be helpful for you. Source Products to Trade on Amazon  In the first step, you have to source valuable items to sell on this platform. Some sellers prefer traditional models, such as reselling wholesale products or selling their own manufactured goods. You can work beyond traditional methods by sourcing products in different creative ways. For instance: Retail arbitrage:It needs low startup cost and good for small and startup sellers. Private label:You may have to incur medium – high cost on private labeling. It is a useful method for brands and established sellers. Reselling wholesale goods:This method is best for established sellers. You have to make the medium-high investment in this method. Drop shipping:It needs low startup cost and suitable for experienced or startup drop shippers. Handmade and manufacturing:Any established manufacturer or artisans can consider this option. Amazon Product Listings  Every Amazon seller can successfully use two ways to generate product listings. You may add items to current product listings or create one new listing for each item. Adding new items to current listings is an easy way for new sellers. Before creating a new listing, you must check other shoppers on Amazon. If someone is already selling these products, you can manually add your items to a current listing in the central dashboard of the seller. Match and Monitor Pricing Profitably  Before adding products to current Amazon listings, you must understand that you have sales competition. Top sellers use Amazing Reprice tool to match and monitor competitor’s prices and avoid wars of expensive prices. This tool can automatically track prices and compete for 24/7 offers. As a competitor fluctuate his/her pricing, the BQool Repricer can automatically adjust the cost of your products. Fulfill Amazon Orders  A significant step on Amazon is transporting orders. Amazon is all about customer satisfaction, and they require you to fill orders on right time. If you are unable to do this, you will have lousy seller rating. To avoid bad score, you can ship orders personally or outsource shipping task. Conclusion This article is enough to get the answer of “how do you sell on Amazon?” No doubt, Amazon is a great platform that welcomes every seller to sell his/her products online. Amazon can be a challenging marketplace, so competition is ferocious. You must find unique and profitable products to sell on Amazon to stay alive in the competition.

Even then, it is going to be hard. Let’s assume “multi-millionaire” means you finish 2017 with $2M (or more) of incremental wealth based solely on selling products on Amazon and that you are starting from near scratch today. Let’s further assume you’ve found a product category where you can gross 50% margins on original sales. Let’s also assume you magically finish 2017 with $0 of inventory left, meaning none of your earnings/capital is tied up in product at year-end, rather, you’ve sold it all at the rates I outlined above. Let’s also assume you are selling in a category where you pay Amazon 15% of sales, you are using FBA 100% and that costs you 6% of sales all-in, and you spend 4% of sales on in-bound logistics, legal, accounting, etc. Let’s also assume you’ve somehow done all of this with 0% cost of capital (i.e.: you aren’t borrowing money on a credit card to buy your inventory). How do you get to $2M net profits? For those assumptions, you have 75% of revenue going to COGS and SG&A (50% COGS, 15% selling fees, 6% fulfillment/freight, and 4% other), leaving you 25%. This is probably unrealistically high. With that said, this means you are netting 25%, thus $2M of “wealth” would require $8M in sales. Doable, but hard. Now, let’s add some reality… Returns. Depending on what you sell, your returns rate could be 5%, 10%, or 20%+. You’ll incur return shipping costs (especially if/when Amazon goes to free returns in key categories like apparel), Amazon only returns 80% of your original selling fees, you’ll incur return processing costs at the DC, and you won’t be able to resell the product for the same price (on average). Let’s assume this adds another 5% overall expense to the business. Your 25% net profit rate just fell to 20%, so your top-line sales just moved from $8M to $10M to hit your $2M wealth target. Capital. If you turn your inventory 12x a year and you have 50% product margins, you’re going to need $400k+ in inventory at any point in time. 12x turns is pretty unusual. Even more unusual would be to have it be flat during the year. Let’s call it 6 turns. So, ~$800k+ in inventory. But you need to have 1.5x that during Nov/Dec, so $1.2M+ in inventory. What’s your cost of capital? 5%? So, $40k for your base inventory and then another $7–8k for Nov/Dec? That ~$50k in capital expense now requires another $250k+ in sales to pay for it… Margins vs. Velocity vs. Fulfillment costs. It is tough to find a category with 50% gross margins, high enough AURs to have fulfillment expenses < 10% (never mind the 6% I used), and high enough demand to drive $10.25M+ in annual sales for a newcomer. And… and… and… Yes, but your odds of winning a major lottery are probably higher, unless you have some exclusive, profitable, “gotta have it” product ready to launch and sell. Even then, it is going to be hard.

Amazon allows self ship as well as offers its own shipping service called as Easy Ship.Packing: Amazon sells its own branded packaging material, which you can purchase from Amazon and also from Amazon (if you require GST bill).There are some online calculators that you can check for aprx idea of selling, but i found most of them using outdated commission rates.
