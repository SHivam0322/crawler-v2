The engineer is focused on the technical aspects of how it gets made.  Their primary output is technical drawings, fixtures, jigs, mold design, tolerances, and specifications.   An industrial designer comes up with the initial concepts.  They figure out what the general look and style of the product should be, and generate many sketches that explore all the materials, colors, shapes, and features that are possible.  They explore the interaction between the product and the consumer and try to make the design something that is both attractive and usable.  The designer is focused on the overall experience of the consumer.  Their primary output is sketches, renderings, models and prototypes. A skilled designer makes the work for the engineer much easier.  They will have chosen materials and shapes that already close to what is feasible.  A skilled production engineer takes a good idea and makes it come to life. In some situations, you only need one or the other.  With complex designs, like consumer electronics, you typically need both, although the engineer is more likely to get involved after the design has left the conceptual stage.

If you have an idea and it is simple (ie just a phone case), you could probably hire a freelance industrial designer to generate CAD files that you could take to a manufacturer. Don't expect much help from the designer during the transfer to manufacturing, that generally is not their sweet spot. Core77 / industrial design magazine + resource / home is a good place to look for such people. If you have an idea and it has non-trivial mechanical elements, you will most likely want to involve a freelance engineer as well. These are more difficult to find. You may get lucky and find an industrial designer who is detail-oriented and has enough experience in the details to develop the tricky mechanical elements. Such a designer would probably be valuable during the transfer to manufacturing. Instead of trying to stitch together various freelancers, you could go to a firm. They will have both designers and engineers (Core77 also has a design directory, listing a bunch of firms in various parts of the country. I can offer specific recommendations in Boston, New York, and San Francisco) and should be able to take your design as far as it needs to go. The cost for these people is not trivial. I would venture (depending on the freelancer/firm/ you go with) anywhere from 75-200/hr. You are almost undoubtedly best off developing your idea yourself as much as you can (at least to the point where you can vividly articulate it) such that you give the people you are paying by the hour a good starting point to jump off from. From there, start with industrial design to flesh out a few concepts, see which ones you like, then go through engineering to get that concept ready for mass production.",2021-03-06T08:18:32.020Z,"How does one go about meeting industrial product design engineers?

Both can't function without each other's input. Design is a field which lies between Art and engineering. A very thin line. If you go all aesthetics, in that case that product is just a show piece and if you go to the engineering side, then it's all about functionality. The emotional side of the product is dead in that case. A good product is a balance of both. Aesthetics and functionality.

This product map is reviewed by engineering to define estimates of capital, manufacturing issues, and interaction with other product managers.This product plan is reviewed by management or the overall product or division head to determine what is acceptable and what is not.This product plan typically will cover several years, and must be updated regularly as technology and competition changes. Once the plan as been approved for the next period, it is turned over to engineering to develop prototypes, work out details with suppliers and partners, and develop manufacturing estimates. Once a final design is done, it is turned over to software engineering and manufacturing to implement production, and to marketing to develop marketing and business partnership plans.

In most of the cases, it is a good practice to use the one that is built with the CAD software used to ensure the maximal interoperability and automatization of non-productive tasks.  Image: Solidworks Simulation There is also the need for a finite element software for material resistance. Most Engineers use the one included in the CAD software but some specialize and can use advanced tools such as ANSYS.  Image: Moldflow There is other specialized simulation software that depends on the exact field that the engineers specialize in (in any). I.e. MoldFlow for injection molding simulation.  Image: Jupiter notebook with Python Many calculi are still done manually. Most of the engineers use Excel (arrg…) but some use scientific programming languages Matlab, Python or Julia, as a more advanced tool. I also know lots of engineers who kept using a school portable scientific calculator.  Image: Microsoft Word Of course, engineers need support for writing specifications and reports. Most use Word, PowerPoint, and Excel (or the free LibreOffice). Some use specialized tools included in the CAD software for tasks like control specifications. Some companies deploy wikis for documentation with tools like Microsoft Sharepoint, Google sites, XWiki or even Mediawiki.  Image: Wrike A project management tool is needed. Too many engineers rely on Excel for tasks lists and Gantt charts and Outlook (or other mail systems) for communication. Sometimes they use a free Gantt tool like GanttProject. Big projects can use Microsoft Project. Beware that it is an extremely heavy tool. Serious companies rely on advanced project management platforms like Wrike, Assana, ProjectPlace, Clarizen, Mavenlink, TeamGantt…  Image: Odoo Of course, product design engineers need to to work with the Entreprise Ressource Planning software of the entreprise. Such software includes SAP, Netsuites, SAGE, Microsoft Dynamics, Odoo… When a PLM software is deployed, the engineers will mostly use it and the data will flow through the ERP.  Image CC BY btwashburn Engineers need a workbench. Yes, a physical one to work on prototypes. Having access to basic tooling machines like mechanical lathes, milling and surface grinding is useful because it can take one month to get a tooled part from a local manufacturer.  Image : Ultimaker 3D printing machines are widely used for prototyping nowadays. It is way more simple to rely on external services like Shapeways, 3DHub, Sculpteo or i.materialise. However, it can take a week or two to get the parts and time is running fast during prototyping. Local 3D printing services can usually deliver in a couple of days. Having a desktop 3D printer implies some maintenance but is ideal to have the parts in one day. An engineer uses different tools in his job. I’m an industrial designer but I’m working on projects from A to Z nowadays so I have a good view of that.  Image: Solidworks The most obvious one is the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. Here in French most of the engineers use Solidworks, the ones who work in automotive or aerospace use CATIA and some use CREO. Other common softwares include Inventor and Fusion 360.

Presentations are then made to upper management to get their approval to proceed. A schedule is created resources are allocated and work begins. Product design phase The design is implemented in great detail. The majority of the time is spent doing design work with periodic design reviews with customers and upper management, Prototype manufacture The design is released to manufacturing to implement a small production run. Time is spent with manufacturing personal to discuss problems or to resolve problem issues. Time is also spent with test equipment development to assure that test equipment development will be able sufficient for the product. Once the prototypes are available they are tested to determine if they work to specification, they are capable of being manufactured and key customers are sampled to get their reaction. Depending where you are in the design cycle you will either be in meetings discussing the anticipated product, making progress reports to customers and management. Once the product is released to manufacturing you will spend time with manufacturing engineers to smooth out manufacturing. This is a quick summary of what a product design engineer does.

But they have a more intrinsic sense of “wanting to learn” rather than “scoring good grades”. The fraction of students who take up a course because they think they will learn something interesting in that, is much larger in USA than in India. This includes courses in entirely different disciplines.This is not necessarily advantageous or disadvantageous to either set of students, however. I India, one of the main targets at the end of education is finding a “good” job. And to be fair, companies do look at the numbers on your transcript then. Obtaining a ‘C’ in “The History of Music” will hurt you a lot more in India than USA.  ·        A lot of universities in USA will offer undergrads the chance to choose/change their major at the end of first year (or in some cases, even a bit later). This does happen in India as well, but the chances are much lower. Only the students at the top of their batches get an opportunity to do it! Thus, in USA, you can take a variety if courses and then choose what stream you want to follow. ·        Research is a much more integral part of engineering/science education here. Most undergrads would have had significant research experience at the university, as well as some industry exposure, by the time they graduate. This is in strong contrast to India, where even the final year projects are at most times, not nearly as rigorous! Coming to graduate school, this difference further grows. A number of reasons including lower interests shown by both the faculty and the students, far lesser opportunities, lower standard of research infrastructure, and a huge surplus of students compared to the number of available projects, heavily load the situation against the Indian engineering output.  ·        There is a much larger stress on theoretical aspects in India.  The overall course content, for most parts, is larger in India as compared to equivalent courses in USA. Examinations are far more stressful. In USA, there is, in general, a much larger continuous assessment component. There are assignments throughout the semester, and students do take them much more seriously than India. They work through the assignments much harder than most Indian students. The laws against plagiarism are much stricter. In case of exams, the Indian system is much more rigorous. In USA, a lot of exams are open-book and/or open-notes (and in some cases, open internet access as well!). Thus, the need to learn formulae is way lower! In India, this does happen, but to a much smaller extent.  ·        Though not restricted to engineering, the students in USA in general are much freer and do their undergrads with a target of discovering what they like, and how they want their life to pan out with! A lot of them do part-time jobs at multiple places. The whole culture is much more relaxed than in India. However, when they do find something to work upon that they like, they pursue that with endless passion. Overall, they choose whatever they want to learn, and learn it well. And I would guess this makes their undergrad experience much more fulfilling than their Indian counterparts, who have the target (and thus, pressure) of either earning a good job or getting into another reputed higher educational program (MS/PhD/MBA, etc.).PS:  I have used the terms “USA” and “America” interchangeably here. Wherever I mentioned America, please assume USA only (though a large part of this answer may be true for Canada too, I suspect!) PPS:  These are just observations!

Question No.06 What are the various phases of design process? Answer: The various phases of design process are: Recognition of need.Definition of problemSynthesisAnalysis and optimizationEvaluationPresentationQuestion No.07 What are the different types of loads that can act on machine components? Answer: Different loads on machine components are: Steady load.Variable load.Shock loadImpact load.Question No.08 What are the factors affecting endurance strength. Answer: Factors affecting endurance strength are Load ii. Surface finishSizeTemperatureImpactReliabilityQuestion No.09 What are the types of variable stresses? Answer: Types of variable stresses are: Completely reversed or cyclic stressesFluctuating stressesRepeated stressesQuestion No.10 Differentiate between repeated stress and reversed stress. Answer: Repeated stress refers to a stress varying from zero to a maximum value of same nature. Reversed stress of cyclic stress varies from one value of tension to the same value of compression. Question No.11 What are the types of fracture? Answer: The two types of fracture are Ductile fractureBrittle fractureQuestion No.12 Distinguish between brittle fracture and ductile fracture. Answer: In brittle fracture, crack growth is up to a small depth of the material. In ductile fracture large amount of plastic deformation is present to a higher depth. Question No.13 Define stress concentration and stress concentration factor. Answer: Stress concentration is the increase in local stresses at points of rapid change in cross section or discontinuities. Stress concentration factor is the ratio of maximum stress at critical section to the nominal stress Question No.14 Explain size factor in endurance strength. Answer: Size factor is used to consider the effect of the size on endurance strength. A large size object will have more defects compared to a small one. So, endurance strength is reduced. If K is the size factor, then Actual endurance strength = Theoretical endurance limit x K Question No.15 Explain Griffith theory. (Or) State the condition for crack growth. Answer: A crack can propagate if the energy release rate of crack is greater than crack resistance. Question No.16 What are the modes of fracture? Answer: The different the modes of fractures are: Mode I (Opening mode) – Displacement is normal to crack surface.Mode II (Sliding mode) – Displacement is in the plane of the plate.Mode III (Tearing mode) – Out of plane shear.Question No.17 What are the factors to be considered in the selection of materials for a machine element? Answer: While selecting a material for a machine element, the following factors are to be considered Required material propertiesManufacturing easeMaterial availabilityCostQuestion No.18 What are various theories of failure?

Does it perform the task it is meant to? Does it interface with the components around it in an acceptable way? The tools they are most likely to be proficient in include an engineering level CAD package (CATIA, Creo/ProE, NX, Solidworks, etc.), one or more Finite Element Analysis packages (ANSYS, PATRAN, etc.), and other math / simulation software such as Matlab / Simulink.

(Side note: Design houses are hurting these days becuase venture captial money isn’t flowing nearly as much as it did a couple years ago for hardware startups.) On the other hand, there are plenty of engineers who have built products from beginning to end who freelance or who do work on the side. I have met and hired many reputable engineers and designers on sites like Upwork. I intutitively look for the things I know will make our working relationship doable becuase I myself am a product engineer. Remember you should always test your product before finding and hiring an engineer. An example is getting face to face with potential customers and asking them what their biggest pain points about X (the problem your trying to solve with your product). Additionally, getting a potential customer to pre-pay for your product there on the spot is a great indicator that your product is real. Here are some of the biggest sticking points when it comes to interviewing someone on Upwork. (Or the like) Understand their portfolio: designers will post a bunch of pictures on their profile showing their work but they may or may not actually have had a significant responsiblity on that project. See how deep their knowledge goes. Ask them how long a project did, what they were responsible for, what problems they ran intoUnderstand their skills: there are different types of engineers for different portions of your project. If you want to first design a beautiful, yet functional enclosure, likely you should get with an industrial designer first before finding a mechanical engineer. The mechanical engineer and electrical engineer (if you require electronics0 part come later when you want to start designing the product for production. Don’t ever assume that one person can build the whole design for you. There are some unicorns out there but they are few and far between.Understand their time commitment: for my previous project I decided to go on an hourly basis becuase I really didnt know how long I needed their time. This does mean though that they generally have to commit to other people to keep their income at a reasonable level. I suggest you do the same unless you have a very well defined product and you know how long it’s going to take to make a prototype of.Know your requirements: you need to know your product in order to convey it to the person on the other side of the skype call (or table if you’re in person). I highly recommend you put together some type of requirements documetation stating how your proposed product works before ever going to find someone to make it for you. Putting everything you’re imagining down on paper is going to save you a ton of time later on.Know who owns the intellectual propery: this is a sticky part. I once won a hackathon and was offered consulting services from a product design firm. At first I thought it was awesome, but soon we found that the consulting firm was not willing to do the work without having rights to the intellectual property putting us in a tight spot. We decided to not go forward with them because of this. For sites like Upwork, the intellectual property rights gets transferred after you pay your contractor. Until then your engineer owns the rights to the work they did until you pay.Finding a good engineer is tough but with some patience and know how you can assemble a great team.

As a designer, you have to get comfortable building on top of abstractions you don’t fully trust, while simultaneously trying to understand them better. As a hyper rational math/cs person I found this really hard at first. I’ll explain what I mean in much more detail soon. Now, since perception and psychology are the building blocks for design, they’re very easy to learn about in a field entirely outside design without realizing you’re learning them at all, e.g. in architecture or art or public speaking, or just by living life. Now, what you end up with is people who have skill at design but can’t articulate how they built it up, because they’re not learning a human-created system from scratch, they’re bringing all their unobservable knowledge of the world into their work. This is why some people have the ability to evaluate whether something is good design or not before being able to build it, and they call this taste. A lot of designers start off their careers feeling like this:  Selected panels from Ira Glass’ Advice to Beginners via Zen Pencils  Let’s dig into why this happens. The commonality in the fields is that in both you build systems [1] to accomplish goals using some building blocks. For example an engineer writes a few lines of code to output the fibonacci sequence. def fibRec(n):     if n < 2:         return n     else:         return fibRec(n-1) + fibRec(n-2) This simple example above composes arithmetic, functions, recursion, etc. To even a beginner programmer this is very easy to read but what’s going on is that we’re combining rigorously defined, well documented, human created concepts to accomplish a goal. Meanwhile, a designer moves/manipulates the building blocks of text and color to accomplish the goal of warning someone on the road.  These examples may seem mundane but let’s analyze them: The color is deliberately bright red since many studies show it’s the most effective color at grabbing attention.The font is neutral and is condensed. It’s designed to be legible for short pieces of text from a distance and in the blur of rainThe sign is octagonal to be easily recognizable even when the elements of color and type don’t work, or when you see it from the other side.The building blocks with design are the rules of human perception and all the cognitive biases that come along with it, and we don’t fully understand the rules because we didn’t create them. They were handed to us by nature and culture, in ways the explanations have been forgotten to.  This mindset shift is the first thing to get comfortable with. You’re not going to learn design the same way you learnt math or programming, so get comfortable with that. With that in mind, here’s some concrete tips See lots of examples of good design. Your subconscious brain will learn to like it without you being able to compositionally explain it. Personally, for me this meant observing lots of furniture, documentaries like Helvetica, architecture, apps, signage, etc. with the attitude of trying to figure out why things work.At the same time, start learning some basics of communication design, I took one in college, but there’s plenty online for free now. They’ll start showing you some of the basic elements of visual perception and how to manipulate them. It’s really important that you do these two together. If you don’t it’ll be like reading a textbook and skipping over the exercises, you won’t really get it. And then it’s really just a matter of observing to build taste, and iterating to live up to your taste. One (admittedly fuzzy) analogy I like for explaining design to machine learning people is that you think of how something makes you feel as the objective function, the basic elements of contrast and layout and motion as the inputs, and you build things to do a forward pass, and then back-propagate the errors. Other than that, there’s already plenty of resources on the internet and I’m happy to guide you as well, but I felt like it’s much more important to get into the right mindset than any tools I can offer you here. My first job was as an engineer at Facebook, and not even remotely close to product. I worked on backend and data systems and search ranking. It was all very technical and mathematical and predictable. Then I wound up moving into product design. As a designer, you have to get comfortable building on top of abstractions you don’t fully trust, while simultaneously trying to understand them better. As a hyper rational math/cs person I found this really hard at first. I’ll explain what I mean in much more detail soon. Now, since perception and psychology are the building blocks for design, they’re v Continue Reading",2021-03-06T08:37:08.660Z,"What is the best way for an engineer to get better at product design?

However, there are some practical considerations to keep in mind when switching majors, so here are my thoughts: How far are you into the Mechanical Engineering program? Mechanical engineering is a powerful degree that opens many doors. If you are more than halfway through and making good grades, you should consider completing your degree and then pursuing industrial design as a masters degree. If possible, add iD as a minor or take some classes related to it. You can spend your free time outside of class developing your design skills so that you are a more versatile than other engineers in your program. The world needs more engineers than can also think creatively.Does your current school offer product design as a major? If not, you have to weigh the benefits of reapplying to another school and possibly starting over again. Many iD programs are studio based and you would have to complete all 4 years of their program from the beginning, regardless of how many credits you already have. And while most universities offer mechanical engineering, far fewer offer industrial design and the ones that do are very competitive and hard to get into.You said you're already good at CAD, but are you also good at sketching and freehand drawing? ""Ideation"" is a crucial part of the industrial design process. The ability to draw concepts quickly while working in a group environment is highly sought after. You can learn this, but it requires a lot of work and doesn't happen overnight. Many of the top schools will want to see a portfolio of your artwork before you can even be admitted into their program. Take a look at these sketches and think about whether this is the kind of work you want to spend hours getting good at. Notice that most of this is freehand, not CAD. (although most product designers also know and use CAD, it typically comes later in the design process). On a personal note, sketching is NOT my strong suit but I still manage to get by. I sketch just enough to get my ideas down and then do the rest in CAD (Solidworks, Rhino, Fusion360, Sketchup... I use them all). This is fine for me since I started my own company, but if I wanted to be competitive against other designers on the open market I would need much better sketching skills than I currently have (which is difficult now because I have a messed up hand). It's my single greatest weakness as a designer, but I make up for it by being an exceptional machinist, fabricator, sculptor, and technical problem solver. I'm also really good at material science and sociology- which helps a lot with UX and interface design. Sketching is the heart and soul of industrial design. Master it.Do you hate your current major? Or do you simply love industrial design more? If you find yourself hating your current program, then it sounds like you need a change regardless of whether or not that is product design. If you like your current major and are doing well at it, but want to work in product design, then there are ways you can set yourself up to be a mechanical engineer on a product development team. Find some iD students working on a project that needs a mechanical engineer and help them out using your 3D modeling skills while learning as much from them as you can. Read books on iD and practice designing products on your own. Get an internship at a company that specializes in product design. Mechanical engineering is a large field with many opportunities, but if you are committed to product design you can choose to work on projects that are more consumer product related and thus build your résumé with that as your expertise.Industrial design may seem glamorous, but designers are just part of a larger team that also includes engineers and business people so there’s more than one way to be involved in the product development process. The good news is that your current degree is closer to working in that field than if you were, for example, a ""heath and nutrition major.""

These are simply artifacts that help you along the way of understanding what your user is doing. Once you know those things, you can reevaluate their experience and redesign it. My advice is to study people and find out what is the difference between wants and needs. An example is myself, about an hour ago, I went to the store to buy coffee beans.  Map the interaction and the goal:Lets break that down: Got in the car. Drove to the store. Got out of the car. Entered the store. Selected coffee beans. Made my purchase. Headed home. Made coffee.  Procedural Goal: Get Coffee beans (tactical) Realized goal: Feeling that I am having an exquisite cup of coffee (psychological)See my world as the user as a divide: Before coffee | Coffee. How do you get me to the goal ASAP as a designer. Design for both goals. Make the procedural goal easy to get to so that I can get to the realized goal, i.e. Perfect tasting coffee.

Both designers and engineers are anything but that.   So let's figure out 'what kind of engineer and what kind of designer do we need for this project to be successful' - and how much do those cost. My assumptions: We're building this for a client. We won't own the product after launch (though you might do bug fixes). So your client is primarily buying a product of you.The website is a marketing website for the apps, not a web app version of the product. Whatever the app is, it's not technically highly advanced. If it were, you'd have a web developer (cheaper because more of a 'commodity')  working on the site, and a (more expensive, because higher demand) software engineer building the actual apps.However, the (perceived) usability of the product matters - after all, you have a UX designer taking the lead on the design, not a UI or visual designer. That suggests you'll need to do problem solving and rapid prototyping  as part of the delivery. All in 2-3 months, so they really need to know what they're doing. (as an aside, I find that both commendable and pretty unusual - great choice to push the client in this direction!)Also, the real test for this product is the rating in the app store. If users feel it sucks, your client will find out quickly and through poor reviews.Since you lack a visual designer, the UX designer will also  need to do that - including for the marketing website / landing page / visual assets for the app etc.Given the project, the client probably will care 'how it looks' (because you're pretty much building everything for them - presence and applications!).If this were my project, I'd look for a relatively experienced UX designer  who additionally has a strong background in visual designa mid-level developer to build the applications (probably using web technology)The design profile is pretty unusual: folks who can both nail UX, UI, and visual design are sought after. The developer profile is relatively speaking less scarce. Still not easy to fill, but not impossible either. In the end, I'd budget about 1:1. Maybe slightly overindex on the designer (depending on how important visual design is for my client). But, given the assumptions, I can't really see a situation where I'd pay the developer more.",2021-03-06T08:57:06.146Z,"How do you value a software engineer and product designer when splitting a contract job?

You can go with mails too but if your team agree on a space it will save you time. There is SaaS platforms that provide such services. Zoho tools, Monday.com, Wrike, Mavenlink. There is a pretty big trick when using these tools. When you are working with a team it is extremely important to keep the tools simple as hell but in the other and it is also extremely important to have tools that will adapt to your needs. Because of features are missing people will start to use Excel and may abandon the tool. The most flexible tool I tested is Wrike. There is also Smartsheet that is basically Excel with a Gantt planning and is intersting for its flexibility. My preference would go to use a platform with a lots of modules like Redmine, that is open source. It means that it cost you zero and you can personalize it extremely far even without knowing programming. Of course if you are a big company you will prefer to subcontract it to companies such as EasyRedmine and Wrike and if you are a medium company with low technical skills a very flexible solution that is still simple to use like Wrike and Smartsheet is the way to go. This is for project management. There is also other tools. Speaking of 3D modeling it is very important to use the right tools for the right uses. When I know that I will not have to struggle with heavy modifications I may drop Solidworks for Rhino. When the surface needs a lot of sculpts I may even use Blender3D. There is also several productivity tools that are linked with the management of the definition files. The most basic is PDM that is useful when you have to manage a complex portfolio of assembled products and components. I say basic but it cost is not low. It become extremely intersting when you are using it internally to a company that has an ERP because it push the information from the definition to the ERP and provide you with a single source of truth for product definition. Most PDM solutions will also include workflow tools to support your processes. Another key point is control. Making controle procedures is not as simple as circling the dimensions to control in the technical drawing. Solidworks has tools to support this that generate precise control procedure that are stored as part of the file definition. Another simple hack is to create the controle procedures with the drawing tool and store it as an annexe of the blueprints. While most people will still use Word and will end with 2 separated files to maintain with not Metadata linking. The same problem arise with technical notices. Solidworks propose a tool (composer) that let you create these notices and keep it updated in real time. I would strongly advise to use this type of tool for complex assemblies with maintenance notices. However for a simple good you may want to privilegiate a beautiful user notice and rely on the services of a graphiste.

Do not think about the product first, but think how the end-user should desire to experience it. What will make the user want to use the product repeatedly, favorably maintain it and store it when not in use. Very basic thinking but requires some study before principle design work begins. If you approach every product design project with the user experience in mind first, then it doesn't matter what your background or field of study is. You will always be able to find success entering the field of product design this way. Many people forget that products, ALL of them, interface with people at some level. Know who you're designing for and their habits, this is the essence of product design. And then the rest will follow; material engineering included.

In a nutshell:A Product Designer is mainly concerned with what features the product has and how people will interact with the product. A Software Engineer is responsible for choosing and implementing the technology that makes the product work. A rough analogy that I think is pretty accurate: if software were a building, the Product Designer would be the Architect (thinks about how the building will be used and draws up plans) and the Software Engineer would be the Builder who decides on the building materials and assembles them into what was planned.

I've seen the most beautiful or coolest projects fail because users couldn't understand how to use it or it didn't function in an expected way. Bruce makes an EXCELLENT point when he mentions ""don't let the perfect get in the way of the good.""  You need a level of flexibility and understanding of development that is more cost-based than perfection-based.  Having a product that is intuitive, effective, and attractive in a timeless style rather than trendy style is much better than going for ""perfect"" or the ""ultimate"" something. Another metaphor is thinking of it like you're a band member up until now you played one instrument and now you're able to play another. Keep a positive disposition and have the attitude that you're a ""jam band"" kind of guy who wants to jump in and co-create good music or in your case good product designs. Designing good products requires collaboration and good collaboration requires excellent communication skills which I find many people seem to overlook. I know so many really brilliant, great engineers and designers who never broke through the glass ceiling because they weren't able to collaborate or communicate well enough and some of them were seen as ""problem people"" with the ""lone genius"" attitude who had a tendency to blame others for not understanding them and their genius. There is a lot of value in learning and sharing with others. In the events of conflict learn to make it constructive and positive because on some level conflict will be a part of every project.

First off, what do you mean by “Design Jobs”. Generally speak, a design jobs refers to someone who utilizes the companies CAD software of choice to generate a 3D model for future development. The development is then performed by a specialist to manipulate the model to the specifications required by the customers. So do you want a “Design Job” in which you work with CAD software to produce a model of another specialized engineer work or do you want a job designing and creating these new products? If its the former (you want to work with CAD software and produce models) then you have already done fairly significant damage to you career. These types of positions are very very VERY entry level engineering and having a MS will make you overqualified for most of them and make you a poorer candidate than an engineer with a BS If its the latter (which I think it is) then you are on a good path. Generally speaking new product development requires more expertise and a MS degree helps with that. Usually an MS + experience will make you a pretty good candidate depending on the application and the experience (if everything is relevant than you’re in good shape). The PhD is usually taken as a measure to offset the experience you need to be a qualified candidate. They also have a tendency of making you rise the corporate ranks a bit faster than normal (but this also depends greatly on the work you produce at your firm). From what I’ve seen from my coworkers. PhD’s are obtained for one of two reasons. It’s either because they have a personal goal of obtaining the PhD or because they want to lead their own development team as a tech leader rather than a manager. If you want your hands in the proverbial muck (like I do) then there isn’t any reason to go past a MS degree and you can get more exposure by exposing yourself to more areas (hence the wide range of high level experiences I’ve gone through). However, going this route also comes with a warning, if you spread yourself out too thin (over too many branches) you will not rise in any of them. Also I would like to note that this comes from a US perspective as well and may or may not be applicable to Germany.",2021-03-06T09:29:08.830Z,"Will a PhD in mechanical engineering hurt me when looking for product design jobs in industry?

Development/Engineering will analyze the designs, raise concerns regarding certain aspects and communicate them to Design. Once an iteration is finalized, it is taken forward. During this, there are other changes that engineering will suggest based on supplier's tooling availabilities. These will again be approved by design and so on.

More importantly, it will help in communicating with designers when you would be working in a company. To design is to not just make objects that are aesthetically desirable, but also to actually and truly help the specific user in achieving their goals. This happens only when product designers do a thorough research on the user, apart from creating multiple concepts to prototype and test. As designers, we create concepts to evoke deep human emotion and behaviours, so we always focus on how the user will interact with this product and how that feels in their hands. The technology needed to achieve such a interaction or the ‘wow’ factor is worked up only after the interaction/experience itself is decided upon first. As an industrial and systems engineer, you would help to create manufacturing methods to help achieve such challenging designs. You would help in the design for manufacturing. I think it's a good minor to have. Thanks for the A2A. Hope this helps.

Below you can find a brief description of the process: The first thing you need to do is a Design Brief with all the specifications you need. Some of these are:  Marketing information: Market segment and User profile, usage scenario, intended distribution channels, Competitive landscape analysis, USP, etc. Anything that helps the designers understand the user, the market and the product segment. This will e useful to work around the USP and avoid what the competitors are already doing to create value.Technical requirements: placement (all the necessary components to fit), size, weight, durability, resistance to dust, water, battery duration, connection ports, etc. This is necessary for the industrial designers to play with the product architecture and create an underlay. The underlay is used to start the sketching phase and make sure that what is being sketched will fit to reality as close as possible. It is also necessary for the Mechanical Engineers and Electronic Engineers to do their job. If you don't have the final components you want to use (probably not), the Engineers can take care of sourcing and trying to find the right thing you need. You need to take into consideration that when going to production, some of these components might change and there could be some minor adjustments on the engineering.Design Requirements: What do you want the product to look like? What kind of brand values should it reflect? What kind of product attributes should it communicate? Desired CMF (color material and finish) you would like to use for the brand or product line, etc. How the product should interact with other products and services, how the user should interact with the product, etc, etc. etc.Limitations and constraints: What limitations you have on the organisation side (logistics, legal, etc), technical limitations, manufacturing limitations, etc, etc, etc. It needs to be super clear what NOT to do and where are the boundaries.The design agency can help you out with the brief and will organize a kick off meeting to go over every point. After that, they will create a project proposal specifying the times, deliverables and price of each phase. You do not need to have ALL the answers on the brief... just be as defined as possible because you save work from the design agency. If there is anything important to figure out, the design agency can help you out, specially during the initial research phase. Projects are organised on several phases (wich might differ depending on the designer or design agency, or the project, or the client), and the end of each phase there is a checkpoint with the client. Just as reference the phases go like this:  Ideation: Here the designers will do design research to understand the brief, competitors, industry, trends, technology, etc. There will be a lot of brainstorming ad creative thinking. At the end of these phase, the design direction will be clear. There will be usually 2 or 3 design directions. Designers could create quick foam modes to early check ergonomics and product size.Concept Phase 1: Designers will play with the components layout, create underlays and start sketching. At the end of these phase you should see nice sketches or 2D renders with the design proposals. Concept merge (not always necessary). Some times the client will like some details from one proposal 1 and others from proposal 3. Client might come up with a new idea, and during the checkpoint it will be discussed how to bring all this into one final proposal. The designers will have to take all of this into consideration and bring all the different details into harmony. (not always pleasant or easy for the designers).Concept Phase 2: On this phase the designers will create the first 3D models based on the sketches/2D renders. The best thing at the end of these phase would be to have appearance mockups. These should look like real products. As an alternative, you could try with SLA/SLS models and photo real renderings. The designers should submit the 3D files for the MEs (mechanical engineers) to start working.Refinement: There might be some adjustments on proportions, details, etc at the end of the concept phase. Also the MEs should provide feedback with their requirements and some adjustments might be needed on the design. The designers should co-work on this stage with the engineers to work around any limitation and keep the design quality. Some fine design details will be finally worked only at this stage.Implementation support: After the engineers provide the data to the vendors, there might be adjustments required for production, tooling, etc. Both the designers and Engineers should get involved to oversee the quality of pre-production and production. There will be some product tests done after initial run (safety tests, drop tests, etc) and there might be some additional work needed form the engineers and designers (if they have an impact on the design).After it goes to production... I cannot tell in detail. It is all logistics (product certifications, legals, distribution, etc.)It is all super condensed and probably I'm missing a lot of details but I hope it gives you at least an overview of what to expect.  Please let me know if you have more questions or if you need any help with the design.

So that matter is of no relevance at all. Now If you want to do M Tech in production or Industrial subjects only then you should take GATE with PI ( if you are a graduate of Production or Industrial Engg). But if you are BTech of ME then it would be sheer foolishness to take GATE in PI , because if your All India Rank is more than 25 AIR in PI GATE, you will not get any M tech course in any IIT except newer ones, till say up to AIR 40. In NITs thru CCMT, only 47 M Tech courses are availble to PI gate score holders. Almost 90% of them are pure Production or Mfg or Industrial engg M Tech courses . Out of these 47 courses only top 10 courses are worth doing ( NIT Trichy, NIT Surathkal, NIT Allahabad). Rest are just for PG degree purposes only . Campus placements are there only in NIT Surathkal and Trichy only. So if you want a job after M Tech, then you have to join only those top 2 NITs ONLY. NIT Warangal does not alllow PI people in its M Tech courses!!!. Thus in Summary, If you want to do hard work for 1 year in GATE preparation, then do not waste your time in PI in case you are Mechanical Degree holder, instead prepare with ME paper. Even If you are PI degree holder, but want to do M Tech in Design, Thermal etc core Mechanical Subjects, then it is recommended to taks GATE in ME only. Benefits of taking GATE with ME for ME graduates If all india rank is up to 600–700, Try luck in PSU job.If rank is up to 2000 try Luck in IIT , IISc and Top 3 NITs for best courses in M Tech. All options are open to ME GATE scorecard holders and not like PI guys who have restrictions on courses.More no of M Tech course choices available if GATE score is with ME paper.If your score is above 700 in GATE, trust me your future is bright.

You can only commit on one.The market analysis is discovered to be unsuficient in the middle of the project (generally during prototype presentation) and a lot of work already be done by the design & technical teams is lost. This is unavoidable in some case. A market analysis cannot be perfect. This is why you have to rush to prototypes and user feedback. However, there is also way to many case where the marketing analysis was discovered to be totally un-serious. As a designer, you shall alert the management as possible missing elements if you can detect it.The specifications implies that you have to develop specific technologies. It is very common that specifications implies things that are impossible. You cannot have a steel that is economic, totally stainless and extremly strong. Or can you ? Sometime you can find innovative solutions but these will need a lot of work. Your marketing may say go but you boss may say don’t. Whatever they choose to do, always make clear that the scope has to reevaluated.The team choose to ignore the obvious fact that the project will take longuer than excepted. In some case, the new project is extremly intersting. The marketing want it for the brand reputation, the designer want it for the nice use cases, the engineer want it for the nice innovations. The boss say ok, but it shall not take too long. Evryone try to convice themselve that it can be done in a shorter timeframe. Actually, it can’t.The product is small but the project is big. Sometime people get trapped into thinking that a small product is easier to develop that a big one. False. A consumer good need a nice market analysis, design, cost optimization… It is absolutly not simple and often more complicated than a mechanical product.Suppliers are unreliable. This often happen with supliers that have a captive market with the company. You have to deal with suppliers that are not the ones you would have choosed and are not the most competent for this product. There is also un-motivated suppliers who know that you will not leave whatever they do.The other departements don’t take the project as a priority. A new product development is always an extremly complicated project with lots of things that can take time and make you wait for it to be completed. If it takes 6 weeks to get a prototype by the tooling team and 3 weeks to get the ERP updated you are doomed. In such situations you will often end up doing things by yourself. This mean that you will have to deploy way more of your time and energy.You fail to convice for the needed investments. Sometime you need a tooling of high quality or you need to invest a little bit in a qualitative process. Sometime you need a costly 3D scan/XRay/EBM analysis. Maybe is it needed to hire an external calculus and simulation lab ? Yes, you can do without it but this is at risk. You take the risk but when it don’t works this ends up to be way more costly…Suppliers are cheating. This will often happen with some suppliers. They deliver a top quality for initial serie. Then the lower the quality and try to see if you will accept it. Don’t fall for it. Don’t try to fix the product afterwards if there is not clear technical reason or if the reason is that they don’t use the same machine. Request what they promised.

A validation cycles is prepared and testing of the product starts.If any issue or failure occurs in testing it is analysed and root cause is taken out and worked upon and necessary design changes are made. Which again takes us to point no 3.With improved modification again a new proto is tested and finally if the validation gets completed then tooling of the product is finalised.The product is releases in the system and now will be taken care by the project management for further launch and production in market.If the product registers some issues in field then again designer is the one to resolve them if it is a design issue.There are active roles of the designer in the complete lifecycle of the product and to see your imagination coming alive is a joyful and proud feeling also",2021-03-06T10:14:30.809Z,"How do you handle your transition from engineering role to product design?

But ID is usually heaviest early, engineering heaviest later. The actual answer is that usually what happens for many consumer products is that the mechanical engineer may provide some basic overall volumes and guidelines to ID, who then does the first design work. There is often a phase where engineers are working on a “works-like” prototype for things that require proving out, while ID is making a looks-like model or renderings. These later get reconciled and combined. ID will often generate the design “first”, and assuming they are good at what they are doing, they will understand basic realities about manufacturing processes and assembly, so it isn't too hard to implement in the engineering phase. The best projects have a lot of back and forth in the design process. Complex products, aesthetically-driven products, furniture, wearables, and products where the size and functions change during the project, and any time the client/boss/marketing wants lots of input and evaluation should have ID involved through at minimum the first “looks-like, works-like” prototype. This was the process for clients at IDEO most of the time. However, in the consultant/startup world, I have been asked many times with building a design “thrown over the wall” from an ID firm who then don't offer much input afterwards, for better or for worse. Other times, the mechanical function is clearly the most important driver so that ID may be brought in to suggest minor details like surface finishes and other ways to improve a basically finished engineering design. Medical devices are sometimes like this. That being said, the workflow between designer and engineer varies a lot. Some designers like to build the entire product in CAD themselves, which I then import and duplicate in a parametric form. Some designers prefer to hand-sketch, then I create the sketches in CAD and we tweak it together. A back-and-forth dialogue is often needed when figuring out manufacturing and assembly details—where do fasteners go, where do parts split, features that may have been added or subtracted or not thought through at first. I usually 3D print many iterations of products for ID to evaluate before the project is sent to manufacture. So in summary: in my experience with consumer products and furniture, ID usually comes first with input from ME, then ME takes over and proceeds with input from ID.",2021-03-06T10:45:41.674Z,"Does PGD in product design from NID focus mainly on aesthetics of a product rather than Engineering design?

We often have high school students visit classes or tour the facilities. If you come in the spring, I suggest you sit in on MSE 260 as Professor Davies is a very lively professor, and if you come in the fall, I suggest you sit in on MSE 221 as I found that material especially fascinating. Last summer, some high school students even worked on a project in the lab I was in because they wanted to learn more about MSE at UPenn.

I was in a similar stage. It was right after my engineering graduation. I did my engineering in aeronautical domain.I even joined for an MBA program, which was when I sensed it is not the right time. I always had this pain of not working on an aircraft while sitting in my Business accounting classes. I couldn't somehow overcome that. I dropped the course after the first semester and joined Air India as a trainee engineer. I still don't regret my decision. What I have to tell you is that work for a while in your respective field, understand work culture, develop some marketable skills, communicate, network and a time will come when you feel saturated with all the above. That would be the right time to join for an MBA. I must tell you it is a great program. If you have a zeal for management it would be wonderful. You get to study anything and everything of business from accounting to strategic management. You can also specialize in your area of interest. You are only supposed to choose your specialization in the final year of your MBA. That means you will get to know about all the subjects during the first year of the program. Then you may choose your specialization based on your interests and career goals. Do speak with some doyens, management students to get to know about the situation.

The way to do this is by building something called as a Product Requirement Document or PRD in short. This is the bible for a product manager and needs to revisited at the end of every day in product development life-cycle where as on the other hand a product specification document is rarely documented alone by Product Manger and more often then not needs the experience and skill of the Product Architect. As product specifications are nothing but product requirements explained in more depth. Product requirements are any function, constraint, or other property required for a designed artefact to meet the needs or wants of stakeholders and users; Specifications are the restatement of the requirements in terms of parameters that can be measured and have target values. So now coming to the answer for your question, a product manager has to full-fill at-least below mentioned points while writing a spec for the Engineering team. Let’s take Calendar product as an example, we will only cover light weight features: Features: Specifying features to be built in an un-ambiguous way. Be it a programmer, sales person or a marketeer, your features should always clarify the same meaning to all of them. (Mind you this is the most difficult task, if you are able to nail this, you can nail everything else on this list).eg: a) User should be able to create a new calendar event. This will have form details to be shown to user while creating calendar event. Constraints for each form element also has to be covered.b) User should be reminded about calendar event. Taken as an input at the time of creation of event. Can have a default value.c) User should be able to view all schedule calendar events. Main view for the product.d) User should be able to filter the view to see calendar events by day, week, month or year. A search bar has to be provided to user.e) User should be able to edit her calendar eventf) User should be able to search all her calendar events.You can go ahead and explain this in more depth along with wire-frames and mock-ups in case of a UI product. Data Integrity and Constraints are also covered for features which involves data entry from users.Metrics: Each feature should have a way to measure its progress, performance and test-ability (usability).eg: A new calendar event has to be created and saved in database in < 1 sec.A user should be able to see all her created event at all times.Search results should show up as user types.Specific: Each engineering specification has to be specific. One cannot say Editing an existing event should take less time then saving a new calendar event in database. The product manager should always seek to create standards based on clear rationale. This rationale is achieved through a critical analysis of user needs, engaging with stakeholders, and studying existing/competitive products.Neutral Solutions: In other words, solution neutral engineering specifications describe WHAT the design should achieve in order to fulfil the user requirements, but they do not dictate HOW the design should achieve these goals or WHAT the design should be. Sometimes Product manager with technical backgrounds often fail at this step.There are many areas where a metric or feasibility of a solution cannot be thought of without interacting with Product Architects, specially in big corps or legacy products. In those scenarios writing a product specification document is a joint exercise.",2021-03-06T11:23:45.946Z,"How does a new feature move from PM to the product design team and finally to the engineering team?

The easiest way to find those are to check out the UN’s 17 goals: About the Sustainable Development Goals You wouldn’t believe how many skateboards and e-guitars I’ve seen proposed as thesis projects. Those guys were dead in the water.choose emerging technology to facilitate a solution for it; generative design, AI, what have you. Resist bent plywood or MDF with all your might. It’s not sexy. That’s so that you won’t be embarrassed about your portfolio in ten years’ time. Things change so fast now that you’ll want to be cutting edge to make sure you look acceptable in a year or two.be brutally clear about the benefits your solution is going to bestow upon the user and/ or society, and there better be lots of good ones that are clearly appreciable by a panel of sarcastic old bags like myself who’ve seen it all before.research all the alternative, existing and emerging solutions to the identified need like mad! Pull off a SWOT analysis every time you can. You really don’t want to end up presenting something somebody else has seen before, because that spells death.Now, I hope I’ve really scared you. But if you get this stuff above under control, you should look really good with your thesis. Try my formula for a good product design project: Combine one of the UN’s 17 goals with an emerging technology to be used; identify a marginalised user group to benefit from a solution; define a context of use, and calculate a full cradle-to-cradle life cycle for it. Example: Safe drinking water; a passive solar desalination plant for use by evacuees in disaster zones in Bangladesh that is made entirely from local ceramics and has no envisioned expiry date; should it break though, it can be fixed with locally prolific techniques, or simply dumped without any ill effect on the environment, because it’s ceramics.

And that was when I took it a lot more seriously for every little thing I did. Some common stereotypes I found in PD was the big hype about sketching. IMO, all that matters is getting your idea across. More than sketching, design (any kind of design), is about story telling. How well do you captivate attention, to tell your audience the story. What is the story about? It is about why you do/did what you do/did, for who you do/did and of course, how you do/did. If you can answer all of these questions to anybody, you’ve really made your design count. If you’re an aspiring product designer in India, IMO, the scene is already overtaken with a HUGE number of engineers - undergraduates, graduates, and 50–60 year old people with a solid technical background who have merged into design fields such as ergonomics and form factor development. So if you think just sitting, ideating, sketching and digitalising your sketches and making things look pretty is going to land you a job, think more. The only way to sustain yourself as a strong product designer is to have a good technical understanding. Pick a field - education is my favourite. Crafts and handicrafts have enormous scope as well. Think about your role in the field. Study things, perspectives, people, culture, anthropology, languages, tradition, mindsets, human social interaction. Derive inspiration. Find loopholes. Learn more digitalising than just Photoshop Illustrator KeyShot Rhino. Envision the future. Read a tonne of books. Watch random shit. Live mentally stimulated. The country really needs some good Design Process. Policy makers, engineers and practically everyone else isn’t taught how to think. Your user study, market study has to be on point for you to develop a product - not just how it looks, but how it performs, how it behaves, how it interacts, how it is going to grow. A strong, true product designer realises their true versatility. I am currently studying product design; in my third year.

As a product designer it is not mandatory to have knowledge on manufacturing processes or producing CAD drawings. These products tend to be artistic manifestations and fit within novelty territory. Industrial design is about creating ideas for mass production, i.e, creating concepts that can be manufactured and be sold. Therefore it requires a bit more work in transferring and customising designs (product designs) to make it ready for manufacturing. You require knowledge of manufacturing processes and operations in order to do your work. Some key highlights Product design can be considered to be a subset of Industrial design.Industrial design can include - product design, furniture design, footwear, and in certain cases fashion and interior design.You can survive in product design without technical knowledge, but you definitely need to have technical/engineering knowledge to be an industrial designer. Unless you are doing early concept works.In industrial design you also learn about business aspects, in order to customise the products to match the business and market needs.In general, product design is more about creating solutions, industrial design is creating solutions and taking them to manufacturing. An industrial designer can be a product designer, but a product designer cannot be industrial designers. concept ———product———production———market product designer ——————————— industrial designer ————————————————————————— (previous answer) Product design is a subset of the industrial design. Industrial design deals with any manufacturable/produceable product, i.e. is requires industry processes and operations. It also covers the whole lifecycle - from initial research to manufacturing. These designers also work on producing manufacturing drawings and redesign for manufacturing operations. Product design deals with developing concepts from research to renderings and prototypes. It is one part of the whole lifecycle, primarily in the initial phase. These designers in principle are not involved in working with the manufacturing activities and handover the designs to them. But since there is overlap, most people and in the industry use the terms interchangeably. Further there are people from engineering side who also use similar or same terms. to summarise, industrial design is more of whole lifecycle focused on end-to-end design activities while product design is focused on conceptual designs and developments. UPDATE: a more concise answer is that: Product Design is focused on products , its design and development. It is more focused on the users, the product and the interaction between them. Product designers can be seen working with users and the product-systems Industrial Design is taking ideas from concepts to business integration. It is focused on the users, the products and the systems, the interaction and service in regard to the business value. The difference is in the business integration, which is mostly in form of CAD and manufacturing drawings, service design and system design. Industrial designers can be seem working more in relation to business operations and translation of designs into business value.",2021-03-06T12:16:29.638Z,"What is the difference between product design and industrial design?

Most of the time I don't think much about it.  I usually notice if something appears to have been joined poorly or inefficiently.

Companies who would spend the money on a consultant wouldn't find that acceptable and they charge more for a higher quality product.  If I see flash around a joint or knife marks that indicate flash was removed after welding, that's generally a sign of poor design in the joint area that has led to increased spending on manufacturing in the form of an extra processing step or reduced cosmetic quality.  Although some applications are so complex it can't be avoided.   I did try contacting a company once about the quality of joining I saw on one of their products to offer some helpful advice.

So, like every established private engineering college in West Bengal, the messiah of placements viz, TCS came to our campus just a day before the Durga Puja and the entire process was a 2-day affair. Many of us dreamed of pandal hopping with our loved ones boasting about a job and earning some pride that was completely lost around 4 years back. The preparation was in full swing and then comes the D-day. The morning I reached our college auditorium and we were made to wait for the TCS people to come. Around 10 am, I saw almost a dozen of white XUVs to rush into our campus with 60–65 good looking pretty faced raiders bumping into the auditorium as armada of anti-hero in movies rush to capture the heroine(those who are fans of south Indian action movies can surely relate to the scenario, take me one for your team. They are damn entertaining!!!). Now, the HR gave a well directed and scripted presentation citing examples of how does it feel to be a part of the parallel government in the nation. I along with our breed of 300 hungry job seekers was deeply convinced. This is it! If some good exists in this world, that has to be those glass buildings in the video! Then began the interview process. The first day had aptitude round and email writing round followed by a personal and HR interview on the next day. Being one of the toppers, I was exempted from the aptitude round and had to write an email. As I was about to head towards the venue, I heard the voice of our TPO “Hey Kaushik, what are you wearing?” I was confused. “Am I wearing anything wrong?”, I tried to remember my image in front of the lone hostel mirror some 3 hours back. “You will go with brown shoes and black pants for the interview?”, she shouted. “I have nothing else to wear. I will manage if required from someone who gets rejected today”, I calmly reverted(just see the confidence !!) Luckily, I cleared the email round. Next day, it was the personal interview. I was introduced to two panelists say P1 and P2. P1 was busy with his laptop(utilizing free wi-fi to the fullest) and P2 was busy with his smartphone. After a formal introduction and trying to sell me like any other random commodity, P1: So, I think you are from CSE background. Let’s discuss C++. Me: Sir, I would like to let you know that I am from EE background and I don’t know C++. However, I know C and JAVA. P2(not taking eyes off his phone): What? You don’t know C++ and you are into an IT interview. Ok, tell me is the AC an ac or dc? Me: It runs on AC supply sir and spoke all gibberish to keep them back on my track. P1(after a dramatic pause): So Kaushik…., I think you may leave. You should know C++ I think. Me(attempting a futile effort to impress): If given a chance I will learn in these few months. P2: Please leave(Facepalm…) I came out shattered and only got some comfort hearing other’s experiences. To my surprise, I was asked to wait and around 4 pm, I was again called for an interview, not sure if he was HR(all were so well groomed I say!!!).Let’s assume HR only. HR: So, Kaushik. I heard that you don’t know C++ but willing to learn. Me: Yes sir. I will learn for sure.(Back in my mind are my answers that famous??) HR: Do you know how to cook? Me: No sir.

One example, by the Design Management Institute, revealed that design-led companies like Apple and Nike have maintained significant stock market advantage, outperforming the S&P by an impressive 211 percent. As a result, we've seen a shift in business priorities for many forward-thinking organizations where design is making significant impacts. However, it’s important to know that design-driven companies are built upon the company culture, not just staffing designers, and many startups make this mistake when hiring their first product designers. That said, especially if you're a young company, here’s 3 signs that you’re not ready to hire a designer yet: 1. You just want to make things look pretty. Steve Jobs said it best: ""Design is not just how it looks, but how it works."" Design has been historically associated with graphic design as a function for marketing and branding--and that association continues despite the changing role of design in technology. I've been amazed at how often design is assumed to serve as decoration--so much bad design is simply decoration. Design is more than an artistic craft. It's a strategic tool for achieving business objectives. In order to design great products, services or campaigns, you need to understand not just what you're making, but why you're making it and for whom. You do that by empathizing with your customers to feel their pain, understand their problems and motivations, and solve for those needs. Context is a designer's ammunition, and designers are ineffective unless they have a clear understanding of the problem. Which brings us to our second reason... 2. You haven't taken the time to understand your customer. This goes beyond just building a demographic profile of your customer. Great design requires sensitivity to many levels of context around customer touchpoints: Emotional Context: How does someone feel when they are using your product or service--not just during, but before and after. What's their mental state? Are they coming to you to alleviate boredom, or are they using your product during a medical emergency? Environmental Context: Where are they when they're using your product or service? What else is fighting for their attention? Do they have time pressures or spatial constraints? Social Context: How will they be perceived by others when using your product or service? Will it make them feel cool or proud? Or are you solving a problem that's too embarrassing to share with others? These are absolute requirements for designing products and services that customers love. Unless you're willing to invest the time to build a clear picture of your customer's problems and motivations, you run the risk of falling short of great design. This risk is worth taking seriously, because the alternative to great design is not no design at all, it's bad design. 3. You intend to silo design into a singular department. In my experience, I've seen too many designers hired onto marketing or engineering teams and tasked with visualizing user experiences or marketing materials. Oftentimes, the designer does not have access to customer data or high-level business goals, and management becomes frustrated with the designer's output and loses faith. The reality is, great design is an attitude more than a skillset. In order to successfully integrate design into your company, it needs to be done on a cultural level and from the top down. Design thinking is not just something that needs to be represented by designers, but the entire company. Everyone in the company becomes a designer the moment each employee is able to rally around the customer's journey. A pillar of great design is consistency, and design needs to be integrated into all customer touchpoints such as customer service centers, your website, social media, the product, or any conceivable interaction that a customer has with a brand. That said, it's no coincidence that design has moved into top level management. To become a design-driven organization, it requires more than acquiring design talent--it requires design leadership. Great design is not easy, but it's worth it. Realizing the magnitude of effort that goes into building a design culture, some companies choose the option to hire design firms or freelancers when they're not ready to make the investment of time, money, and attention. This is certainly a viable option, but if the rise in activity over the last few years has proven anything, it's that prioritizing this investment can lead to serious business outcomes that really do move the needle. Great design stems from a great design culture, and a great design culture is difficult to cultivate. Design talent these days falls under a large umbrella of writing and communication skills, coding skills, strong business acumen, and visual design. Individuals skilled in any combination of those areas are difficult to find, but they are worth the investment. After all, the one thing more expensive than building a great design culture is to have no design culture at all. Most successful startups these days are actually founded by designers (like Aribnb), proving that design should be at the foundation of the company from Day 1. Also, extensive research over the last few years has established a strong business case for the value of design.

DB 603   Then, the valvetrain… the same cam actuates the intake and exhaust valves with roller rockers pivoting on a common very short shaft, resulting in a extremely compact layout. There is even a ball interposed to reduce friction at the joint between rocker and valve stem. Exhaust valves are sodium cooled.  Cross bolting by tie-bolts trough the main bearings caps. The crankcase is closed by a flat aluminum plate. (photo by me) The DB 601 has split roller bearings on its forked conrods’ big ends. They were replaced by plain bearings on the 605 and the larger 603, partly since the roller bearing factories in Schweinfurt had been severely bombed. The supercharger of the DB 600 series was driven from the crankshaft by the intermediary of spur gears, a bevel gear and a double hydrodynamic fluid coupling whose filling was controlled to provide a continuously variable transmission automatically adjusted to altitude and required boost. The German Junkers Jumo 210, 211, 213, BMW 801, DB 601 and derivatives were the first engines in the world fitted with gasoline direct injection. Luftwaffe's fuel injected engines gave them some advantages over the carbureted engines used by the Allies. Moreover, all the German WWII aero engines were controlled by a single lever trough mechanical systems called Komandogerät at BMW, Motorbedingetriebe (MBG) at Junkers and Leistunghebelregelung at Daimler-Benz. It automatically adjusted fuel flow, mixture strength, propeller pitch, ignition timing and boost pressure.  BMW 801’s Kommandogerät  Junkers Jumo 213’s Motorbedingetriebe  Daimler-Benz DB 605 & 603’s Leistunghebelregelung The allied aircrafts had much more complex engine controls. WTF? > Vintage Wings of Canada Walter Wolfrum was one of the fortunate pilots who was afforded the opportunity to test fly aircraft like the Mustang: “During the war I had the opportunity to fly captured P-47s and P-51s. I didn’t like the Thunderbolt. It was too big. The cockpit was immense and unfamiliar. After so many hours in the snug confines of the 109, everything felt out of reach and too far away from the pilot. Although the P-51 was a fine airplane to fly, because of its reactions and capabilities, it too was disconcerting. With all those levers, controls and switches in the cockpit. I’m surprised [their] pilots could find the time to fight. We had nothing like this in the 109. Everything was simple and very close to the pilot. You fitted into the cockpit like a hand in a glove. Our instrumentation was complete, but simple: throttle, mixture control and propeller pitch. How [the] pilots were able to work on all their gadgets and still function amazes me.” Other advanced features the German engines received from 1943–44 are the methanol-water MW50 and nitrous oxide GM1 injection systems. This enabled them to develop similar power to allied engines despite lower octane gasoline. Diverse turbocharged prototypes were manufactured but due to the lack of nickel and cobalt for exhaust turbines’ heat resistant alloys, they couldn’t be series-produced. Example below.  For me, the most beautiful WWII aero engine are the Jumo 213 and Bristol Hercules.  The Jumo 213 one piece crankcase-cylinderblock is a masterpiece of foundry  The Bristol Hercules’ sleeve valves system is amazing Production Of course, Germany lagged behind the Allies in production capacity. I found the following production numbers but it includes US and British engines still produced after the war, although in much smaller numbers. Some were also manufactured in other countries under license, the Daimler-Benz engines as well. I certainly forgot some engines and we should also count the ones produced in Soviet Union, Italy and Japan but such data are hard to find. Anyway the numbers below give a rough idea: German aero-engines production seems to have been slightly higher than British production but vastly inferior to US production.

When I first started my career Civil Engineers had a larger role and tended to take schemes from concept through to construction and handover, including doing practically everything plus the contractual stuff, and even on some mech/elec and process heavy projects. We did also have the other disciplines too, though not to the extent we do now. It’s become a bit more specialised since I started at the end of 1990. I work in the water industry in Scotland, am a Civil Engineer and also a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers. Pipeline design has always been our bread and butter.

Everyone on the team is nice, humble, and monstrously talented. We get to design the first system in the world that connects people to the things they love, and on top of that help them achieve their dreams in real life. What's not to like?   The Creative Team just one year ago at the end of 2012. Me and the team I'm the first product design hire at Pinterest, and have been with the company for nearly three years at time of writing. Our Product Design team currently consists of 9 full-time product designers, 3 freelancers, 1 product design manager, and Evan Sharp, our co-founder who leads the Creative Team as a whole. Product Design is not the only kind of design that we do here. The discipline lives within what we call the Creative Team, which is also home to Brand Design, Research and Writing. Altogether, we are 25 people in a company of around 160.   Design is a critical part of our strategy Design of all kinds, not just product, is integral to what we do at Pinterest because Pinterest itself is about inspiring people to live fuller, richer lives and take real-world action on dreams that were always just out of reach. While a well-designed product is friendly and easy-to-use, it also adds an air of authenticity to the idea that Pinterest can help you live the life you want to live.   Interfacing company functions From the beginning, Pinterest has been a company devoted to ""knitting,"" which we define as deep, cross-discipline collaboration. As great as it is, when many different kinds of people work on something together, keeping everyone's opinion heard becomes challenging. Part of our job as product designers is being the human interface between various company functions. While we share this role with everyone, product designers are directly responsible for taking opinions and ideas from all corners of the company and synthesizing them into solutions to a problem.   Employees participating in a “Design Play” session for a project. Design Play is our term for short participatory design exercises that convey the challenges of solving a design problem. In my opinion, the best projects are the ones where all members of a team are aware of the challenges and considerations of other functions and can adapt their own work accordingly. As a company, we are getting better and better at consistently achieving this cross-disciplinary comprehension at a really high level. When we perfect this, I don't think labels such as ""engineering company"" or ""design company"" will be accurate; something like a ""cross-disciplinary company,"" however weird that sounds, would make more sense.   Interfacing pinners and their interests ""Put Pinners First"" is one of our other more well-known company values. As product designers, this value encompasses everything that we do. Often times, we have to balance what pinners want, what is technically feasible, and if applicable, what is good for the company. This isn't easy; rarely is every party satisfied.  What pinners want usually aligns with what is good for the company. However, there’s no way around a solution being technically infeasible, or a team not having enough people to execute on an idea. When we run into roadblocks like these, working together so closely is beneficial because we can find reasonable compromises quickly.   Pinners talking to us about how we can make pins more useful for them during a participatory design study in early 2013. Interfacing with pinners also heavily involves working with other teams at Pinterest. We have to know what pinners want in order to authentically represent them. As product designers, the Research team is a common collaborator, helping us conduct usability and participatory design studies. We also work with the Data Insights team to solve specific problems highlighted by quantitative data, and with the Community team to hear first-hand about the most common problems pinners have and their most-requested features.  To learn more about how we work with the Research team, check out Gabriel Trionfi's answer to What's it like to work on the research team at Pinterest? What's the qual/quant mix? How often are you in the field? Does research have a place at the table?   The process of designing products   A product designer has many roles at Pinterest:  Product StrategyWe are involved in most user-facing projects from their inception to help lead direction.Interaction Design This is our core competency. Broadly, this skill encompasses system architecture, experience design, and cognitive psychology.Visual Design We maintain, and when necessary evolve, the design language of Pinterest. We also draw any necessary icons and gatekeep the visual quality across platforms. Sometimes, icons or illustration are outsourced to some of our extremely talented friends.Production DesignThis is a necessary evil that we'd like to hire someone for specifically. We cut out any assets needed by the development teams, which can be a real chore, but gets relaxing once you get in the zone.  Jason Wilson, one of our product designers, sketching out an impromptu solution to a problem. How product designers work (our process): Product designers are free to work in whatever way they find most efficient, so long as they communicate and knit with the rest of their teams. Different projects and teams also mandate different processes. It really varies, but at a high level we:  Gather inputs and insights (whether that be from data science, qualitative research, or pinners we know),Explore broad directions,Prototype, iterate and refine those directions,Launch and learn!In general, we focus on the problem first and the platform second. By thinking about problems holistically, we get a solution that generally works across all platforms. At that point, considering a platform’s unique context and constraints comes naturally.   A quick look at the process for just one direction of Place Pins. There were seven directions explored in total on the web. The technical nitty-gritty:  We mostly use Photoshop, with some projects done in Sketch. We use various other tools as well, including code and lots of paper sketches.We believe that designers should, at the very least, be technically adept. That way, even if we can’t build something ourselves, we are still speaking the same language as our engineers. That being said, most of us can prototype features in Javascript, and at least half of us can build our own backends as well for testing things out.We use Basecamp to share work and give impromptu feedback, but we're currently investigating other tools. In-person critique is held twice a week.  Pinkit is a Javascript tool that we develop on the product design team to make designing system units and building prototypes with real data really simple.   The Future Pinterest is a really great place to work for any designer because the problems are plentiful, solving them is rewarding, and they're difficult enough that you're always learning something new. That being said, as a product design team we're almost impossibly small compared to the rest of the company. We're always looking for more world-class product designers to join the team, so check out our open Careers in Creative and get in touch!

Scanned parts are recreated in design Service team completely.Analysis division checks the design life through FEA. There are few tools such as LS Dyna,hypermesh which converts/processes given CAD file to mesh. Mesh regions are necessary to evaluate the design through finite element analysis(FEA).All the product development designs will go for design analysis and validation.If any design fails through FEA,then it will go for re-work/ strengthening. This cycle completes when the design doesn't fail under the given safety standards/No.of cycles.When all the design stuffs are over ,part will be prototyped followed by manufacturing.

No evidence to prove that the virus has artificial or synthetic traces. We humans hasn’t have the capability at this time to synthesize such a virus.” Many American allies including US intelligence community agreed with the broad consensus in the scientific community that the new coronavirus was not artificial or genetically modified. Do Intel agencies still think it’s made or leaked from Wuhan lab? No, Debunked. Trump and Pompeo said they have ‘strong evidence’, but of course, they didn’t or couldn’t show any. French intelligence agencies said that it is absolutely certain that the new coronavirus was not leaked from Wuhan P4 laboratory. (well, the French helped set up the lab as well). So did a few others. Who knows, the virus may not even originate in China. More details below.  Facts: All the existing evidence shows that the new coronavirus originates from nature rather than artificially. On 30th January, the British authoritative medical journal “The Lancet” published an article by a research team from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. It was pointed out that the conclusion was drawn through re-genetic analysis of 10 2019-nCoV genome sequences of 9 diagnosed patients in Wuhan, China. Neocoronavirus is a new type of human infectious coronavirus. Compared with SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus, the new coronavirus is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses. This suggests that bats may be the original host of this virus. Twenty-seven internationally renowned medical experts from eight different countries issued a joint statement in the Lancet on 19th February, stating that researchers from all over the world have analyzed the whole genome of the new coronavirus and published the results publicly. These results have proved overwhelmingly that the virus, like many other new pathogens, comes from wild animals. Five well-known scholars from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia wrote in “Naturemedicine” on 17th March that there is no evidence that the new coronavirus was made in the laboratory or otherwise designed. On 26th March, Collins, president of the National Institutes of Health, published a blog post stating that the virus was naturally produced. The researchers found that the new coronavirus does not have the main structure of the virus used before, so it is not created by humans. It may be a combination of a bat virus and another pangolin-borne virus. Therefore, the new coronavirus is not a laboratory operation product. A spokesman for the World Health Organization, Fadela Chaib, told a press conference on 21st April that all the existing evidence indicated that the new coronavirus originated from animals, and was not transformed or created from laboratories or elsewhere. The virus is likely to gain momentum in bats, but how to spread it from bats to humans remains to be discovered. On 30th April, the official website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of the United States issued a statement saying that the US intelligence community agreed with the broad consensus in the scientific community that the new coronavirus was not artificial or genetically modified. On 1st May, Michael Ryan, the head of the WHO Health Emergency Program, said that many scientists have studied the gene sequence of the new coronavirus and are convinced that the new coronavirus is from nature. The World Health Organization representative in China, Dr. Galea, said on 5th May that all the available evidence so far shows that the virus originated from animals in nature and was not artificially manufactured or synthesized. Many researchers have studied the genomic characteristics of the virus and found that the evidence does not support the claim that the virus originated in the laboratory. The French news weekly “Modern Value” quoted French intelligence agencies as saying that it is absolutely certain that the new coronavirus was not leaked from Wuhan P4 laboratory.

So my advice is based on out-of-school places to learn. I'm sure many others here can advise you on a good school, which is definitely something you should do in addition to my suggestions! Engineering design has several basic disciplines: 1. Identifying an existing product that has flaws, but is still very popular with consumers. What are the flaws and how can they be overcome?2. Identifying an existing consumer desire that is currently not met by any existing product. Can you imagine a way to build a product that fulfills the desire.3. How to make something work reliably with readily obtainable parts (hardware) or methods (software).4. How to make it manufacturable without too many steps or too much skill on the part of the assembly line.5. How to make it easy for the user to use/play and maintain it.6. How to make it attractive to the user, so that they feel pride of ownership and recommend the product to others. Note that all products start with #1 or #2. So, the best place to begin is to watch yourself and others using consumer products. For example: When you tie your shoes, note how many rote movements you have to learn to make before a shoe is tied. Look at the shoes on children's feet at a playground. How many have velcro or straps compared to the shoes on accompanying adults feet? It's easy for one person tying their own shoes to put up with many rote movements, but when you are responsible for other people's shoes, it begins to bother you and you buy your children shoes with velcro or straps.  You should take the advice of great writers to would be writers seriously. It's common to be advised to get out in the world, and always watch and listen to people carefully. But, you have to listen to more than their words. For example, when observing an end user boasting to a group of friends about his new product, it's common to see he/she stumble on some feature and a look of fear comes over the boaster's face. How embarrassing. In reality, that is your cue! What did they stumble on, why didn't the user interface anticipate their needs? Could you improve it? When you see other users of the same product having similar problems you begin to get obsessive about it. That's your cue to go to the next step.   It's time to start taking things apart, and reading and researching why it was made that way. The modern world is full of things you can learn about. View source in your browser and start learning how web pages are being revolutionized with HTML5  and javascript. Learn to read javascript. If you are curious about a clock, take it apart. Try to put it back together working. Next, go buy some parts and try to build your improved clock from scratch. You can buy parts for a prototype from AliBaba for very little money. Keep finding problems and solving them. When you build a bread board prototype or you modify the code on your website to do something new, you've made the first step to becoming a real engineer. You are executing ideas, making them real, solving problems. I'm sure you are looking for a recommendation about the best school to attend.

In order to get your mind to produce great ideas, let the old ones out. Think of situations you or a friend were in, when you would have benefitted if you had ""that"" type of application, or service. After collecting, take a couple of days to clean up, reorganise, trim the extra fat, and you will probably have 2 or 3 projects on your plate. Now the only thing that's left to do is to prioritise and gather extra info about the most important one, to start generating requirements, define clear goals and estimate time/budget in a rough manner.

For example, when your new project is a metal part, you should not find a plastic manufacturer. 2,Do you know what the processing it should be? If it is made of metal, do you know what the processing it should be? If not sure, do you have samples or prototypes available? All manufacturers custom make parts as per samples or prototypes or 3D drawings. If you have more than one samples/protoypes available, you can send one to the manufacturer to know whether it is in their field.For us, if it is not within our capabilities, we can usually help to transfer the sample/prototype to other factories as per the customer's request. Metals are usually made by die casting(it is also called metal injection molding or MIM), stamping, or extruding. If it is made of plastic, they can usually be made by plastic injection molding, blow molding, rotocasting, extruding, rotational molding,etc. Also, plastic injection molding is the widest used method. For which processing, it depends on the design or constructure of the part. If you are not sure, come to us for help. 3,What should you prepare? Money,of course. *_* Then a prototype or sample or 3D design drawings. To make prototypes, you can find a local rapid prototyping company to do it. If just need to be similar to an existing product, you can get a similar sample from existing market, and tell the manufacture where you need modifications. If it is not new, just need to copy, you can easily get a sample. To make 3D design drawing, one of my customers, I heard that he finds a university engineering major student to create the first 3D.

It's not as hard as it seems, if you are willing to learn what everybody already knows in bits, and pieces. They know it all in scattered forms.

Then you can build your personal set of responses and be consistent with reality. That way there will be fewer collisions. Anyone can become much more effective, and make better use of the inherent capacities. There are enough people to supply exercises, to do lists, and concepts. The biggest interference in how people use their abilities is controlled by emotional memories. The bedrock of reality is a set of simple to explain, yet difficult to accept realities. They are simple because that is the nature of fundamentals. They are hard to accept because they bypass, and challenge so many false assumptions to which we are habituated. This is a starter description -Life is better when you pay attention. Don’t get lostin a fog of distractions. -You are unique, and so is every other being. -You are an aspect of everything, and so is every otherbeing. -There is what is known directly, and what is not known,or only suspected. -Causes produce effects, for all of us. Sometimes theeffects are not obvious. -Lives change, Yet, Life goes on. Those who keep these simple realities in mind, simultaneously, will have fewer accidents, and be able to develop better lives. These consistently real truths are intuitively obvious,yet we often forget one, or more, when we react. Our emotional past, and the inherited tendencies from our ancestors get in the way of currently practical,rational thought.

Necessary? While whether or not you’ll need to will depend on your employer’s policy, it is not strictly necessary. Helpful? You bet. Like most of the other engineers I know, I started with a blend of production engineering and project management that was the first level in my company’s engineering career path. I had specific process areas I was responsible for, and spent a considerable amount of my time monitoring key process indications (KPIs), optimizing and troubleshooting, and coming up with solutions for problems the operators and technologists were having. This gave me the opportunity to develop strong relations with the technicians and to really understand their jobs and what they felt made them better or worse, safer or more dangerous. When later I moved more completely into project management and design, these relationships remained and I always had people I could rely on to talk candidly to me because they knew they could rely on me to listen to them. I also had an understanding of not just how to determine pipe sizes and how big a process vessel had to be, but also where to put the controls, what to automate and what to think twice about automating, and how to make running and maintaining the system safer. Without having first seen it from the production side, I’d have been missing a lot of knowledge. Later on, I moved to another major area of the same plant. Here I was a project manager and process designer and had a lot of engineering responsibilities, but I never did get the production experience there. As such, I never had the same depth of relationship with the technicians, and had to push harder to get feedback and input from them. Without having first had the production experience to give me insight into how to design a system so that an operator could easily and safely run, troubleshoot, and maintain it, I might have made some preventable mistakes (okay, more preventable mistakes) in my new area. If you get a choice, I’d recommend some production engineering to start. And if you don’t get a choice, be thankful for the opportunity to pick up this experience if they require you to be in production. I believe it will make you a better overall engineer. If your company takes you straight from school into process design, then I would advise you to find a technician or two you get along with, if the opportunity to develop friendships arises then pursue that, and try to be as involved as you can in the day to day operation of your designs. This can be a great source of feedback and review from an operator standpoint, and may help make up for not having that “in the trenches” time.

I was finding Facebook messages weeks after the interview that I hadn't noticed earlier. This was a little confusing as I wasn't sure who to pay attention to; but it was also quite exciting. Nonetheless, they submitted my CV. I should note that at this point I felt the overall process was a little disorganized but I was happy to hear what they had to say. I was receiving lots of emails from different people at Facebook, we bounced back a few conversations and a phone interview was arranged. For the most part, they were very helpful and friendly, quick to reply and supportive. It was really nice. The phone interview lasted just over an hour, if you include introductions etc. I only spoke with one person but I felt there were other people listening in as I was most certainly on speaker phone. This was something that was on my mind during the interview. The interview went on as most do, however I was repeatedly reminded that there were a list of questions that we needed to get through; which I found a little odd. It wasn't that we had questions to get through; I found it strange that I was reminded regularly during the interview. It preoccupied my thoughts and clouded the purpose of this initial interview a little. In a situation like this, where they came to me, surely it would have made more sense to allow the conversation flow more naturally. Afterward, I was a little unsure of how it went.  There were a lot of typical questions, but thankfully nothing ridiculous like 'If you could be a random object, what would it be?' or 'What is your greatest weakness?'. Overall it was quite pleasant. Over the next week a recruiter from Facebook was in touch to say:  After careful consideration, I don't think your experience is quite the right fit for the team right now. We love your enthusiasm and ideas with regards to Facebook, so keep them coming. This told me nothing. Also, the ""I don't think.."" got me a little. At what point was this ever a personal choice? I suppose it wasn't but I genuinely felt as though I had been taken for a ride. I wasn't disappointed that I didn't get the job I never applied for, I was disappointed because I believe this was a missed an opportunity for Facebook, I believe had I been hired Facebook would be better than it is.

Generally engineers start by creating a clear parameter set of what the object in question has to do, what space it can occupy, what loads it must carry, what places it can touch, what materials it can be made of, what conditions it will be exposed to and what it must look like. The parameters then guide the selection of materials and form. For me I would then build a model of the space in which the product would need to be installed. be it a room, or compartment on a truck or inside the commutator mechanism on an electric motor. From there I would start to layout my product seeking to conform to the parameters set forth. As this process proceeds There is a cycle of building and testing of various designs for the product. The first few versions might have weak spots, or be too thick and cause interference during motion. or perhaps the aesthetic is wrong for the intended use. at that point you go back and refine the design, then back to evaluation and testing. This back and forth sometimes leads to changes in other components in the design in order to best accommodate the needed function. Modern design software makes this a very rapid process at times once the initial modeling is done. One can design a component, perform motion studies, engineering load analysis etc then immediately tweak the design and retest in very short order. After this refining process winds down(eventually the gains are outweighed by the time to implement) you can finalize a design, work on any aesthetic considerations and begin the process of determining manufacturability. Interestingly sometimes this part of the process results in more adjustments than the actual design phase does. The part as designed may be too expensive to produce or require specialized tools and so a discourse between the fabricator and the engineer ensues and changes may be made to the design to accommodate its construction or fabrication. The last step in that process is evaluation of the finished design. even at this stage change may be made to accommodate final assembly, maintenance or repair(you can't have that bolt in that hole where there is no room for a wrench) I recently submitted a product design to the fabricator for prototype part manufacturing. here are some of the statistics of the process. -400+ ultimate components from soup to nuts, -65 distinct versions of the product were made over the course of 1.5 months of development some small like bolt size changes(15), some major like a complete layout changes for several major components(4). -One major structural component was revised 26 times, curiously its final design closely resembles the original design sketches even though over the course of development it had changed significantly. -Product size reduced 30% over original models -Strength of key frame components more than doubled due to refinements. -Fabrication cost of major components reduced about 25% due to adjustments based on fabricator feed back. One of the most fascinating things about this process for me, is how amazingly elegant and pleasing the final results can turn out to be, Sometimes the final product looks so simple and elegant, so obvious and perfect that you would be amazed at how much effort and iteration went into its development.",2021-03-06T13:13:35.254Z,"How do engineers engineer products that need to conform to radical industrial design form factors?

However, let me try to interpret. Industrial design addresses the process of design applied to products intended for mass production. Design in this sense is separated from manufacture of the product in that it addresses form and function before it addresses physical realization of the product. Industrial design is distinguished from craft-based design, where the form of the product is created as it is designed, as in woodworking. Industrial engineering deals with optimization of processes, systems, and organizations around production or plant operations. The focus of the industrial engineer is to eliminate waste in terms of time, money, resources, materials, labor hours, or energy; the focus is on the value stream in processes. Production engineering and industrial engineering have common roots and may be considered by some to be the same discipline. Generally, production engineering addresses the management practices (management science) around production operations, attempting to address efficiency and effectiveness within the business. Some of the activities under production engineering include application of machining processes, castings, tool design, metrology, automation, jigs/fixtures, and die and mould design. Both industrial engineering and manufacturing engineering are closely aligned. Thanks for the question. I hope this answer clarifies at least some of the thoughts around these disciplines.",2021-03-06T13:16:58.344Z,"What is the difference between industrial design branch and industrial and production engineering branch?

I personally hate the term UI designer - it couches the work in the most superficial terms - what the software looks like. My peers who do the visual design or implement an interface are visual designers (VX or VXD). They design visual systems that create clarity, coherence and consistency within the interface.   The notion of a DIGITAL product designer (Industrial Designers get quite pissed when UX people refer to themselves as product designers - we don't design manufactured goods, that's a whole different level of voodoo) really originated on the West Coast, inside major tech companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Adobe, etc.  It was in those companies where digital product design became multidisciplinary as software and hardware became more integrated and systematized. The product design process involves real user research, and collaboration among multiple design disciplines (visual, interaction, industrial, research, etc). We work as peers to product managers and engineers and are deeply integrated into their work.  Product designers are intimately involved with the definition and specification of products, not simply the decoration.  It is not easy work, in fact, it can be quite grueling to go through an entire ship cycle of a product, especially when it involves hardware or devices. There are SO many technical dependencies, roadmap alignment, endless bugs, shifts in strategy, lots of arguments, and changes. Many designers that came up in a consulting or agency environment struggle with the unrelenting pace and focus of working on the same project or problem for years at a time.  The longest I ever worked on a single project is 2.5 years from concept to release on a 1.0. A short project in my world is closer to 3-6 months. That's what product design entails.   An experienced product designer needs to develop more than just solid design skills. They need to be adept at visualizing their ideas, selling and pitching, have a solid technical grounding and the ability to ""speak the lingo"" with engineers, and savvy enough to couch their design solutions in terms of strategy, metrics and business goals.  The up side is that you get to see your work go live in the world, see feedback and metrics on how well it performs and even fix mistakes. You're invested in the outcome in a way that just isn't possible from the outside.  As a consultant, you can do a lot of great work, beautiful blue sky work, etc - but for me, nothing compares with putting your stamp on something your users love.  So while many UX designers are product designers, most are not.  Being a product designer is more a function of the nature of the company you work at, and what you work on while you're there. Not necessarily.

The future of product managers is accepting that product managers are now becoming product thinkers. There is a need for more product thinkers. They are not just visionaries but a support system and an organizational system. Medium – a place to read and write big ideas and important stories has predicted the three trends that will shape the future for product management. Experimentation has become a core part of a product manager’s role. As compared to 2015, where product managers only aspired to conduct experimentation, product managers in 2019 are extensively conducting experimentation. They are also acknowledging the benefits of being consumer centric and data driven. Product managers have also admitted that most of their new ideas stem from customer feedback. Product managers want to cut through the red tape. Even though product managers are saying that customer feedback is the number one source of new ideas but most of them are also collecting customer feedback as a daily activity. Product management is a strategic role. Product managers are often known for doing anything and everything that needs to be done. Product managers are often the liaison between the team and key stakeholders. As of now, product management is thought of as a general profession that does not require specialized skills or design skills. This is the mindset that has to change. As mentioned earlier, product managers have now become product thinkers. The task of a product thinker requires a specialized skill set. Even though all these are true, India is a developing nation and product management is slowly picking up momentum. Product managers are now not only managers but product thinkers as well. I was actively searching for a course to do as I am extremely intrigued by this product thinker analogy. I wanted to upgrade my career and open up options for the future to come. Strangely enough, I saw an advertisement for an online portal called Upgrad which offers courses in many fields. After browsing through the website, I noticed they had a course on product management.

It is increasingly rare to find individuals with most of these skills. Not every design problem is solved simply by developing geometry in CAD. Not every structural problem is an FEA problem. Not every fluid flow or heat-transfer problem requires CFD. A skilled design engineer knows when and how to use these tools and when to use closed-form calculations. While designers with good CAD skills generally shouldn’t be given overall product engineering responsibility, the truth is it happens in many organizations.

If I were ever asked a question like this in an interview, my answer would be along the lines of “I look forward to the opportunity to study the problem in detail, so I can give you a well-researched answer”. If pressed, then I would give the best answer I could with the details available.",2021-03-06T13:29:38.907Z,"Are mechanical engineers asked to design a product in an interview? ",Quora

When Steve Areen thought about building his dream home, all he had to do was find $9,000 and a place to build. He did just that and, in a few weeks, he had a vacation home in the middle of Thailand that could make anyone drool.In just 6 weeks, Steve was able to create the home of his dreams.  With a Thai friend’s guidance, his son-in-law’s masonry skills and a lot of work, the team made progress quickly.  Steve was given a place on his friend Hajjar Gibran’s mango grove to build his home.  The basic structure only cost about $6,000.  In Thailand, materials are cheaper, but it’s still mind blowing to know just how little this cost to make.  The extra details and furnishings of the home brought the cost up another $3,000.  Totaling approximately $9,000 for the entire home.  It took elbow grease and dedication.  But it seems so worth it.  Not only does this dream home look cool, but the low-cost and quick building schedule is amazing.  Cement blocks and clay bricks were used to build the home, as well as some natural materials.  If he had the chance to build the home again, Steve said that he would use compressed earth blocks.  Whether it’s a home away from home or your new family residence, this dome would be perfect.  Imagine spending long afternoons swinging on your rooftop hammock.  Or gazing into your backyard pond, filled with beautiful lilies.  The dome is full of windows and natural light, really helping the house become one with nature.  On the outside of the house, Steve built steps up to the roof, you can climb the entire house if you’d like to.  Inside, all of the accents are natural.  His shower is the big stone mosaic you see here.  And the bathroom sink is made of natural bamboo and other materials.  It’s hard to believe something so cheap, relative to housing prices here, could be so gorgeous.  Every day would feel like a vacation.  Can I go here right now?

60438837ed76476feda2dfc1,https://www.quora.com/How-much-part-failure-or-fatigue-is-designed-and-engineered-into-products?-,"That's a question that structural engineers wrestle with every day, especially with designs that involve human safety. So, the answer has to be that it depends on the product and how it is to be used. With extremely complex structural systems like aircraft, I t becomes even more difficult. In aircraft, failure of a single component can be catastrophic. The advent of computer aided design and analysis tools has helped a lot. Finite element analysis is an analytical technique that every mechanical and structural engineer should become very familiar with for calculating ultimate strength and fatigue resistance. Also, whenever possible, it is good to perform testing on products to assure their performance. I began my engineering career in 1970 with the Lockheed-Georgia Company as an Instrumentation Engineer in the Fatigue and Static Testing department. We used hydraulic systems to apply cyclic and static loads to the aircraft structures on the C5-A aircraft. We even had two entire airplanes that we performed the structural tests on. Here are a couple of examples of the sorts of issues that can come up. When Lockheed bid on the C5-A contract, the Air Force had issued a detailed set of specifications for the airplane that included a maximum weight for the finished airplane and the required fuel economy. After Lockheed had completed the detailed design, they found that in order to be strong enough, the airplane was going to weigh too much, but the Air Force refused to relax the specifications at all. So Lockheed went on a big ""weight savings campaign"". All employees were asked to submit ""Weight Savings Proposals"" and the submitters of ones that were implemented received a ""Weight Savings Award""! Most of the weight saved came out of the aircraft structure, so as you might expect, the structured ended up being too weak so that there were lots of fatigue cracks that developed. We found where all of these were so that the structure could be strengthened before failure occurred in the field, but we were chasing fatigue cracks all over the airplane, especially in the wings. Finally, Lockheed convinced the Air Force to let them design the wing properly and the wings on the entire fleet of C5-As had to be replaced at massive cost. Lockheed had a good design to start with, but politics interfered. An example of how failure of a single component can be catastrophic happened at the end of the Viet Nam War. As Saigon was being evacuated a C5-A was sent in to fly out children from an orphanage. As the aircraft reached cruising altitude, there was an explosive decompression of the fuselage that caused the plane to crash, killing almost everyone board. It was traced to a failure of a latch on the rear pressure door. the rear pressure door on the C5-A is roughly square about 20 feet by 20 feet. (I don't remember the exact dimensions.) It is so big that it has to have latches all around the perimeter of the door about every 18 inches to 2 feet apart. ONE of the latches wasn't latched properly and failed and the pressure inside the fuselage caused the entire door to ""unzip"". Part of the door cut the control lines and the plane went down. I could give lots more examples, but this answer is already too long! you have asked a VERY important question that you will need to keep asking through your entire career! Unfortunately, there isn't a simple answer. 1",2021-03-06T13:48:39.498Z,"How much part failure or fatigue is designed and engineered into products? ",Quora

That is so because product design is one of the most demand skills in the current marketplace. There is a serious shortage of good product designers.  Corporations need to manufacture products faster and they have to release new concepts along with them. Without a team of expert product designers, this would be impossible. Just remember to take a good course in this regard. You should select an institute having ample experience in this field. The following points should help you understand it easily: Products are omnipresent You can see products everywhere and anywhere. Mobile phones, furniture, cars they all are products and so they all are a result of the work of a product designer. A product designer visualizes a new concept and makes that a reality. The product designer not only creates novel concepts but he or she also has to innovate with the existing designs. After a designer proposes a new concept, it gets approval from the team. Then, the engineers begin working on the product and create it. You may see as to why a product designer holds value in the current market. If you want to enter a career which is in high demand, you should choose product design. Companies require good professionals in this field because the market has evolved significantly. Designs are becoming obsolete faster. Companies have to release new products or update their old ones more frequently in order to stay in the competition. All of this demands the work of good product designers. The demand for the professionals is set to rise in the coming years so you should not worry much in this regard. Design is fundamental If you will join any of the reputed product design colleges in India, you will get to see why design is such a vital part of product development. Without design, one cannot develop a product. The design is 90% of the development as it involves visualization, conceptualization and creation of the product. Therefore, the importance of design cannot be decreased by any means. For example, in writing a book, the main work would be done by the writer. He or she would imagine an idea, create a story accordingly and then put it on paper. Even though he or she does not print the book or draw the cover art, without him or her, the book would not even exist. Such is a role of a product designer. You can take a diploma in product design to get more knowledge of this field. Conclusion You will be working alongside engineers, project managers, marketers and other professionals while creating your designs. If a product does not look good or if it does not solve any major problems, then it cannot succeed in the market. Marketing it becomes more difficult too. Therefore, the importance of a product designer is very high.
