You can check it out if you have some time :) Being a self-employed person is not just about working as a graphic designer or photographer. Freelance work also requires managerial and sales skills, taking away the time you want to devote to your career. If you no longer have the time to manage your busy schedule or write your weekly newsletter, why not assign these tasks to a virtual assistant? What is a virtual assistant? Contrary to what the title might suggest, a virtual assistant is not software. In fact, a virtual assistant is someone who outsources administrative and technical tasks from home, whether he or she lives in Canada or Morocco. While his assistance is virtual, the professional relationship with you is real. What can a virtual assistant do? All that can be accomplished with the help of a computer, the virtual assistant can do it for you: accounting, management of a website, search for airline tickets ... The possibilities are numerous. To ensure the efficiency of your work, a relationship of trust must be established between you and your virtual assistant, especially if you give him the passwords necessary for the accomplishment of his tasks, such as sorting your email.  How to choose your virtual assistant? Before you begin your research, determine the tasks you want to delegate, then estimate how much time you will have earned by outsourcing these tasks. Because time is money, think about the budget you want to give to this service. The estimate of a budget is important, since your virtual assistant can ask a rate per hour or a flat rate depending on the services offered. Fortunately, the time you have earned will allow you to complete additional mandates, thus to have more money. You've decided you want to find a virtual assistant, but what should you consider when it comes to choosing the right assistant for your business? 1. Personality. You may be looking for a virtual assistant but you'll still be developing an ongoing relationship - whether that's via email, on the telephone or sometimes even in person. So it's important that there is a business and personality fit with your assistant from the start. 2. Professional approach. Your assistant, virtual or otherwise, is often the gatekeeper to your business, so their professional approach needs to match that of your business. How do they answer and deal with telephone calls? How timely are they in responding and actioning emails? Do they have a personable approach? 3. Setting boundaries. Make sure you are clear about the boundaries of your virtual assistant's responsibilities. Some clients are looking to give their assistants a certain level of autonomy, while others are looking for help with set tasks and jobs only. Be clear what you are looking for from the start so you find an assistant that has the skill sets to match your needs. 4. Skill set. It goes without saying that your virtual assistant should be organised and proficient, however tasks that virtual assistants are expected to carry out can vary significantly on a client-by-client basis. Providing a clear list of all the tasks you'd like your assistant to handle will help identify 'the' assistant that has the specific skills you are looking for. 5. Technical skills. Do you want an assistant that has experience using a specific CRM tool? Are you looking for someone that can use marketing software such as Adobe? Or maybe you need a person that is highly skilled in using Excel for book-keeping purposes? Technology is varied so technical skills will vary too. Be clear about what experience you require, and whether there is an opportunity to learn on the job too.

I found out the following Pros & Cons of being a Virtual Assistant comparing to a full-time Personal Assistant job. Pros: Career Freedom(you choose who to work with, when and how much to charge)Independence and flexibility(you can work for any client around the world as long as their working hours are adjustable to your working hours, and, your skillset is a perfect fit for their requirements)Scalable earnings (virtual assistants are self employed, or solo-entrepreneurs, therefore they are able to expand their services, raise their rates and sign up more clients while subcontracting with other virtual assistants around the world)Cons: Job security (your clients may disappear overnight, or suddenly “not require your services for some time”)No Employment Benefits (forget about paid leaves and holidays, sick leaves and insurance, gratuity pay etc.)Uncertainty (as VA industry becomes more and more competitive, you never have a 100% reassurance in tomorrow demand)Huge learning curve (to stay relevant and ensure you are an in-demand Virtual Assistant, you will have to master new skills for your own income sustainability.

I’m talking about Freelancer or Fiverr. But most people would agree that Upwork, the world’s largest freelance platform is the best place to start. Yourquestion, however, is what is the “best” place to hire a virtual assistant. While the places I listed do a decent job of pairing you with somebody who would be your remote, work-from-home, freelance assistant, the results you get ultimately depend on the kind of arrangement you agree to. And it also depends on the person you hired. This might seem like a no-brainer but it’s actually crucial when it comes to a virtual assistant because everybody can claim that they’re a virtual assistant. Everybody can say that they can work remotely and send you files through emails and all that good stuff but you have certain expectations at the end of the day. You are looking for certain results. Focus on those results when filtering people for that virtual assistant role. This means you have to be specific as to the range of duties you want to assign to your virtual assistant because not everybody has the same skill set. Some VAs specialize in content creation. These are good writers, Facebook commenters, and they can handle all sorts of tasks that have something to do with writing. Others are good with data entry and not much else. That’s perfectly fine too if that’s what you’re looking for. Finally, others are great with graphics. So the first thing you need to do is to focus on the skill sets that you’re looking for. The second is to make sure that this person is actually tried and proven. Can you see samples of their work? Are you happy with the quality? Is there a high chance that they would deliver the same quality to your project? Finally, there’s the arrangement which is the most important part to me. Most virtual assistants sell their time. Somebody could post an ad on Fiverr and say, “I would be a virtual assistant for eight hours and I will only charge five dollars.” On the surface, it might seem like a legit deal but it may turn out to be a ripoff. I’m not saying they’re not going to do VA work for you. But there’s a high chance that they will drag their feet at that rate. They will tell you that even though they worked eight hours, they were able to deliver only this much work because that is eight hours’ of work. How are you to know? Do you see how this works? In reality, they might be selling every single hour of their workday to other clients and everybody’s in the dark. There is no way to know. The point I’m trying to make is that as a consumer of virtual assistant services, you have to get away from a time-based system. The chances of you getting ripped off with this system are too high. What is the better alternative? Well, look into quota-based virtual assistants. This is the closest you will get to a results-based arrangement. How does this work? You negotiate with the virtual assistant how many deliverable items they have to come up with for a fixed period. It can be an hour or eight hours, it doesn’t matter. What you should focus on are the results. You then negotiate for how much you’re going to pay for those results. This is the best approach because it is based on a quota. If they don’t meet the quota, you don’t get to pay them. It’s that simple. Sadly, too many people who hire virtual assistants get ripped off because they don’t know this situation exists. How do you get this type of arrangement? You can try Fiverr and filter through all the virtual assistants there until you get somebody who will work on a quota basis and also has the skill sets you’re looking for. Another alternative is to go with VA listing companies like Cognoplus which intentionally screens people for skill sets and make sure that they only list VAs who agree on a quota basis. Once you get the list from Cognoplus, you can assume that these people are going to work on a results-based quota system. The only drawback is the cost is fixed. They work on a daily basis and you have to pay them a minimum of 30 dollars per day. But they work on a quota basis. This is an imperfect solution, mind you. Quota-based VAs are so rare that you shouldn’t be all that shocked that the entire list of VAs they sent you is booked. This doesn’t mean that you can’t book a project but you might have to wait a couple of days until a spot opens up with the VA that you select. At the end of the day, that is a small price to pay for results. A lot of people would answer this question by rattling off the usual suspects. You know what I’m talking about.

It is logical that for many teleworkers, it is not the ideal profession, but for those with a vocation for service, it will be the best choice. If you want to become a virtual assistant of those that are difficult to find, here we have gathered 10 characteristics that you should have: HonestyHonesty is essential, and here we do not talk about value in general, but to be honest with ourselves. If you can not be honest and accept, for example, when you do not know how to do something or when you should ask for help, you will be in trouble, since being a virtual assistant means knowing how to do many different tasks , but also knowing how to delegate them or learn to do them correctly . Time managementWith this point, we do not just mean that you must be an organized person and handle both your own calendar and your client's . What's more, if you do not control this point, directly, forget about being a virtual assistant. But, to that you must manage your times to perform each task. If you are hired for 4 hours and you have a list of 20 items to do, you should know how to calculate how long it will take you to correctly handle the client's expectations. Give the best of yourselfHard work is the key to success, work online or offline. Also, if you work hard, this will be recognized. Do not be afraid to give your best , even if you were originally hired for less money than you expected. If you give your best, you can request increases or get recommendations to continue advancing in your career. Work smartLogically, working intelligently is much more important than ""hard work"" but without clear objectives. If you are a smart teleworker, you will be much more successful than someone who simply works hard. How can you achieve it? Constantly forming yourself, being aware of new tools that make your work easier, organizing yourself correctly and investing in your work tools . Always make suggestionsAs a Virtual Assistant one of the key features that you must develop is to make productive suggestions. For example, if you notice that you lose 1 full hour eliminating e-mails from newsletters or spam from your client's mail, suggesting a tool to stop receiving them permanently would be a good suggestion. Or, if you notice that an important client or a relative is coming of age soon, remind them to know if they do not need you to get a gift for them. Communicative skillsAnother key feature of a good virtual assistant is communicating clearly and correctly. If your communication skills are not good, start trying to improve them. You must handle neat language, always, both when referring to your client, as when sending e-mails or communicating with other people that your work requires. Positive attitude""You can"" should be a phrase written on the forehead of each virtual assistant. You must take responsibility for your work and treat your client's business, as if it were your own business. If you work with a positive and focused attitude , not only in your task, but in completely alleviating the life of your client, you will go on the right track and you will be essential in a very short time.  Pro activityThere is always something new under the sun. All virtual assistants must be extremely proactive so they never run out of jobs. While some customers have a detailed list of tasks they want you to do, others simply need your help and you will not have scheduled tasks, but a delegation of those that can not be done at the time. You should look for the systematization, the outline and suggest new tasks that you can perform if you see that your client does not assign them to you. Eager to learnThe desire and ability to learn must be an internal fire in each virtual assistant. Never say ""no, I do not know how to do it"" to your customers.

Indeed, today almost all tasks can be done remotely thanks to new IT tools made available. You will be able to confer all your internal and external communication to a virtual assistant. Indeed, simply by giving access to all your communication platforms, you can entrust the management to it: receiving and sending mails, feeding social networks, receiving calls ... In this same perspective, it can also manage all your schedule according to the proposed and planned meetings.  Apart from that, you can also delegate all the secondary tasks so that you can focus on your core business.

Applying to a remote virtual assistant brings significantly more benefits than hiring a classic assistant.

However, a common route to take would be to create a blog and then monetize it via ads and affiliate networks. This works and I have had success with it in the past, but I want to touch on a less common approach that works very well. This approach involves buying an established and already profitable online business and then running it for its monthly cash flow. This method does require some capital to get started, but you can get started with less than $10,000 if you decided to. Keep in mind, the more money you have to invest the higher the monthly cash flow will be. A rough estimate is 25x monthly profit, so assume a business was making $500/month then it would be worth $12,500. If you had $100,000 to invest you could purchase a business that would be making around $4,000 every single month in cash flow. That’s a niche chunk of change! The best part about this method is that you cana grow the business while you own it, which will exponential grow the value of the business when YOU go to sell it. For example, let’s say that you buy a business for $100k and it was making $4,000/month. Over the next 12 months you grow it to $6,000 then it would be worth around $150,000.

IndependenceA virtual assistant enjoys far more independence compared to their office counterparts.

Things that you take for granted like paid vacations, free coffee or sandwiches are not available to you when you are a virtual assistant. On the upside, you may get the freedom to choose your working hours. To maximize VA productivity, it’s highly recommended to let them work at their most productive time. You also get to choose where to work from, i.e. your home, in the cafe, in the library or along a beachfront with clear waters and white sand under the blue sky (well as long as you have internet). ProductivityA VA only has himself or herself to motivate them to work productively. Every VAs’ worst distraction is domestic life. Domestic chores and errands can easily disrupt very VA’s productivity, hence, a VA should learn to separate professional from domestic tasks. Plan you day and schedule domestic tasks in between work. Set daily goals and focus your energy on accomplishing them. Having said that, it’s easy for a VA to fall into the pitfalls of multitasking. Contrary to popular notions, multitasking reduces individual productivity by a staggering 40%, pulls down your IQ by as much as 10 points and can cause stress. Focus on accomplishing one task at a time until you complete all tasks set for the day. Always remember a VA’s value is their productivity. If you are not productive, you will not get paid. JoyFinally, just like anything in life, you will find joy in doing what you love. VA’s are more productive because they are happier with their job and their workplace. It’s also the reason why VAs stay much longer with their jobs and employers.

In most states and provinces in North America, Property Management became a licensed trade in Real Estate over the past couple of decades, I started just before the licensing trend in the 1990’s and worked my first couple of years unlicensed because it wasn’t mandatory. I left the industry for more than 20 years and then returned working for a small home builder as an employee for their rental portfolio a few years ago, working as an employee for a company that directly owns the real estate also does not require a license as you are not contracting to any third parties for management of their properties. My Real Estate License has long been expired as I worked in other industries, and I don’t particularity want to do it again, its costly and time consuming compared to what I had to do way back when. I too have been thinking about doing this type of VA work: Writing Ads, Editing Pictures, Posting Ads and doing back office work such as accounting and perhaps even taking calls and dispatching trades for work. Obviously I can’t show properties, I am not local. I could also prepare legal notices though serving them may present a problem. I could do most routine correspondence to tenants and prepare leases, even do e-signatures and tenant applications & verification, possibly even some para-legal work that I have extensive experience with. I am also good at property market research. Usually the issue with licensing come into play when you touch money. Would the above listed tasks be allowed in most states…California included? or are any of these tasks solely reserved for licensed professionals? In my jurisdiction you have to be licensed to accept security deposits and rent payments (money) you also must be licensed to show properties to perspective tenants. Nowadays the money part can all be done electronically directly to the property owner without ever touching the agent. There is some grey area around writing and posting advertisements if you are not licensed. I think the better question then is: What can someone do to assist a property owner as a VA that doesn’t require a State Real Estate License to deal in Property Management? I am interested as I really don’t want to run afoul of the law with what I am trying to do myself. I think the question isn’t so much about a licensed virtual assistant.

Let’s say it took 6 hours for a hard working man to chop down the tree. The smart work: A smart working person will invest time in sharpening the axe before chopping down the tree. It will not only reduce his efforts but also reduce the time of cutting down the tree.

The hard work: Hard working people will pick up the axe and start hitting the tree. They will keep on hitting it until it is cut. It takes a huge amount of time and their effort. Let’s say it took 6 hours for a hard working man to chop down the tree. The smart work: A smart working person will invest time in sharpening the axe before chopping down the tree. It will not only reduce his efforts but also reduce the time of cutting down the tree. If he spends 1 hour in sharpening the axe, he’ll still be able to chop down the tree in less than 5 hours, and also, with minimal effort. Conclusion: Smart working people also work hard, they know the value of their time and efforts, so they don’t work hard for the same thing again and again. Once you have sharpened your axe, you can chop down multiple trees without much efforts, until you need to sharpen it again.  Task 2: You’re asked to separate nails from a mix of sand and pebbles. The hard work: To handpick the nails one by one out of the mixture. It may take you an hour or more depending on the quantity of the mixture. The smart work: To buy a magnet and separate out the nails. It may not take more than 10 minutes. Conclusion: Hard working people invest their time in doing things, smart working people invest their time in acquiring the skills and resources to get things done. Buying a magnet is like investing in a resource/skill that will make your work easier, not only once, but it will help you with the same task again and again, in future as well.  You might be thinking that the examples are too hypothetical, who asks to chop down a tree or to separate iron nails from a mixture? So, lets take an example that you may easily relate to: Task 3: Suppose you're the monitor of your class. Your teacher gives you a bundle of notebooks to arrange in alphabetical order. She gives you the attendance register for reference where all the names are already sorted alphabetically. The hard working way: You read the first name from the register, find that notebook from the bundle and keep it aside. Again, you read the second name from the register, find the notebook from the bundle and keep the notebook above the first one, and so on. This way, you'll have to scan through the bundle of notebooks multiple times and it will take a lot of effort and time. Now, lets look at the smart way: You distribute the notebooks to the respective student. Now, take the register, read out the name from the register (which is already sorted alphabetically) and ask the person to come and submit the notebook to you (assuming you can take this privilege since you are the monitor of the class). It won’t take more than 10 minutes to arrange the entire bundle and with almost no effort of yours. Conclusion: Smart working people don’t do anything different, they do the same things differently. Let’s directly jump into examples: Task 1: You’re given a task to cut down a tree. The hard work: Hard working people will pick up the axe and start hitting the tree. They will keep on hitting it until it is cut. It takes a huge amount of time and their effort. Let’s say it took 6 hours for a hard working man to chop down the tree.

However, this doesn’t mean that everything is going to go smooth 24/7 – there are some complications that may arise when you work with a virtual assistant, regardless of how smart or professional they may be. Below, we are going to tell you the common challenges in working with virtual assistants so that you can gain an understanding of how to overcome those challenges … Starting Out Starting out has to be one of the most difficult tasks for a virtual assistant. When you first start out as a VA, you’re going to have to take time to learn about the company, and get to know what your “boss” expects from you. If you’re lucky, you’ll be working with someone that paints a clear picture for you and can tell you exactly what they need. Communication Speaking in painting a big picture for you, communication is another difficult task. For some virtual assistants, the most difficult task they have is communicating with the one that hired them. In fact, communication is sitting at the top of the most common challenges when working with virtual assistants. Regardless of the size of the business, communication is a big thing – it is something that needs to be carried out consistently and efficiently in order to succeed. There needs to be time set to the side for your virtual assistant to speak with you and talk about your goals. Communication will affect the performance of every person that is involved. For example, let’s say you have a new project that you assign to your virtual assistant – you put files together, forward it to your assistant and tell them about the new project to work on. You fail to give specific instructions to your virtual assistant. This includes how you expect the final output to look, and the deadline. For a virtual assistant, is important that they ask any questions that may have about the project before they start. Along with needing to be specific with the details you communicate, you also need to be consistent with your communication. Simply speaking with your virtual assistant and letting them know that they’re doing a good job on their work can go a long way for motivating them.

Apologizing in a corporate environment is seen as a sign of weakness.Know how to say “F*** You in a polite manner”. Keep everything official and on mail. Any conversation or promise made offline is useless, always remember that.Regularly discuss with your manager what is required out of you as an employee. Set practical KRA’s and work towards them. Any extra initiative that you take otherwise should solely be based on your own choice and discretion.Be accommodative. At times, if you have to put in that extra shift or work in a few extra hours, please do it but do not make a habit out of it. Companies see you as an asset, at the end of the day.Be approachable. The very first rule of being successful in a corporate environment is to be likable because of the skillsets and persona you have, not your looks. Be friendly, get to know as many people on the floor as you can but always keep that professional dignity unless you are really close friends.Upgrade your skillsets every 6–12months. The world is changing, new tech and processes are coming in every single day. So, if you want to be a step ahead of the curve, constantly keep learning new things.Be street-smart. If you had to choose between a good package and a good working environment with slightly lesser emoluments, take the second option. It will be easy for you to strike a work-life balance, and in the long run, you will save a lot on medical bills, psychiatrist counseling sessions etc.Plan your leaves. This is something I have learned over the years as I do travel a lot. Take your entitled leaves, plan them out, inform your manager well in advance, and just forget about work during that time.Take ownership. Never play the blame game in the corporate environment. In case, you are being framed, cool it down and talk to your seniors later. Any heated argument should be avoided at any cost.Know when to leave a job. If it is too much a toll on your ego, health, and career growth, leave the job but on good terms. Never take a hasty decision.Bonus: You will meet 95% of people you would not like or want to work with, but you have to. Just put on that fake smile and get to work. Keep things simple.

I started off freelancing on Elance (now called Upwork) years ago so freelance websites could be a beneficial stepping stone in your business, but I wouldn't depend on freelance websites either. I encourage people to build their brand so clients can find and hire you independent of freelance websites that way you have more control over rate and branding. Here are a few options for you. You may have to get creative, but this will help you. 1. Register on freelance platforms. Yes, some websites may charge a fee or percentage, but you can find clients or better yet clients can find you. The purpose is to get you work, experience, and reviews. Don't forget about LinkedIn. Make sure you have a LinkedIn profile as well. They also have a freelance platform called ProFinder. https://www.linkedin.com/profinder 2. What sort of duties or work will you do in your virtual assistant business? Will you be more administrative or social media management? Don’t spread yourself too wide but be very specific about what sort of tasks you do and how you can help someone if they hire you. 3. Who is your targeted audience? Do you want to work for busy women entrepreneurs, startup CEOs, etc.? You have to know this because it will help you with #4 & #5. 4. Go where your targeted audiences are. Build your social media brand following and connect with your targeted audience. 5. Share your expertise with your targeted audience through blogging or vlogging. 6. Send cold emails to people you want to work with. I did this and landed a few clients. If I saw a job listing for my line of consulting work, I would send the hiring manager an email and offer my services on a freelance basis. Most of the time your clients may not be looking for a “freelance” person but an employee. I hope those ideas help you.

There are some great VA's on those pages, it just takes quite a bit of searching.  Cheap does not always mean quality work. If you hire an independent VA, like myself, every VA tracks their time differently.  I use a software called toggl, where as soon as I begin your project or assignment, I start the timer.  I can go back to it multiple times over a week/month and then invoice you depending on how much time I have worked.  This is why most clients choose to go the ""retainer"" way, where the client will pay for a bulk of hours per month upfront (I have 10 and 20 hour packages) and just send assignments to the VA.  The VA then tracks it the same way, but does not invoice you, since you already paid upfront.  They'll let you know when your time is running low and you can decide whether or not you want to renew.

Airbnb rent-out If you have a spare room or even a house that is suitable for living in, you can advertise such services on one of the available platforms. This method isn’t for people who can’t bear the presence of random neighbours. At the same time, it is a profitable and stable source of income, which you can improve by better self-promotion and condition enhancement. Babysitter In case there are numerous kids in your neighbourhood, you can offer their parents caring services if they need some extra free time. According to the specialized portals, average hourly pay of such babysitters is around $28. Keep in mind, you wouldn’t like this job if you don’t feel comfortable with kids or aren’t sure you can adequately calm them down. Music reviewer Well, there is hardly anyone who wouldn’t love music. At the same time, all personal preferences are unique. With this in mind, you can sign up for the portals that pay you to evaluate the tracks critically. Some just ask for a suggestion about your level of excitement, while others can request an extensive review and will pay accordingly. Support centre worker  Some companies tend to hire home-based workers for performing maintenance job of responding to the clients’ issues. If you own a computer/laptop and have a stable internet connection, as well as don’t mind people asking you the same things every day, you can make pretty decent money with this occupation. Telemarketer This is a similar position as the previous one, but it implies you to be the initiator of calls. This job will suit you if you are into persuading others into the necessity of the product/service that your company offers. Communicational skills are a must-have on this job since any wrong word can end the call without achieving the right result. Online casino operator This is another highly lucrative online job that can offer you a low-investment managing position. The ability to create your own internet gambling platform on a franchising option is a perfect chance to start receiving a stable profit with little interference. Also, as time passes, you will be able to set up an independent venue, that will be a licensed platform with an impressive annual turnover. Copywriter, translator, transcriptionist These three positions have a lot in common, but the primary skill you must possess is language fluency. If you enjoy creating new content, you can start writing articles, stories or even books; if you are passionate about other languages, there are plenty of available tasks for translation; if your listening skills are trained enough and you don’t mind typing what you have just listened – transcribing is just for you. How I managed to turn a home-oriented business into an enjoyable activity Again, for me, the pleasure was the critical point of home-based occupation. Since I am staying in a comfortable environment, I wanted the job to be similarly pleasant as well as bring sufficient income. The choices were various, but to cut a long story short, I opted for the online gambling business. Why exactly this sphere?  Well, I formed my final mind when I got acquainted with the professionals from the company my friend advised me. Responsive staff quickly explained to me the strong sides of the sphere, including effortless organizational process (from 2 weeks), quick pay-off (3-6 months), and total market revenue (over $45 billion for now). However, there was something more. I wanted my business to run smoothly with my little interference, so this was exactly what I was looking for. As soon as I set up the platform, configured the optimal working conditions, it started bringing me profit while I didn’t have to make almost any impactful actions. My dream home job came true, and I wholeheartedly hope that yours will be similarly enjoyable. Have a nice day!

So, as I suggested, part time jobs are available for every domain you are interested in. Be it culinary where you could start your own small venture which involves supplying healthy food dabbas for children in the nearby schools or even starting off with a small culinary or baking workshop for women in your neighbourhood. Else, if you are an expert in finance or HR, you could start with your own consultancy. A keen interest in marketing could plunge you into direct sales jobs in umpteen cosmetic companies looking out for dynamic women. One other area where you could look out is the educational sector. If you are passionate about teaching children, why not take up a qualifying training like NTT or Montessori and start working in a pre school. Another wonderful option could be to start your own educational franchisee and be your own boss. And that's exactly what I am doing for the past 3 years and I don't regret that decision one bit. I am talking about a company named Cuemath, which has been revolutionising Math education in India for the past 6 years and has taken its expertise abroad so children of every country earn the benefit. Cuemath- An after school Math Franchisee Although a 6 year young company, Cuemath has the country's largest teacher network and is growing each passing day. If you are well qualified, have a passion for teaching and can devote about 3 to 4 hours of your evenings, then just take the plunge as the setting up a CUEMATH franchise is as simple as that. Excellent Trainings and Certification Once you register to become a Cuemath teacher, you have to undergo rigorous training and assessments to help you start your center and further run it effectively. Once the training is done, you are presented with a certificate stating the genuinity of your training and the green signal to start your center. The higher grade module further involves tougher levels of assessments before you are certified. Minimum Set up cost Setting up a CUEMATH center is extremely hassle free unlike setting up any other franchisee that demands huge initial investment. The initial investment of Rs.7000 is purely for the teaching materials and aids that you would need to start your center. However, the other investment is on a tab with the pre specified configuration. This can be used for personal work too and hence cannot be considered as a purely an investment for Cuemath. So, what are you waiting for? If you think you have in you, just go for it. For more details and links to apply, kindly go through my Quora bio section. All the best!!

The only difference is that the virtual assistant works remotely! It is a very popular business because it allows a gain of efficiency and a reduction of important costs. Some tasks that can be done by a virtual assistant A virtual assistant can touch everything or on the contrary specialize. Here are some examples : Management of social networks: A company can for example have several groups on Facebook to manage. A virtual assistant can schedule the publication of the content, answer members' questions, advertise the page / group by posting to other groups etc.Transcribing videos or podcasts: If you're hosting podcasts or posting videos, you can produce transcripts to feed your blog with textual content. This is a great way to optimize your content strategy by strengthening the different channels.Moderation of your forum / site: If your website offers users to publish content, a virtual assistant can take care of the moderation.Promote your site via comments: Posting constructive comments on other blogs is a good way to generate traffic but also to build relationships with other bloggers. The only problem is a task that can be very time-consuming and that can be handled perfectly well by an AV.Article review / publications: If you publish content on social networks or on your website, a virtual assistant can reread and correct any mistakes (in addition to providing feedback)To put it simply, an AV can do a lot of things.

Even if an AV is not physically present within the company, he must take all necessary measures to be available. He must also meet the different demands of his client. Good communication skills Starting from the first point, you must inform the customer of the progress of his work, so establish how and when you should update him when he becomes a customer and before starting each new task. Some customers prefer daily monitoring when others prefer a weekly report. Be sure to be on the same wavelength. If a customer constantly has to chase you for updates, it means that you are not doing your job properly. Management of time The research apparently indicates that you should focus on one thing and that it is inefficient to do multiple tasks at once, but that's kind of what we do in life! Of course, you need to focus on the task at hand, but you will also work with several clients who all think they are your only or most important client. You will probably have many things to do in the course of a day, so plan ahead (leaving time for unplanned things) and plan the tasks when you will be most effective.

How to find your first contract as a virtual assistant It is recommended that you take a relatively easy first concert as an AV. You may be wondering: ""How to have my first client as a virtual assistant?"" When you start working on these platforms, your primary goal should be to get as many positive comments as possible. Do not worry about ordering a high hourly rate early in your career or you may be preparing for failure. The best way to get these high-paying virtual assistant positions is to build a portfolio of positive reviews on the best freelance platforms. Put yourself in the shoes of someone looking for a virtual assistant; one of the first things you will check will be comments provided by other customers. When you build a positive reputation as a virtual assistant , you will be able to earn a higher rate as you gain experience. Think about the skills you currently have and the skills your client may need. When you match these skills to your client's requirements, you will be able to develop new sources of revenue while charging a higher premium.",2021-03-04T15:05:38.853Z,"How can I become the most popular Virtual Assistant?

Video Production 22. Software Education Let’s take a look at the top 5 ideas that’ll make you money in 2020: 1. Dropshipping Are you looking to sell products online but don’t have the money to buy and store inventory? Consider dropshipping! Dropshipping is an ecommerce business model in which you don’t have to manage any physical products. All you have to do is set up an online store, and partner with suppliers who’re ready to store, package, and ship orders to your customers. What’s more, you don’t need to spend hours on product research because you can use dropshipping apps like Oberlo to find awesome products to sell. If you’re searching for easy online business ideas to pursue, dropshipping might be a good option for you. 2. Content Writing Almost every company with an internet presence needs help with creating content for product pages, blogs, etc. As such, starting a content writing or copywriting company could be one of the most profitable business ideas for you. Popular websites for finding those first few customers include Remote , Problogger Jobs, and BloggingPro. You can also join content writing groups on Facebook to promote your business to a wider audience. There are lots of ways you can make a good impression on clients, such as by offering keyword optimization or custom graphics as part of your services. 3. Home-based Catering If you have a knack for cooking and see it as a creative outlet, you can make a decent income by opening a home-based catering business. The initial investment depends much on how big you want the setup to be. For example, if you start with smaller events that you can manage on your own, you should be able to start your business for less. Most home-based caterers start by creating a website, experimenting with local food markets, or joining platforms that allow cooking experts to squeeze some profits out of their culinary skills. 4. Virtual Assistant One of the most successful business ideas is to offer virtual assistant services. Everyone from large enterprises to solopreneurs require help with the day-to-day management of their business.

You can land your first few clients by responding to listings on platforms like FreeUp, PeoplePerHour, or Virtual Assistant Jobs. This is a proven business model as people are always looking for efficient virtual assistants. 5. Website Flipping Website flipping is among the new business ideas that have got everyone from work-at-home to recent graduates excited. It involves buying an already running website, improving its design and content, and then selling it for a profit. There are quite a few places where you can buy and sell websites to earn a profit. Shopify’s marketplace Exchange, for example, allows you to buy ecommerce websites that you can further improve via content marketing, SEO, and other tactics. Once your site begins to generate more revenue than when you acquired it, you can list it for sale on the marketplace.

I knew how to write but working as a writer is something totally different. You don't get to write what your mind tells you, you have to write what your job asks you to. Then again in the month of March I backed another oportunity from Internshala. The company's name was ShahWebsetters. I was asked to write articles and reviews about blockchain based companies. Now that was a tough one. While I knew what blockchain and cryptocurrencies were, I never delved very deep into them to be able to write about them. But then I discovered, a great content writer is the one who is good at writing and excellent at his/her research. So, I worked for ShahWebsetters for around 2 months and simultaneously did my research on how and where I could get better writing opportunities. While I wrote about blockchain companies, I realized two things: It was a really interesting niche and it was still growing which means there must be a lot of writing opportunities. Then I started cold emailing potential clients as I had learned that cold emailing is a great way to land high paying jobs. And it did work for me. So, how can you learn skills for freelancing? Choose what you are interested in (something that can be delivered through digital medium)Brush up your skills. You can also try for internships as they are a great opportunity to learn as nobody judges you (people know, interns are there to learn and they can deliver perfect materials all the time)Start small (if you don't consider yourself very good at whatever you prefer to do). This will help you build up some great samples to show to other potential clients in the future.Keep reading blogs from freelancers who do the same work as you. They have great advices as to where and how you can find better work opportunities. (I've learnt a lot from other content writers who are well settled.)There's always more to everything. Never let your thirst die.I don't consider myself settled in this field, but as I worked my way to big clients, I've learned a lot.

Rather like R2D2 in Star Wars. The main problem that I find as a contractor to companies in trading difficulties that their computer programs/suites are totally out of line of what they require. Many of them buying off the shelf packages, only to find they need “tweaking”. As you will know the best way to make a program unstable is to start mucking around with the coding or program structure through amendments and “work a arounds”. Once you have learned the skills and prepared to continue updating them in the current world you business is pretty secure. That said in to day’s market there are a lot of people all vieing for the same job ( to call it competitive is a misnomer since it comes down to the fact there are more people than jobs), there is no such thing as a stable job. Just as a couple of quick a examples: Who would have thought in the 1950s that the milk roundsman would become extinct.That a supermarket “check out girl/boy” would be taken over by self bar-code scanning customers who fed money their credit card in to a machine which had read the goods, listed them and totaled them up and accept payment whether by plastic or hard currency.In the latter for girls in particular it was seen as the first step on the ladder in the same way as filing clerk, or copy-typist. I can recall when I first started Credit Control in the 1980s , I had full secretarial services, dictated in to a pool of tapes which the typists in the pool extracted in order of deposition and time recorded. These were sent back to me and my colleagues via my line manager for my signature, placed in an envelope to be collected by the Post Room operatives. 30 years, and certainly with the advent of e-mails and boards such as this, most people do their own typing, which although answers the issues about confidentiality. In my case particular, legally sensitive documents. As an aside this has gone down the “food chain” in so far as most teenagers, indeed 10 year old’s can “touch type”; something unheard of up to 1980s. I think these days there is no longer a career pattern available as technology changes so quickly, I think I am probably the last generation who will have worked in one sector to all their life; even if that employment has been broken. Actually moving away from it is proving to b even more difficult. Sadly employers want a “Jack of all trades and master of none”; covered with the euphemism as a “flexible approach to work “ or “multi-tasking”.

Leon’s Story Leon had heard about affiliate marketing from a family member who was talking about how they were making money in their spare time. Leon became curious about this way to make money, so he started searching the web and came across me on Facebook. We talked about affiliate marketing for about a day, if I remember correctly before he decided to join Builderall under me. I worked with Leon for a few months but he never made a dime. I tried to remind him that we talked about building an audience with free traffic because he didn’t have a following base, but he wasn’t hearing any of that. I showed him how to take down his site and funnels but before he took everything down, he made his first commission. It was a little too late though. Leon had already made up his mind that he was going to try something else, so he requested his commissions, took down his funnels and website, then left. This is what happens to many people who start affiliate marketing. They don’t make any money and they give up before they see the fruits of their labors. The funny thing is that first commission was a sign that he was on the right track. Paige’s Story Paige's story is basically the opposite, but I want to use it because she started at the same time as Leon. Paige had heard about affiliate marketing from a friend who told her that she would be able to quit her job in 6 months due to the commissions that she was bringing in. Paige’s friend told her how she had been an affiliate for years, using a blog as her traffic source. Paige started to look around to learn more about affiliate marketing until she stumbled onto my Instagram profile where she DM’d me. We had talked for a few days about affiliate marketing and a number of other things before she decided to join the Builderall program under me. Now, if you think I’m about to tell you I taught her everything and now she’s making $10,000 a month, then you’re wrong. You see, she already had a Facebook page with 5,000 followers on it. I looked at her page and it had really good engagement, which is more than I can say for my personal IG account lol. We worked on getting her audience excited about what she was going to promote and then we started to build a funnel so she could collect names and emails. Paige made $2,000 within the first day of launching her first funnel, but I don’t want to be misleading by letting you think she made that because of me. No, she had already put in the work and was pass ready to monetize. What Paige had in her favor was key things all affiliates need. The following base.People who knew, liked, and trusted herEstablished as an authority figure in her nicheGood engagement.I only helped her get her Facebook page members hyped about what she was going to give them and the funnel she made. So to answer your question, “How much can a beginner make in affiliate marketing?” it depends on what you have going for you. Now there is another route that could have been taken for Leon where he could have seen some income coming in and that would have been buying solo ads or social media ads. The thing is, he didn’t have the money to test, make adjustments, and test again so we went the free traffic method. Like with Paige, I’d help him set up a funnel that would have collected data on what type of people were opting into his funnel so we could run ads at a really cheap price. Unfortunately, using free traffic takes time and not a lot of people have the patience to see that method through.

A client looking for a specific solution is looking for motivated people who are focused and specialize in a specific skill set. A person who offers plenty of different services is likely an expert in none and can be qualified as a “virtual assistant”. VAs get hired for more generic jobs that don’t require specific qualification. Ideally, you should aim for the skill that you’re most excited about and would be willing to develop and grow for the next few years. This would strengthen your personal brand and increase your success rate when pitching clients interested in that particular service. If you want to expand a bit, make sure that all of your services are relevant and can be bought as a package. For example, a copywriter can also offer SEO or social media marketing. Or a web developer can also stress on their front-end skills or database qualification. Diverging too much would send mixed signals and question your authority and experience in each area. If you still insist on focusing on multiple services, create different sites and profiles for yourself. Each “business card” of yours should focus solely on one particular skill. You can market each of them separately and land clients from different sources.

Here is my story… I ran a company that had a big dispatch division and I use to pay between $12 to $15 USD for our dispatchers here in New York. It was very hard to find quality personnel and it was always tough to find reliable people as it for whatever reason considered a “low end job”. With this said, I 100% outsourced my dispatch team to the Philippines and let go og the American team. I even spent a week there just to make sure the move was going to be successful. Guess what… my overall performance of the agents almost doubled, the agents were 85%–90% educated with a college degree, and the job that was considered a “low end” job here in the USA was actually considered a great career in the Philippines. The new agents were motivated and happy - unlike here in America! The agents in the Philippines, funny thing sounded more professional then my American workers and most didn’t even have an accent! They sounded just like they were in the room next to me. Not only did I save the company over $600k a year with the move, productivity almost doubled, and just as important, time and energy that was used to manage the dispatch end of the business in the past was reallocated to growing the business!!! THE BEST MOVE EVER FOR ALL THE REASONS ABOVE. Now if you are only getting one virtual assistant, you can hire them by the hour or pay by the call. If you are only looking for someone to take your calls/messages, even screen your calls, you can do that cheap. It will cost $9.99 a month plus 75 cents per call. For hourly, they will do basically everything a secretary can do but outsourcing you’ll pay a lot less. In fact, for $5.50 an hour and that is all in, no taxes, no other fees, etc. They can do everything of course all the above in the other plan, plus set appointments, data entry, sales calls, collection calls, social media posts, live website chat, click on that link and it will explain more but they can do it all. Just contact them and tell them what you are looking for so they can match you up with the right agent. But at the end of the day, outsourcing is the BEST bang for your buck! Just make sure you work with a good company that has agents that speak English without or with very little accent. This is why I personally stay away from call centers in India, etc. Stick with the ones who can manage your virtual assistant, get a fill in should your agent get sick and hire quality agents that sound like they are in the very next room to you.

6040fa3922d1c358659e5bd2,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-work-from-home-jobs?-,"I have mentioned free WFH that can be done without any investment. 1. Game tester This type of home work is ideal for gamers, because you should have experience for it. It's about testing new games for content and technical errors before they hit the market. Such jobs are relatively popular. There are also offers for permanent positions, but these are mostly freelance extra earnings if you want to work from home.

Game tester This type of home work is ideal for gamers, because you should have experience for it. It's about testing new games for content and technical errors before they hit the market. Such jobs are relatively popular. There are also offers for permanent positions, but these are mostly freelance extra earnings if you want to work from home. Contact For a job as a game tester directly to the software company, look up current job advertisements, for example at Joblift , Adzuna or on the corresponding placement portals such as Note, however, that there is not always money for the tests. 2. Usability tester The usability test is a special form of product test that deals with digital content. For example , they test apps, software or websites on behalf of the manufacturer . You evaluate speed, user friendliness and appearance and look for logical and technical errors. They are based on given test plans and document the results. Apart from interest and general experience in handling the products to be tested, you do not need any specialist knowledge. Concentration and precise work are important. The job is good for students and for working from home. You can find offers for permanent positions or freelance work via job boards or search engines on the Internet. You will of course also find job offers on the relevant agency platforms. In our opinion, the following are particularly recommended: The remuneration is usually performance-related. That means there is a fixed amount per test. 3. Create digital products If you create e-books, audio or video courses , you can sell them to as many customers as you want without any additional effort. These digital products often generate passive income even after years . This is not about classic home work, with which you immediately generate regular income, but rather a self-employed activity with a high initial expenditure of time. Because the digital products must offer your customers benefits and meet their quality requirements. 4. Working from home as a programmer As a programmer, you can also work very well from home, although you must of course have the appropriate programming skills. It is an advantage if you have a command of several programming languages ​​such as C ++, PHP and Java. Most programmers specialize in databases or app development , for example . Programmers work as employees or freelancers. In this way, students can gain practical experience. 5. Graphic designer Working from home is no problem for both freelance and employed graphic designers. In the case of an employment relationship, however, it depends on whether the employer allows home work. In order to work as a graphic designer, you need special skills that convey an education or a degree. However, the job title is not protected. 6. Web designer Web designers are self-employed or employed. It is possible to work from home as only one computer workstation is required. In most cases, communication with customers takes place online. In the case of an employee relationship, however, the employer can request presence in the office. A web designer creates and maintains the websites of his customers. He must be familiar with both the technical and the creative sides of these tasks. Web designers are often themselves clients for graphic designers and copywriters. The job demands many skills and offers good income opportunities. The customer acquisition takes place at the self-employed normally through its own website, as this is also an important business card of their own work as well as online marketing activities, advertisements on portals and referrals. 7. Video producer A video producer creates videos and films. Typical projects are image films, advertising clips or videos from private events . If you are filming yourself, you cannot work entirely from home. Editing, sound editing and inserting effects take up a large part of the time. If working from home is important to you, specialize in these activities. To do this, work as a freelancer with partners who concentrate on filming. There are also companies that are looking for professionals for this work. 8. Write, correct or proofread texts Whether for company publications, online shops, blogs or magazines , the need for content is great. Much of this is written by freelance copywriters and reviewed by proofreaders and editors. A corrector pays attention to spelling, grammar and typography errors. An editor also checks the content, structure and logic of the texts. A linguistic and, in the case of specializations, technical training is an advantage. But lateral entrants with the right talent can also familiarize themselves. 9. Translate As a translator, you can easily work from home. Because, unlike an interpreter , you only translate in writing . The job title is not protected. Nevertheless, the work makes high demands. You not only need a good knowledge of the respective foreign language and the cultural characteristics of the country, but also have to master the subtleties of the mother tongue. Furthermore, specialist knowledge is required if the texts deal with special topics. It makes sense to specialize during your studies or training. Because literary translations have different requirements than the translation of technical texts or websites. The possible earnings depend on the language, your abilities and the type of text. Many translators work freelance. 10. Data and address recording In some organizations, it is occasionally or regularly necessary to manually collect data . These are, for example, addresses of mail items, lists or business cards, but also survey and research results. These tasks are often delegated to freelancers. However, permanent positions are also possible. Payment is based on the quantity, with a fixed price per data set being agreed. If you regularly do this work as a freelancer, you need to register at least one small business . For an employment relationship, you conclude an employment contract. This work is not difficult, but requires a high level of concentration. You can find relevant vacancies on job boards and classifieds. Always check whether you can work from home. 11. Internet research Both companies and research institutions occasionally outsource research work. These are often simple tasks such as finding company data or prices for market research . Some research work also requires knowledge of the relevant area, especially in the scientific field. This work works well for students. A fixed price is paid for each information researched. You should therefore have sufficient internet experience. These research tasks are often performed by freelancers. Employment with an employment contract is possible in individual cases. Corresponding job offers and orders can be found on the common job exchanges, including on Joblift or Adzuna . 12. Virtual assistance This involves taking on secretarial work for which no presence is required. Companies like to use this option at peak times or to bridge vacation phases. Even small companies without their own secretariat make use of this support. The tasks include answering calls, organizing appointments or answering e-mails. Virtual assistants work from home as self-employed or are employed by a corresponding service company. In this profession, it is also often possible for employees to work from home. Payment is made according to time or at a fixed price for tasks taken on. This occupation is also suitable for a main occupation. 13. Customer support Customer care is often, but not always, based on an employment contract. Because it's about communicating with a company's customers by phone, email or chat . This requires more extensive knowledge of the company's products and services. You can find relevant positions on the job exchanges. They answer questions, deal with customer concerns and receive complaints. Friendliness and customer orientation are therefore the most important requirements. Customer care can also be provided by self-employed home workers as part of virtual assistance. 14. YouTube Your own YouTube channel is also suitable for working from home. In the long term, you can achieve a good passive income and build your own business. But that also means that there is a lot of effort before success. You need to regularly produce interesting videos and use clever marketing to draw attention to your channel. Because this is the only way to reach enough subscribers to generate a decent income. The income is generated by placing advertisements and through affiliate links in the video description. YouTubers with a very high reach can also receive product placement contracts. Running your own YouTube channel is always an independent job. If you want to know how to create your own YouTube channel in no time at all, you should watch the following video: 15. Sell DIY products Do you like to be creative in your craft? Then you can make money selling your homemade products . Sewing and needlework, self-made jewelry and decorative items bring in additional income or even a main income. You work from home and can turn your hobby into a profession. 16. Sell stock photos As a hobby photographer, have you saved a lot of pictures and new ones are constantly being added? Use this treasure to make money. Certainly some of your works are suitable for websites and publications. About exchanges such as Alamy or iStock can be photo-rights sale . Of course, you cannot work from home only because you are taking photos away from home. But you are not tied to fixed working hours and do a large part of the post-processing of the photos and assigning the keywords at home. The best part, however, is that the photos will still generate passive income even after a long time without you having to do anything. And apart from a good camera and suitable image processing software , there are no initial investments. 17. Make money as a blogger You can also work from home and make money with your own blog. The income is generated through affiliate links . These are referrals linked on your page for products or services that you get paid for. For example, depending on the agreement, you earn on every click or purchase. Large online shops and other companies offer programs for this. For affiliate marketing to be worthwhile, your blog needs to achieve a good search engine ranking. On the one hand, it is important to publish interesting articles on a regular basis. Second, you have to take care of search engine optimization ( SEO ). You can make a lot of money with a good and extensive blog. The initial effort usually pays off in the long term 18. Dropshipping Working from home is also possible with your own online shop , especially if you use the dropshipping concept. This means that the wholesaler sends the goods directly to the customer. You don't come into contact with it and don't need a warehouse. You don't have to pre-finance anything either. Therefore, this variant is also a good start for founders. Your task is initially to set up the online shop, for which you can use Shopify , for example . The most difficult thing is to find suitable wholesalers. But once the shop is up and running, you take care of product range maintenance, advertising and customer relationships. You can work completely from home. If you want to find out more about how you can set up your own online shop, we recommend Christoph Schweiger's dropshipping video course . Here you will learn step by step everything to do with dropshipping. 19. Take surveys online For a significant income, you would have to register with many of these portals. Also, the very widespread payment with vouchers or bonuses does not offer the same flexibility as money. But surveys are a good opportunity to earn a few euros on the side, while you can work from home or during the waiting times that arise in everyday life. Because a smartphone is enough. 20. Product Tester Another option for working from home that is suitable as an extra income is to test products. You can do that via Pinecone , for example . Basically, however, paid tests are rather rare. For this you can, for example, register at Mystery Shopping where you will be selected for suitable tests. Most other portals, however, deal with the evaluation of purchased products , for which you receive vouchers or reward points. 21. Assembly, production and packaging work Working from home is also possible without a computer. This is the classic form of home work where you carry out simple manual activities . In advertisements, jobs are sometimes offered for filling surprise bags or installing ballpoint pens. Do not accept such work if you are to pay money for the material supplied. Because there are also black sheep in this area. It can be more worthwhile to ask local businesses about working from home. Due to the proximity, the delivery routes are not long and the employer provides you with the necessary work equipment. They also usually receive an employment contract. Payment for such work is almost always piece wages. 22. Micro jobs When a larger project can be broken down into small tasks, it is called crowdsourcing. This creates micro jobs that you can do online via portals such as App Download Typical tasks are internet research, categorizing photos or creating small texts . Usually the earnings are low in relation to the effort. Therefore, micro jobs are not particularly suitable if you want to make a living from working from home. However, they are a good idea for an uncomplicated additional income with free time management. Which employers still allow home work? There are numerous other opportunities to work part-time, self-employed or as a full-time employee from home in a wide variety of industries. In online job boards you can search specifically for opportunities that enable you to work from home. To do this, enter “home work”, “home office” or “work from home” in the search bar. With the various offers, pay attention to whether it is an employment relationship or a freelance work and, above all, a serious offer. I have mentioned free WFH that can be done without any investment. 1. Game tester This type of home work is ideal for gamers, because you should have experience for it. It's about testing new games for content and technical errors before they hit the market. Such jobs are relatively popular. There are also offers for permanent positions, but these are mostly freelance extra earnings if you want to work from home. Contact For a job as a game tester directly to the software company, look up current job advertisements, for example at Joblift , Adzuna or on the corresponding placement portals such as  Continue Reading",2021-03-04T15:18:17.834Z,"What are the best work-from-home jobs?

But most of the time this software came in the form of packaged applications that had to be installed locally to use. Once purchased, the customer owned the software outright and might buy a maintenance and service package and maybe the new version in a year or two. FContinue ReadingA couple jobs that, although they existed ten years ago, didn't mean the same thing or were not as important: Customer Success Manager   Ten years ago: The software industry has moved rapidly over the last ten years from a model where giant companies sold software to other giant companies on CDs or, in some cases, over the internet. But most of the time this software came in the form of packaged applications that had to be installed locally to use. Once purchased, the customer owned the software outright and might buy a maintenance and service package and maybe the new version in a year or two. For every dollar a company spent on keeping customers happy after the purchase so they'd upgrade, they spent nine selling to new customers. Today: Most new, valuable enterprise software companies are selling internet-based software, or software as a service (SaaS), and they're selling it via subscription. This means that getting new customers is still critical, but retaining them is just as important. Because you're not getting all the money up front in a license, you have to make sure they're happy, are using the software to their own advantage, and will decide to renew the subscription when the time is right. The number of customers who don't do this are measured by churn, and churn, right after new customer growth, is typically the second question anybody will ask about the health of the business. The people who keep churn low are Customer Success Managers. They do everything necessary to keep customers happy enough to renew.Community Manager  Ten years ago: There were communities for social products like Facebook, Blogger, and eventually Napster, but most communities weren't being monetized well enough to justify somebody to manage them. Many forums and some forward thinking media companies engaged real community managers, but this was an exception.Today: Communities are present and being monetized effectively for most major B2C service networks, like Waze, Spotify, Pandora, Houzz, etc. And counter-intuitively, for most large B2B companies like Cisco, Symantec, NetApp, HP, and EMC. Groups of knowledgeable enthusiasts are finding enough value in these services and forums that community managers are a necessity. Although the roles can be wildly different depending on the type of forum or service, the basic need is to support the community with services such as moderation, adding new features, and enabling growth without compromising quality.

Do you want to work from home? Do you have secretarial training (BEP, BTS, specific diploma)? Or do you simply have a typing talent and a large organization? Look no further, virtual assistant work is for you! Modular schedules, a fixed remuneration, and a schedule at your convenience. Using a virtual assistant is common practice, especially among self-employed and very small businesses . Why a virtual assistant? The reason is this : as soon as a certain turnover / profit ratio is exceeded, the question arises to know what to delegate in order to start enjoying its success while continuing to focus on the heart. of his activity . The more customers arrive, the more administrative, tax, and accounting issues grow and end up filling entire days. We wrote an article about this: learning to delegate . When an entrepreneur is overwhelmed, he naturally needs an assistant to assist him. This virtual solution therefore benefits the entrepreneur and the assistant. The entrepreneur who is often on the move, or with a small office, will not have to install a new office for his assistant. The savings are not a few hundred euros, but it is in thousands of euros per year for an office! Yes, it is necessary to pay the rent of 10m ² extra (in the metropolis the m ² is expensive), it is necessary to invest in an office, in a computer, in software licenses, to buy a telephone, to make a corner cook, to pay the supplies, etc . Few people, however, will be able to afford to hire a full-time person on an assistant position, or simply do not have the workload to fill a full-time position . They then seek to use the services of a virtual assistant. Other companies are interested in this type of service for one-off periods, especially during the summer, when many of their employees go on holiday to ensure the workload in their absence. Finally, other companies may have too much work to do for existing staff, and need help from time to time with an off-site assistant to handle some of the workload. With the increasing development of home-based businesses and activities, demand for this type of service will continue to grow. This is an ideal niche for entering the market as an online business: the demand for online virtual assistant ships is very strong at present. You can bill your services on time, on a contract for a given job, or on a monthly rate base. This is one of the easiest and cheapest online activities. And also the most interesting for who has to work from home with flexible hours: the virtual assistant can do his work without having to move every day, or make a presence in the office, he will have several bosses if he or she wish it, and will manage its schedule as it sees fit. His boss will not be above his back to spy on his screen morning and evening. Skills to become a virtual assistant Excellent computer skills will be a valuable asset. Oral and written communication skills will also be important because your clients will demand quality work from you, and you will need to communicate with them regularly. In addition, knowledge and understanding of the current world of business will be a plus. A virtual assistant (or a virtual assistant if you are a man) performs exactly the same tasks as a classic assistant: - daily tasks, - computer input. - prospect new customers, - answer phone calls, - organize the agenda, - scan documents, ... The people you have online will not know that you're teleworking, it's completely transparent to them. You can find yourself deep in the Ardèche or in the heart of Paris. Cost to start this activity You will first have to create a website. The price varies between 15 euros per month if you go through a web service type Free Website Builder | Create a Free Website | Wix.com. If you want a website with more functionalities, count for a price of 800 to 1500 euros . You will also need to start having a phone line and office equipment. If you already have some of these items, your initial start-up costs will be reduced accordingly. An important question you will be faced with is the compatibility with the software your customer uses . No need to put all your efforts into developing an electronic report, only to realize that your customer can not open it. Beforehand, find out about the software that most of your customers use. To start your business, you will need these software . Other fees will be related to the promotion of your business. To start, you can expect between 500 € and 2500 €. How to start administratively?  You have two options: payroll (you are self-employed), or become a salaried employee of a company specializing in tele-secretarial services. 1st option, the wage portage. If you have a good address book and therefore enough contacts to find your own bosses, then the portage salary is ideal. You depend only on yourself and you will have the choice to take more or fewer contracts depending on your availability. Your bosses will not be taxed and you will be able to choose people with whom you want to work. The benefits are greater, but the risk also if you do not find customers. 2nd option, to become a salaried employee of a secretarial company. The advantages of this option are many.

Getting lost in a new job is complicated, especially if you have never practiced secretarial work or telecommuting before. If you are currently employed in a company and want to telework, it is better to inquire before leaving your job. You can even apply for a tele-secretary position for just a few hours a day, in addition to your current job. Your day will be heavier in hours, but you will find your hands on this new type of work, and you will discover if you are made for this career or not.

It’s a little difficult to answer this question because the success of a career switch usually depends on the degree to which your earlier work experience can be successfully used in the new position. But I’m curious why you spend a decade doing an entry-level job. Were there truly no opportunities for promotion? Did you simply not take ownership of your career and just went with what was familiar and comfortable? Being stuck in an entry-level position after ten years in the workforce is…peculiar.

I had been leading Design and Product Management teams in Silicon Valley, after working in Tech for over 20 years. I decided to leave the corporate world and my old career behind, and I became a Leadership Coach and Career Advisor. As I wrote in more detail in this article, if you want to start something entirely new — like your own business — it comes down to three types of opportunities: What you can doWhat you knowWho you’ve becomeWhat you can do I’ve found that this is one of the easiest businesses for a 9–5 employee to start. Why? Because it is based on what you already have several years of experience doing in your day-to-day job. You have either been providing a variety of services, creating some product, or maybe even a little of both. A useful exercise is to transform your current detailed job description into a business plan. How would a business describe its services if it offered what you do day-to-day? What would that company charge? If your employer hires contractors or consultants to provide similar services, what are they paid? What you know If you’ve been in the working world for many years, you have acquired a great deal of knowledge, skills, and experience. This “Toolbox of You” can be packaged up and sold as books, courses, training services, workshops, and more. Unlike the first option, which is typically considered “active,” this business can generate both active and passive income streams. “Passive income” is a bit of a misnomer. It does require a great deal of active work to capture the information and put the system in place that will generate passive revenue later. Who you’ve become For this last type, you must have achieved a degree of visible and recognized success. I will admit that this is the most challenging business to build of the three, and not everyone will be able to do it. It goes beyond what you can make or do, or even what you know. It is based on who you are, your career and life path, your notable success, and the resulting lifestyle you now enjoy. In Summary The longer you work in a specific type of role and for a particular type of company, the harder it is to imagine doing anything else but that career. You may have even forgotten what it is that you wanted to do with your life in the first place. It is tempting to break free and start your own thing, but you may feel stuck, overwhelmed, and at a loss for what “your thing” is. I hope you understand that you can wrap up your talent, skills, knowledge, and experience and create a lucrative business from that package (more quickly than you may have thought). I know many people who have done just that. I was almost 50 years old when I started a new career and my own business.
