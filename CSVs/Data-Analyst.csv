This means we distinguish between the position for data analyst or data scientist at X. We also read about, hear about, work with, or recognize teams.

People hear about many companies on the public stock market, startups at areas that foster new companies, or government agencies and headquarters. We let Z fit into any of these places. You can vary each one, a suggested factor in X, Y, or Z. The simplest answer to your question means that someone with data analyst seeks data scientist in X. They might fix Y and Z during their development. They can satisfy the requirements, skill set, and people relationships toward data scientist in X among the context in Y and Z. If they seek a few more variable changes in Y or Z, they need to account for them. In a community of individuals, working in professions, agreeing to terms at companies, supporting public and private schools, and fostering a community for cities, they deal with a much larger context. In addition, individuals only in X work with city and state officials on behalf of tax collection, city planning, and state government and development. And of course, any person in X regardless of data analyst or data scientist profession, contributes to the federal government. My simple answer for you, without working many years, suggests I have little context to work with. I cannot draw from past experiences, common talks, and a knowledge about our intent. If someone in X talks, walks, and works like a data scientist in Y and Z, they can make the transfer from data analyst.

Business Analysis is a disciplined approach for introducing and managing change to organizations, whether they are for-profit businesses, governments, or non-profits. Business analysis is used to identify and articulate the need for change in how organizations work, and to facilitate that change. As business analysts, we identify and define the solutions that will maximize the value delivered by an organization to its stakeholders. Business analysts work across all levels of an organization and may be involved in everything from defining strategy, to creating the enterprise architecture, to taking a leadership role by defining the goals and requirements for programs and projects or supporting continuous improvement in its technology and processes. - IIBA To keep it simple according to me would be- Elicit, Analyze and Define Requirements- Define and Validate the solution - This can be done along with the help of different project members like technical team etc. Even while presenting a solution Business Analyst does not need to go too deep in Technical Aspects, these are handled by Technical personnel. Business Analyst present the solution at a conceptual level or may describe on architectural level certain technical aspects. Data Analyst Analysis of data is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains. Third Step would be based on roles the skills and knowledge required Business Analyst - Communication, Analytical thinking, Domain Knowledge, Generic technical Knowledge, Problem solving skills,Decision solving skills, Managerial Skills,Negotiation and Persuasion Skills. Data Analyst - Data analyst also needs similar skills with some additional skills like to analyze data like SQL, DATA mining, OLAP, Reports etc Conclusion- From the First Step - Business Analysis as a task can be performed by the Data Analysis particularly during the initial stage when the Data model, Data analysis model and Presentation model are defined. In the Initial stage, when models are defined, we always start with understanding the Business problem. Business User needs which data in what format, when do the need it and why they need it. So in a company there could be a scenario for Data Analyst where the Business Analysis and Data Analysis task can be performed by a same person, that person should possess skills required for Business Analyst or Data Analyst (They have created a profile called Business Analytics or BI analyst) or it could be divided in form of two roles which are Data Analyst and Business Analyst.(Which seems to be more popular in Indian IT industry ) From the Second Step - Business Analysts seems to be operating more on a strategic roles and is generic in terms of solution design for a business problem Data analyst seems to also operate on operational level constantly operating on Data to understand the problem areas, monitoring data quality , report etc From the Third Step - Data analyst needs specialized data analysis skills and knowledge like SQL , Data mining , Tool knowledge etc Data analyst comes under roof called Business Analytics which data warehousing, business intelligence, enterprise information management, enterprise performance management, analytic applications,monitoring and governance, risk, and compliance. So data analysis can also be be part a broader profile. Note - Business Analytics and Business Intelligence (BI) are two terms heavily used when people are talking about data and what it can do for their company. Some people use these terms interchangeably, some strictly distinguish between them. Some (IBM [6], SAP [7]) consider business intelligence as a subset of BA, others [8] [9] think the opposite. There are many different opinions. For example, research Defining Business Analytics and Its Impact on Organizational Decision-Making [10] conducted by Computerworld says “Business intelligence (BI) is an important aspect of an organization’s strategic framework. But what is beyond BI? Some indicators point to business analytics, a progression from BI, as the next step. Business analytics is predictive as well as historical, which requires a cultural shift to the acceptance of a proactive, fact-based decision-making environment, providing organizations with new insights and better answers faster… Through this research, we can see that IT and business professionals mainly align business analytics with BI products. In fact, more than half of respondents (54%) cited BI as the category of products that first comes to mind when they think of the term “business analytics”.” What is Business Analytics? - Matouš Havlena Job Requirements Here are few job requirement for a data analyst that will provide you some perspective about the profile.

For insert-only & unschema'ed data, you can do a ton with a highly tunable database like Cassandra, which lets you determine on a dataset-by-dataset basis how much is in memory vs. on disk. One issue you're likely running into with your SQL server, and one you would run into with any inherently centralized (i.e. not distributed) database (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc), is that your queries aren't run in parallel: as datasets get very large, parallelism is a must. Parallelism comes from distributed databases and distributed query paths. Some distributed databases + query systems that are good for rigid schema stuff: Vertica (company) is the old standard, and I've heard good things about Citus Data. Some distributed databases + query systems that are good for arbitrary schema stuff:  Apache Hadoop+HBase is the old batch standard, and Apache Storm + Cassandra (database) is a great realtime alternative, depending on your needs.  Additionally, a batched analysis hack we've seen people using in the AWS universe is an interesting combination of Amazon S3 and Amazon Elastic MapReduce, where flat text files (one JSON object per line) are stored in S3 and processed with EMR.  This can get quite expensive as the dataset grows, but analysis can be highly parallel and reasonably quick at arbitrary scale (given that you have the budget).  Dev time on something like this is pretty minimal when compared to Hadoop+HBase. At my company (Keen IO), our job is to abstract away a lot of this difficult stuff, and put a developer-friendly API on top of it.  Under the hood, we use Storm + Cassandra, plus something else out of Twitter called Trident, which is described well here:  Trident: a high-level abstraction for realtime computation.  This lets us process billions of arbitrarily-structured events, with arbitrary ad hoc queries, really really fast -- and because Cassandra is so tunable, we can move entire datasets or subsets of datasets into memory where applicable, on a customer-by-customer basis. To get better response times at large volumes, a common technique is batch and cache:  use something batched like Hadoop (or your large, likely join-heavy SQL jobs), run it on a scheduler, and cache the results.

Another thing is, you should be able to present yourself to the best. Look, it is not that you must be from a CS/IT background. Deloitte is a company that looks for people who are able to learn quickly. For getting selected into Deloitte, either show very good portfolio of technical knowledge directly coming from IT industry or else show a good portfolio of extra curricular activities by presenting yourself in a very decent manner. Let me tell you the selection process: WrittenIn written test, you have 5sections (English, Maths, Reasoning, SQL, C-coding). For clearing the test, you just require basic mathematics up to 10th standard. Reasoning questions are mostly from arrangements in different manners and sequences. For SQL, I would suggest going through the extreme cases (NULL statements), transactions, etc. Refer Ivan Bayross if you want to learn SQL. C coding involves two questions: 20marks and 40marks respectively. One question is for creating a pattern and another examines the arrays and pointers logics. 2. Group Case Study The case studies are usually from the situations where data maintenance is a problem and for it you should just keep points in a well planned manner and with references to upcoming technologies in market. Believe me, don’t take names of extreme technologies that are not required for the situation. Some people just know a word Hadoop and they start saying this everywhere even where handling of big data is not required. Analyze the case properly and then build your points. It is usually of 7–10 minutes and in this 7mins are for discussion and 3mins for giving presentation on sheets that will be provided to you. I got this case study, ” There is a company running 3 atomic energy plants but their reporting tool takes a long time. Apart from this, the data is not centralized. So, you need to propose solutions based on the points they will give to you including the budget, development plan, etc.” Give examples from real world situations rather than your mind. 3. Technical Interview Let me share with you, they love DBMS a lot. They will ask you about ER-diagrams and SQL queries based on the projects that you are explaining to them. If you have something live launched in the market, then show them. It really gives an advantage to you towards selection. You can take your laptops, phones, etc. if you made something really nice and appreciating. 4. HR Interview Here, you should prepare for the most expected questions like family background, introduce yourself, your hobbies, achievements, difficult situations in life, etc. I would suggest you, give one answer soo effective that you just selected in that single move. At the end, luck is something that matters in companies, because they are sometimes confused to choose among the candidates, so just chill. “If you don’t get selected in a company, just keep faith in yourself that this company doesn’t have level to take you and a bigger company is waiting for you.” All the best !",2021-03-06T06:35:33.103Z,"How should I prepare for a Data Analyst interview at Deloitte?

You have to be pretty comfortable with advanced math to be a data scientist, and that just takes learning, practice, and working through mathematical equations & problem sets. Coding — To get anything done, today’s data scientists use coding on a regular basis. Popular tools are iPython or Jupyter Notebook, R, and advanced SQL. To use these tools effectively, you need to be comfortable with writing and reading procedural code (if/then statements, for/while loops, functions) and with dealing with source control repositories and understanding how web applications work. Python is perhaps the best language to learn, but a background in Java, C++, or other “real” languages (not scripting languages) can work.

You can break these down further, but be sure to know these 5 at the very least (I’ve combined a few of them together). Data Exploration and Cleaning: You should know how to explore different data sets and clean your data so it is ready for analysis. As a data analyst, you’ll be spending about 70–80% of your time in this phase. Data Analysis: Now it’s time for you to learn how to conduct some analysis. You’ll need to know your basic statistics, probability, and linear algebra to get meaningful insight. Data Visualization & Presentation: Once, you’ve done the analysis, you’ll need to learn how to communicate your findings with others. Things like visual perception, color, presentation, etc. Tableau is great for this! Each step is critical for the data analyst to know and understand. Here’s a Udemy course I created that goes over each of these steps at an introductory level. It might be too basic for you, but just here for anyone interested. Data Analysis Course For Beginners - Udemy Learn About Statistical Analysis You’ll also need to know the basics around statistics, probability, and linear algebra. Brush up on the following (and supporting topics): -measure of central tendency -measure of spread & variability -measure of shape -normal distribution -CTL and confidence intervals -hypothesis testing -simple linear regression Then apply the above topics to conduct the following: Descriptive analysis - This is analysis done using historical data. So this could be something like analyzing last years sales to find any trends in the data that you can use for future promotions. Inferential analysis - This is simply using a sample set to make predictions about the entire population (very common in statistics) Predictive analysis - The practice of extracting information from existing data in order to determine patterns and predict future outcomes and trends.

The value of the nano degree credential itself is unknown since the job market has yet to decide how much it is worth (no one has completed the degree yet). That being said, the skill set one acquires is much desired for, and I (after 3 semesters with G-Tech's Udacity program) can personally vouch for the quality of courses on Udacity in general. While the nano degree isn't an accredited Master's degree, it actually offers a bit more flexibility as Udacity can use instructors from FB and Google who aren't necessarily tied to a university (something hard to do for an accredited degree). Thus, the nano degree students have teachers from the private sector, whereas the master's students on Udacity are confined to professors tied to universities.  Feel free to comment or message me, as this is something I am extremely passionate about, and I truly do believe the Georgia Tech program has changed my life.

You have not mentioned anything about yourself so I’m just considering you are a fresher and looking for jobs. So let’s breakdown each and go in-depth. A Solid Resume:A solid resume contains At least one internship (It’s totally ok, if you don’t have any focus on next points)Knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, AWS, Docker etc.Few super amazing projects which helps other people and involve use of latest technologies. - Python, Go, nodejs, APIs, AWS, shell scripting etc.Few contributions to good open source projectsAchievements in programming, Hackathons, Competitive Programming etc. (To prove you’re good in Algorithms and Data structure)Activities which show you have some leadership qualities.Why networking is important? Networking is extremely and very effective in getting a job or internship. You don’t know when and where you may need someone’s help. Good networking will get you referrals, recommendations etc. Connect with people on LinkedIn, Facebook, Quora, Angel List and ask questions to them.Read more about them first and then write a small message introducing yourself explaining how you can help or contribute in their projects/work etc.Show them your skills and qualities.People usually feel good when you have already done your research about them and give them any suggestions, idea in their projects/work.Don’t start spamming, wait for response at least for 2 weeks before you do a follow up.Attend meet ups, Hackathons, tech talks and conference near you.One is always better than zero so at least try, there is no harm in this. Lastly, leadership will give you much bigger opportunities than just 9 to 5 jobs in front of computer. Work on personal development, it helps a lot in the long term. I hope I answered your question.

I will attempt to answer this question generally to provide some intuition, then share a bit of data. But first, let me put up a Venn diagram.  My random forest predicts you rolling your eyes. But bear with me.   I expect many of the readers of this question have come across the other data science Venn of 'hacking skills', 'math and statistics' and 'substantive expertise'. That's a great picture. The problem is that is does not tell you about roles. And with many self-branded data scientists, it gets messy. (The other problem is, well, you try putting any diagram with 'hacking skills' in front of IT departments in large companies and let me know how you go.) So I use this diagram. It is taken from a masters course I am completing, and it was developed by industry professionals in the analytics field. But more importantly, it has roles in the overlaps :)  The answer to this question is in the Venn, but first it is also worth looking at the commonalities.  Both data scientists and BI analysts do visualizations.  Tools are just tools.  BI analysts may be part of deploying a visualisation (or a few of them in a dashboard) in a 'production' environment more than data scientists. But they certainly both 'do' (conceptualize, design and build) visualizations.  Both data scientists and BI analysts work with data sources.  Managing data is just managing data.  Some may work with traditional data warehousing technologies, star schemas, normalised tables and BI cubes. Some may work with more modern distributed or cloud based storage technologies. But they both work with data sources. Both data scientists and BI analysts do programming.  Coding is just coding.  Loading a modelling library in python, writing up scripts or SQL queries to perform and check ETL, or building a D3 app may typically exist in very different parts of an analytics project pipeline. But they all require programming skills. But in addition to that, data scientists are expected to be statistically literate, run experiments, interpret data with a mind on causation and - most often - do modelling. That is the main distinction in my mind, and the high level answer to this question. I am sure BI analysts can do these things if they want to, and I do not doubt that many of them have the capability to. But they would not be responsible for it.  Experimentation, statistical interpretation, plus building, testing and using models - whether they are statistical, optimisation, time series or machine learning - sit primarily with data scientists.    Secondly, at the more detailed level, you will see that these high level statements mask many exceptions. This also partially explains the variability of answers to this question. At the industry level, you will see that the categorisation is full of phrases like 'more likely', 'most common', etc.  This is the underlying reality. There are no absolutes in tools or skills. But this gives a bit more of a flavour of the differences between BI and data scientist roles (at least in the Australian market).    You are welcome to download the paper here. p.s. To the question details, IMHO it is not at all surprising that there are many people 're-branding' into data science. When you put together a higher salary package with a nascent space often misunderstood by recruiters and hiring companies, there are opportunities for people to opportunistically 'trade up'. It is unfortunate as that ultimately hurts the profession, but things are maturing quickly and I hope hiring practices will tighten up soon.",2021-03-06T06:50:46.891Z,"What is the difference between a data scientist and a business intelligence analyst?

In simple words, Data Science is an umbrella term and Data Analytics is a sub-part of it. So here I am gonna tell you the differences between the two terms in the simplest of words based on my experience.  Let’s start with the basic meaning DATA SCIENCE According to Wikipedia’s definition, Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that uses various scientific methods, processes, algorithms & systems to extract insights from structured & unstructured data. A Data Scientist gathers data from multiple sources & complies it together. After that, he/she applies ML, predictive analytics & sentiment analysis to extract critical information from the collected data sets. The goal of Data Scientists is to obtain meaningful information from large sets of data. DATA ANALYTICS Data Analytics is the most basic field of Data Science. A Data Analyst process the existing datasets by performing statistical analysis. Analysts uncover meaningful insights for current problems by various methods of capturing, processing & organizing data. KEY DIFFERENCES Data Scientist identifies the problems & then provide solutions for them. A Data Analyst, on the other hand, is hired by the company to solve their business problems. An Analyst only deals with solving the problems.A Data Scientist & Data Analyst also differs in the manner of handling data. A Data Analyst mostly manages structured data & use SQL queries for such purpose. On the contrary, a Data Scientist is responsible for handling unstructured data also & uses NoSQL.It is very important for a Data Scientist to have strong communication & management skills to deliver insights & make efficient decisions. However, Data Analyst is not required to possess communication skills & Business acumen.

Theoretical knowledge should be broad and involve mathematics, market and technology. Requirements and sensitivity to data, including statistical knowledge, market research, model principles, etc. 2, the use of conventional analysis tools, including databases, data mining, statistical analysis tools, common office software (Excel, PPT, mind map) and so on. 3. Have a certain business understanding ability and understand the business logic behind the business. Because only understanding the business problems can be converted into data analysis problems to meet the department's requirements. 4. The ability to report data and visualize data. Data analysis is no better, if you can't ""express"" in a beautiful way, the results will be greatly reduced. Second, use data analysis as a ability to cultivate Most of the work now requires you to have the logic analysis ability, especially the analysis and understanding of the data. Today, with the deepening of the concept of data operation, large Internet companies such as BAT emphasize that all employees participate in data operations, and data analysis as a capability in training is also a future trend. Third,The skills and knowledge required by data analysts The four steps of data analysis: data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, data presentation.1, data acquisitionData acquisition seems simple, but it needs to grasp the business understanding of the problem, and transform it into a data problem to solve. To be straightforward, what kind of data is needed, from which angles to analyze, and after defining the problem, then collect data. This link requires data analysts to have structured logical thinking.Recommended books: ""Pyramid Principles"", McKinsey Trilogy: McKinsey awareness, tools, methods;Recommended tools: mind mapping tools (Xmind Baidu brain map, etc.); 2, data processingThe processing of data requires an efficient tool:Excel and high-end skills: Everyday work is common, easy to master, and it is easy to process 100,000-level data.FineReport: Professional reporting tool, a daily report design can be used as a template, as long as you can write SQL to get started. Compared with excel reporting, the development of technical requirements is less, can quickly develop regular reports, dynamic reports, and can be placed on the mobile and large screen viewing. Oracle and SQL sever: The most commonly used tens of millions of databases in the enterprise, proficient in the SQL language.Maintain continuous technical learning, such as learning a new and popular distributed database such as Hadoop to enhance personal abilities and help with job search.3. Analyze the dataAnalytical data often requires various statistical analysis models, such as association rules, clustering, classification, prediction models, and so on.Therefore, mastering some statistical analysis tools is inevitable:SPSS series: old statistical analysis softwareSAS: Classic mining software that requires programming.R: Open source software, new and popular, more efficient for unstructured data processing, requiring programming.Various BI tools:Tableau: the originator of the visualization tool, freely visual analysis of the processed data, the chart effect is amazingFineBI: Similar to Tableau, it can perform arbitrary dimension analysis on the front end; data can be processed at the front end (computation, filter and filter, etc.), and can be connected to a big data platform such as Hadoop, and the data processing performance is better. 4.Data visualization Many data analysis tools already cover the data visualization part, and only need to effectively present and report the data results, which can be displayed by wordPPTH5. Fourth, about the career development of data analysts 1.Data analysts are usually divided into two categories, technical analysts and business analysts, the division of labor is different, but each has its own advantages.Technical analysts work on data mining and analysis in specialized mining teams. If you can grow up in this type of professional team, it is fortunate, but the threshold for entering such a team is high, and you need solid data mining knowledge, mining tool application experience and programming skills. This type of analyst is more inclined to the technical line, the future career channel may take the expert's technical route. The role of technical analysts includes data engineers, mining engineers, data scientists, modeling engineers, data architects, ETL engineers, etc. These titles all represent more or less the nature of their work. A business analyst is a data analyst who sinks into various business teams or operations and becomes a member of the business team. Their work is to support business operations, including abnormal monitoring of daily business, customer and market research, participation in product development, and establishment of data models to improve operational efficiency. This type of analyst is biased towards products and operations and can be turned into operations and products. 2.The ideal industry of data analysts on the Internet, but the road to Rome, take the right route. Fifth, at last 1. Use data analysis as a capability to develop good data analysis skills in the current team, but I strongly recommend that you still need to learn the programming skills of system development, and for business intelligence systems (BI and CRM) has some understanding, this may be the advantage of applying for data analysis. 2.Solidly learn one or two data mining software, based on your existing programming foundation, you can learn SAS or R, basically can meet the needs of a large number of enterprises.

Whats the outcome of analysis and how does it impact other people?Problem solving - Create issues trees for the problems you try to solve. Brainstorm and have different scenarios to solve 1 problem.Personally I’ve faced a lot of challenges to be a data analyst. In one of the experience from my past I was embarrassed by my VP when I was asked very basic questions on statistics (I couldn't answer as I was nervous). I went back and studied hard. I even sat with my juniors and took help from them on learning statistics basics. I was challenged when I worked with my colleagues who came from the best colleges in town. So yes its challenging if you want to work with the best people. Challenging because your coding abilities, problem solving, quant skills are all continuously challenged by your seniors, juniors and you have to stay ahead of your game.

With the increase in data, organisations are adopting these technologies to gain better insights from the data. Big Data analysts help organisations to fulfil their needs by curating valuable insights from raw data. In this article, we list down 6 must-have skills in order to become a skilled Big Data analyst. 1| Multi-Programming Skills The fundamental knowledge of data structures and algorithms is very crucial to learn before you start to learn the other skills and it will help you throughout your journey. To be a good Big Data analyst you must know and understand the statistical languages such as Python and R. You must learn how to code and be able to write, understand and correct errors in the code which includes a massive amount of data. Besides Python and R, there are other programming languages such as Scala, C++, SQL, Java, etc. which will be benefiting you in your journey. 2| Data Visualization The easiest way to understand a concept is through visualization. Big data analysts working with a large number of both structured and unstructured data helps an organisation to view the analytics of the data by presenting it visually. At the present scenario, there are various prominent data visualization tools such as Tableau, Data Wrapper, Plotly, etc. It is basically an easy way to convey the results of the large dataset in a simple and understandable manner. 3| Quantitative & Analytical Skills Quantitative and analytical skills play a major role in Big Data analytics. Knowledge in statistics, as well as mathematics, will guide while curating a large amount of unstructured data. One must have a strong grasp in linear algebra to be ahead while tackling big data problems. Quantitative data analysis methods such as descriptive statistics and inferential statistics help the analysts to summarise the data, generalise results, find patterns, make predictions, etc. 4| Data Handling & Interpreting Managing and interpreting data is not an easy task. With the help of data interpretation, the analysts can review the data for the purpose of arriving at the inference. Handling the data and making sense out of it indeed consumes a lot of time but it can be said as one of the crucial parts of a project. The data in an organisation is growing exponentially day-by-day and handling those to derive insights need a skilled big data analyst. 5| Knowledge Of Multiple Technologies & Frameworks We already mentioned that understanding multi-programming languages play as one of the vital to be a good Big Data analyst. Besides this, there is a range of technologies that a skilled Big Data analyst must know. Frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, etc. helps in streaming Big Data to a greater extent. Components of Apache Hadoop such as HIVE, MapReduce, HDFS, Pig are highly demanding these days. It is crucial for Big Data analysts to be familiar with these technologies and frameworks for better decision-making. 6| Business & Problem Solving Skills A good Big Data Analyst must have adequate knowledge of the business process along with statistical and technical knowledge. He must be able to understand the aspects and the business goals in an organisation before gaining insights and pattern from a large amount of data. Bottom Line Learning these skills will easily help you to create a perfect resume while applying for Big Data analyst jobs but you can’t be fruitful to an organisation unless you get your hands dirty by these skills. “Practice makes a man perfect”, thus the more you practice with these skills, the more you gain insights in this domain.

It totally depends on the data set quantity, how big it is.Post lunch, You’ve finished the analysis of direct and indirect sales for the last month so now you will move onto gathering data on particular distributors and resellers(based on your project it can vary). From this data you will locate the most popular items, trends in the data, relationships that can be drawn from the findings and generally anything you do find that could be deemed as interesting or relevant.You have all of the data collected for the specific re-seller, and have created graphs and charts of relevant material. Now write in any notes that are relevant to the data, such as assumptions as to why some changes in sales occurred, and highlight trends and changes in sales and the re-seller’s buying patterns. This is important as these changes may not be obvious in the chart/graph set.So by now its evening 6.So it all depends on your project. Somedays you have fewer data to interpret and other days you slog longer hours pulling those data and making meaning out of it.

The basic skill set for a data analyst includes programming in Python or R, SQL, statistics knowledge, and some “workflow” computer skills like bash/command line and git. This is a lot, but it’s doable in just a few months if you have a lot of time to commit to learning and can treat it like a job (or like a second job). It’s also the sort of thing you can approach more gradually and learn over the course of a year or two, and I’ve seen plenty of examples of both approaches from our students. Your background also matters. If you have some previous exposure to statistics, or programming, or business analysis, that can help speed things up, and it can make you a more attractive job candidate. But at the end of the day, all employers really care about is whether you have the skills needed to solve their problems. Even if you’re really starting from “zero” you can get those skills pretty quickly if you’re dedicated and you have the right study tools and approach. Just for example, here’s one student I spoke with who didn’t make it even to the end of our data analyst path before he found himself with three job offers. Getting to that point only took him a couple of months, although he did have a STEM background and he was a very dedicated student. So, bottom line: it’s hard to say. If you’re really starting from zero and you have limited time to dedicate to it each week, I’d say plan on 6 months to a year required to acquire the necessary skills and build the projects you’ll need to get jobs.

They don't always have the resources to train people within a short span of time.  2. They might not have a huge team of analysts unlike many established companies running internship programs. In sports companies analysts usually are hired in such a way that they can take up all sorts of jobs. And such versatility comes with experience. Unless you can convince them that you can be useful to them in multiple ways they would not accept you as an intern. 3. Industry practices- being run by a handful of people sports clubs or companies usually recruit by the way of referrals. So, they are not always open to recruiting people from outside (another reason being there is a lot of confidentiality issues due to rivalry among clubs and they don't naturally trust outsiders). So, in case you don't have any  person who can introduce you to any of these sports clubs you may still follow some the approaches mentioned here: Data Science and Data Analyst Internships  Second part deals with sports analytics. It's different from other analytics tasks because here the outcomes are instantly visible as victory or loss. If your analytical inputs are not enough to help the team win matches it's of no value. So the stakes are very high and club managements are not willing to take chances on such a sensitive issue. Also, you don't get a chance to carry out trial and error to select a particular strategy unlike many other products. The various aspects of sports analytics have been discussed in the post Role of Data Scientists in Sports Analytics  that it highlights the skill sets required in sports analytics.

If you want to learn how to be a data analyst, follow the following steps 1. Master Microsoft Excel 2. Learn Basic SQL 3. Learn Basic Web Development 4. Dive into a Concentration Here's how you should start: 1. Master Microsoft Excel First and foremost, master Microsoft Excel. Excel is the most versatile and common business tool for data analytics. While many data analysts graduate to other functional specific paths+tools (data-mining, visualization, statistical-applications, etc), almost all paths start with and likely still use Excel. Start by learning the basic navigational components and concepts (workbooks, worksheets, formula bar,ribbon). Learn a couple of basic formulas (if, vlookup, text, date) and then graduate to the more powerful formulas (sumproduct,getpivotdata,match/index).As you begin to get more comfortable, begin mastering the keyboard shortcuts. Start by learning how to navigate within a workbook/between workbooks. Then learn the shortcuts for formatting, inserting charts/tables, hiding/unhiding/grouping columns/rows. Biased Note: If possible, you should learn Excel using a Windows operating system. The Mac OS version is limited by design and doesn't allow you to learn the traditional shortcuts, which will slow you down substantially. You know you've learned enough shortcuts when you can perform 80% of the tasks you need by only using the keyboard instead of the mouse.Learn the Data->Pivot->Presentation method for designing scalable Excel templates. This article has a good introduction:http://www.databison.com/index.p...Learn how to build different models/presentations for different analytics applications. Build a model for your Fantasty Sports team. Download a financial statement, and try to predict the next quarter's revenues. Download data from the US Census (http://www.census.gov/main/www/a...) and learn more about demographic profile of the US. Excel is good at most analytical tasks as a generalist tool, but not great with any tasks. However, concentrating on Excel will expose you to various analytics concepts which you can later master in other applications.If you have questions, watch the videos or post in the forums at MrExcel. It's the Quora/Stackexchange for Excel2. Learn Basic SQL Excel allows you to slice and dice data, but it assumes you have the data readily available. As you become a more seasoned analyst, you'll find the best way to get at data is to pull it directly from the source, and that often requires pulling data from a Relational Database which likely support some derative of SQL. You should master SQL next. Here's a general guide  Buy a book, find a good web tutorial (Try W3Schools for a light tutorialhttp://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql... or Big Data University for a more involved one: http://bigdatauniversity.com ), or ask an analyst friend to show you the basics for an hour. I showed a friend last week--you'll pick it up quickly.Skip all the stuff about tables and go straight to learning how to pull data. Learn the big 6 reserved keywords:SELECTFROMWHEREGROUP BYHAVINGORDER BYFollowing that, learn how to join to other tables. Know the difference between an inner and outer joinThen take a deep dive and learn the concepts behind Relational Databases. You should know why databases have IDs/Keys, the difference between a fact and a dimension, why indexes are useful, and at least remembered reading the about the 1st/2nd/3rd Normal FormsIf you like the design stuff, pick up a copy of Kimball's the Data Warehouse ToolKit http://www.amazon.com/The-Data-W... Great overview to Dimensional Modeling with an emphasis on different vertical. Then breeze thru Kimball's the ETL toolkit afterward.Graduate to learning how to create temporary tables and indexes. Then create a view and move on to figuring out how to create, insert, and update tables.If you're really hungry, download a copy of MySQL Community Server, setup a database server for yourself, and go at it.3. Learn Basic Web Development This may seem like an odd-ball for #3, but it's a natural next step and an added bonus (or requirement), especially if you want to work at consumer internet companies. Knowing how to read--or at least becoming vaguely familiar with--common web technologies/languages/co ncepts such as HTML and Javascript will enable you become a better analyst in a world that is becoming more web based. Get a wordpress blog, and mess around with it a bit. Add some google analytics tracking to it. Learn about tracking pixels, server-side tags, and get v post.  4. Dive into a Concentration If you nail #1 and #2 and get exposed to the #3, you will have learned the foundations of a basic data analyst. There are a ton of paths to choose once you've nailed the basics. Each of these have their own set of technologies, tools, and careers. A few highlighted below - Collection+Storage. Focus is on optimal methods to collect, store, and make accessible data for various applications. Could mean learning unix, web servers, and regular expressions for mining log files. Could mean learning how to design a star-schema, creating a NoSQL database, as well as determining the optimal solution for inserting, updating, deleting, and extracting data. - Analytics. Focus here is on learning how to better slice and dice data. Could mean learning Excel VBA for automation. Could mean picking up a tool for better visualization (Tableua) of data or statistical analysis (R,SPSS,SAS).  - Presentation. Focus is on data presentation. Dashboards, Reports, Alerts, Data Tables--you name it. You could learn how to use tools that are made for visual analytics (such as Tableua), focus on developing catchy infographics, use an existing SaaS tool for distribution visuals, or dive into programming and create your own set of visuals using jquery/google charts api. As Anon User wrote, the Edward Tufte books are a fantastic way to get lightly exposed to this concentration - Programming. SQL is a declarative language--you tell the query engine what you want and the engine figures out the rest. Most other programming languages are procedural languages--you tell them how to get what you want. The latter is a lot harder to learn, but at some point, you may want to do more than just write SQL code to influence your analytics - whether it be for back-end or front-end analytics applications. If you've had no formal programming experience, take a class. If you know some basics or can simply geek out with the best of 'em, try your luck at one of the more commonly available programming languages. Here are some to consider - Excel VBA. Old, but if you just want to automate spreadsheets, there's no lower friction way to start. - PHP. Dead simple. Tons of examples. Used all over the web - Python. Second to PHP. Beautiful. Increasing more common for scripting, although web frameworks are less common than PHP - Javascript. Plenty of examples, and great if you want to do front-end visualizations. Math/Statistics. Finding patterns in data relies on at least a rudimentary understanding of statistics. Becoming a seasoned data-minor, developing sophisticated forecasting/stock-trading /bidding heuristics will require much more. If you're interested in this component, mess around with R (or SAS/SPSS) to start. - Enterprise. There are plenty of companies that have made top dollars selling full-fledged Enterprise reporting solutions. Cognos, Business Objects, Microstrategy, and Hyperion are a few. You can have a well-paid career mastering these tools and consulting for companies that need them maintained. These tools address all parts of the data analyst spectrum, but increasingly are becoming less common in consumer internet data analytics because they're expense and require teams to maintain them.  Lastly, as you become a more seasoned analyst, don't ignore the ""business"" component. Business Intelligence is not a technical problem. It's a data socialization problem. How do you get the right information to the right decision makers (human or machine) at the right time to affect a desired outcome? Data Hackers add value to a business by surfacing information that turns into business outputs, and the better you are exposed to a particular business, the more empowered you will be to affect the end product.

Clubs are becoming smarter, more efficient. We've probably all seen the graphics and statistics that pop up in newspapers and on shows such as Match of the Day: it began with counting corners and shots on goal, but recently the analysis has become more whizz-bang; not least speed profiling and heat maps, which plot a player's movement around the pitch. But this is just a fraction of the data that can be collected during a match. Opta, a sports statistics company, records around 1,500 ""events"" from every fixture. All 20 clubs in the Premier League , La Liga– and many in the lower divisions – now employ data analysts to make sense of this information. The analysts are involved in pre-match preparation and post-game debriefs; they help to identify transfer targets and devise strategies for nurturing young players through the ranks. These developments have inspired confusion and even suspicion from many supporters, summed up by a recent headline in the New Statesman: ""How the spreadsheet-wielding geeks are taking over football."" Before Germany-Holland at Euro 2012, German data analysts crunched the numbers on their opponents and spotted a weakness: The Dutch defenders often strayed too far apart. The German national team’s secret codebook says that the ideal distance between defenders in a back four is eight meters. The Dutch were regularly leaving larger gaps. In the group game in Kharkiv, Germany located those gaps and won 2-1.History is written by the winners, and, with hindsight, it’s to forget the Germans. One bad night against the Italians in Warsaw, two childish positioning errors by German defenders, and they lost the semi-final. Yet, going into the semis, the Germans were the only team with four straight victories. Since they began serious data analysis in 2005, they have reached at least the semi-final stage of four successive tournaments. Almost unnoticed by fans and media outside Germany, data analysis became more influential than ever before at Euro 2012. Statistics are starting to change international football. Like almost everything on earth, modern data analysis in sports originated in California. About 20 years ago, the Oakland A’s baseball team began finding new statistics to value players. For instance, hitters had always been judged on their batting average. The A’s found that on-base percentage — in those days, an almost unknown number — was a far better predictor of a player’s worth. They found that time-honored methods like stealing bases and sacrifice bunts made no sense. The man forever associated with this is the A’s general manager, Billy Beane. In the recent film Moneyball, based on Michael Lewis’ book, Beane was done the honour of being played by Brad Pitt. Watch the movie ""Moneyball"" , you will get the idea.Go for it.For further details you can google about them.There are lot of data analyst in almost every field of sports.

They are experts in the industry in which they operate, be it finance, manufacturing, retail or research, but at the same time be comfortable with data manipulation using spreadsheets and database tools. They understand business requirements & logics and make sure organizational systems/applications are capable to cater to those ""calculations"". For example, a business analyst working in the finance industry must understand calculations for a payback period and internal rate of return, as both calculations are required to calculate returns on an investment. Communication skills are also critical for business analysts as they must be able to convey technical messages in layman terms to a non-technical audience - the business users. As they must resolve issues relating to end user interactions with computer systems, business analyst must also be strong problem solvers.

That said, you probably want a relational database management system (RDBMS) to practice on. Some good systems with a low-barrier-to-entry include both MS SQL Server and MySQL as well as PostgreSQL because they’re readily available. I think that you’ll develop a more transportable and versatile skill base, though, if you start with an open source RDBMS that is cross-platform. MS SQL Server is proprietary, and even though it does run on Linux and Mac now, is still pretty Windows-centric. So, MySQL or PostgreSQL would be my recommendations. I’d also recommend that you, as an aspiring data analyst, try to shy away from using procedural add-ons to SQL, like Microsoft T-SQL or Oracle PL/SQL.

Too often, I read descriptions of the role and it’s just become a catch-all for “analysts and scientists don’t know how to do this particular thing. So we’ll just get someone who knows how to do all these things they’re not great at.” The job is quickly developing purple squirrel requirements and unreasonable expectations. That being said, it is a job where you need to know a decent amount of a lot of tech from a lot of different areas. I have had to apply knowledge ranging from linux server admining to get the tools I want, to efficient algorithm design as a developer, and machine learning experience to guide what the data needs to be transformed into. Expect to pick up new technologies rapidly in this field as a requirement. A good data engineer will never possess all the skills you want. Good data engineers learned how to learn. Advice to hiring managers: if you have someone lacking a few technologies, but has demonstrated that they know how to learn quickly, invest in that person. If you have an engineer that learned XYZ that you use, but they stopped - their knowledge will be obsolete in 3–5 years (max). I see the field as really developing two divisions within it under the same name. There are support engineers (which I am) and warehousing engineers. There is a ton of cross over in skills, but support engineers focus more on availability, warehousing engineers focus on delivery. First, and foremost though - Data Engineers are not big data DBAs. If all they’re doing is moving data supporting your SQL databases into Hadoop, and then building a few things in Hive/Spark/Pig, or that’s all they’re able to do, they’re a DBA with a few extra skills. Engineering skills handle siloed data and availability and deliverability of that data in scope and scale. But what does “availability” mean? It’s a common word that never gets defined. Does it mean that you can just query it in Splunk? NO. Availability means that you can unsilo data and make it available to other groups + you can connect the data with existing or new data sources. Just a dump into Hadoop data lake doesn’t create availability, being able to connect the data is a primary function. In large corps, other engineers get it into a lake and handle proper schema implementation in transitional or end tables (often with an Engineer’s input since they know the future uses). Data Engineers get that data to the point that it’s usable and/or deliver that data to analysts or scientists. Usability is cleaning, feature extraction, feature creation, and connectivity between sources. Deliverability is pipelines, automation, formatting, and putting that into an end interface. In smaller companies, these roles might be blended, but as data grows in a company - and it always will - these roles should be further separated so you’re not just throwing generalists at your data. The reason is that usability is more focused on creating algorithms and translating scientist/analyst needs into code that acts on the raw. It’s a small data development-to-big data implementation. Deliverability is focused on automation and generalizability/robustness/optimizations from designs that make the data usable. This cannot happen in a vacuum either. Engineers need to understand what data is useful in order to do their job. Usefulness comes from input that scientists and analysts provide. Engineers also often have a lot of understanding of what can be immediately extracted and what cannot, but also what could be extracted. It’s a symbiotic system when it works well. Analysts need X, scientists need Y, engineers get as close to those needs as the data allows. Engineers often work with the raw and can say “Hey, I can also get you Z, and that looks like really useful data you didn’t consider or know was available.” It is a primarily a support position. Engineers aren’t your scientists and building the predictive models, or compiling data into daily reporting/analysis in analyst roles. Many good ones often know modeling, statistics, and are capable scientists in their spare time. Many are active on Kaggle doing their own analysis - it’s fun for us. They can help with the other roles, and if they have bandwidth they can be very helpful and insightful, but that’s not their role. From other engineers, this is an area where frustration often starts to come in. Treat your support staff well. If you just treat your engineers as a go-fetch system for data, they’re going to resent you. A) It’s always harder than it sounds. B) They understand the data at a different level and have a lot of insights into how complex systems interact within your company. Treating them as a go-fetch system is underutilizing them and treating them like they provide no useful analytical knowledge. Also - if you get them to automate your entire analysis (note to analysts) - they just eliminated your job function using their spare bandwidth. Engineers are the ones automating white collar data jobs. I believe another function is developing too, and it might be a primary one later on. And that’s feature creation. Because data often can be linked, just a simple extraction in both sources only reveals the picture in each source. Understanding linkages allows the combination, contrasting, and other techniques to utilize multiple sources to even greater advantage than a few treated as separate. Engineers are well suited, based on their daily duties, to adopt this responsibility and share it with scientists. In the end, analysts, scientists, and engineers all make data speak. Engineers can make the raw data speak the languages that analysts and scientists can understand. Scientists make that data speak to critical questions and predictive systems. Analysts make that speak to business concerns and daily value-added analysis.",2021-03-06T07:12:55.417Z,"Data scientist vs Data analyst vs Data engineer? ",Quora

This means data engineers need to remain cognizant of the concerns analysts and scientists have when it comes to building and deploying models. These concerns are not the same as those that occur in traditional software engineering. Models make assumptions about their inputs that get violated in ways that cannot be known upfront; they need to be ensembled, monitored, matched against user interactions, swapped in-and-out of inference engines and tested against nondeterministic conditions of quality. Data Engineers need to speak some of the high-level language that Data Scientists speak, and understand the most important concepts (and vice versa). Data Engineers should thus have experience building and validating some simple models, and definitely have experience putting those models into production. Data Engineers are not typically expected to analyze/visualize data (unless it’s related to system performance) or build models. If this is happening it is usually a symptom of understaffing or ill-defined requests from the product teams.

This implies that you should have knowledge in areas like SQL, Python or R and any other essential statistical programming language. 2. Basic Statistics This is also very important as a data analyst. You need to understand distributions, maximum likelihood estimators, statistical tests and much more. 3. Machine Learning If you work at a very big company with massive amounts of data then you will have to familiarize yourself with methods of machine language. This implies that you need to know machine words like ensemble methods, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, etc. You also need to know the broad strokes and know the appropriate time to use the various techniques. 4. Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus You might be required to derive some machine learning used elsewhere when you are interviewed. Also, you can be asked questions in linear algebra or multivariable statistics because this is the foundation of many of these techniques. If you are wondering why a data analyst needs understanding in these areas, then you should know that a data science team would need to build their own implementations. 5. Data Visualization and Communication The visualization and communication of data are very important for upcoming companies when making decisions for the first time that are data driven or even companies that see data analysts who make decisions that are data driven. Visualization is important if you want to understand tools of data visualization such as d3.js and ggplot. You need to understand the principles in communicating information and visually encoding data. 6. Software Engineering If you are to work at a smaller company you might need to have a good knowledge of software engineering because you’ll handle a lot of activities like data logging, and might also work on developing products that are data-driven. Not many people know much about data analytics yet due to its nature. If you want to get a job, you need to develop your skills on the job and acquire the necessary knowledge in the various areas of data science.

You have shared some details, but they're not enough to give the optimal suggestion. Nevertheless, I will try my best. Firstly, I think that there are multiple routes to becoming a data scientist, even an aspiring one. Since data science is a highly interdisciplinary field, combining body of knowledge from various domains (Figure 1), one can approach data science from the domain they are most familiar with, while picking up other knowledge and skills on the way. In your case, it seems that you're relatively comfortable with software engineering and know some statistics and data analytics. Thus, you should focus your work on improving your stats/analytics knowledge and skills, while maintaining your software engineering ones up-to-date. As Josh Wills famously said, ""a data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician"".  Figure 1. One of more recent adaptations of the original data science Venn diagram. Source: Data Science Venn Diagram v2.0. Secondly, based on the above-mentioned arguments, you have several options, which you should prioritize, according to your specific situation. These options include: If you have financial ability not to work for a period of time and are seriously interested in becoming a data scientist, you can consider enrolling in one of widely available structured programs. They range from relevant MOOCs (tracks with or without certificate) and data science courses / bootcamps / schools to certificate programs and full-scale masters programs in data science from major universities, e.g., Data Science Certificate and Master of Science in CSE, respectively (as you see, names of the programs vary from containing ""data science"" to being programs in CSE, analytics, data analytics, business analytics and even statistics).There are also several interesting data science fellowship programs (essentially, more prestigious bootcamps) that I would recommend to take a look at. Two sister programs Insight Data Science Fellows Program and Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program are highly regarded by top technology companies. Core differences between them are that the former is focused on the machine learning aspect of data science and accepts only Ph.D. graduates, whereas the latter is focused on data engineering (software development) aspect of data science and doesn't have this limitation (it seems that you better fit the data engineering program, especially assuming that you're not post-doctoral). Another interesting and popular program, which also have the remote attendance option, is The Data Incubator, which offers both local (NYC / Washington, DC / SFBA) and remote (online) attendance options. Unlike many other bootcamps, these fellowships are absolutely free (minus living expenses for local options), as their costs are covered by potential employers, interested in hiring top talent in the field.If you don't have financial ability to not to work for some time or have other family responsibilities, I would suggest you to use an alternative path to becoming a data scientist. I would call this path organic in comparison to focused or intensive one, described above. By organic path I mean finding a software engineering job and combining working on the job with self-study along several dimensions that you arguably need to improve upon / master (mathematics, statistics, etc.). This is the path I've chosen to follow, based on my life circumstances (even though I don't necessarily have a definitive goal to become a data scientist, but want to acquire relevant knowledge and skills for various reasons). There are tons of offline and online resources for mastering data science domains through self-study. For example, see my Quora answer on resources for data visualization: Aleksandr Blekh's answer to What are the best resources for learning data visualization?

They don’t come from a heavy programming background. If you come from academia, their data and programming skills are weak. That means they can’t really do the job in the real-world. Machine learning engineers are programmers.They talk about the importance of math. The machine learning engineer is the top role in this space.

More details below… Knowledge of data pertaining to health care , such as claims, especially Medicare and Medicaid data, or electronic health records. There are not as many people as you think who can analyze health care data just from their own original thought . Many take direction from those who know more about the data sources than they do, and companies are hungry for analysts with technical skill (see below) who can also think about how to build the methodology using the data sources. Each field has its own stores of data that are commonly used and language associated with the data that analysts are fluent in ( acronyms and such). There is a level of understanding of the data that is essential to being able to use it appropriately. The health care field has very rich data sources that have nuances that must be known to the analyst in order to acquire knowledge from the data that the analysis is seeking. For example, if you use claims data when it is first released for a quarter to describe services from that quarter, you may be undercounting services or money because of a lack of runout claims that are paid in the quarter following the quarter of service. This is a very small example ; eligibility and payment in health care has complicated policies from CMS and from private payers.if you hold rather work on clinical trials than health care data, understand the phases of drug approval by the FDA and understand CDISC ADAM.No matter what field you choose: Tehnical skill beyond the basics and willingness to learn new tools as needed. This means understanding scripting (SAS macros , SQL stored procedures) that can build efficiency into data cleaning and reporting. It also also means skill in using R or Tableau (SAS to a lesser extent) to do data visualization. Different jobs require different levels of knowledge in these two areas- programming/developing and data visualization. Figure out which you are most interested in and focus on that.
