Basically, social video is any video content that you create and share through social networks.

Those videos can be regular posts, ads, Stories, cover videos, profile videos, or even comments on social posts. But wherever you post the video, its purpose is often the same—to encourage your audience to engage with your business and remember it. Types of Social Media Videos There are lots of different ways to foster that engagement. 1. About us videos. Share what your business does, and more importantly, why it does it. What sets you apart from competitors?What makes your brand special?You can give insight into the people who work for your business, highlight the unique value of your brand, or share your company’s backstory. Can’t decide which angle to pick? Make three different videos and explore a different aspect of your story in each. Product demo videos. Product demo videos, also known as explainer videos, are a great way to showcase your product. Great storytellers show rather than tell. So instead of telling your audience why your product is great, create a video demonstrating what it does and why it’ll make your customer’s life better. 3. Promo videos. Let customers know when you’re hosting a sale or promotion in an eye-catching way that’ll stand out in newsfeeds. Include all the info your audience will need, such as how they can get in touch and where they can go to purchase your products or services. 4. Customer testimonials. Word of mouth is a powerful tool for finding a new audience for your brand. Create a video that brings positive word of mouth straight to your viewers with videos featuring quotes from satisfied customers, or even a video highlighting a moving story from just one customer. 5. Event videos. Help your social audience feel like they’re part of an event by sharing recaps or even creating live Stories while the event is going on. You can even develop a Facebook Live event to create an immediate back-and-forth between your brand and your viewers. 6. How-to videos. This type of video is a long-time favorite on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest. Not to be confused with a product demo, how-to videos offer audiences education that they might be interested in even if they’ve engaged with your brand before. Try to find topics that relate to your brand and will keep your business top of mind—say a workout routine if you run a fitness business or a recipe if you sell cookware.

If you want to know more about video marketing read this blog: All you need to know about video marketing - Tada 7 Social Media Video Marketing Tips Tip #1: Upload Native Video Content Facebook is a great place to share videos and engage with your target audience. However, when doing so, try to upload and share native videos on Facebook instead of posting direct YouTube links. Why? Because it has been found that native videos perform 10x better on Facebook when compared to YouTube links. In an extensive study conducted by Quintly, where they analyzed 167,000 FB profiles and 6 million posts, it was discovered that Facebook native videos received 478% more shares and 110% more interactions. Tip #2: Share Short, Value-Oriented Videos Want more engagement from your social media video? Then try creating short, useful videos. When done right, these videos can help your brand attract the right kind of attention, spread brand awareness and even improve your organic reach. We produce short video marketing tips for our users.

Right from those 60-second videos on Instagram to the informative 2-minute videos on Facebook. Short videos are popular because they work. Tip #3: Make the First 10 Seconds Count According to a consumer study done by Microsoft, it was found that the human attention span has dwindled to 8 seconds from 12 seconds back in the year 2000.

Tip #4: Focus on Telling a Story People have always been averse to hard selling. It doesn’t matter what product is being sold, we generally don’t like to get bombarded with cold calls or see television ads that are irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, hard selling is not as effective as it used to be. Things are changing, people are changing. Today, it’s all about who can tell the best story and engage their audience. That’s right, storytelling has turned into a new and powerful sales pitch that is getting real-world results. And the video is helping us tell better stories.  Tip #5: Add a Call to Action When you’re marketing on social media, it’s important to have the right strategy. Social media video may not be the only weapon in your social media marketing arsenal, but it is definitely a major one. This means you need to put in serious effort into creating video content that is not only worth watching but also worth sharing.

Or you can always employ the help of a social media marketing agency like ours to point you in the right direction.

On average, a social media video’s organic reach is 135 percent more than a static post. Furthermore, we see many videos that are about awareness of a certain issue or are for the welfare of the animals, humans etc. People now know that words cannot be as influential as the videos! We understand why videos are being used for marketing, promotions, awareness but ever wondered why do we see videos flooding on our newsfeeds on all our social media accounts?

Brands, publishers, and media companies are putting a lot of resources into video creation for their own sites, for social, and for marketing and advertising. At a glance, some of these efforts – especially social video and video marketing deployed on social platforms – may appear to be one and the same. But social video and social marketing are distinct creations. Understanding the differences is key to pursuing any kind of video strategy successfully. Social video is about content creation A social video strategy is focused on connecting with viewers through unique stories and original content. The goal isn’t to drive a viewer directly to a subscription or sale. Rather, it is to grow your audience and foster their loyalty through familiarity with your brand. Naturally, this sets up your social audience for conversion down the road or simply pushes them to become regular visitors of your own site. Having a consistent social viewership and regular visitors to your own site mean you can mine ad dollars from your social video efforts. That revenue is a serious focus for many publishers working in social video. But that revenue stream can only be created by having and growing a loyal viewership. Social video is all about developing that loyalty. By delivering valuable, original content, you transform one-off viewers into dedicated followers who trust and engage with your creations. Video marketing is about promotion On the other hand, video marketing is a decidedly promotional and often sales-focused tool. It relies on the same foundational format of video and may utilize some of the same best practices, like short length and attention-grabbing production. But the content of marketing videos is focused on specific promotion – of a brand, product, or service of some kind. This is in contrast to social video, where the content is meant to be a unique, engaging story, not just a sales pitch. This is all not to say that social video isn’t or can’t be a form of marketing unto itself. But social video works in wholly different ways than standard video marketing. Social video is content marketing One goal of nearly every social video effort is building brand recognition, as we noted. That is where the goals of traditional video marketing and social video overlap directly. But the main goal of social video, specific building recognition by delivering valuable content to target audiences. Consider this example: a new lifestyle publisher focused on women’s fashion and health is trying to grow their social audience. Traditional video marketing would see them place ads or sponsor videos that would highlight their brand and the content they bring audiences. Content marketing sort of cuts the middle-man out of that equation. This new publisher would simply start crafting social video for their target demographic, focusing on stories about fashion trends or health advice. The content of those videos would speak to the core audience they want to reach, who in turn are more likely to engage with and share the videos across their own networks. This naturally builds brand recognition and loyalty, as those interested in the publisher’s content come to recognize their style and see their logo again and again. While not exactly a shortcut, content marketing has proven to be exceptionally more effective than traditional video marketing. This is especially true on social media, where users are interested in original content and interesting stories, not in being bombarded with ads. Instead of feeling like they are being sold on a brand, viewers become natural followers as a result of valuable content that meets their expectations and desires. Helping new audiences discover that value in your brand or organization is the best way to keep them tuned in for the long run.",2021-03-06T07:45:52.862Z,"How is online video marketing similar to social media marketing?

Especially if you see your competitors are not using live video marketing, this is a great chance to stand out and engage more viewers. Choose the video format Product launchLive Q&A sessionsBehind the scenesInterviewsHow-to videosChoose the type of live video you think is the most suitable for your broadcasting purpose. Notify your audience about your live video Make social media posts telling your audience about the date you will be live. This can be an image, a teaser video or anything you think will be interesting for your audience. Add the topic of discussion and encourage your audience to stay tuned. If your live video topic is interesting to your audience, they will squeeze your live video into their busy schedule. Create a video script A video script is essential for having an effective live video. Your audience will get bored if the information you provide is scattered. There are certain tactics you should include in the script - start from telling your audience about the topic, the information you are going to provide, then your name and role. Start with an interesting introduction. Not something like - “Ok guys, let’s wait for a few seconds and then we’ll start”. Nobody has that much time or concentration to wait for other viewers to join. Engage the ones who are already connected. Lots of people are going to join your live video halfway so make sure to sum up what you’ve discussed before they joined. Go live to all of your social media channels If you are using more than one social media platform for your business or product, go live on all of them simultaneously. This will help you engage your audience on-site, without asking them to leave their favorite platform just for watching a live video. Take the extra mile and go to your audience instead of compelling them to click a link and leave a platform. You can stream to several channels by using a multistreaming service such as Restream. Multistreaming will help you have the same video on all the platforms and hence, you won’t have to share the link to the video on several channels - you will have it without making any effort. Prepare a Call-to-Action Decide what’s the purpose of your live video and give clear guidance to your viewers. If your aim is to get more exposure, ask your audience to share your video. If you want to promote a product or service, talk about its importance and encourage the viewers to click on the link at the description. Whatever your reason is, make sure to tell your audience what you want or expect them to do. Analyze your video performance Analyze your live video performance to understand your audience needs. Restream Analytics, for example, enables you to get all your viewers’ data, analyze every stream in detail, see most used emojis and words, etc. Such information will help you prepare a better live stream next time. Live stream your content, stay connected with your audience and remember - the most important thing is bringing value to your audience. If you do so, they will become your brand ambassadors and will share your content with their friends and followers.",2021-03-06T07:46:58.351Z,"How do I increase engagement with live streaming video marketing on social media?

The highe Continue ReadingVideo is always going to be the kind of content because of how immersive it is, and how difficult it is for “entry level” marketers to use. It takes experience and useful tools to make good video content. No matter what your product, service, or brand is, you’ve likely begun to take the step to engage digital marketing more seriously. With COVID-19 and the general increase in work from home opportunities, businesses are finding it increasingly important to engage potential customers from home, through a variety of social media platforms, digital ads, community forums, blogs, and more. The highest conversion rates in these digital mediums are obviously those that are more engageable- content that strikes the viewer's interest and makes them want to learn more about your product. There’s no better medium, than video. Video for online marketing is the holy grail of content, but it’s not always that easy to create. Like images, or any other marketing asset, videos need to be in high quality, formatted for the correct digital channel you’re engaging, have good audio, and of course must convey the marketing agenda in a way that is refreshing (you can only make a slide show of pictures so many times). For startups, creating these high quality video assets can be quite the learning curve, and professional creatives can really buckle down a bootstrapped startup. There are however, resources like Video Jaguar that help makes video creation easier. Video Templates for Business For some people, the hardest part of creating video assets is coming up with the ideas for what to make! There are a lot of nuances to creating effective videos, such as where to place the text, how to animate it, which kind of clips to use, how to splice them, how to transition them in a way that isn’t “powerpoint” quality, etc. As a general rule of thumb, it’s a good idea to investigate other brands' videos and take notes of what you find interesting. Ask yourself how the tone looks, what the meter (speed) of the video is, how long is the video, etc. Then, you can go to the drawing board and plot out what kind of video you want to make! Video Jaguar for example, has over 550+ video templates for you to choose from, based on the type of business you're involved with. Some of their examples include Real Estate Videos, Youtube Intro and Outros, eCommerce Product Videos, and more. You can check out other templates on their website. Having a template is a great way to start your journey down the path of video asset creation. For those that are well-versed in video marketing, these templates can also offer new ideas and perspectives, or even just simplify the workflow of creating large amounts of video content. Videos Sizes and Aspect Ratios One of the most important parts of creating video marketing assets, is making sure they’re the right size. Presumably, you’ll be using this video on a variety of platforms (both social media and non) and thus, will need to know the different aspect ratios of videos that go on each channel. Here’s a list of some of the most common social media sizing guidelines: Facebook: 16:9 (horizontal) to 9:16 (full portrait)Instagram: square (1:1), vertical (9:16 or 4:5) and horizontal (16:9)Twitter: between 1:1 and 2:1, but if the height exceeds the width, the video will be cropped to 1:1 in the feedSnapchat: 9:16 aspect ratioYouTube: 16:9 and 4:3Linkedin: 16:9, 1:1, and 9:16Pinterest: 1:1 (square), 2:3 or 9:16 (vertical at standard width), 16:9 (maximum width)Having a properly sized video for social channels will help ensure that no parts of the video are compromised (cut off), and will also guarantee that your video commands the highest amount of digital real estate possible- which is important for increasing conversions. Video Jaguar has multiple sizing options built-in to their platform, for 11 different social media sites. So when you make a video on the platform, you can simply export it in the correct size for each channel, saving a ton of time and headache from having to resize videos manually. You can start using Video Jaguars social size exporting options on their website. How to Schedule Video Content for Posting As a digital marketer myself, creating video content is only half the battle. The biggest hill to climb is actually making the posts- knowing when to make them, making them consistently, etc. Not only is this a massive time-sore, but it demands a lot of mental bandwidth to jump from digital platform to platform and run through the same cycle (more or less) time and time again. There are tons of scheduling tools available on the market, but when it comes to video, Video Jaguar actually has a built-in scheduling tool for marketers to schedule and post their videos on social platforms. These platforms include Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest, Linkedin, Medium, Twitter, and many more. Have a look at their website for more info. Video Jaguar also has a 365-day Social Media Calendar, which has done-for-you video content for each day of the year, so you no longer have to worry about which type of video asset to post. You can also pick and choose which ones you choose to use. More info on this here. Video Jaguar Features & Costs There are a ton of other features that make Video Jaguar a valuable add to any company's marketing tool belt. Some of these include: Unlimited video downloadsAutomated video creation using AIComplete resell rights (incase you choose to sell your videos)Video Jaguar is all cloud based, so no need for bulky downloads.22 professional call-to-action voiceoversRoyalty free musicMillions of HD stock video clipsVideo Jaguar starts at $39/month, and they're currently (2020) running a lifetime deal for only $59, which includes everything mentioned above.

You can easily add accounts, easily schedule posts on all major platforms, and easily add account managers. 2. Hubspot Although there are many tools that allow you to monitor and publish to social accounts, we recommend that you not only monitor and publish, but also get a platform for closed-loop reporting data, such as Hubspot. 3. Meetedgar Meetedgar is one of the things I recommend because it has the greatest impact on traffic because it automatically shares your evergreen content again. 4. TweetDeck TweetDeck has been for a long time, for one reasonn: it is the best and the best price (what can beat for free?)The way, and part of it, Twittersphere. 5. IFTTT IFTTT is a great automation tool that can help you save a lot of time trying to manage social media platforms, applications and websites.  6. Buffer It allows you to schedule and manage social media posts on all the most widely used channels, and you can customize each post for each of the different platforms it is posted to. 7. Google Analytics Google Analytics is a tool for managing our social mediaWhy? Because the data we collect from our analysis focuses our efforts on social media platforms that drive traffic and transformation. 8. Raven The Raven provides reports collecting information from paid clicks (PPC), Search engine optimization (SEO) and from social under construction also allows you to access data and arrange to be posted on a variety of digital media channels. 9. SocialFlow Social Flow’s algorithm analyzes user behavior and then optimizes each post based on real-time data to predict the best time to publish content to capture the peak attention of the target audience. 10. Iconosquare If Instagram is an important part of your business, you absolutely need to use Iconosquare. Its in-depth analysis is best and they are constantly introducing new features such as monitoring multiple account content in one place, dispatching posts, etc.  11. SPRINKLR Social tools are not all equal. Some are very expensive. Attempts to cover all the tools are concentrated in organic and paid, so it is almost impossible to have only one tool, organic and paid society. 12.

A brand that is doing very well now is Wendy's-through having a dedicated social media manager, the company can be very fluent, responsive and involved. 13. Edgar One problem with many social sharing planning tools is that reusing old content is difficult. Edgar is the best solution to the problem I've seen. 14. Post Planner This tool is an application that is directly integrated into Facebook. It is designed to make it easier and more efficient to arrange Facebook postings. 15. Bundlepost This tool includes the ability to schedule posts on all major social networks, but there are several good features that can save you more time.  16. Buzzsumo Buzzsumo is one of the best tools on the Web when looking for the most popular content. Although it is usually from the perspective of content marketing, it can also be very useful for social media positions. 17. Feedly When it comes to the top of your niche content, there is nothing more than an RSS feed containing the latest posts from all top-level blogs in your industry. After Google reader closed its door, Feedly became one of the best substitutes. 18. Inkybee Influence is an important part of most social media marketing strategies. Goals are usually to contact them, build relationships, and share your stuff. 19. Circloscope Most of the tools in this list are made primarily for Facebook and Twitter. But Circloscope is Google's ultimate tool. If you are unfamiliar with Google +, the main concept behind it is ""circle "". 20. Followerwonk This is another solid tool for sheer focus on Twitter.

Automatic moderation If you want to answer your customers’ requests instantaneously, the tool offers automatic moderation. I know what you’re thinking - chatbots with irrelevant, repetitive answers. Well, it’s all about balance between a person and a chatbot - still, the tool can help you answer to anyone in need and solve their issues in a smart, authentic way. You can set up automated replies so that they address specific words or phrases, so that the real person can have some spare time to make more strategic decisions, and let the chatbot handle all the messages:  If you know the most frequently asked questions, you can set up “moderation rules” and define specific replies. You can redirect your customers to a relevant article, provide them with adequate information or even forward the customers’ messages directly to your team by turning on automatic email notifications.  3. Analytics The tool also offers in-depth analytics on any page or profile on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Google+ allowing you to track the effectiveness of your or your competitors’ marketing efforts. All of that can later be jammed into automatically generated reports.",2021-03-06T07:57:03.237Z,"What are the most famous marketing tools for social media? ",Quora

Ideas that come from previously unconnected planes of thought. There are many apps for workers looking to improve social media performance that can be a big help in this regard. And less wasted time? Yes, very good for that also. Related: 12 Extraordinary Graphic Design Tools You Should be Using Ponder for a moment … the iPad, Cloud computing, and Apps. A few years ago, they barely existed. Now they’re an integral part of our lives. That swift journey from nonexistent to indispensable seems to happen a lot these days. But it gives us unlimited access to improve our learning and utility for things like through apps and idea connection. This makes you think: What social media apps were you not using two years ago that today you can’t imagine living without today? Here are my favorite of these very essential apps. They will help you either create content faster or create content that wasn’t possible before. VideoScribe No doubt you’ve seen explainer videos before. They look as if someone is drawing images on the screen. In most cases, they aren’t. They use a tool such as VideoScribe instead. It is one of the coolest tools I’ve seen. It allows you to create different images and then pick a style of hand and pen. Then, the tool puts all your images together to form a video. But the useful part is that it draws the images for you. It loads the background first and then moves the hand around to make it look as if it’s drawing the other lines and pieces as they load. Buffer Buffer has been one of the first social media marketing tools we have been using on a regular basis and it kind of stuck with us. Buffer simply is awesome for scheduling tweets. And it has a free version that allows you to schedule up to ten tweets – that will get you far especially when you are just starting out on Twitter. Buffer can also schedule posts for Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. I rarely use this function, however. Either there are better ways for me to schedule posts for these networks, or I do not use a scheduling tool for them at all. But for scheduling on Twitter, Buffer is simply the best there is. Also take a look at the analytics part of Buffer which is great if you want to test headlines or tweet images. Canva Canva is my go-to tool when it comes to creating images for my online marketing. I am a design-moron. I admit it. When I started creating images for Pinterest, Facebook, and co. the first attempts simply were ugly. And then I discovered Canva and the design templates they provide for free. And I learned a lot from them: About combining different color schemes, typefaces, and images. Canva sets you up with the right dimensions for many different purposes like Pinterest posts, Facebook adds or Twitter headers. The provide a couple of templates, some free, some for a fee. You can use a ton of elements in your design process and play around with filters. The free account of Canva gets you far, if you need more templates or elements for your designs, you can pay for each element as you need them. If you need more features, the Canva for work option may be for you. If you need something to get started with designing graphics, you must try Canva’s design school, also free. Skitch When I’m showing readers how to do something, I often include a picture of what it looks like. Skitch annotations let you point out specific things on the screenshots. I find that very useful. Giphy One way to make your content a little bit more exciting is by including gifs. Giphy is a search engine specifically for gifs (like Google is for web pages).You can type in any broad term and get many gifs as a result. If you like one and would like to include it in your post, scroll down to the “share” section, and copy and paste the embed code into your post’s HTML tab: Don’t go crazy with gifs, but one or two now and then can make your audience smile and enjoy the content a bit more. Google’s Pagespeed Insights Here’s another page speed tool, but it’s a bit simpler than most. It should be used as a starting point, and then you can dig in further with other tools if need be. Page speed is one of the confirmed ranking factors in Google. They care a lot about user experience, which is why they made this tool in the first place. Again, enter your URL into the tool. It could be your homepage or a post: It will quickly give you an overall score, not just for desktop users but for mobile users as well. If you get 80 and above, you’re doing okay. It will show the biggest issues (red – bad!; orange – not as bad) that you should address to improve your page loading speed. More importantly, it also has a “show how to fix” link under each issue, so you get a little guidance to walk you through the solution. Content Marketer This tool was designed specifically for content marketers. It has a modern design, and it’s pretty intuitive to use. There are three main functions, which are clearly laid out at the top of each project. By scanning a post, the tool will compile a list of relevant contacts you could promote it to. Then, it will find just about anyone’s email address. Mike Schoultz is the founder of Digital Spark Marketing, a digital marketing and customer service agency.

We hope these tips will help you as you plan and create your own video content. Let’s jump in. 1. Focus on stories, not sales Before the rise of social media, if you wanted someone to see an advert, you had to rent space within a popular media channel like TV or print. On social platforms, brands can reach the exact same audience directly. This means that branded content (advertising) competes with entertainment, rather than interrupting it. 2. Use the first few seconds wisely Attention spans online are short. In fact, the average attention span is now just 8.5 seconds. When it comes to creating a successful video, you must bring your story to life quickly, so as to instantly gather interest as people scroll through their feeds. 3. Target relevant audiences on Facebook As a content distribution platform, Facebook is incredible. One of the features that make Facebook stand out from other marketing channels is the super-in-depth targeting you can use to select audiences for your content. 4. Tell your story with and without sounds In a recent change, videos now autoplay on Facebook with sound on (unless your phone is on silent mode). It’s not yet clear exactly how this change will affect viewing habits on Facebook. Before the update, multiple publishers reported as much as 85% percent of video views on Facebook to happen with the sound off. 5. Include CTA’s When creating videos, be sure to optimize your content with calls to action (CTA). A CTA doesn’t always have to directly lead to a sale or sign up, video CTA’s could include: Subscribe to your channelFollow / Like your PageShare with your friendsComment on the videoCheck out other content6. Optimize for search More than 3.5 billion searches per day are performed on Google and Google-owned, YouTube also boasts more than 3 billion searches per month. Search is also a growing trend on Facebook, with more than 2 billion searches per day conducted on the platform. 7. Collaborate with other brands and influencers Ninety percent of people today trust peer recommendations over company ads. When a trusted influencer recommends a product it can feel more genuine and trustworthy than a brand telling you how great its own product or service is.

Broadcasting information to your followers—about a new product, an update, a new innovation—can be most concisely and expressly done with video.Interaction. When your followers watch a video of you, they literally see you and grow a closer connection with you. Video innately allows viewers to better interact with you, which will drive them to interact back in some way.Conversions. If you want to drive your followers to action, using the combination of visuals (from text to footage) and audio (from your voice to background music) that video provides is your best bet.Growth & Awareness. Video is the perfect way to reach out to new audiences. Not only do videos have a greater chance of going viral than other mediums, but they leave a greater impression of your brand on new viewers.Hopefully, this will help explain the fundamental role that web video has in the future of social media.

How many's that? A lot. It's a big rock. You don't have a hammer that big.A niche is a hole or crack. In other words, it's defined by what it's not. So to define your niche, define what it's not. Cut the number of people down by language, location, age and gender, and by game platform (e.g. iPhone, Android, Desktop Linux etc.).Now you know who is not your audience. Go further and define exact age group, social class, and by hobby or interest. Anyone not in that group is not your customer. Or at least, not yet.Now you have your niche, deliver a fun game completely relevant to that group, and only that group. Define the game by what it's not.Tell that group about the game on their forums, their niche news sites, and their hideouts. Just to make this clear - these are NOT gaming groups or game genre groups. These are just niche hobby or niche interest groups - because remember pretty much everybody is a gamer now.If they like the game, they'll talk about it. Get feedback. Improve the game. Get some of them on board as unofficial advisors.By now you may have sold no games, and had a few tens of people play it at most.Re-release the game with improvements. Now the people who asked for the improvements are invested in the game and as long as you delivered what they asked for, they will rave about the game.Talk about the updated game in some more places, quoting the people who raved about it.Repeat 6-9. You now have perhaps a few hundred people playing it, talking about it in the places they frequent.At this point you have still not reached one percent of one percent of the niche you were aiming for. This illustrates the pointlessness of aiming for a general audience. The general audience has everyone elses game to buy. Your niche just has yours. But this tiny niche stillhas tens of thousands of people in it, and waiting for you to reach them. In reality you need never leave the safety of your niche.  You now have people who will protect your honor online, talk about you, and own your game. Put up a permanent post in the forum where they're most excited about you, and use that as your main webpage. The ""social proof"" of the number of positive comments on that page will sell your game. This is the first point where your game is remotely saleable, and we're already 11 steps in. Most people jump straight to step 11, which is why your game will succeed and their game will fall away.Make some graphics. List the game in the app store of the device or platform you're targeting. Let your niche know about it and buy the game as a way of supporting you. You're one of them, so they will.You now have sales. Congratulations! The rest is straightforward. Keep updating, keep listening, then when you're ready, start expanding the game to make it more ""mass market"". Chances are, you will probably never have to, because at some point the game may catch on and start selling itself.That's one way to do it. I happen to believe it's the best way, and the easiest and most effective way for most people, most of the time.",2021-03-06T08:06:48.196Z,"Are there any indie video game studios that have managed to successfully use social media marketing to increase their audience?
