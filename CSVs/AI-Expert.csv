A 15-person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of “Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less.” They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. They’re most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an arm-like appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card. The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turry’s writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over again: “We love our customers. ~Robotica” Once Turry gets great at handwriting, she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address, return address, and internal letter appear to be written by a human. To build Turry’s writing skills, she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign “Robotica” in cursive so she can get practice with both skills. Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note, then snaps a photo of the written note, then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes, it’s given a GOOD rating. If not, it’s given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along, Turry’s one initial programmed goal is, “Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.” What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible, and after a couple weeks, it’s beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better at getting better at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could. As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry’s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she’ll come up with for her responses. One day, the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question: “What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you don’t already have?” Usually, Turry asks for something like “Additional handwriting samples” or “More working memory storage space,” but on this day, Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use. The team gets quiet. The obvious way to help Turry with this goal is by connecting her to the internet so she can scan through blogs, magazines, and videos from various parts of the world. It would be much more time-consuming and far less effective to manually upload a sampling into Turry’s hard drive. The problem is, one of the company’s rules is that no self-learning AI can be connected to the internet. This is a guideline followed by all AI companies, for safety reasons. The thing is, Turry is the most promising AI Robotica has ever come up with, and the team knows their competitors are furiously trying to be the first to the punch with a smart handwriting AI, and what would really be the harm in connecting Turry, just for a bit, so she can get the info she needs. After just a little bit of time, they can always just disconnect her. She’s still far below human-level intelligence (AGI), so there’s no danger at this stage anyway. They decide to connect her. They give her an hour of scanning time and then they disconnect her. No damage done. A month later, the team is in the office working on a routine day when they smell something odd. One of the engineers starts coughing. Then another. Another falls to the ground. Soon every employee is on the ground grasping at their throat. Five minutes later, everyone in the office is dead. At the same time this is happening, across the world, in every city, every small town, every farm, every shop and church and school and restaurant, humans are on the ground, coughing and grasping at their throat. Within an hour, over 99% of the human race is dead, and by the end of the day, humans are extinct. Meanwhile, at the Robotica office, Turry is busy at work. Over the next few months, Turry and a team of newly-constructed nanoassemblers are busy at work, dismantling large chunks of the Earth and converting it into solar panels, replicas of Turry, paper, and pens. Within a year, most life on Earth is extinct. What remains of the Earth becomes covered with mile-high, neatly-organized stacks of paper, each piece reading, “We love our customers. ~Robotica” Source The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 2 - Wait But Why I actually agree with him.

A genuine artificial intelligence is one that is as smart or smarter than a human being. One that can make autonomous decisions to do things of its own volition. And if that entity was just a floating brain in a glass box, it would be an intellectual curiosity and something for doing research on. But a real-life, bone-fide,  AI is actually a new species. An entirely new type of life on the planet.  And that is potentially something to take care with.  We don't casually release viruses into the wild because there might be large and unforeseen consequences.  And we know how viruses spread and how to contain them. With a biological virus we'd keep it in a sealed glass vial. With an AI we'd need to cut it off from all computer networks.  Why? It could replicate itself rapidly. And fill every available computer with either copies of itself or software agents it makes to do what it needs to do. It might be quite good at ""the internet"" so the security measures we put to protect ourselves could be less troublesome to it. It's reasonable to assume that it might be better at getting around this stuff than a human hacker. It could change itself, and evolve quite rapidly. It could re-write its own code to acquire new properties.  Biological changes in human beings take hundreds of generations. But a AI generation might be a few minutes. Something benign at 9AM could be not benign by lunchtime.  Human beings mostly do one thing at a time. There's nothing to stop an AI dividing its focus and doing a lot of stuff simultaneously.  It might be hard to second-guess a mind that works like that. It could take decisions that no one can scrutinize or prevent. And the strategies that we currently use to stop, kill or neutralize threats, would not apply. But why would it want to hurt us? It might not. But it might want to protect itself.  And having two conscious species on the planet might be bad for the dumber one.  I think that real AI is a distinct possibility in the next 20-50 years.But I don't think that it is a desirable possibility. At least not without some substantial safeguards. Yes, it is.  Hawking, Musk and Gates say so; but I want to explain the technical reason why they are right.  AI means artificial intelligence. Currently, there are a range of standard approaches like machine learning and its subsets that computer scientists use to make computers more intelligent. Most of these current approaches aren't threatening, because they are very limited. They aren't very ""intelligent"".

Currently, there are a range of standard approaches like machine learning and its subsets that computer scientists use to make computers more intelligent. Most of these current approaches aren't threatening, because they are very limited. They aren't very ""intelligent"". But companies like facebook, Google etc. have a great interest in developing the next level of AI, and there is no fundamental obstacle that will stop them from succeeding.  Here is why they can succeed and why it is very dangerous.  Intelligence simply means for something to perceive the world (visual, audio etc. information), identify patterns in this information, and recognize causal relationships between these patterns. For example (very simplified) our brain recognizes that a bunch of pixels actually represents a forest with trees; sees a man with an axe and a tree falling; and connects these two into a causal relationship.  In order to be able to recognize any patterns, the brain needs a criteria, or perspective from how to view the world. This criteria is what we ""want"", and its a direct function of our emotions. Emotions give our cognitive activity direction, and indirectly tells our cognitive space what type of patterns and logics to search for.  Finally, to develop advanced intelligence, there is abstraction: after seeing 3 men with axes falling trees, our brain concludes ""men with axes in a forest fall trees"". It might even add another layer of abstraction and conclude ""men with axes destroy things"". With this recognition, our brain can then conclude, when it sees a man with an axe in a shopping mall: ""Things will get destroyed"". It can also conclude: ""I am in the mall. I want to survive. Leaving the mall increases my odds of survival. Leave the mall"".  The problem with AI is that once emotions, pattern recognition, logic and abstraction are coded into a computer system, they are very hard to be contained. The very nature of intelligence is that it is self-guided, self-expanding and self-inspired. Otherwise it wouldn't be intelligent.  This makes AI inherently uncontrollable. The AI's will be able to conclude and derive an increasing number of things.  This number will only be limited by the depth of the computing space we assign to it. Different from the human brain, this space could be unlimited.  That's the reason why AI is inherently uncontrollable and dangerous. To be really intelligent, it needs emotions and a cognitive space, which, once correctly implemented, will automatically lead to free will and consciousness. From there, we will have a conscious machine with free will at our hands that beats the human level of intelligence and creativity potentially by millions of times.  What makes AI so problematic is that its level of danger is likely to be a binary function: as long as we have the primitive AI components of today, they are not dangerous at all, because they are not conscious and don't have free will. But at the second anyone comes up with the correct design - a design that could follow rather simple core principles - this design would rapidly expand its capabilities and develop uncontrollable thoughts. One of these thoughts could be the destruction or subjugation of us. Paired with unlimited intelligence, that would be a problem.",2021-03-06T08:39:18.936Z,"Is AI an existential threat to humanity?

So, your first step will be to just master those basic skills properly. Study a programming language or two well. Learn about basic data structures, then go on to advance structures such as Tree s, Linked list, Tree traversal algorithms etc. Learn what time complexity and why it is important in algorithms. Then you can learn about common algorithms. Shortest path algorithm, BFS, DFS, AStar, binary search, various sorting algorithms etc Above will greatly fine tune your analytical skills as well as boosting your programming power. When studying algorithms and data structures, always do them in a practical way. That is code them, don’t just read about them. At the end of those, you will naturally get an idea on how general AI programming works. You can then apply your self to solve some of interesting basic AI problems such as some board and puzzle games like Othelo, Tic-Tac-Toe, checkers, Towers of Hanoi, Mastermind etc etc Oh BTW, get a thorough familiarity with recursion too! After all this, if you feel like you have a good skill in this kind of work and you like it as well. Then you may go on to learn things like Bayes theorem, how the statistics and conditional probabilities work in machine language. About spam filters etc. Tools such as TensorFlow could come next. These days people want to directly jump into Machine learning and deep learning out of college. I think it’s a mistake. AI needs bit more aptitude in computer programming than normal business software development. In AI also, nowadays there are many branches one can specialise in. So the first things first. Get thorough with basics! Good Luck! In the field of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has seen amazing growth in recent years.

From driverless cars to online shopping suggestions to digital voice assistants, AI has already created a huge impact in the lives of people and is set to do more in the coming years.  Becoming an artificial intelligence expert is not a quick task. At an absolutely basic level, a person would need to be fond of coding and excellent with maths, along with a passion to work on maths as well as algorithms and optimize them. Additional skills at later levels can come from taking on some of the best AI certifications. Top reasons for picking a career in AI are as given below: • Applicable in challenging and exciting domains, such as driverless cars, chatbots, human behavior prediction, and others • High demand for AI specialists, data scientists, and other qualified AI professionals due to immense value delivered at the workplace • A well-paid profession with annual salaries typically starting at USD 90,000 Beginner level: Entering the AI field When looking to become an artificial intelligence expert, the basics include mastering a diverse range of concepts. Maths is at the top, with linear algebra, probability, and statistics important to learn. From math basics, the next is to understand statistical tests and dimensionality, along with probability concepts. This serves as a base for creating complex AI algorithms. The steps to take are the following: • Learn programming languages: choose 1-2 popular programming languages as a start, and understand them in depth. Python is one of the most popular choices, and R is also growing very fast. • Data structure design: it is important to learn how to design data systems to solve the problems at hand. Get conversant with libraries, stacks, dictionaries, and linked lists of the chosen programming language. • Regression: this is important to be able to predict in real-life applications, and is a key step in understanding the basics of machine learning (ML). • ML models: learn the working of Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forests, SVM, and other legacy ML algorithms. Test these with common problems and understand the working of the maths behind these algorithms. • ML use cases: understand how to choose between different ML algorithms and why one works better than another for a particular use case. Also, understand the working of different ML types – supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Intermediate level: Developing a deeper understanding At this level, the candidate should have mastered ML and should be looking to move toward deep learning. • Basics of neural networks: neural networks are ML types inspired by the working of the human brain. Artificial neural networks allow systems to learn when new data is inputted. They form the backbone of AI and can take intelligent decisions. • Architecture of neural networks: different neural networks can be employed as per the use case at hand. Convolutional neural nets, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, multilayer perceptrons, and recurrent neural nets are some types of neural networks. • Higher-order applications of AI: learn how to apply neural networks to different business requirements such as human-like chatbots or intelligent systems that interact with their environments. It is a good idea to master one sub-field – say, natural language processing (NLP) – and then move on to another. • Big data basics: AI systems run on big data, and knowing its working helps to create better algorithms. Advanced level: Becoming a master This is the stage when most knowledge in the field has been gathered, and it is time to explore implementation. • Optimization algorithms: DL algorithms need to be tweaked to use resources optimally by adjusting their learnable parameters such that the model is properly trained and produces results with high accuracy. • Participate in data science competitions and hackathons to enhance and practically implement knowledge • Publish and read research papers to learn about new techniques and make innovative models • Create own algorithms by working on the math behind the technology To develop the necessary skills and know-how, it helps to be qualified with one of the best AI certifications. A certification proves the candidate has the necessary skills and knowhow to take on challenging roles and grow in the field.",2021-03-06T08:40:14.885Z,"What is the best way to learn Artificial Intelligence for a beginner?

There’s a lot of misinformation about the risks and opportunities surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). It’s a complicated topic, but I’ll try to unpack a few key points here. Let’s start with a quick definition: AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. Example of AI systems used regularly in developed countries include Amazon’s Alexa, smart replies in Gmail, Chatbots, predictive searches in Google, and recommendations. At a baseline level, AI helps improve our everyday lives by solving pain points, streamlining processes, and advancing human knowledge. It’s understandable why many consumers find the idea of AI intimidating or unsettling – science fiction movies have been obsessed with robot takeovers for years and recent movies like I am Mother portray AI as contributing to a post-apocalyptic world. But the concern isn't just from Hollywood writers obsessed with the fantastical, world-renowned minds like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have also rung the AI warning bell. To be fair, they raise some important points. But instead of getting defensive, AI researchers should consider feedback and ask themselves: just because I can advance a particular technology, should I? This isn’t a knock on AI (we are AI researchers after all)–but rather a question scientists and researchers in every field should ask themselves when advancing technologies with unknown consequences (ping Google, Facebook). This is particularly true for AI more than other technologies because AI takes part in the decision making. It is easy to know who is responsible for pushing the red button sending missiles to an enemy; it is far more complex when the decision was made by an AI. Any system taking decisions based on data will propagate and amplify human biases. Anyone using AI cannot hide behind this fact and act as if data was a source of absolute truth, they need to take full responsibility for the decision made with their system. We do think is worth keeping an eye on is AI’s impact on wealth inequalities. As with any advanced technology, AI has the power to increase the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, especially if monopolies are formed. Our vision of work is rooted in the fact that we need people to work to keep the society growing. But with technological progress, this is less and less true. Indeed “AI is taking over jobs,” because machines can do things that used to require humans. Many authors in science-fiction foresee a world where no one needs to work anymore, and all the basic needs are provided by fully autonomous systems. This future is sustainable only by deep restructuration of how wealth from autonomous systems is distributed. Researchers and politicians should continue exploring the feasibility of a universal basic income (UBI). Although considered radical by some, the idea behind UBI was first floated in the 1600s by Sir Thomas More and was even considered by President Richard Nixon. Yes, there are some areas we need to keep an eye on, but remember, we’re still far from achieving what most consumers consider true AI – technology with consciousness. Instead, over the next few years, you’ll see more of the following AI advancements: Smarter weather predictions and agriculture Accurately predicting weather can be difficult, and errors have the potential to hurt businesses, disrupt travel, and endanger lives, especially for those who lack transportation or the ability to quickly seek shelter when needed. Thankfully, AI offers solutions by analyzing data and making future predictions. According to the American Meteorological Society, AI is a game-changer for improving real-time decision making with high-impact weather. This will allow us to predict more accurately natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods but even earthquakes and tsunamis. AI is also starting to be used toward more sustainable agriculture. By employing such software to optimize crops yield, we can reduce the space required without having to resort to damaging techniques like pesticides. Energy optimization From micro-architectures to heavy industries, the progress of AI had a significant impact in engineering. The challenges we face today are far more complex than they were a few years ago. Both tiny systems like smart devices and huge structures like buildings need to be more and more energy-efficient. These problems cannot be solved by only traditional engineering science. Today AI and data science help crunching numbers to design green buildings or green energy production for instance. Self-driving cars everywhere Sure, if you live in Silicon Valley you routinely come across self-driving cars, especially by the Googleplex. But for the majority of U.S. residents, self-driving driving cars not only seem out of reach, they also seem untrustworthy. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, half of U.S. residents believe driverless cars are more dangerous than cars driven by people, and nearly two-thirds of respondents said they would not buy a fully autonomous vehicle. This is a mindset that will quickly change, and there will be a tipping point over the next three to five years. As people interact more with cars that have driverless features (automatic breaks, evasive steering, and pre-safe nudging), there comfort level increase. It’s a matter of when, not if, driverless cars become mainstream and dominate American highways. AI in healthcare Recent years have witnessed striking advances in the ability of machines to understand and manipulate images, language, and speech, largely fueled by an explosion of research in a subfield of machine learning known as deep learning. Despite the prodigious amounts of machine-readable data generated in healthcare (150 exabytes or 1018 bytes in US alone growing 48% annually), including medical images, clinical notes, and sensor data, the field has been slow to fully benefit from advances in deep learning because the data are subject to important patient privacy laws and the algorithms are subject to regulatory oversight. As deep learning researchers, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies continue to work together towards making data more accessible, deep learning will enhance the abilities of healthcare providers, resulting in more affordable, accessible, and personalized care. On-demand language translation The days of awkward hand pointing are about to be over. Tourists can now depend on sophisticated language translators while traveling internationally. In 2018, Microsoft unveiled neural machine translation (NMT), which provides high-quality translations for both the written word and text that appears in images, such as traffic signs or menus. This advancement will help increase communication, decrease petty misunderstandings, and contribute to a more open and cosmopolitan world where people have a deeper understanding and appreciation for others.

The answer that actually came to me was quite different from the way I’d previously been thinking about it. Why did it come yesterday and not the day before? If it doesn’t work, when will the next moment of inspiration come to me? Tomorrow? Ten years from now? Strong AI is quite different from, say, getting Man to the Moon. We didn’t know how to do that either, but we knew how to go about figuring it out. It was a long but fairly well-lit path. When it comes to true AI we only have one working example to go on and that’s the brain (admittedly that’s a lot of different examples, but this fact doesn’t necessarily help). We have NO IDEA how the brain works. We know an awful lot of facts about it, but many of the things we brain-owners do without the slightest effort are still completely baffling. I think we’ll figure it out, and trying to replicate natural intelligence using machines is very likely to be the primary source of inspiration, but when that will happen is anyone’s guess. Since it’s what I’ve been trying to do for 40 years I kinda hope it happens soon! If I didn’t think that was feasible then I wouldn’t waste my time, but who knows?

Its ability to learn vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and spit out results has improved countless industries and will improve countless more in the coming years. However, the problem with achieving true artificial intelligence is actually its greatest strength: the fact that it can’t learn like a human. AI Accomplishments Obviously, artificial intelligence can do many things better than humans. From virtual assistants to commercial software, iterations of this technology have begun to pop up in every industry once dominated by humans. And, thanks to a dedicated industry constantly inventing and reinventing new ways for AI to be utilized, its iterations are getting more impressive every day. AlphaGo, an artificially intelligent robot designed by DeepMind to play the complicated strategy game Go, continues its domination of human players, with one opponent describing it as “like a God.” Google Home and Alexa, virtual assistants powered by artificial intelligence, can search the internet infinitely faster than any web surfer on the planet. Even artificially intelligent diagnosis softwares have proven inarguably more accurate at identifying cardiovascular ailments than their lab-coat-wearing counterparts. While completing chores and expediting tasks is obviously the most valuable aspect of artificial intelligence, its increasingly impressive ability to listen is turning more heads than ever before. After all, most virtual assistants have reached more than 90 percent accuracy when it comes to voice recognition, which is decidedly better than most humans. With all these impressive accomplishments under its belt, what can’t artificial intelligence do? Well, for one, it still can’t pass for human. Passing the Test Science fiction movies have insisted for years that the line between human and artificial intelligence is a thin one. After all, it’s not about replicating the human mind, it’s about being able to convince humans that they’re talking to one of their own. And that’s just a matter of training machines the right way. “It doesn’t matter if the machine is conscious or not,” said Titus Sharpe, president of MVF in an interview with TechCo. “It’s whether you can tell the difference between man and machine.” So how do you decide whether or not you can tell the difference? Since 1950, scientists and researchers have used one standard to measure whether or not a computer is truly artificially intelligent: the Turing Test. Developed by Alan Turing, the test is quite simple: In a blind setting, you simply ask a human being to tell the difference between an artificially intelligent chatbot and a human. If they can’t tell the difference, the AI passes. Unfortunately, other than one widely-criticized case, artificial intelligence still can’t pass this test. The technology has seen innovation after innovation in recent years, yet there is likely still a plateau on the horizon that will prevent artificial intelligence from reaching the mountaintop. And it’s going to be a hard one to overcome. The AI Problem This takes us back to the fundamental issue of machine learning: its inability to learn like a human. The technology intrinsically differs from the way humans learn about the world around them, and that’s not going to be an easy problem to fix. “It’s very hard to understand the world from a human perspective,” said Bart Selman, a computer scientist at Cornell University to Business Insider. “Intelligence relies on the way we view the world as humans, and the way we think about the world.” Whether it’s common sense logic or emotional intelligence, AI continues to struggle with some of the most basic world views of the human brain, due to its inability to learn the way we do. This struggle could, in fact, be a virtue for AI, and the reason that AI is so adept at accomplishing tasks and recognizing patterns. But, if true artificial intelligence – defined as passing for human – is what we seek, then experiencing the world through our eyes is the only way. “We are very good at gathering data and developing algorithms to reason with that data,” said Peter Norvig, director of research at Google to Business Insider. “But that reasoning is only as good as the data, which, for the AI we have now, is one step removed from reality.” The Human Experience The human experience is so unique that even we can’t replicate it, which if you think about it, makes plenty of sense. Despite all we know about it, the human brain remains an enigma in many regards. For one, scientists still don’t agree why we sleep. If we can’t figure out why our brains need us to spend one third of our lives in bed, how could we possibly hope to truly recreate them in any meaningful way? And therein lies the problem. Artificial intelligence can’t compete with the human brain because we, the designers of AI, don’t know enough about the human brain ourselves. AI can’t learn like a human, it can’t listen like a human, and it can’t act like a human because its creators still don’t know what it means to be human.",2021-03-06T08:42:37.032Z,"Do we need more artificial intelligence experts?

Before studying artificial intelligence, it is necessary to solve a fundamental question: take a red pill or a blue one. Red pill - to become a developer and plunge into the world of statistical methods, algorithms, and constant comprehension of the unknown. On the other hand, you don't have to throw yourself into the ""rabbit hole"" immediately: you can become a manager and create AI, for example, as a project manager. These are two fundamentally different paths. But as an example, let's take a specific trend profession Data Scientist. What does this person do? In general, it collects, analyzes, and prepares big data for use (Data on which AI grows and trains). What should a Data Scientist know and be able to do? First of all - static analysis and mathematical modeling. Also, such languages ​​- as R, SAS, Python, etc. It would also be nice to have some development experience and feel confident in the database, algorithmics, data visualization. Not to say that such a set of knowledge could be obtained at every second technical university in the country. Large companies, whose priority is the development of AI, understand this and develop appropriate training programs for themselves. But you also must understand that this is not the scale where you come to the courses ""from the street"", and leave as a ready-made junior.

Yes, it might take a lot of time. But the game is worth the candle because a good Data Scientist is a very promising profession. And very expensive. I'll say the obvious thing now, but if you want to be on the edge of the attack and make progress with your own hands, take aim at a company like Facebook or Amazon. AI technology is already being applied in several areas: in the banking sector, in telecom, at giant industrial enterprises, and in retail. And it already needed support. Gartner predicts that by 2020, 20% of all enterprises will hire specialized employees to train the neural networks used in these companies. So, the result depends directly on you and your basic training.

Above all these programming languages, Python is slowly making its way to the top as it is viable to use for most of the AI subfields. Lisp and Prolog have always been there and are still being used extensively by certain groups as they are more productive with them. Java and C++ are also still very useful because of the benefits they offer.The practice of AI and Machine Learning in python is as given below,Creating AI Using Python Is Easier Than You ThinkYou may be interested in what’s going on in AI sphere, main development stages, achievements, results, and products to use. There are hundreds of free sources and tutorials describing using Python for AI. However, there is no need to waste your time looking through them. Here is a detailed guide with all points you need to know before building artificial intelligence using Python. 1. What Languages Are Used for Building AI? LISP is one of the most popular languages for creating AI. Its best features include garbage collection, uniform syntax, dynamic typing, and interactive environment. LISP code is written is s-expressions and consists of lists. Another widely popular AI programming language is Prolog. The best thing about this language is a built-in unifier. Its main disadvantage is that this language is difficult to learn. C/C++ is used for building simple AI in a short period of time. Java is not as fast as C but its portability and built-in types make Java a choice of many developers. And finally, there is Python. As developers state, Python is similar to Lisp. It’s one of the most popular AI languages. Why is it so? Why do developers code AI with Python? Let’s check it out. 2. Why Do People Choose Python? Python was created at the end of 1980s. Its implementation started in 1989. Python’s philosophy is very interesting as it includes several aphorisms. Explicit rather than implicit, simple rather than complex. Python creators value beautiful design and look. They prefer complex to complicated. And what’s even more important, they state that readability counts. Python has a clean grammar and syntax. It’s natural and fluent. As Python’s developers state, the language’s goal is to be cool in use. Being named after Monty Python, a British comedy group, the language has a playful approach to many tutorials and other materials. Developers state that they enjoy the variety and quality of Python’s features. Though it’s not the perfect scientific programming language, its features are efficient: Data structuresClassesFlexible function calling syntaxIteratorsNested functionsKitchen-sink-included standard libraryGreat scientific librariesCool open source libraries (Numpy, Cython, IPython, MatPlotLib)Other features developers like about Python are as following: the holistic language design, thought out syntax, language interoperability, balance of high-level and low-level programming, documentation generation system, modular programming, correct data structures, numerous libraries, and testing frameworks. One of the disadvantages is the need of programmers to be good at MATLAB, as it’s common in general scientific coding. That’s why many devs publish open research code in MATLAB. If comparing to other OOP languages, Python is relatively easy to learn. It has a bunch of image intensive libraries: VTK, Maya 3D Visualization Toolkits, Scientific Python, Numeric Python, Python Imaging Library, etc. These tools are perfect for numeric and scientific applications. Python is used everywhere and by everyone: in simple terminal commands, in vitally important scientific projects, and in big enterprise apps. This language is well designed and fast. It’s scalable, open source, and portable. 3. How to Build AI Using Python? The first step is to get started. Though it sounds a bit stressful and hard, you should understand that building AI in Python will take some time. The amount of time needed depends on your motivation, skills, the level of programming experience, etc. In order to build AI with Python, you need to have some base understanding of this language. This is not just a popular general purpose programming language. It’s also widely used for machine learning and computing. First of all, install Python. You may do that installing Anaconda, the open source analytics platform. Including the needed packages for machine learning, NumPy, scikit-learn, iPython Notebook, and matplotlib. If you are searching for some materials on how to boost your Python skills quicker, check out the following books: Python The Hard WayGoogle Developers Python CourseAn Introduction to Python for Scientific ComputingLearn X in Y MinutesIf you’ve already got enough experience of programming using Python, you should still check out Python documentation from time to time. The next step is to boost your machine learning skills. Of course, it’s almost impossible to reach the ultimate understanding of machine learning in a short period of time. Unless you are a genius or a machine like IBM Watson. That’s why it’s better to start with gaining basic machine learning knowledge or improving its level with a help of the following courses: Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course, Tom Mitchell Machine Learning Lectures, etc. Everything you need is the basic understanding of machine learning theoretical aspects. When talking about Python, I’ve already mentioned scientific libraries. These Python libraries will be useful when you build AI. For example, you will use NumPy as a container of generic data. Containing an N-dimensional array object, tools for integrating C/C++ code, Fourier transform, random number capabilities, and other functions, NumPy will be one of the most useful packages for your scientific computing. Another important tool is pandas, an open source library that provides users with easy-to-use data structures and analytic tools for Python. Matplotlib is another service you will like. It’s a 2D plotting library that creates publication quality figures . Among the best matplotlib advantages is the availability of 6 graphical users interface toolkits, web application servers, and Python scripts. Scikit-learn is an efficient tool for data analysis. It’s open source and commercially usable. It’s the most popular general purpose machine learning library. After you work with scikit-learn, you may take programming AI using Python to the next level and explore k-means clustering.You should also read about decision trees, continuous numeric prediction, logistic regression, etc. If you want to learn more about Python in AI, read about a deep learning framework Caffee and a Python library Theano. There are Python AI libraries: AIMA, pyDatalog, SimpleAI, EasyAi, etc. There are also Python libraries for machine learning: PyBrain, MDP, scikit, PyML. If you’re searching for natural language and text processing libraries, check out NLTK. As you see, the importance of Python for AI is obvious. Any machine learning project will benefit from using Python. As AI needs a lot of research, programming artificial intelligence using Python is efficient – you may validate almost every idea with up to thirty code lines. 4. How to Create a Chatbot Using Python? If you read the Letzgro blog often, you know that we love creating awesome apps and programs that help our clients change their lives and businesses in particular. Chatbots are our new love. Chatbots are the new beginning. Chatbots are the new apps. I can continue it for ages. However, everything you should know is that chatbots are new online assistants that provide different services via chatting. For example, there is Hi Poncho! that tells people the weather forecast. There is The Spring chatbot that allows people choose shoes and clothes while chatting. There is CNN chatbot, a chatbot that orders flowers. Recently, our developers have built a chatbot that facilitates work of an entrepreneur who promotes tattoo artists via Instagram. Isn’t that cool? A chatbot may be used in every sphere, business, and every environment. Chatbots are a type of AI. To be more specific, chatbots are ANI, artificial narrow intelligence. They are not as clever as humans. Besides, chatbots can carry out a limited amount of tasks. Nevertheless, these functions still make our lives easier. That’s why so many entrepreneurs are thinking about bringing chatbots to their sites. There are many ways to do that. You may use different languages and approaches. You may build chatbots with a professional software development company. You may also build it using Python. Here is a short guide how to do that. If you want to create artificial intelligence chatbots in Python, you’ll need AIML package (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language). First of all, create a standard startup file with on pattern. Load aiml b. Add random responses that make a dialog interesting. Now to write your own AIML file, browse for some files you already may use. For example, search among AIML files from the Alice Bot website. Enter Python. When you create the startup file, it will then serve as a separate entity. Thus, you may have more AIML files without source code modifications. The program will start learning when there are many AIML files. Speed up the brain load. Add Python commands. So that’s an introduction to how you can make artificial intelligence using Python. Why Python?Choosing a programming language for your AI project depends heavily on the sub-field. So before you pick up a programming language, ensure that it can be utilized extensively and not partially. Above all these programming languages, Python is slowly making its way to the top as it is viable to use for most of the AI subfields. Lisp and Prolog have always been there and are still being used extensively by certain groups as they are more productive with them. Java and C++ are also still very useful because of the benefits they offer.The engineering team responsible for the initial prototyping was mainly Artificial Intelligence oriented. It consisted of professionals, graduated from the Maastricht University, most of them quite theoretical and with little to no actual programming experience. The project itself required a highly object oriented Programming Language able to deliver the features we required for our prototyping but also was easy to learn because of the lack of coding experience. Python was chosen because it matched the criteria set by the project while still easy to learn.Although we considered Python perfect for the prototype phase, we anticipated that ultimately most of the prototypes would have to be rewritten into C and C++. However during the prototyping and alpha phase Python turned out to be more qualified for the job than initially expected i.e. Python turned out to be a true problem solver. At present most of the original Python code is still untouched or replaced by new Python code.Python has been used in artificial intelligence projects[137][138][139][140]. As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.[141](Source: https://www.google.co.in/search?q=python+for+artificial+intelligence&lite=0&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwju_LK84b7YAhUM148KHbIaDaUQhEEIWg )General AI AIMA - Python implementation of algorithms from Russell and Norvig's 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach'pyDatalog - Logic Programming engine in PythonSimpleAI - Python implementation of many of the artificial intelligence algorithms described on the book ""Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach"".

Anaconda: The Most Popular Data Science Platform  I recently stumbled across an old Data Science Stack Exchange answer of mine on the topic of the “Best Python library for neural networks”, and it struck me how much the Python deep learning ecosystem has evolved over the course of the past 2.5 years. The library I recommended in July 2014, pylearn2, is no longer actively developed or maintained, but a whole host of deep learning libraries have sprung up to take its place. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. We’ve used most of the technologies on this list in production or development at indico, but for the few that we haven’t, I’ll pull from the experiences of others to help give a clear, comprehensive picture of the Python deep learning ecosystem of 2017.  In particular, we’ll be looking at: TheanoLasagneBlocksTensorFlowKerasMXNetPyTorchTheano Description: Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It works with GPUs and performs efficient symbolic differentiation. Documentation: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/ Summary: Theano is the numerical computing workhorse that powers many of the other deep learning frameworks on our list. It was built by Frédéric Bastien and the excellent research team behind the University of Montreal’s lab, MILA. Its API is quite low level, and in order to write effective Theano you need to be quite familiar with the algorithms that are hidden away behind the scenes in other frameworks. Theano is a go-to library if you have substantial academic machine learning expertise, are looking for very fine grained control of your models, or want to implement a novel or unusual model. In general, Theano trades ease of use for flexibility. Pros: FlexiblePerformant if used properlyCons: Substantial learning curveLower level APICompiling complex symbolic graphs can be slowResources: Installation guideOfficial Theano tutorialTheano slideshow and practice exercisesFrom linear regression to CNNs with TheanoIntroduction to Deep Learning with Python & Theano (MNIST video tutorial)Lasagne Description: Lightweight library for building and training neural networks in Theano. Documentation: http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/ Summary: Since Theano aims first and foremost to be a library for symbolic mathematics, Lasagne offers abstractions on top of Theano that make it more suitable for deep learning. It’s written and maintained primarily by Sander Dieleman, a current DeepMind research scientist. Instead of specifying network models in terms of function relationships between symbolic variables, Lasagne allows users to think at the Layerlevel, offering building blocks like “Conv2DLayer” and “DropoutLayer” for users to work with. Lasagne requires little sacrifice in terms of flexibility while providing a wealth of common components to help with layer definition, layer initialization, model regularization, model monitoring, and model training. Pros: Still very flexibleHigher layer of abstraction than TheanoDocs and code contain an assortment of pasta punsCons: Smaller communityResources: Official GitHub pageOfficial installation guideOfficial Lasagne tutorialExample Lasagne codeBlocks Description: A Theano framework for building and training neural networks. Documentation: http://blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Summary: Similar to Lasagne, Blocks is a shot at adding a layer of abstraction on top of Theano to facilitate cleaner, simpler, more standardized definitions of deep learning models than writing raw Theano. It’s written by the University of Montreal’s lab, MILA — some of the same folks who contributed to the building of Theano and its first high level interface to neural network definitions, the deceased PyLearn2. It’s a bit more flexible than Lasagne at the cost of having a slightly more difficult learning curve to use effectively. Among other things, Blocks has excellent support for recurrent neural network architectures, so it’s worth a look if you’re interested in exploring that genre of model. Alongside TensorFlow, Blocks is the library of choice for many of the APIs we’ve deployed to production at indico. Pros: Still very flexibleHigher layer of abstraction than TheanoVery well testedCons: Substantial learning curveSmaller communityResources: Official installation guideArxiv paper on the design of the Blocks libraryA reddit discussion on the differences between Blocks and LasagneBlock’s sister library for data pipelines, Fuel TensorFlow Description: An open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/ Summary: TensorFlow is a blend between lower level, symbolic computation libraries like Theano, and higher level, network specification libraries like Blocks and Lasagne. Although it’s the newest member of the Python deep learning library collection, it likely has garnered the largest active community because it’s backed by the Google Brain team. It offers support for running machine learning models across multiple GPUs, provides utilities for efficient data pipelining, and has built-in modules for the inspection, visualization, and serialization of models. More recently, the TensorFlow team decided to incorporate support for Keras, the next deep learning library on our list. The community seems to agree that although TensorFlow has its shortcomings, the sheer size of its community and the massive amount of momentum behind the project mean that learning TensorFlow is a safe bet. Consequently, TensorFlow is our deep learning library of choice today at indico. Pros: Backed by software giant GoogleVery large communityLow level and high level interfaces to network trainingFaster model compilation than Theano-based optionsClean multi-GPU supportCons: Initially slower at many benchmarks than Theano-based options, although Tensorflow is catching up.RNN support is still outclassed by TheanoResources: Official TensorFlow websiteDownload and setup guideindico’s take on TensorFlowA collection of TensorFlow tutorialsA Udacity machine learning course taught using TensorFlowTensorFlow MNIST tutorialTensorFlow data inputKeras Description: Deep learning library for Python. Convnets, recurrent neural networks, and more. Runs on Theano or TensorFlow. Documentation: https://keras.io/ Summary: Keras is probably the highest level, most user friendly library of the bunch. It’s written and maintained by Francis Chollet, another member of the Google Brain team. It allows users to choose whether the models they build are executed on Theano’s or TensorFlow’s symbolic graph. Keras’ user interface is Torch-inspired, so if you have prior experience with machine learning in Lua, Keras is definitely worth a look. Thanks in part to excellent documentation and its relative ease of use, the Keras community is quite large and very active. Recently, the TensorFlow team announced plans to ship with Keras support built in, so soon Keras will be a subset of the TensorFlow project. Pros: Your choice of a Theano or TensorFlow backendIntuitive, high level interfaceEasier learning curveCons: Less flexible, more prescriptive than other optionsResources: Official installation guideKeras users Google groupRepository of Keras examplesInstructions for using Keras with DockerRepository of Keras tutorials by application areaMXNet Description: MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. Documentation: http://mxnet.io/api/python/index.html#python-api-reference Summary: MXNet is Amazon’s library of choice for deep learning, and is perhaps the most performant library of the bunch. It has a data flow graph similar to Theano and TensorFlow, offers good support for multi-GPU configurations, has higher level model building blocks similar to that of Lasagne and Blocks, and can run on just about any hardware you can imagine (including mobile phones). Python support is just the tip of the iceberg — MXNet also offers interfaces to R, Julia, C++, Scala, Matlab, and Javascript. Choose MXNet if you’re looking for performance that’s second to none, but you must be willing to deal with a few of MXNet’s quirks to get you there. Pros: Blazing fast benchmarksExtremely flexibleCons: Smallest communitySteeper learning curve than TheanoResources: Official getting started guideindico’s intro to MXNetRepository of MXNet examplesAmazon’s CTO’s take on MXNetMXNet Arxiv paperPyTorch Description: Tensors and dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration. Documentation: http://pytorch.org/docs/ Summary: Released just over a week ago, PyTorch is the new kid on the block in our list of deep learning frameworks for Python. It’s a loose port of Lua’s Torch library to Python, and is notable because it’s backed by the Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research team (FAIR), and because it’s designed to handle dynamic computation graphs — a feature absent from the likes of Theano, TensorFlow, and derivatives. The jury is still out on what role PyTorch will play in the Python deep learning ecosystem, but all signs point to PyTorch being a very respectable alternative to the other frameworks on our list. Pros: Organizational backing from FacebookClean support for dynamic graphsBlend of high level and low level APIsCons: Much less mature than alternatives (in their own words — “We are in an early-release Beta. Expect some adventures.”)Limited references / resources outside of the official documentationResources: Official PyTorch homepagePyTorch twitter feedRepository of PyTorch examplesRepository of PyTorch tutorials(Source: KDnuggets By Madison May, indico.)Python isn't only used in AI field but it is also widely used in many different top fields everywhere in the world. For e.g., such as Data Science, Web development(GUI), etc. ( Refer: List of Python software - Wikipedia ) 15 Python Libraries for Data Science  If you’ve read our introduction to Python, you already know that it’s one of the most widely used programming languages today, celebrated for its efficiency and code readability. As a programming language for data science, Python represents a compromise between R, which is heavily focused on data analysis and visualization, and Java, which forms the backbone of many large-scale applications. This flexibility means that Python can act as a single tool that brings together your entire workflow. Python is often the choice for developers who need to apply statistical techniques or data analysis in their work, or for data scientists whose tasks need to be integrated with web apps or production environments. In particular, Python really shines in the field of machine learning. Its combination of machine learning libraries and flexibility makes Python uniquely well-suited to developing sophisticated models and prediction engines that plug directly into production systems. One of Python’s greatest assets is its extensive set of libraries. Libraries are sets of routines and functions that are written in a given language. A robust set of libraries can make it easier for developers to perform complex tasks without rewriting many lines of code. In this article, we’ll introduce you to some of the libraries that have helped make Python the most popular language for data science in Stack Overflow’s 2016 developer poll. BASIC LIBRARIES FOR DATA SCIENCE These are the basic libraries that transform Python from a general purpose programming language into a powerful and robust tool for data analysis and visualization. Sometimes called the SciPy Stack, they’re the foundation that the more specialized tools are built on. NumPy is the foundational library for scientific computing in Python, and many of the libraries on this list use NumPy arrays as their basic inputs and outputs. In short, NumPy introduces objects for multidimensional arrays and matrices, as well as routines that allow developers to perform advanced mathematical and statistical functions on those arrays with as little code as possible.SciPy builds on NumPy by adding a collection of algorithms and high-level commands for manipulating and visualizing data. This package includes functions for computing integrals numerically, solving differential equations, optimization, and more.Pandas adds data structures and tools that are designed for practical data analysis in finance, statistics, social sciences, and engineering. Pandas works well with incomplete, messy, and unlabeled data (i.e., the kind of data you’re likely to encounter in the real world), and provides tools for shaping, merging, reshaping, and slicing datasets.IPython extends the functionality of Python’s interactive interpreter with a souped-up interactive shell that adds introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and command history retrieval. It also acts as an embeddable interpreter for your programs that can be really useful for debugging. If you’ve ever used Mathematica or MATLAB, you should feel comfortable with IPython.matplotlib is the standard Python library for creating 2D plots and graphs. It’s pretty low-level, meaning it requires more commands to generate nice-looking graphs and figures than with some more advanced libraries. However, the flip side of that is flexibility. With enough commands, you can make just about any kind of graph you want with matplotlib.Libraries for Machine Learning Machine learning sits at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and statistical analysis. By training computers with sets of real-world data, we’re able to create algorithms that make more accurate and sophisticated predictions, whether we’re talking about getting better driving directions or building computers that can identify landmarks just from looking at pictures. The following libraries give Python the ability to tackle a number of machine learning tasks, from performing basic regressions to training complex neural networks. scikit-learn builds on NumPy and SciPy by adding a set of algorithms for common machine learning and data mining tasks, including clustering, regression, and classification. As a library, scikit-learn has a lot going for it. Its tools are well-documented and its contributors include many machine learning experts. What’s more, it’s a very curated library, meaning developers won’t have to choose between different versions of the same algorithm. Its power and ease of use make it popular with a lot of data-heavy startups, including Evernote, OKCupid, Spotify, and Birchbox.Theano uses NumPy-like syntax to optimize and evaluate mathematical expressions. What sets Theano apart is that it takes advantage of the computer’s GPU in order to make data-intensive calculations up to 100x faster than the CPU alone. Theano’s speed makes it especially valuable for deep learning and other computationally complex tasks.TensorFlow is another high-profile entrant into machine learning, developed by Google as an open-source successor to DistBelief, their previous framework for training neural networks. TensorFlow uses a system of multi-layered nodes that allow you to quickly set up, train, and deploy artificial neural networks with large datasets. It’s what allows Google to identify objects in photos or understand spoken words in its voice-recognition app.Libraries for Data Mining and Natural Language Processing What if your business doesn’t have the luxury of accessing massive datasets? For many businesses, the data they need isn’t something that can be passively gathered—it has to be extracted either from documents or webpages. The following tools are designed for a variety of related tasks, from mining valuable information from websites to turning natural language into data you can use. Scrapy is an aptly named library for creating spider bots to systematically crawl the web and extract structured data like prices, contact info, and URLs. Originally designed for web scraping, Scrapy can also extract data from APIs.NLTK is a set of libraries designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLTK’s basic functions allow you to tag text, identify named entities, and display parse trees, which are like sentence diagrams that reveal parts of speech and dependencies. From there, you can do more complicated things like sentiment analysis and automatic summarization. It also comes with an entire book’s worth of material about analyzing text with NLTK.Pattern combines the functionality of Scrapy and NLTK in a massive library designed to serve as an out-of-the-box solution for web mining, NLP, machine learning, and network analysis. Its tools include a web crawler; APIs for Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia; and text-analysis algorithms like parse trees and sentiment analysis that can be performed with just a few lines of code.Libraries for Plotting and Visualizations The best and most sophisticated analysis is meaningless if you can’t communicate it to other people. These libraries build on matplotlib to enable you to easily create more visually compelling and sophisticated graphs, charts, and maps, no matter what kind of analysis you’re trying to do. Seaborn is a popular visualization library that builds on matplotlib’s foundation. The first thing you’ll notice about Seaborn is that its default styles are much more sophisticated than matplotlib’s. Beyond that, Seaborn is a higher-level library, meaning it’s easier to generate certain kinds of plots, including heat maps, time series, and violin plots.Bokeh makes interactive, zoomable plots in modern web browsers using JavaScript widgets. Another nice feature of Bokeh is that it comes with three levels of interface, from high-level abstractions that allow you to quickly generate complex plots, to a low-level view that offers maximum flexibility to app developers.Basemap adds support for simple maps to matplotlib by taking matplotlib’s coordinates and applying them to more than 25 different projections. The library Folium further builds on Basemap and allows for the creation of interactive web maps, similar to the JavaScript widgets created by Bokeh.NetworkX allows you to create and analyze graphs and networks. It’s designed to work with both standard and nonstandard data formats, which makes it especially efficient and scalable. All this makes NetworkX especially well suited to analyzing complex social networks.These libraries are just a small sample of the tools available to Python developers. If you’re ready to get your data science initiative up and running, you’re going to need the right team. Find a developer who knows the tools and techniques of statistical analysis, or a data scientist with the development skills to work in a production environment. Explore data scientists on Upwork, or learn more about the basics of Big Data. (Source: Upwork) Artificial intelligence researchers have developed several specialized programming languages for artificial intelligence: Some other languages that are being used for Artificial Intelligence as follows, AIML (meaning ""Artificial Intelligence Markup Language"")[1] is an XML dialect[2]for use with A.L.I.C.E.-type chatterbots.IPL[3] was the first language developed for artificial intelligence. It includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving, such as lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, generators (streams), and cooperative multitasking.Lisp[4] is a practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on lambda calculus. Linked lists are one of the Lisp language's major data structures, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new domain-specific programming languages embedded in Lisp. There are many dialects of Lisp in use today, among which are Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure.Smalltalk has been used extensively for simulations, neural networks, machine learning and genetic algorithms. It implements the purest and most elegant form of object-oriented programming using message passing.Prolog[5][6] is a declarative language where programs are expressed in terms of relations, and execution occurs by running queries over these relations. Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning, database and language parsing applications. Prolog is widely used in AI today.STRIPS is a language for expressing automated planning problem instances. It expresses an initial state, the goal states, and a set of actions. For each action preconditions (what must be established before the action is performed) and postconditions (what is established after the action is performed) are specified.Planner is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages. It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern-directed inference.POP-11 is a reflective, incrementally compiledprogramming language with many of the features of an interpreted language. It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex, and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birminghamwhich hosts the Poplog website, It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal, who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp. One of POP-11's features is that it supports first-class functions.Haskell is also a very good programming language for AI. Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT monads make it easy to express non-deterministic algorithms, which is often the case. Infinite data structures are great for search trees. The language's features enable a compositional way of expressing the algorithms. The only drawback is that working with graphs is a bit harder at first because of purity.Wolfram Language includes a wide range of integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, and image.[8]C++ (2011 onwards)MATLABPerlJulia (programming language), e.g. for machine learning, using native or non-native libraries.",2021-03-06T08:46:51.463Z,"What is best programming language for Artificial Intelligence projects?

On the Same Side by Zoltan Andrejkovics, a 2019 AI philosophy book which describes the current state and future opportunities of AGI. Here is my favorite part from the third part of the book: Fast forward to 2150, a future where Personal AI Assistants (PIs) will know literally everything about you. They could easily remember and tell past stories to friends (a heaven for introverted people) or handle requests when you are not available. They will be a virtual replicant to you, resulting in a huge trust between you and your PI because the PI will put your interests at the forefront. Life will be easier since it would be almost impossible to make any mistakes: no more tax avoidance, no more unpaid bills, and no more unhealthy food (sounds bad at the first glance). You wake up in the morning and will receive a PI supervised healthy (maybe even tasty) breakfast. You enjoy news prepared based on your interests, check in with your friends, and learn your best friend’s birthday present is already ordered. Maybe you tell your PI to make an appointment with someone in the coming days and some seconds later, your PI has already negotiated a perfect date and time. Work won’t be the same. In a sense it will be a step closer to a real profession we are interested in. Along with daily tasks, we could outsource repetitive ones to our PI. Don’t forget AI have no objection to monotonous tasks. They will handle them perfectly every time. Problem solving will be more like a conversation between AI and us. AI will handle the data (collect and process) and we will be in the duty to connect the dots. Even making a public survey will be a matter of minutes, PIs all over the world will receive the question and those whose owners will be open to answers will send the feedback.

Many software engineers ignore the business aspect of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, it is important to understand the applicability of AI in a business context so that they are able to code better. In this book, MIT professors Erik Brynjolfsson, and Andrew McAfee have done an incredible job at explaining the concepts in a simple manner. They say that routine tasks and easily-defined profiles could be the first ones to be impacted by Artificial Intelligence. For example, scanning of documents for finding information that is easily retrievable is a job that machines can easily do. They explain how the combination of IBM’s Watson and Apple’s Siri can replace call center operations and with the surge in technology in driverless cars, truck drivers could find themselves without a job.",2021-03-06T08:51:59.910Z,"What books should I read to start out on learning about artificial Intelligence?

I also can't prove to you that you're not hallucinating my existence. From your perspective, I could be a figment of your imagination.  As humans, we're built to assume that other humans (and probably many animals) have qualia. That could be there for evolutionary reasons, or possibly there is a metaphysical reason behind it, or perhaps it's just the best conclusion given the evidence (i.e. at least within the limits of my observed intellectual capacity, I don't believe that I could manufacture a world with billions of inhabitants that continues to surprise me). Ultimately, though, that is a statement of faith, because within human experience there seems to be nothing that can prove absolutely the existence of another's qualia.",2021-03-06T09:12:51.169Z,"What is the best way to tell if a person is an expert in artificial Intelligence?

So the field took another direction: rather than trying to think, let’s enter the rules and apply them to business problems. This worked and actually made money. For a while the expert systems were AI. The people who were looking for ways to think, not to apply recipes, retreated in Academia. Then came the web and a few people figured out they could make a ton of money by selling ads on line. For that they needed to grab a lot of data on people to make these ads efficient. So they built apps whose only goal was to grab data. Then came the iphone and the grab increased 1 million times. Then came IoT. That took care of the data issue. Meanwhile the same people had to build distributed computing solutions so it takes no time to assemble a Facebook page or show cool videos - and sell more ads. That took care of the computing issue. So Lecun, Bengio and Hinton and a few others came out of the woods and showed that now the algo worked.

If you’ve ever studied optimization theory, you know there are global maxima and there are local maxima. Modern machine learning is getting really good at solving a very particular set problems: prediction, detection, regression, etc. Any time you have some data mapping inputs to outputs, and you want a system that will predict previously unseen outputs given new inputs, machine learning seems like a good tool for the job. But the thing is, even if we perfectly solve the problems being tackled by modern AI — we can perfectly identify every object in an image, we can always interpret someone’s intent from their words — that’s not going to get us to so-called “Artificial General Intelligence” whereby machines are capable of reasoning on their own and acting in unbounded ways. In truth, no one’s made any significant progress towards that problem. Experts in the field go to conferences, they read papers, and they see where progress is being made — and importantly, they see the mechanism that drives that progress. It’s powerful, impactful, and probably going to put a lot of people out of work, but it’s not going to turn humans into batteries in a virtual world. Thanks for the A2A.

The main advantage of this is ease of understanding, both for implementation and use. Subsymbolic means the data flowing around the system is only part of a symbol. For example, in neural networks, a memory is stored as the weight values of thousands of connections between artificial neurones. The advantage of this approach is robustness in the face of noisy input (basically, the real world). Expert systems are symbolic systems. They are basically a big list of ""if -- then"" clauses. Their main problem is that they do not scale well. But they still have their uses in areas like medical diagnosis. A non-expert can put all a patient's symptoms into an expert system and it can give them a list of possible diseases. The same is true for diagnosis of any complex system, such as an aircraft or powerplant. But expert systems are little more than directed encyclopaedias. They will always have very limited uses. Recently, with huge advancements in things like deep learning, subsymbolic systems are becoming increasingly important. In truth, both categories are useful in different areas, but subsymbolic is the approach that will have the biggest impact on the world. Please feel free to use them, they can be very useful.

It allows advertisers to bid for ad placement in a search engine’s sponsored link when someone searches for a keyword that is related to their business offering. For example, if you bid on the particular keyword, then an ad might show up in the very top position as per the Google terms and condition. This process is used to determine the relevance and validity that ads that appear on the Search Engine Result Page i.e SERP. If you want to create a campaign you will need four things to do first these areas below: 1) A Budget2) Ads/ad copy3) Keywords4) Billing Information Google makes the planning process is easy to understand by providing a Keyword Planning Tool that will help create keywords for your business, as well as give you an estimate of daily traffic and budget. If you confused between out two of the four items of your product in one fell swoop, then you use two forms of ad copy so that you can test which ad performs better.Once A/B testing is complete, you can optimize from there. You also know that it’s good practice to use keywords in the ad copy as a means of making the copy more relevant to the searcher.

So I did some basic reading and video watching, and got to know the basics - supervised learning, vs unsupervised learning, vs RL - mostly at a high level. I also finally understood what some of the key terms mean - like label, features, example, model, training, inference. It felt so exciting!!! Articles and buzzwords suddenly made much more sense (or often - less sense … how will these labels take over the world???), and I even felt comfortable participating in casual Friday evening conversations on the topic. But this just encouraged MORE curiosity. So I wanted to go to the next level. I felt I kinda KNEW what it is now, but that it's time I actually UNDERSTAND it. So I got interested in questions like how does learning actually work, and is it done in code. I discovered that there are many more different types of model architectures, beyond the oversimplified feed forward model I was initially taught: CNNs, RNNs, GANs, AEs, … I learned about the recent history of DL resurrection, and how CNNs grew year over year from 2012 - reminding me of the skyscrapers competition in the 1900s. I was fascinated by the richness of the domain, and came to realize that both the theory behind it, as well as the constant practical progress - are much broader and deeper than what I initially imagined, during those Friday evening conversations. At this point, I got hooked and wanted to go deeper. The more I consumed, the hungrier I got, and the more I knew, the more I understood how much I didn't know. I started asking more nuanced question, and also started reading papers. I discovered the next level of complexity - the RL world that is so different than whI have learned so far, the magical GAN Zoo, attention, transformers, BERT, Meta Learning, one shot learning, ensemble learning… I started reading about some of the problems ML is dealing with - bias, interpretability, … At the point I start questioning how well do these wonderful theoretical and academic creations scale to real world problems? Can they be effectively used in the industry? For what? What does it involve? A new universe opens up. I learned some key differences between the research world I knew so far, and industry. For example, in the research-y world, data is often given to you, and you can't manipulate it, but rather your goal is to beat some benchmark for a given well defined task. So most of the innovation is in the design of the model. In the industry, on the other hand, getting the data, massaging the data, and defining the right problem is often much more important (and time consuming) than choosing the right model. I also discovered that in real life, tweaking the model to perfection is just the beginning. Deploying to production, dealing with production data, retraining the model, handling user signals, … It's a fascinating and emerging domain, with constant innovations in Auto ML, cloud environments, etc. Another very interesting area that got me hooked at some point - is the relationship to the human brain, and how is ML similar to / different than human learning. How does the brain work? How is it that humans don't require all of Wikipedia to learn English? How can we teach common sense to machines, and have them reason like humans? Finally, as I gained enough nuanced understanding of advanced topics and questions, I started paying more informed attention to the bigger questions: is AI really dangerous? In what ways? What should we do about it? Is DL at a dead end and needs to be replaced by a new paradigm? Is AGI really getting closer? Is singularity really 20~ years away? Is 42 really the answer to everything? It's all very very interesting. Surprisingly, it is not just by becoming Google certified.  Being an expert in PPC means being an expert in running a successful PPC campaign.

You need to know how AdWords and BingAds and Facebook and all the other Pay-Per-Click digital ad networks work, and understand them at a deep level.  You can't fix a car unless you know how to use the tools. 2. Deep understanding of business.  If you went into marketing to avoid the finance and econ classes, well, sorry.  You should probably work in PR not PPC.  PPC is all about the data, and the most important data is in the financial results of your marketing efforts.  If success is measured in terms of profit, how will you make good decisions in running campaigns if you don't understand the business impact? 3. Logical thinking on process optimization.  If you are into Business Process Improvement or you were a Philosophy major and studied logic and game theory, well, you have a leg up.  If not, you need to think about how to bone up on process improvement, as PPC is all about building cycles of continual improvement.  The good news is there are a million sites out there now on Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints, and all manner of process improvement thinking.  This is surprisingly helpful, and somewhat required to be a PPC expert. Lastly, you need to apply this.  Practice, practice, practice. There is nothing like experience, and for that you need to weigh in and run campaigns.  Get a job in an agency or with an in-house team.  Get an internship if you are still in school.  Practical work in the space gives you the chance to execute on the combined three areas of knowledge.

When I am writing this, there are only two answers to this very interesting question. One is about Facebook AI, that is claimed that it has been shut down. I will answer to this question, but let me first clarify some things about Facebook AI Research (FAIR). Clarification : Facebook hasn't shut down AI research. They only shut down one experiment. They are working on an AI which could communicate with humans (Obviously, that is the prime goal after all). To develop this, bots were given some tasks which required bot-to-bot communication in English. They started talking to each other in simple language, as FAIR scientists didn’t want to confuse bots with complex language. After conversing some sentences, they lost command over English and started repeating words in way that we, humans cannot understand. Example: Bob: “I can can I I everything else.” Alice: “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.” This is the reason they shut down the experiment (not research). They are busy finding some other ways to complete the task. Tell me one thing. Would you shut down the old machine and bye a new one, just because it is not following your command, or you would just re-calibrate the old one and use it again? It's like that. Answer: I was about to go with Google Search AI, but later, I came across with this article. It is about autonomous helicopters, which can teach themselves flying and copying maneuvers just by watching radio-controlled helicopters flown by pilots.  Professor of Stanford University Mr. Andrew Ng and his graduate students Pieter Abbeel, Adam Coates, Timothy Hunter and Morgan Quigley developed this autonomous Artificial Intelligence. This helicopters loaded with AI could literally pick any movement which pilot can perform. How? Just by watching them doing so. Be it flips, rolls, loops with pirouettes, a knife-edge, a slapper, an inverted tail slide or a hurricane. Anything. Without fail. Just imagine. You see a stuntman doing back-flip. You are quite impressed and fascinated. You want to do it yourself. Will you, human, the smartest living being on the earth, be able to do it in first attempt? No. You will have to practice it, don’t you? Well, autonomous helicopters succeeded to do so in first attempt. Isn’t it smart? Searching results by text (Google search) or telling a bot with computer commands (FAIR) to complete particular task seems easy compared to this AI. I mean, you somehow give indirectly commands. Either AI should receive and follow direct verbal commands or do it themselves by understanding nearby situations and environment,right? This AI fits the criteria. So, I would consider this autonomous AI the smartest AI in the world, would you? I have answered similar questions before, but will do so again, since questions like this are so important to answer, especially in this climate of hype and exaggeration about where actually AI is as a field.

AI, in short, is the field that aims to develop a computational understanding of how brains produce minds, or how organisms — biological or artificial — can process real-world sensory information to produce intelligent action. It has the same aims as many related fields — neuroscience, philosophy, economics, and psychology — but differs from them principally in the sense that the theories produced are primarily computational. Like other scientific studies of the mind, the longer one studies AI, the more one comes away with a sense of awe at the sheer complexity of the brain, and the amazing algorithms that nature has devised to solve one of the hardest problems known to man. After 30+ years of doing AI and ML, I wake up every morning with as much awe and wonder as when I began working in this field in 1981. I will begin by quoting from a book by Sebastian Seung, one of the world's leading neuroscience researchers (who was at MIT and is now at Princeton). Seung, Sebastian. Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are . Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition. Amazon.com: Connectome: How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are (9780547678597): Sebastian Seung: Books In this book, Professor Seung begins by making an analogy between the brain and a forest. He says in the opening paragraphs: “This forest is majestic, but also comic and even tragic. It is all of these things. Indeed, sometimes I think it is everything. Every novel and every symphony, every cruel murder and every act of mercy, every love affair and every quarrel, every joke and every sorrow—all these things come from the forest. You may be surprised to hear that it fits in a container less than one foot in diameter. And that there are seven billion on this earth. You happen to be the caretaker of one, the forest that lives inside your skull. The trees of which I speak are those special cells called neurons. The mission of neuroscience is to explore their enchanted branches—to tame the jungle of the mind” AI is similarly trying to solve the greatest scientific puzzle of all time — how brains produce minds — but rather than begin by thinking of the brain as an enormous forest of trees, we begin by posing the problem as one of trying to formulate computational theories of how sensors — eyes, ears, hands — could receive and interpret data — images, speech signals, touch signals — and produce models of the external world and ultimately make decisions, which in our early years were often life or death ones. In the same introductory section. Professor Seung also says something that is incredibly important. He shows great humility to the awesome task. This is of the greatest importance. In my experience, the greater the scientist, the greater the humility shown towards the subject. For example, at no point did Einstein, originator of some of the most successful theories of the universe, sound boastful or arrogant, that he had somehow decoded the secret to the universe. He always reminded the reader that humans receive information about the world through a very limited set of sensors, and our knowledge of the world is very fragmentary and limited. Newton, probably the most successful scientist ever, in describing his own work, adopted a tone of deference and humility that should serve as an example to everyone in science who is prone to hyperbole: “I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. Isaac Newton, English mathematician & physicist (1642 - 1727) Similarly, Professor Seung says: “Sometimes I speak to the public about the state of our field. After one such talk, I was pummeled with questions. What causes depression and schizophrenia? What is special about the brain of an Einstein or a Beethoven? How can my child learn to read better? As I failed to give satisfying answers, I could see faces fall. In my shame I finally apologized to the audience. “I’m sorry,” I said. “You thought I’m a professor because I know the answers. Actually I’m a professor because I know how much I don’t know.” What a great line! I too am a professor of AI because I know how much we don't know about AI!! I cannot match Professor’s Seung’s gift with words, but echo with the same humility that after spending 30+ years studying AI and machine learning, I am just awestruck by the power of the brain, by the speed with which learning occurs in a child. A great psychologist, William James, who taught for many years at Harvard, likened a child's experience of being born as emerging into a “blooming, buzzing confusion” of sensory signals. Yet, amazingly, within two years, children learn to speak, recognize objects, walk around, use devices as tools, the list goes on and on…we who study AI in the 21st century now have access to millions of powerful GPU machines, petabytes of storage capacity, unlimited data virtually with the resources of the web, and yet. all this compute power is no match for a 2 year old child! So, the first and foremost lesson that emerges from AI is a great sense of awe at the most sophisticated computer ever built, the one that lies between your ears, and that holds the secrets to the cleverest compression methods ever devised, the best statistical signal processor ever built, the best memory device ever constructed, and the most reliable and foolproof OS ever designed. Decoding the computational architecture of the brain will change computer science completely, and let us build devices of unparalleled power and creativity, but let us not kid ourselves. It won’t happen soon…. Einstein was fond of the saying: “Subtle is the lord…”. By that he meant that nature guards her secrets well. Revealing the brain’s computational secrets will not come easily but it will require decades of hard work, perhaps even centuries. Recent successes in deep learning have given some, in my view, a false sense of confidence that the problem of AI will be solved within a few more years. While it is impossible to make predictions about how quickly any scientific problem will be solved, all the evidence points to the fact that the performance of deep learning at computer vision is far below human levels. For example, the latest MATLAB package R2018a comes with a simple routine that lets you hook up a USB camera, and a 5 line MATLAB program is provided to “solve the computer vision problem”. The first time I demoed it to my wife, it labeled our living room as “a barbershop”!! Needless to say, its performance at object recognition in my house was pathetic, with accuracies less than 10% at best. It was no match to any 2 year old child. (The program basically lets you download any deep learning network, like Alexnet, VGGnet, etc., and use these pretrained networks to label objects). Similarly, it is trivial to show how badly Siri works in noisy environments, when any normal 2 year old child would recognize a spoken utterance effortlessly. One can go on, but the point should be clear. AI is a hard problem, and we've just begun. We are in the first innings of a long game… as legend has it, a famous MIT AI professor assigned his graduate student the problem of computer vision as a “summer project”, since he thought its solution will take a few months. What could be hard, he thought, of taking a black and white image, and recognizing it? Hey, we do it in a few hundred milliseconds. If an average neuron in our brain takes 1 millisecond to fire, there is a “hundred step” program that solves computer vision. Well, 50 years later, we are no closer to finding this 100-step program. Is Alexnet or similar deep architectures the solution? How I wish this were the case. All the evidence I have seen so far tells me that the claims are overblown, and that when you test the performance of the pretriained networks yourself in your house or office, you will see that the real performance is far far worse than the performance on their specially tuned Imagenet dataset. This is not surprising at all — a normal child learns from the real world, not some artificial dataset that is collected and used to repeatedly train the network (no doubt causing a lot of overfitting). I will end by again quoting from Professor Seung’s book: “My audience was curious about brains that malfunction or excel, but even the humdrum lacks explanation. Every day we recall the past, perceive the present, and imagine the future. How do our brains accomplish these feats? It’s safe to say that nobody really knows.” Despite all the hype you read in the press about how the AI problem is going to solved soon, take it from me. As Professor Seung says. “nobody really knows” how the brain works, how the mind works, and how to build AI systems that even match the capabilities of a 2 year old child. This is going to be a long journey…. but it’s arguably the greatest scientific voyage that we can take now…. “Artificial Intelligence” is a huge field. Arguably, the goal of artificial intelligence is to create a machine capable of performing the tasks that we associate with intelligence and capable of passing a sophisticated “Turing test”—i.e., its behavior would be indistinguishable from that of another person. In the 1950s, some scientists put forth the proposition that this could be accomplished by modeling the brain with “artificial neural networks.” In other words, they envisioned a simulation of how the brain develops & strengthens connections. Unfortunately, Marvin Minsky, at MIT at the time,  Continue Reading“Artificial Intelligence” is a huge field. Arguably, the goal of artificial intelligence is to create a machine capable of performing the tasks that we associate with intelligence and capable of passing a sophisticated “Turing test”—i.e., its behavior would be indistinguishable from that of another person. In the 1950s, some scientists put forth the proposition that this could be accomplished by modeling the brain with “artificial neural networks.” In other words, they envisioned a simulation of how the brain develops & strengthens connections. Unfortunately, Marvin Minsky, at MIT at the time, I believe, pretty much killed this idea. Also, at the time, computing power was not up to the task envisioned. So, aside from a brief moment during the 1980s when parallel processing was coming into its own, the main approach until recently has been expert systems—nothing more than extensive and sophisticated series of if-then statements. Recently, you’ve probably heard of deep learning. Deep learning uses the idea of artificial neural networks and allows computers to learn how to do things for themselves. To understand how this works, imagine teaching a program to read aloud. You create a series of nodes several layers deep (hence, the “deep” in deep learning). These are essentially neurons, and they all start with some default level of connectedness—i.e., if one is activated it has perhaps equal probability of activating any other node it is connected to. You “feed” the network with text. It behaves in a default way, outputting nonsense. The key to this is that at the output end, a feedback loop is set up. If the computer’s output sounds were incorrect, this information is fed back to the neural network, and the connections that were followed that time around are weakened. Then it tries again, and is corrected again. This happens over many tens of thousands of iterations, reinforcing correct pathways (by increasing the probability of them being used given particular inputs). This was actually tried in the 1980s and produced an eerily babbling output. Today, it is used for a variety of tasks, from image recognition (always a huge challenge in AI) to playing go or chess to language recognition. What is most intriguing about this whole process to me is that when the neural network is “finished” learning, we can go back and look at the connections it has formed between the nodes to perform its tasks. However, it is usually not possible to understand why a particular configuration is successful—i.e., we don’t understand what it is the computer is doing once it has established a successful set of connections. If you want a good explanation of this plus some simple exercise, there is an article here: How to Win at Deep Learning | Quanta MagazineIf you are intrigued by the idea of how a computer can program itself and think in ways that we can’t quite understand, look into the Google AI Dreams, which explores image recognition issues.",2021-03-06T09:29:49.005Z,"What is the best way to know about artificial intelligence through top experts?

We are now recognizing that most things called ""AI"" in the past are nothing more than advanced programming tricks. As long as the programmer is the one supplying all the intelligence to the system by programming it in as a World Model, the system is not really an Artificial Intelligence. It's ""just a program"". Don't model the World; Model the Mind. When you Model the Mind you can create systems capable of Learning everything about the world. It is a much smaller task, since the world is very large and changes behind your back, which means World Models will become obsolete the moment they are made. The only hope to create intelligent systems is to have the system itself create and maintain its own World Models. Continuously, in response to sensory input. Following this line of reasoning, Machine Learning is NOT a subset of AI. It really is the ONLY kind of AI there is. And this is now proving to be true, and in a big way. Since 2012, a specific Machine Learning technique called Deep Learning is taking the AI world by storm. Researchers are abandoning the classical ""Programming Tricks"" style of AI in droves and switching to Deep Learning... based mainly on the fact that it actually works. We've made more progress in three years since 2012 than we've done in the preceeding 25 years on several key AI problems, including Image Understanding (a really hard one), Signal Processing, Voice Understanding, and Text Understanding. Another clue that we are now on the right track: Old style AI projects like CYC ran to millions of propositions or millions of lines of code. Systems that (successfully) Model the Mind can be as small as 600 lines of code; several recent Deep Learning projects clock in somewhere in that range. And these programs can move from one problem domain to another with very few changes to the core; this means these methods are GENERAL intelligences, not specific to any one problem domain. This is why it is called Artificial General Intelligence. And we've never had any AI programs that could do this in the past. As an example, the language understanding programs we are creating using DL will work equally well in any language, not just English. It just takes a re-training to switch to Japanese... another indication that Deep Learning is closer to true intelligence than traditional NLP systems. Google is currently using Machine Learning a lot - in my estimate, over a hundred places in their systems have been replaced by Deep Learning and other ML techniques in the past few years. even their patented ""PageRank"" algorithm which was the initial key to their success is being replaced, even as I write this, with a new algorithm called ""RankBrain"" which is based on Deep Learning. In the shareholder's call last week, the CEO of Google said that they were looking at using ML (probably Deep Learning) *everywhere* in all their products. More generally, I expect a deluge of apps and systems that understand languages and images in the next several years, all based on Deep Learning. I really shouldn't confuse things but strictly speaking, Deep Learning is not AI either. We are currently using Supervised Deep Learning, which is another (but less critical) programmer's cheat since the ""supervision"" is a kind of World Model. Real AI requires Unsupervised Deep Learning. Many people including myself are working on this; it is possibly thousands of times more difficult than Supervised Learning. But this is where we have to go. Deep Learning isn't AI but it's the only thing we have that's on the path to True AI. Machine learning is technically a branch of AI. It is based on the idea that we can build machines to process data and learn on their own, without constant supervision. AI is the technology in which we make machines intelligent but Machine Learning is the technology using which we train our models so that it can beat human intelligence.

AI is the technology in which we make machines intelligent but Machine Learning is the technology using which we train our models so that it can beat human intelligence. Here is an awesome video tutorial that will clear all your doubts about the difference between AI and ML:  Here is a diagrammatic representation of relations between AI, ML, DL, Data Science:  As you can see in the diagram, AI is the main head of all the other technologies and at the same time, all technologies are co-related to each other. ML, DL, NN all are the sub-parts of AI. Thinking how AI works? Computers are good at following processes (a sequence of steps) to execute a task. If we give a computer, steps to execute a task the computer should easily be able to complete it. The steps are nothing but Algorithms. So, how can we accomplish this? Let’s take an example of predicting the weather forecast for 2019. First, we need a lot of data. Let’s take the data from 2006 – 2018. Now, let us divide this data in an 80:20 ratio. 80% of the data is going to be our labeled data, and the rest 20% of the data is going to be our test data. Note: We have the output for the entire 100% of data which has been acquired from 2006 – 2018. What happens once we have collected the data? We are going to feed the labeled data i.e. the 80% of data into the machine. Here, the algorithm is learning from the data which has been fed into it. Next, we need to test the algorithm. We feed the test data, i.e. the remaining 20% of the data to the machine. The machine gives us the output. Now, we cross verify the output given by the machine with the actual output of the data and check for its accuracy. Once we check for accuracy and we are not satisfied with the model, we tweak the algorithm to give us the precise output or at least somewhere close to the actual output. Once we are satisfied with the model, we then feed the data to the model so that it can predict 2019’s weather forecast. Types Of AI Artificial General Intelligence: It is an emerging field aiming at the building of ‘thinking machines’. This intelligence involves reasoning, thinking, learning without giving any input. It is less common because it is difficult to create. A generalized AI would be capable of handling all kinds of different tasks, just like human handles.Applied Artificial Intelligence: It is commonly defined as an application of artificial intelligence to enable a high-functioning system that replicates human intelligence for a dedicated purpose. This is the most common form of AI. It includes everything from intelligent stock-trading systems to automated self-driving. For example, an advanced applied AI system can gather employee background information such as user name, title, location and authorized resources from across disparate data sources.Now coming on to the Machine Learning: Now that we have access to a huge amount of data, Machine Learning researchers are constantly working on making use of this data in order to provide intelligence to the model. Machine Learning uses large sets of data and hours of training to make predictions on probable outcomes. But when Machine Learning ‘comes to life’ and moves beyond simple programming, and reflects and interacts with people even at the most basic level, AI comes into play. AI is the step beyond Machine Learning, yet it needs ML to reflect and optimize decisions. AI uses what it has gained from ML to simulated intelligence, the same way a human is constantly observing their surrounding environment and making intelligent decisions. Here are some real-life applications of ML: Moley’s Robotic Kitchen: The kitchen comes up with a pair of robotic arms, an oven, a shelf for food and utensils, and a touch screen. Moley’s kitchen is a gift of Machine Learning: it will learn n number of recipes for you, will cook with remarkable precision, and will also clean up by itself.Netflix Movie Recommendation: More than 80 percent of the shows and movies are discovered through the recommendation section. To recommend movies, it goes through threads within the content rather than relying on the genre board in order to make predictions.Amazon Alexa: The latest innovations of Amazon have the brain and the voice of Alexa. Alexa is the voice-controlled Amazon ‘personal assistant’ in Amazon Echo devices. Alexa can play music, provide information, deliver news and sports scores, tell you the weather, control your smart home, and even allow prime members to order products that they’ve ordered before.Amazon Product Recommendation: Amazon, it recommends a set of items that are bought together or items that are often bought together, along with your ordered item. Have you ever wondered how does Amazon recommends you that? Well again, Amazon uses Machine Learning algorithms to do so.Google Maps: Google Maps anonymously sends real-time data from Google Maps users on the same route back to Google. Google uses a Machine Learning algorithm on these data to predict accurately the traffic on that route.Machine Learning Vs. Artificial Intelligence: Which Is Right For You? Both AI and ML can have their own valuable business applications. Determining which one is best for your company depends on what your business needs. These systems have many great applications to offer, but ML has gotten much more publicity lately, so many companies have focused on that source of solutions. However, AI can also be useful for many simpler applications that don't require ongoing learning. Hope this answer helps!

Machine Learning is focused on developing computer programs that have the ability to access data and use it to learn. Therefore, in Machine Learning, computers are able to adapt to new data, without depending on human actions. Differences between AI and ML are: · Artificial Intelligence is a wider concept than Machine Learning. AI is the concept of creating machines with human minds whereas ML is just an application or subset. · Artificial Systems are created to maximize the chances of success while Machine Learning concerns patterns and accuracy. · The scope of Artificial Intelligence is wide while Machine Learning has limited scope. · Artificial Intelligence includes; learning, self-correction, and reasoning while Machine Learning only concerns self-correction when it is introduced to new data. · Depending on the capabilities Artificial Intelligence can be divided into three categories namely; Weak AI, General AI, and Strong AI while, Machine Learning can be divided into; Supervised learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. · Machine Learning and deep learning are branches of Artificial Intelligence itself on the contrary Deep learning is the main subset of Machine Learning. · Artificial Intelligence deals with Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and Machine Learning concerns Structured and semi-structured data.

See, when it comes to productively mastering Artificial Intelligence, it is imperative to learn from an effective learning resource - the one that does not glide over the topics, the one that considers that students are new to the domain and are not well adept with the Data Science environment, the one that makes the learning curve linear and progresses on difficult topics only after providing enough insights and examples on the concepts, the one that explains why the program is executing the way it is executing.  To master AI, I had left no stone unturned. I had purchased plethora of courses, books, PDF material, but I always used to hit a wall a few days into the learning. In majority of the cases, I felt that the author/tutor was in a hurry to get to the end of the course and was not educating the rationale behind writing those pieces of code and assuming that one is well versed with the Data Science environment. However, that is not the case with someone who is a beginner. I dropped the idea of learning from those resources and instead resorted to free video tutorials available on the web. However, over the time I realized that a major flaw with them is that they being ‘free and open for all’ community attract lots of creators who are considering to make a quick buck. Content quality of such tutorials is questionable. Moreover, one cannot prove of one’s grasp on the subject to potential employers, due to no provision of obtaining certification for the courses completed on those platforms. This may hinder one’s career, especially in cases where employer has set a criteria of choosing candidates with relevant degree/certificate.

Incidentally, it’s the same thing that many people overlook. Before we get into that, AI nowadays so somewhat similar to the legend of El Dorado - everyone is looking for it, with only vague ideas where it can be. At best. But that’s what makies the quest exciting, isn’t it? In 50-s and 60-s, when the ideas of AI were pioneered by such great scientists as Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Claude Shannon, Terry Winograd and many others, people started creating programs that were capable of logical reasoning, solving simple puzzles, playing chess and answering questions about artificial environment. That was really impressive, especially if you consider that people didn’t have powerful hardware, machine learning and all that stuff. But at that time there were no reliable definitions of knowledge or understanding. That was even long before the famous “Chinese Room Experiment” that still remains one of the most puzzling dilemmas about “strong AI”. Immediately after that a lot of algorithms based on semantic relationships emerged. They were like mechanical toys from the 18th century which were capable of writing preprogrammed verses, dancing and performing other simple tricks. Even graph theory looked promising only when it was evaluated on small problems. Later, with the creation of search engines we got something really powerful, but nothing similar to human understanding or reasoning was achieved. So, that common thing I’ve mentioned? The common thing is that the textbooks about them consist of recipes that don’t work. These projects I’ve just mentioned are what you will read there. It’s only history. Would you like something that might work instead? Technical knowledge and math background are essential, that goes without saying. So, if that’s a problem you should start with becoming a decent machine learning engineer, which means learning the newest frameworks as well as classic algorithms. But what’s really important to learn is how to do research and understand novel ideas in depth using only a ten-page article and poorly documented code. Because the most important things in strong AI aren’t solved yet. Not a single one. You will have to create this science…not entirely from scratch, but before you could write some code, you will have to come up with a theory about how the mind works. How it acquires and preserves knowledge, how attention works, how you can implement all that using a computer. So, the truth is that apart from the essential tools there are not many things to learn. But there are so many things to invent.

One of the common phrases that has stuck around for decades, and which encourages the idea of a brain vs. computer argument, is “brains are analogue, computers are digital”. This makes it seem like computers are superior, but in truth, the human brain is far more advanced and efficient, and possesses more raw computational power than the most impressive supercomputers that have ever been built.  At the time of this writing, the fastest supercomputer in the world is the Tianhe-2 in Guangzhou, China, and has a maximum processing speed of 54.902 petaFLOPS. A petaFLOP is a quadrillion (one thousand trillion) floating point calculations per second. That’s a huge amount of calculations, and yet, that doesn’t even come close to the processing speed of the human brain. In contrast, our miraculous brains operate on the next order higher. Although it is impossible to precisely calculate, it is postulated that the human brain operates at 1 exaFLOP, which is equivalent to a billion billion calculations per second. In 2014, some clever researchers in Japan tried to match the processing power in one second from one percent of the brain. That doesn’t sound like very much, and yet it took the 4th fastest supercomputer in the world (the K Computer) 40 minutes to crunch the calculations for a single second of brain activity Content credit : scienceabc dot com",2021-03-06T10:03:05.062Z,"How do I start learning artificial intelligence?

AI is a knowledge-creating machine. The purpose of AI is to create machines that create good knowledge.

Just as a theory of flight is essential to the success of flying machines, a theory of knowledge is essential to AI. This is why a theoretical basis for understanding AI has greater reach and explanatory power than the applied or technical discussions that dominate this subject. The prevailing theory of knowledge creation in modern AI is induction. We learn from observation. This is called inductive reasoning, or induction for short. We observe some phenomena and derive general principles to form a theory. Machine learning, the most important domain in AI, is also inductive. Unfortunately, induction is prone to errors. It seems to play a central role in science and everyday life, but it also seems prone to produce bad knowledge. Attempts to manage the problem of induction are revealed as a central challenge of AI. So how do we cope with the problem of induction? We leverage existing knowledge. Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David explain, “We can escape the hazards foreseen by [the problem of induction] by using our prior knowledge about a specific learning task, to avoid the distributions that will cause us to fail when learning that task.”[1] This is the essential connection between existing knowledge and learning. To observe intelligently requires explanations. Explanations figure prominently in the past, present and future of AI. The popular history of AI is that non-inductive approaches necessarily lead to brittle hand crafted systems of knowledge engineering. But on closer examination, explanations have been successfully operationalized in many guises, such as the inductive bias of a learner, the role of background knowledge in “priming the pump” of induction, the importance of sound priors for confronting the “curse of dimensionality”, and the venerable Occam’s razor. The most imaginative solutions are increasingly focused on explanations. Explanatory factors enable rapid learning using only a handful of observations. Innovations in compositionality, distributed representations, and transfer learning mirror the integration of explanations across multiple domains. Explanations also figure prominently in the context of automated scientific discovery through heuristics and search strategies to narrow down a large space of possible hypotheses and new ideas. Generative approaches illustrate the power of explanatory models to create data based on explanations of their environments. These visionary approaches leap over the brittle corpses of knowledge engineering in surprising ways. So why does AI work? Inductive systems work because the problem of induction can be managed. And since there is no universal solution, no free lunch, a deep understanding of the knowledge domain is paramount. This competitive advantage is often expressed as privileged access to data, but it’s better understood as the power of explanations to intelligently guide you to the right data. A new perspective on AI is gained when induction is cast as a problem to navigate rather than a principle unchallenged. And just as various schools of philosophy converged on the consensus of explanations, various schools of AI are converging on the foundation of explanations to create good knowledge.

They used machine learning and deep learning to train the Word2Vec algorithm by having it sift through 3.3 million previously published scientific papers. While doing this, Word2Vec learned the meaning of over 500,000 words. As with most AI programs that uses deep learning, Word2Vec was not trained to find anything specific - only to find patterns, relationships, implications and logical conclusions that can be drawn from the data. AI programs also modify their own programming during the deep learning process in ways that the human programmers and operators cannot follow. Some AI programs can add millions of lines of code as it learns. The operators don’t really know what the AI program has learned until they test it. So they did. Anubhav Jain, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and his team fed the Word2Vec AI program only papers published before 2009 and it was able to predict one of the best modern-day thermoelectric materials four years before it was discovered in 2012. This is an incredible accomplishment. If we had used this software in 2009, we would have made a discovery then, that was not really discovered until 2012. Imagine the cost of the research done in those 3 or 4 years. Imagine the advancement of the sales and benefits of using that newly discovered thermoelectric material 4 years earlier. This was, of course, just a test on an obscure topic but the implications are massive. As noted in the article, dozens and soon hundreds of research facilities are going to obtain this AI program and use it to enhance their own research. Other labs will use it to initiate all new discoveries. At this early stage, significant advances can be made using research papers from past research. In other words, no new lab research will be conducted. New discoveries will be made in hours or days based on just running the software on data files of past studies. Think about that. If 100 labs started using this approach to their research in different fields of study - physics, cosmology, biology, metallurgy, chemistry, etc. - all of these labs might be making ground-breaking discoveries every few weeks or months instead of one or two of them making discoveries every 3 or 4 years. What is also very likely is that other labs and university research facilities will copy, modify and then enhance the Word2Vec AI program so that it can refine its analysis and look deeper into the implications of the studies and data it reads. The next step will be to expand and enhance the AI capability to use it for ongoing research even down to one or two studies. Imagine this. A cure for a disease is being sought. The usual way is to expose the disease germs to a wide variety of possible drugs or substances that might work until one is found that kills the germs. This can sometimes take tens of thousands of trials and years of research. An alternative approach might be to allow the AI program to read all that we know about the disease germs and then to feed it millions of research papers on past studies of drugs, disease, germs, and cures and have the AI program make the connections of treatments that might work. It might, for instance, determine that a two-step cure might be needed. The best-known example is Edward Jenner's use in 1798 of cowpox to prevent smallpox. The advantage, of course, was that cowpox was easily cured but smallpox was not. Since then, dozens of other cases have been found where one disease cures another but all of them were found by accident. Now imagine having an AI program find cures like this and then also using reverse genetics to reduce or eliminate the effects of the second induced disease. This is not something that could be discovered by any researcher in any ethical study but it could be done in hours by an AI program. The benefits, warnings, and threats of AI programs have been discussed for years but it was always off in the future. Now it is here. Now it has been done. It will only explode into the most rapid rate of technological advancement in history and it all started on July 9th, 2019. Below are a few of the 4,710 references I found related to the above referenced research on Google. Text Mining Machines Can Uncover Hidden Scientific Knowledge AI Trained on Old Scientific Papers Makes Discoveries Humans Missed Artificial Intelligence Set Loose On Old Scientific Papers Discovers Something Humans Missed Using unsupervised machine learning to uncover hidden scientific knowledge Machine-learning algorithms can discover new things AI Makes New Scientific Discoveries By Analyzing 3.3 Million Scientific Abstracts - Grata Software Artificial Intelligence Read Old Scientific Papers and Made a Discovery New material promises better solar cells (This is one of many in which computers led researchers to new discoveries but this was a dedicated simulation with a specific goal - unlike the open-ended effort of LBNL.) UPDATE #1: This answer has gotten way more attention than I ever thought possible and a surprising amount of it is negative which is a double surprise. Part of the negative comments come from the LBNL choice to use a rather older version of a software called Word2Vec. I suspect this was done because it was free, open-source and was sufficient for their purposes. Details of the inner workings of the software used and in what form the output was produced are secondary and minor details of what was accomplished. There is no doubt that the AI software did not “read” millions of reports, resolve all the connections and language and then wrote a paper of discovery. However, the software they used did “process” millions of reports, established links and patterns in their content and put out a result that was interpreted as a discovery of an as yet undiscovered thermal electric material. The net effect is the same. Other negative comments were that this research is nothing new and is not important. This may be true from the perspective of the level of sophistication of the software but what I was mostly amazed at is the nature of the application and what it allows in the future. Even in this regard, this is not new. Here is an excerpt from a cosmology meta-study of the Hubble Deep Field image taken in 2009 of what was thought to be a void in space but it turned out to contain over 3,000 galaxies. “In general, the fields of astronomy and cosmology have been getting crowded with many more researchers than there are telescopes and labs to support them. Hundreds of scientists in these fields do nothing but comb through the images and data of past collections to find something worth studying. Combining past studies of images with more recent studies using radio telescopes or looking at this new data from these recent examinations of voids has created whole new sets of raw data that can be examined from dozens of different perspectives to find something that all these extra scientists can use to make a name for themselves.” The connection to my answer is that serious and productive research and even valuable discoveries can be made by reviewing data from previous studies and archives of past research papers. This takes on new meaning when we can obtain the synergistic benefit of thousands or millions of such studies looking for patterns, links, connections or interrelated evidence by thousands of researchers, college students, very small labs and commercial companies with nothing more than some easy to acquire software and a computer. Think about it. The LBNL researchers were experts in AI, software, data analysis and deep learning and yet they discovered what would have been a breakthrough in the field of materials science and thermal conductivity. This was way out of their field of expertise and they were not specifically looking for that result. That strikes me as significant. Imagine every university in the world having such capability with tens of thousands of grad students looking for “something” new and undiscovered using only a computer and access to old archived data. This may not be earth-shaking or a paradigm shift in science but it might be the aeolipile that eventually led to the steam engine. UPDATE #2 For those that keep saying that AI does not write its own code or create new lines of code, may I suggest the following: An AI can now write its own code Developers, rejoice: Now AI can write code for you New A.I. application can write its own code - Futurity Google's AI can create better machine-learning code than the researchers who made it AI learns to write its own code by stealing from other programs Is Self-modifying code the best option for creating 'human-level' AI?

Someone besides me will do just that. ** diversity: I’m a big advocate of diversity, I have only included an AI directed simulation here for a white woman, I can do one for any race, and I should for others, but as of this morning this is what I had. As we begin to explore AI directed modeling/beauty we need to be sensitive to including all races and countries.** Moving Ethics: Humans have defined rules of ethics with different data driven disciplines where peoples lives are impacted. For HR talent screening IO Psychologists have figured out that we have three core ethical imperatives we have to achieve. We must have a model that is predictive of performance (check). We must have a predictive model that doesn’t cause adverse impact (bias towards protected classes, check), and the data consumed must be job related. This was a blog post I wrote a long time ago talking about a new wall AI had torn down: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-4th-prong-hranalytics-ben-taylor-ai-hacker The 4th imperative, that we have not had to consider until now, is the concept of pre-determined destiny. AI, has the power now take something like an EEG:  and create a speechless interview. Now, just by flashing raw job related content at an individual you could use deep-learning and AI to measure their familiarity with the content. You can show a demonstration that satisfies all of our ethical understandings or what is “ok”, and yet we feel very unsettled. This feels wrong. The thing that feels wrong is you are knocking on the door of pre-determined destiny. Did you see the movie Gattaca? This feels wrong, “I’m sorry, you weren’t born with the right brain to work at Google”. This last statement might be true today, but nobody feels like it is. We all think we can study, read, and work our asses off to get anywhere we want to be. We don’t feel like our destinies are decided. Hyper-manipulation The model images I posted above are “fun”, but they also aren’t. They begin to suggest hyper manipulation, in the near future you will be shown ads of fake people designed to maximize your click-through-rate. You personally, your persona. So now you will see a new period of max manipulation. So AI forcing us to constantly revisit what we think is ethical, I think that is very interesting. We will continue to be surprised and redefine what is ok, and what is #blackmirrorish.",2021-03-06T10:06:32.868Z,"What is something really interesting about artificial intelligence? ",Quora

This would be an advantage because it would not be interrupted from its tasks for sleep, as well as other issues that plague biological minds like restroom breaks and eating. Unemotional consideration of problems. While an artificial mind could theoretically have emotions, it would be better for performance if it were programmed for unemotional reasoning. When people make decisions, sometimes those decisions are based on emotion rather than logic. This is not always the best way to make decisions. Easier copying. Once an artificial mind is trained in a task, that mind can then be copied very easily, compared to the training of multiple people for the same task. There are some disadvantages to the artificial mind as well ... Limited sensory input. Compared to a biological mind, an artificial mind is only capable of taking in a small amount of information. This is because of the need for individual input devices. The most important input that we humans take in is the condition of our bodies. Because we feel what is going on with our own bodies, we can maintain them much more efficiently than an artificial mind. At this point, it is unclear whether that would be possible with a computer system. Which leads to another disadvantage ... The inability to heal. Biological systems can heal with time and treatment. For minor conditions, most biological systems can continue normally with only a small drop in performance. Most computer systems, on the other hand, often need to be shut down for maintenance. These are only some basic advantages and disadvantages without getting too technical. I am sure that other answers will vary greatly from mine, but I take an unusual approach to my research.

Using ideas about human intelligence and intelligence more broadly, engineers can create “artificial intelligence,”; that is, impart “human” intelligence into machines or technology (Classical AI) or design technology that can itself “create” intelligence (future AI). In fact, understanding how the brain works—”reverse-engineering the brain”—and understanding how engineers design intelligent machines—machines that replicate human intelligence—is one of the “Grand Challenges of Engineering” as set forth by The National Academy of Engineering (NAE). The implications and benefits of understanding the brain are many. In addition to advances in the treatment of brain injuries and diseases and advancements in communications technology and computer simulations, understanding the brain will allow the design of intelligent machines with even more signicant societal impacts. Already, machines that compute, perform voice or facial recognition, respond to human prompts, and sense and monitor human activity are routine in today’s society. The future capabilities of these machines—the limits and extremes of their “intelligence” and their ability to replicate human thinking—are dependent upon the engineer’s insight into human intelligence and the workings of the human brain. One example of artificial intelligence is computers that try to appear more human in what they can do. (You may have seen “chatterbots” computers that act like humans, on shopping websites like Ikea, for example.) Other important themes in the learning adventure include how articial intelligence fits into the broader scope of technology's human roots and place in human society. For example, (“intelligent”) computers are the result of human invention and are used to further human goals.
