Please forgive me for writing a long answer. Ok. Let’s go back to 2019 or rather I should say the darkest phase of my life. I was in severe depression and the fact is you don’t even realise it. This was an year I came to know about anexiety and panic attacks. I didn’t even knew at the begining that I am getting panic attacks because of my unawareness towards mental health. There were days when I didn’t even managed to sleep even for an hour and then the next day I would go to office and do my work asusual. This cycle continued and ultimately I started to consume alcohol daily just in order to get some amount of sleep which certainly worked in the begining but later it also didn’t helped me. I didn’t knew what was happening with me. I didn’t had any close friends back then whom I could have shared this with. The single person whom I could have trusted was my girlfriend with whom I beleived that I share strong bond but I was wrong. She betrayed/cheated me, I was always being judged by her. She even body shamed me because of my weight and even looks. Not only that, I was being judged financially too because I am just a mediocre Engineer. There were other things also which happened between us but I would not go into that. All these issues led to frequent illness, more liquor consumption, chain smoking, less interaction with other folks. I once even tried to give hint in front of some of my friends but they tried to make fun out of it. Trust me its so hard to control your emotions as a man and showing a happy face to world while inside its killing you. I can remember, I used to go in my bathroom just to cry so that my other flatmates can’t see and thought may be crying will releive something off my chest. Now things became more serious and I used to get attacks at office too. I consulted experts, got medicines to get things under controlled. There comes a time in your life when you realize that only you can save yourself. And I reached this point of my life at the begining of 2020. Things which changed my life in 2020: I started working out, lost 21 kgs in 2–3 months. Started to eat healthy food.I quitted smoking, haven’t touched a ciggarette since January 1.Started doing meditation which certainly provides mental strength and peace.Performed exceptionally well at office, received outstanding feedback.Absence of toxic people in life, again mental peace.Learnt Cooking, thanks to pandemic.Learnt several tech related things.Met some fantastic people coincidently and talked about the mental health and became good friends now.Realised how people suddenly change and betrays your trust. Trust nobody except your family. Nobody is going to stay with you permamently except your family. Have started living for them.Seeing Mom and Dad daily while doing work from home, again thanks to pandemic.Being an active listener for people who are in need just like I was an year ago.This is how 2020 has been treating me till now. May god give all of you, the strength to fight and deal with whatever bad things going inside you. Stay healthy, stay happy. Thanks. Yes, 2020 has been a life-changing year for me. Wanna know why?

The problem is, Amazon has opened up their platform allowing third parties to sell there, but they do not want to be used as a way of sending traffic to other websites (taking business away from them). It is against Amazon terms of service to include marketing materials such as brochures etc. when you ship a customer their order. Technically you can try doing this anyway, hoping no customer will complain or mention it in a review, hoping that Amazon will not do a test order (I am unsure if this happens but you never know), and hoping a competitor seller on Amazon does not find out and complain so that Amazon gives you the boot. You run the risk of having your account shut down by doing this, so it depends on your comfort level. What I would do is include an invoice with each order including your contact information and logo, and in that contact information include the URL. A small company I work with has not run into problems with that (yet.) If possible, I would suggest making your username on Amazon your website name. For example, if your username is “mystore”, if a customer wanted to find you they would probably try visiting mystore .com. In your about us, keep mentioning mystore so customers get to know your brand’s name. An email list for a newsletter is not a bad idea, but technically it should be opt-in (for spam laws). If you spam a customer and they get angry and complain to Amazon that could risk your account too. I would avoid doing this through Amazon’s messaging system but maybe after you ship their order you can email them saying did you get your order ok, how is everything, by the way do you want to join our newsletter for news, information, discounts, and contests. Disclaimer: I can’t remember offhand if this was addressed in Amazon’s TOS so you may want to check that! I understand why you would want to use Amazon as a way to send customers to your site, gaining site traffic and saving Amazon fees, but having sales in both places can be an advantage. If your Amazon account keeps running, it can be a continuous source of new customers since many people search for a product there first and many people trust Amazon’s system over a random website. It can also be good extra exposure for your brand if your Amazon store or listing comes up in a Google search (especially over anything negative). My advice is to not get greedy and obey Amazon’s TOS and once a customer is aware of you and has a good experience they may just go directly to your website next time.

Duplicate ideas: In the Indian startup ecosystem, there are only a few people who are actually working on innovative ideas, the majority is only working on previous ideas which have gained momentum in either the valley or India. Doing so spoils the market for really groundbreaking ideas, as the former get easy access to VC funds because of the availability of data from the markets in which they were successful. However, now it is being seen that success in the valley won’t necessarily translate into success in the Indian startup ecosystem too. Like a slew of food delivery startups have either closed their shops or got acquired by larger players to sustain in this ecosystem.Campus ambassadors program: It is also been seen that startups employ a campus ambassadors program who in turn get their targets and force people to download the app for which in turn they get paid. This strategy might seem very lucrative in the short run as the number of app downloads increase data wise, but a very huge number of people downloaded the app just because of the friendship and will soon uninstall that app and will never use it.Over marketing: What I mean when I use this product is that, every startup has a business cycle. The founders tend to spend a lot of money on marketing when their startup is still in its inception or in its making, thus draining all their funds at the initial stage of the business cycle and not saving much money for marketing when their product is actually ready and when the marketing will give them ROI.Not focusing on consistency while doing Social Media Marketing(SMM): In any SMM, consistency is the key to get momentum around the brand and get people to actually start noticing it. However, a majority of startups in the Indian ecosystem, completely ignore this fact and post as per their own whims and fancies which completely defeats the objective of SMM.Distribution of content: Almost all the startups have a blog page through which they provide value to their prospective users in various forms. However, the majority fail to use that section effectively as no sharing of that blogs happens and even if it happens its rarely done as to gain attention. Like, suppose there is a startup which provides services to singles in finding a house in a particular city. Now sharing their blog posts on flat seekers groups on Facebook will provide them with way more attention than randomly sharing it on every platform.These are some of the major things which I feel need fixing, do add - rebut in comments.
