In a literal sense, yes. In a more metaphorical way, not really. Allow me to explain. Professional photographers existed long before Photoshop, so it’s very possible to make a living without it.

In a literal sense, yes. In a more metaphorical way, not really. Allow me to explain. Professional photographers existed long before Photoshop, so it’s very possible to make a living without it. But even back then, they were manipulating the process to produce the best prints possible. This was akin to Photoshop. I don’t know if it’s possible for professional photography to exist as a genre without manipulation capabilities of some kind, but I also know photographers whose work is primarily given directly to the client at the end of the shoot. In that sense, the photographer doesn’t do any manipulation because the client handles everything. This is generally what’s known as Work for Hire (WFH) and is a perfectly acceptable way of making a living. I’m not a great retoucher, myself, so I enjoy the idea of handing off that sort of thing to the client any chance I can get. But photo manipulation still exists, even if I’m not always the one doing it. Could clients make a living without it? I’m not sure. It would be a different world if no photo manipulation existed at all (either manual darkroom manipulation or digital Photoshop-style). Images always need to be cropped and color corrected for the various mediums in which they’re reproduced. I don’t see a way to get around that. Dodging and burning is generally considered the most basic of manipulations and will probably be around forever. But do we need compositing and higher-level manipulative capabilities? Not in a strict sense, no, but certainly in the sense that clients need to push the envelope at all time since viewers have grown increasingly accustomed to high-quality images and production values. In the end, I think the answer to your question depends on whether you’re asking academically or realistically. Academically, yes—we can live without manipulation. Realistically, I don’t think it will happen, nor would I want it to.",2021-03-05T14:06:14.146Z,"Is it possible for a photographer to have a successful professional career without the use of photo editing softwares?

Relevant master's degree programs are also available for those seeking advancement opportunities; they might lead to positions such as photography department supervisor or editorial chief.Photo editors often work for a website, newspaper, magazine or book publisher. They're typically responsible for selecting, editing, positioning and publishing photos to accompany the text of a publication. Photo editors also might supervise staff photographers, give photo assignments and make sure that others complete their work on time.Video editors train and educate themselves in any number of ways. Some apprentice at production studios and post houses, while others enter educational programs at local community colleges or at prestigious academic institutions. Two leading examples of the latter would include NYU's Tisch School of the Arts and UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television. Still others turn autodidact and teach themselves the skills necessary to be a video editor. These individuals then continue in the profession as freelancers, at post houses or as members of corporations.  With the rise of so-called 'prosumer' hardware and software and the availability of any number of excellent books on video editing, it has never been easier or less expensive to learn advanced video editing techniques. Of course, the contacts one makes as part of a structured training program, either as a tradesman or as an undergraduate, will likely prove crucial in establishing oneself in the profession. Nevertheless, one can certainly develop the pure skill and knowledge necessary to be a successful video editor at home, with a minimum financial investment.Contemporary video editors must also be masters of a number of computer programs and hardware apparatus, including Avid's Media Composer, Express DV and Xpress Pro, Apple's Final Cut Pro and QuickTime and Adobe's Premiere Pro and After Effects. While video editors frequently belong to many of the same unions and guilds as other entertainment professionals, the organizations most directly concerned with income, labor issues and best practices of video editors are Motion Picture Editors Guild (MPEG), NABET (Welcome To NABET 211 Syracuse NY Quality Television) and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars.org | Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences).

Kid, who would read day and night to maintain his first position in every next class. He had been a topper since LKG.    He was such a brilliant child. My eldest brother owns this school and I did my schooling from the same.  When I was in school, I also used to take classes if any teacher was absent. Bhaisaab (principal sir) would generally ask me to teach primary class students and there he was, Aftab. I would find the students ecstatic to see me in their class but it was Aftab who would be on cloud line. He would quickly open his bag to hand me over the stick kept in(since he was the monitor of the class) and he would clean the blackboard smiling beautifully and then he would write the date on the blackboard. Then I would ask the students what the teacher had teaching and what they wanted to be taught. Everyone would call me ""Sirji"". Sometimes he Would inadvertently utter word "" Chacha(uncle) "" and at once would show up his tongue, frightened, saying sorry. Other student would laugh at him, so would I. While leaving the class, he would accompany me to the door used to say ""Chacha, dubara aa jayo"" (Chacha, come again). He was Smart like anything. Still I don't know what happened to him, he suddenly fell sick. I was in Delhi and I thought he was just having a mild fever until I discovered that some diseases had left him paralyzed. I called Arshad bhaiya to know if he was doing okay. He told me that aftab was at home.They took him to a nearby doctor. The date was 7th March, I guess, I had a few words with Aftab also. I felt he would recover soon. But his health began to deteriorate quite seriously.They rushed him off to the only government hospital in my district. Still, I would reckon that he would recover soon. I had no clue how serious the condition was. I had some work to deal with regarding fee concession application in college so I couldn't call Arshad bhaiya day after. On 10th of march, in the morning, I got a call from home just to discover that we had lost him. From Nuh,They had referred him to SMS hospital in Jaipur but we lost him before we could reach Jaipur. I was stunned, shocked, numb completely. I couldn't believe my ears. It was heart wrenching. Suddenly, all the memories started flashing in front of my eyes. I could hear his sweet voice in my head. I couldn't resist crying. I wished it to be a dream. I was broken. I just cried and cried. I remember someone was trying to console me, they were my friends there. I didn't remember anything clearly of that moment except screaming. I had to rush back home. To the graveyards, procession filled the streets,majority being our school students and his best friends. It was impossible to believe that he was dead. There was something that separates him from other kids in my family. He had a bicycle, his best friend. He would clean it every ride. Every time I visited home, I saw him playing or reading. He would come to me saying ""Thik hai Chacha? "" (Are u fine,Uncle? ) and then gave me candies he always used to carry. He would spend most of his day playing, roaming with his school friends on bicycle. But he would just study in the night. He was so energetic kid. He won't sleep until his homework is done.  ￼   He would always come to cheer me up whenever I play cricket in the village.  My eyes are teary while writing this. This question in the feed just reminded me of Aftab. We just miss him. We know he is still with us in our spirit. We have been trying to overcome the pain. Trying to overcome something that is stuck in our chests. But this emptiness would never go away.  Aftab, with his best friend, Parvez( My nephew, his cousin).

There are three reasons why we provide color correction services, Lighting: Lighting happens to be one of the most important aspects, every time you click a picture. But the challenge is that even the slightest of inconsistency in the camera setting or the environment you are shooting in, has the potential to cause the picture come out below expectation. At times the white balance setting used to take the picture is not an appropriate match for the lighting in the shot. Color Temperature Control: You would not disagree to the chances of you getting wrong outcome for particular settings, even after using auto white balance features. Color correction is one more an aspect, of the color correction services that we as professional image editing service providers deliver. White Balance in Portraits: Needless to draw your attention to the fact that outdoor lighting is not the only thing that affects the color changes. If we talk about portrait photography, the color/pigment of a person’s skin leaves behind a huge impact on the outcome, the resulting image or picture. As a photographer do not have the luxury of spending hours performing image editing tasks such as color correction and so on.

I had just regained consciousness after being under general anesthesia for a surgery, which thankfully, was a complete success. Despite my carefree smile and that little victory symbol you see in that photo, I was broken on the inside. I was scared and I was in pain. I had no idea how long it would to take me to recuperate. I was also worried about my campus placements, as they were supposed to start a few months later and I had done pretty much… zero preparation. It almost felt like fate had played a cruel joke on me. However, I knew that there was no turning point then. I could either hide from destiny and curse my luck for ruining my future, or, give my best shot. I chose the latter. The next three months felt like an eternity. Everyday, I had to undergo intense sickening pain in order to get my wounds dressed. Simple tasks like walking, sitting and sleeping had become a challenge. I had to lie on my stomach for hours on end, studying like a fanatic. There were moments when I felt like breaking down but my family’s constant support couple with my own stubbornness to get out of the misery sailed me through those arduous times.  This was taken a couple of weeks ago.  One year later and I am probably the most content, if not the most happy, I have ever been in my life. I bagged 2 offers of 7+ LPA package and scored the best GPA in the past 2 semesters. I was able to work on various projects and I am now pursuing my hobbies head-on. Also, I managed to give myself a haircut, twice. Although I have hardly tasted success, I have gained a liking for it.  These photos remind me that no matter how bad things are, they will change, if you are willing to do so. There’s no stopping once you’ve promised yourself to alter your fate. It took me a lot of courage to share my story here but I hope that my small victory makes a difference in your life, for the better.",2021-03-05T14:17:08.576Z,"What are your favorite before and after photos?

First, figure out what you want to do in post processing.  Are you looking to make prints or do you just want to touch up your pictures before you put them onto Instagram?  In either case, are the changes you would like to make based on lighting, contrast (the range of light intensity from shadow to bright highlights) or color balance or are you wanting to be able to crop (move one or more edge of the frame of the photo inward) your pictures? Most simple photo editing apps can handle these sorts of changes.  Exposure, contrast and color balance are usually done automatically in these simple apps and so you are stuck with what the app developer thought was a good result, mostly.  Almost all will allow you to crop your pictures.   There are a lot of cheap-to-free photo editing apps, most with some quirky feature meant to make them stand out.  Try a few until you come across one that delivers what you are looking for. If you ever want to graduate from novice to knowledgeable, then you'll need to make the larger step of going for a full-feature post-processing application like GIMP, Photoshop or Light Room.  These are software suites, not just apps, so their creators assume a certain level of base knowledge on the part of their users.  They aren't exactly unfriendly so much as they are a bit difficult to get to know unless you are willing to learn how digital photography works.  Once you do, you find all the nitpicking and obtuse terminology becomes very friendly and useful. So, if you are at a point where you want to buy a camera that allows full manual control and you want to bring out the full potential of the images it creates, first learn how to use the camera and then sit down and search the web for introductory articles about post processing in general.  Gather a list of potential candidates that fit your budget and look closer.  Once you think one seems like it ought to be right for you, seek out beginner tutorials.  The Adobe products tend to have professionally produced tutorials that are free.  You can also buy tutorial packages for just about any product, both those that are made by the creators of the products and those that are made by knowledgeable users.",2021-03-05T14:17:57.751Z,"What is the best photo editing program for a beginner?

The question for most photographers is how do they choose the right editing software to supplement their skills. There are countless different options out there to choose from, from better-known systems like Photoshop and Adobe to simple but effective choices like Canva. There’s even some great free options. In today’s post we’re going to answer the question “What is the best photo editing software for photographers?” by looking at: The top-rated software on the market (free and paid)The features of each toolHow you can use the softwareLet’s get started! professional photo editing services for photographers Why Should You Edit Your Photos? Editing your photos not only brings out their beauty, but it also helps in reducing the file size, so your WordPress site will be fast and your search engine rankings will improve. Having an intuitive and easy to use photo editing software can help you edit your photos quickly and take them to the next level. Let’s take a look at some of the best photo editing software available online. 1. Adobe Lightroom  Adobe is truly the gold-standard when it comes to image editing software. If Photoshop comes off as too complex and cumbersome, then you’re sure to love all the incredible things that you can accomplish with Adobe Lightroom. Lightroom allows you to edit your pics in a straightforward intuitive interface with a host of fantastic features, including: Face detection for photo organizationCamera and lens based correctionsBrush and gradient adjustmentsFixing and blurring toolsPresets and professional filtersCustomizable slidersMultiple device support and syncYou can get Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop together for $9.99/mo here in Adobe’s Creative Cloud Plan.

Skylum Luminar  Luminar has quickly grown to become one of the the most popular editing tools for professional photographers around the world for many reasons.

Adobe Photoshop  It’s hard to write an article about the best photo editing software for photographers without giving Adobe Photoshop a well-deserved mention. Photoshop is the go-to tool for illustrators, designers, and artists around the world. Photoshop’s masking, retouching and layering tools are still some of the most compelling on the market, though it’s fair to say that this tool might not be best for the odd “basic” touchup (that would be best left for Lightroom). Photoshop is designed for professionals that need all the bells and whistles. If Lightroom is a jeep, Photoshop is a military Hummer. Features include: Sophisticated touch-up and retouch featuresLarge amount of filters and brushesMulti-layer editing3D design functionalityPro editing toolsBest-known photography softwareYou can get Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop together for $9.99/mo here in Adobe’s Creative Cloud Plan.

I pointed out books like Fifty shades of Gray because it's more about “ How can you do sex involving belts and such other stuff” and less about LOVE . I don't think that's necessary to read or to watch. I'm not saying that you should stop watching such kind of stuff totally. It's your personal choice. What am saying is reading our epics can shape you as a better person . It's important to read such epic mythologies of our culture . Ignoring such books and getting addicted to such fiction books is not going to be productive. Edit 2 : Few people are misunderstanding my answer, especially the inspiration and twerking ones. So let me clear this out. I know everyone has their personal choice. They can learn twerking if they want to. But what am saying is putting aside our culture and following the western foot steps is becoming more now a days. Secondly , you can follow Salman khan , fine but don't you want to know about Subhash Chandra Bose who strived for our independence? He is very well educated , fought for our country and a lot of things. You will get to know about him if u have read about him.You can talk anything and everything about a film actor but when it comes to freedom fighters you become mum. I have been to Japan and a lot of people were showing interest in our traditional dances but we are ignoring it completely. You want to popularize and follow Western culture but demean and ignore our culture ? My whole Intension to write those points is to respect and save our culture from diminishing.

By observing life’s experiences around us and careful reflection of what we observe, we can gather facts and information to learn new solutions and methods. Increase your ability to ‘connect the dots’ around you. Take notes and revisit them often. Embrace the mess of complex learning. In this new world of continuous learning, we are all teachers as well as learners. We realize learning is often an ugly task. Accept that the process of trial and error is an acceptable learning process. And watch carefully what others are learning all around you in both the business and personal environment. Look for novelty Their brains pay more attention to things in the environment that are new to our experience. So, seek out as many new experiences to try as you can handle and become an explorer.

He understood the complexities of the world today required imagination for the discovery of new ideas and solutions. Imagination requires lots of practice; it doesn’t just happen on its own. So start working on this skill to add it to improve your learning. Embrace change and contrast People learn new things best when they are in contrast to other information in the environment or to things that are in contrast to previous experiences. To improve learning, work on your experience of change … study trends and study changes going on around you. Step out into the unknown as often as you can. Understand the meaning In learning, we respond best when we determine things are that are most meaningful. Find the meanings that provide that which motivates us to dig deeper. Connect and collaborate Connecting with others in the internet world is a great way to share ideas and solicit feedback, new views, and ideas. Once you have found some interesting connections who share like goals, try a collaboration project or two. Collaboration is an excellent way to expand learning in a sharing environment.

Trust me, its not “more things to learn and/or a burden” it'd just make your life easier. You would need Photoshop for making design mock-ups for web/mobile veiwing, for making posters and product design. You would need illustrator for designing logos, icons, for typography, for t-shirt graphics and such. You would need InDesign for making designs that are specifically for print purposes. InDesign comes with a lot of tools that ensures the perfect output for print, something with only Photoshop cannot ensure.

You can be the perfect all rounder. Take initiatives in everything. Be it academic, cultural or social. I was in a tier 3 college [Long story of how I ended up here] and there wasn’t much going around. The normal things for me were achievements for most of my class. I realized this after our first round of exams where I studied like I always did and ended up being the topper of our whole batch. I’ve never got any ranks throughout my school and here I was a topper amongst over 300 people. The attention I got was overwhelming. The teachers used to take my name as an example when they used to scold the class. And when the fresher’s party and the fests came, I showed everyone the creative side of me. I played my keyboard and even participated in a fashion show. Everyone in my batch knew about me now. Even seniors used to come and approach me. I was one of the “cool kids”. In my first year, I had connections till final year in my college. Even though I was in depression, my college life was certainly a breeze thereafter. Teachers literally used to call me out of the class and chat with me in their respective labs. I had more teacher friends than students and that did give me special privileges. Like, I never had to worry about attendance.  Do not isolate yourself.As I mentioned, I was in a tier 3 college. I was not happy at all. I was the best around and there was barely any competition. And as they say: “If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.” Even though I was popular, my personal and social life was crumbling. I used to talk with everyone but mostly used to stay on my own. I never let anyone be my friend. I even used to have most of my lunches alone. That was one the major reasons why the teachers used to pamper me. I soon realized that this isn’t a healthy way to live. I thought to myself - Now that I’m stuck in this place for another 3 years, I will make the most of it. Since my 2nd year, I started being more receptive and let more people in. YOU DO NEED A SUPPORT SYSTEM. No matter how much you consider yourself as a lone wolf, in a storm, the pack survives and the lone wolf dies. I had two close friends now and that was more than enough. I still stayed alone at times but that was for solitude and not because of loneliness or despise.  Do not take pangas with your staff.My friend was failed in a practical exam twice because he had an argument with the professor. Most of the professors have a sensitive ego and if you are not careful with that then they can make your life a living hell. I have known people who were failed for two consecutive years just for one subject. Just cause they were not adaptable to the professor’s needs. I will say that, treat your professors like a high maintenance girlfriend and it will be fruitful af. I remember, I forgot my assignment file during one of our final practicals. That is the only thing that is checked except for your practical performance. AND I FORGOT IT AT HOME. But since I was good with teachers, they convinced the external that I’m an exceptional student and this should be pardoned. I have never seen that before. I got 45 out of 50 in that practical exam.  Do not drop out after your second year is over.Okay, your first year was full of general subjects and you entered your core stream in the second year. Now you are realizing that this field is not meant for you? Are you stuck in that dilemma? I can relate with you. I was exactly in the same position. I was studying something in which I was surely good at but definitely not where my interest lied. I contemplated so much to drop out and start afresh in some other course. But that would mean that two years of your life just went down the drain. Instead, be optimistic and see that 50% of the struggle is already over. Just a couple more years and you are out of here! :) You don’t need to focus on scoring. As long as you’re getting above 60%, everything’s chill. You can spend majority of your time in exploring new things. Learn about different fields, get an internship, start an online course or even a business. There are plenty of things you can do. I started my websites during this phase and now I’m flexible enough to choose if I wanna pursue it full time or get a regular job. I have that choice. And I have rejected companies. This is only because I didn’t give up and explored.  Do not focus ONLY on academics.Yes, studies is cool but personality has equal weightage. I have been to plenty of job interviews and they do not care how much you are scoring. The biggest companies of India have 60% as their minimum criteria for being eligible for job interviews. THAT'S IT! 60% ONLY! That can land you the interview but converting it into a job? That’s all your knowledge and personality. Groom yourself well. Both physically and mentally. Get new hobbies. Talk to new people. There are plenty of things that you can do apart from just studying and playing video games all day! EDIT; Do not take this 60% thing into consideration if you are planning for masters or further studies. Marks will matter over there.  Do not waste all of your time pursuing the opposite gender.If you find someone worthy then it’s great. Stay with him/her and dominate together. But do not waste your time in pursuing different people just cause you are horny and lonely all the time. You will just feel hollow from the inside after everything’s said and done. At least that’s what I felt. To each person their own.  Do not waste all of your time in “recreational” activities.This is an obvious. Try everything but don’t be an addict. Do it once, see how it feels like and then never do it again. Or do it socially if it’s mild stuff like alcohol. But follow these two rules strictly: NEVER DRINK WHEN YOU ARE ALONE.NEVER DRINK WHEN YOU ARE SAD.That’s how addicts are made. Follow there rules and you are safe. (As much as I can keep you)  Lastly, do not settle for mediocrity.So what if you didn’t get into the place where you wanted. You can’t change that now.

Sourav Ganguly When the going gets Tough, The Tough gets going. Just when Team India was morally down due to match fixing issues and other problems, Sourav took the mantle as the Skipper Of the Indian Team and resurrected the Indian Team into a Renegade Fighting Machine. Then the team grouped together and conquered the opponents in their own soil.  Sachin Tendulkar It’s not about the 100 centuries, Numerous Records, First Player to Score 200 in ODI, Tons of Awards and much more accolades. It was always the passion, love and respect for the game called Cricket for which he reigned and will always be the Ultimate God.  Jonty Rhodes The legend who showed the world the importance of Fielding in the game which was being ruled by Bat and Ball. Till then Jonty has been considered as one of the best fielders in cricket and been an inspiration for all budding and emerging cricketers.  Virat Kohli Leave Out All those aggressive roars and celebrations from Virat as it is not his hobby, but his Habit since in the last few months he has been making and breaking records with now being crowned as the Captain Of Team India in All 3 Formats. But this picture shows that how much he loves the game and it’s God. Many comparisons have been drawn parallel for Virat and Sachin, but nonetheless they are different. He is not the next Sachin,but the first Virat “King” Kohli.  Rahul Dravid He is not Sachin, Ganguly, Laxman or Sehwag, but the invincible and unparalleled Rahul Dravid. A Complete Player who never chased Records, but Records chased him whenever he scored a century in all the test playing nations around the world. This picture is special because this is one where The WALL scored his first century at the Lord’s, England in 2011. A complete test cricketer who could stop and ground the ball to the pitch which would come at more than 140 KMPH.  Mike Hussey One of the Greatest Dark Horses of Australian Cricket. He might not be a holder of big records, but holds a special place in hearts of cricket lovers as Mr.Cricket. This picture is when Aussies beat Pakistan in the semi-final match in 2010 World Cup T20 where Mike Hussey brought victory for the Aussies from a No-Win situation.  Dale Steyn The South African Speedster just cannot be missed, his aggressive celebration after a wicket is always a visual treat. When his deliveries strike the ball, stumps break and fly around.  Brian Lara Behold and Bow down the King from West Indies.501* and 400 in First Class and Test Cricket, a record which is yet to be broken in the cricketing fraternity. The Game misses this legend.  Virender Sehwag This is the picture of Sehwag blasting Saqlain Mushtaq to reach the 300 mark. This was done after discussing with the God at the other end. The batsman who showed complete fearlessness when coming to hard hitting and smashing hundreds all over the best bowling attacks in the world. Now his fiery run of Fun and Frolic is the happening buzz in Twitter.  Yuvraj Singh MSD might have sealed victory for India in World Cup 2011, But Yuvraj Singh played a major role in the same with the bat and ball. This picture shows the enormous amount of joy, happiness and emotions tearing down from Yuvraj when he knows that the task has been completed and goal reached. He played for his country when his life was stake knowing the unknown to come in the later years, but Champions never quit, sometimes they just stay low to regain momentum. That’s what Yuvraj Singh is all about.  M.S.Dhoni This is a Portrait to be preserved in the Hall Of Fame of Cricket in my opinion. Nothing better than this picture could describe MSD. That One Sixer from MSD will echo in eternity forever.  Note : More Pics will be added soon.

Various factors such as personal time commitments, budget, how far and deep you want to explore the particular discipline or practice—are but a few. If you are aiming to improve your photo editing skills by adding Photoshop (and by logical extension, Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom workflows) to your toolbelt, then a formal classroom or e-learning lesson-by-lesson instruction regimen is really hard to beat.

Various factors such as personal time commitments, budget, how far and deep you want to explore the particular discipline or practice—are but a few. If you are aiming to improve your photo editing skills by adding Photoshop (and by logical extension, Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom workflows) to your toolbelt, then a formal classroom or e-learning lesson-by-lesson instruction regimen is really hard to beat. Check with your local community college or design programs. Also, seek out local meetups, groups or better yet make one on Meetup for yourself and invite others who want to co-learn along side you. A classroom setting doesn’t need to be in a classroom. You can make it virtual. A big benefit to learning a program (i.e. Photoshop) There are other well known and obvious alternatives, depending on time/budget and most of all—how it is that you best learn. Some people love to learn by looking at others ‘doing something’ and then repeating or ‘doing’ that same tactile action. If this method of learning by repetition works for you, then I would suggest taking online video classes and following along with instructors, classmates, from a lesson syllabus and textbook. This type of learning environment tends to build and scaffold really well on ever more complex skills that you learn step-by-step in order to perform more complex operations in Photoshop as you produce more challenging work/exercises. Practical answer: You can, of course, autodidact it and hop online to myriad and vast resources, communities and leaning learning/sharing platforms specifically geared to Photoshop. This way, you can learn when, how and for how long you desire. Online stuff is great for working schedules, day jobs and if you just want to add this as a side gig or a hobby. Before doing any of that, the first and most logical resource place to visit is the Adobe Photoshop Learn & Support: Adobe Photoshop Learn & Support and READ it ALL if you can. Bookmark resources Other great online resources (again, depending on budget) for teaching yourself Photoshop (editing, document/layer management, photo compositing, color correction, and beyond) include: Learn Adobe Photoshop - Envato Tuts+ Design & Illustration Tutorials Photoshop - Online Courses, Classes, Training, Tutorials on Lynda Adobe Photoshop Tutorials And Classes | Skillshare (So many great teachers and classes on Skillshare, depending on how you want to use Photoshop/your overall area of focus) Check out Meg Lewis: Meg Lewis - Skillshare Adobe® Photoshop® CC: The Complete Guide with Ben Willmore | CreativeLive The #1 Photoshop, Lightroom, and Photography Tutorials Website Online YouTube: PHLEARN Justin Odisho Photoshop Tutorials https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-oYkx9wyeGc6Sh8tkVlaTw These are just a few of the literally thousands of online resources you can access to learn Photoshop. A word about search: be specific and needle-point focused in your search terms. I would also highly encourage detailed tutorial searches specifically within YouTube. Mistake-making and learning by fixing your files and following along with videos in one of the more time consuming but highly rewarding ways to learn. Plus you can save your files with a layer dedicated to referencing the specific URL for that tutorial. For example, if you get stuck or lost on a particular tool, function or aspect workflow within Photoshop, or you are trying to accomplish say, editing portrait blemishes, or how to fix flyaway hairs or how to do HDR skies for wedding announcement portraits—whatever the specific tool or nuanced situation, just type that into your search and something relevant will certainly come up. Be sure to check if the YouTube channel is subscribable and if it has a decently high number of views and thumbs up. This is a good way to tell if you have hit on a good tutorial relative and relevant to your needs. Know this—Photoshop has been around since the 1980s and it has built up a huge community of makers, creators, sharers, artists, digital product designers, photo editors, mentors and third-party product makers for things like scripts, plugins, artist packs and more. Seek them out, again relative to your specific needs and pursuits within Photoshop. Finally: if you are a book learner, there are Books! There are so many great books for learning Photoshop. Don’t overlook them, no matter how tedious you find reading and following along in your program. Among the better ones I have learned from: Adobe Photoshop CC–Visual Quickstart Guides from Peachpit Press/Pearson: Photoshop CC: Visual QuickStart Guide Adobe Photoshop–Classroom in a Book 2018 Release. This is also from Pearson, but is the sanctioned Adobe Photoshop CC Learning guide: Adobe Photoshop CC Classroom in a Book (2018 release) Adobe Photoshop CC for Photographers 2018: Amazon.com: Adobe Photoshop CC for Photographers 2018 (9781138086760): Martin Evening: Books Before buying them on Amazon or whatever, head to your local public library! Look in the Graphic Design or Reference/Self-Help sections where you can find numerous books on teaching yourself any level of Photoshop. Free!

There are a few different things you need for a photo-editing monitor. We’ve compiled a list of the best monitors for your editing and answered a few of your questions about what you might need to get the monitor of your dreams. Let’s take a look. How to choose a monitor for Photo Editing Color Gamut Standard color isn’t enough. Most monitors now offer 100% coverage for the original color gamut, sRGB, but you’re looking for a monitor with something more. Look for at least 99% of Adobe’s RGB, and preferably a spectrum that includes REC 709 and DCI-P3 gamuts. It also needs to be able to pull at least 16.7 million colors with 8-bit display though if you can, move that up to 10-bit which handles well over a billion colors. Your calibration should include at least an 8-bit look-up table. You need a DisplayPort so that you can make full use of your 4k HD. Otherwise, you’re losing resolution through your connections Resolution and Size It’s a good idea to go ahead and embrace 4k. This gives you a full HD resolution since you’re probably shooting with at least 20 megapixels. You should also go for a screen with more considerable real estate so you can view dual programs within the display itself though this can also be accomplished with a second monitor. Embedded Calibration You should be able to calibrate the colors on your monitor from time to time. The easiest way is if the monitor comes with its own internal calibration settings. Most monitors with this capability come with a color spectrum that drapes over the display to help you adjust for true to life color. If it doesn’t, you’ll want to make sure the monitor is factory calibrated and that you purchase a standardizer of your own.

Because I know that this idea for reinventing myself has worked over and over for me. Because I knew I would need guidelines to look at when I was most scared. Because for the next 60 years I will reinvent myself many times. Since I first worked on these ideas, I’ve seen many things happen. I’ve seen these guidelines work for others. And I’ve seen them working for me again. And I’ve interviewed 100s of others to see how they reinvented themselves. Because I was curious. Any advice it seems I give is really just me saying my autobiography. Here are the rules: I’ve been at zero a few times, come back a few times, and done it over and over. I’ve started entire new careers. People who knew me then, don’t know me now. And so on. I’ve had to change careers 15 times. Sometimes because my interests changed. Sometimes because all bridges have been burnt beyond recognition, sometimes because I desperately needed money. And sometimes just because I hated everyone in my old career or they hated me. Sometimes because I fell in love. Love is a map that changes. There’s other ways to reinvent yourself. Take what I say with a grain of salt. This is what worked for me. Now that I’ve interviewed 100s of people for my podcast, I’ve also seen what reinvention looks like at every stage of life, in every career, in every part of the process of well-being, which is hopefully my goal. A) REINVENTION NEVER STOPS Every day you reinvent yourself. You’re always in motion. But you decide every day: forward or backward. B) YOU START FROM SCRATCH Every label you claim you have from before is just vanity. You were a doctor? You were ivy league? You had millions? You had a family? Nobody cares. You lost everything. You’re a zero. Don’t try to say you’re anything else. B1) SURRENDER Don’t regret the storm that left you deserted here. Don’t be anxious about the life in front of you, although it’s hard. Surrender to the current moment. Serve the moment. It’s the only master you need to listen to. C) YOU NEED A MENTOR Else, you’ll sink to the bottom. Someone has to show you how to move and breathe. But don’t worry about finding a mentor (see below). D) THREE TYPES OF MENTORS – Direct. Someone who is in front of you who will show you how they did it. What is “it”? Wait. By the way, mentors aren’t like that old Chinese guy in “The Karate Kid”. Ultimately most mentors will hate you. – Indirect. Books. Movies. You can outsource 90% of mentorship to books and other materials. 200-500 books equals one good mentor. People ask me, “what is a good book to read” and I never know the answer. There’s 200-500 good books to read. I would throw in inspirational books. Whatever are your beliefs, underline them through reading every day. – Everything is a mentor. If you are a zero, and have passion for reinvention, then everything you look at will be a metaphor for what you want to do. Don’t be stuck inside of yourself. Look at everything. See what it has to offer. Even if it is nothing, that’s something. E) DON’T WORRY IF YOU DON’T KNOW YOUR PASSION You have passion for your health. Start there. Take baby steps. You don’t need a passion to succeed. Do what you do with love and success is a natural symptom. When I love, I’m happy. When I debate, and wonder, and want, and control, and believe, I’m not as happy. F) TIME IT TAKES TO REINVENT: FIVE YEARS Since I first wrote this I’ve probably seen 500 examples of this. All the same: five years. Here’s a description of the five years: Year One: you’re flailing and reading everything and just starting to DO. Year Two: you know who you need to talk to and network with. You’re Doing every day. You finally know what the monopoly board looks like in your new endeavors. Year Three: you’re good enough to start making money. It might not be a living yet. Year Four: you’re making a good living Year Five: you’re making wealth Sometimes I get frustrated in years 1-4. I say, “why isn’t it happening yet?” and I punch the floor and hurt my hand and throw a coconut on the floor in a weird ritual. That’s ok. Just keep going. Or stop and pick a new field. Changing is never bad. It means you learned enough from one thing and now you are ready for the next. Life is not made of consistency. That’s how you die one day at a time. Life is made of changes, memories, and evil plans, and the pleasure that comes from freedom. It doesn’t matter. Eventually you’re dead and then it’s hard to reinvent yourself. G) IT DOESN’T TAKE LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS AND IT WON’T TAKE LESS Many people look for life hacks. That’s fine. But there are no shortcuts. People ask, “if you can tell yourself at 20 what to do, what would you say?” I would say, “age until you are my age and that’s ok and then you will know the answer.” H) IT’S NOT ABOUT MONEY But money is a decent measuring stick. When people say “it’s not about the money” often they are really saying, “I’m really scared it’s ALL about the money.” “What about just doing what you love?” they say. There will be many days where you don’t love what you are doing. If you are doing it just for love then it will take much much longer than five years. Happiness is just a positive perception from our brain. Some days you will be unhappy. Our brain is a tool we use. It’s not who we are. I) WHEN CAN YOU SAY, “I AM AN X!” WHERE “X” IS YOUR NEW CAREER? Today. J) WHEN CAN I START DOING X? Today. If you want to paint, then today buy a canvas and paints, start buying 500 books one at a time, and start painting. If you want to write do these three things: Read. Write. Take your favorite author and type your favorite story of his word for word. Wonder to yourself why he wrote each word. He’s your mentor today. If you want to start a business, start spec-ing out the idea for your business. Reinvention starts today. Every day. K) HOW DO I MAKE MONEY? By year three you’ve put in 5000-7000 hours. That’s good enough to be in the top 200-300 in the world in anything. The top 200 in almost any field makes a living. By year 3 you will know how to make money. By year 4 you will scale that up and make a living. Some people stop at year 4. In the meantime, don’t be afraid to take any jobs for money. Learning from different fields, even ones you hate, is what makes the unique intersection of YOU. Don’t hate yourself for doing things you hate. L) By year 5 you’re top 30-50 so can make wealth. M) HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO? Whatever area you feel like reading 500 books about. Go to the bookstore and find it. If you get bored three months later go back to the bookstore. It’s ok to get disillusioned. That’s what failure is about. Success is better than failure but the biggest lessons are found in failure. When you make mistakes fast, your brain learns. But when you get stuck, with no ideas, and no health, and nothing to push you forward. You atrophy. Changing fast, creates more intersections, makes you the best in the world at those intersections. Very important: There’s no rush. You will reinvent yourself many times in an interesting life. You will fail to reinvent many times. That’s fun also. Many reinventions makes your life a book of stories instead of a textbook. Some people want the story of their life to be a textbook. For better worse, mine is a book of stories. That’s why reinvention happens every day. N) THE CHOICES YOU MAKE TODAY WILL BE YOUR BIOGRAPHY TOMORROW Make interesting choices and you will have an interesting biography. N1) THE CHOICES YOU MAKE TODAY WILL BE IN YOUR BIOLOGY TOMORROW Environment, culture, food, sleep, move === how you feel today. How you see the world today. How you see yourself today. O) WHAT IF I LIKE SOMETHING OBSCURE? Like biblical archaeology or 11th century warfare? Repeat all of the steps above and then in year 5 you will make wealth. We have no idea how. Don’t look to find the end of the road when you are still at the very first step. Dorothy couldn’t see Oz when she first walked on the yellow brick road. P) WHAT IF MY FAMILY WANTS ME TO BE A DOCTOR? How many years of your life did you promise your family? Ten years? Your whole life? Then wait until next life. The good thing is: you get to choose. Choose freedom over family. Freedom over preconceptions. Freedom over government. Freedom over people-pleasing. Freedom over societal morals. We only have this life to be free. Q) MY MENTOR WANTS ME TO DO THINGS HIS WAY! That’s fine. Learn HIS way. Then do it YOUR way. With respect. Hopefully nobody has a gun to your head. Then you have to do it their way until the gun is put down. R) MY SPOUSE IS WORRIED I WON’T BE ABLE TO HELP WITH SUPPORTING THE KIDS? Then after you work 16 hours a day, 7 days a week being a janitor, use your spare time to reinvent. Someone who is reinventing ALWAYS has spare time. Part of reinvention is collecting little bits and pieces of time and re-carving them the way you want them to be. S) WHAT IF MY FRIENDS THINK I AM CRAZY? One thing I notice about friends is that they change. Some stay with you, some drift away. When you reinvent yourself, you’ll be constantly changing the people around you. This is natural. T) WHAT IF I WANT TO BE AN ASTRONAUT? That’s not a reinvention. That’s a specific job. Broaden it out. If you like “outer space” there are many careers. Richard Branson wanted to be an astronaut and started Virgin Galactic. U) WHAT IF I LIKE TO GO DRINKING AND PARTYING? Read this post again in a year. V) WHAT IF I’M NOT KEEPING HEALTHY, WRITING DOWN IDEAS, BEING AROUND GOOD PEOPLE, AND NOT BEING GRATEFUL? Read this post again in two or three years when you are broke and jobless and nobody likes you. W) WHAT IF I HAVE NO SKILLS? Read “B” again. X) WHAT IF I HAVE NO DEGREE OR A USELESS DEGREE? Read “B” again. Y) WHAT IF I HAVE TO FOCUS ON PAYING DOWN DEBT OR THE MORTGAGE? Read “R” again. Mort = death. Gage = Pledge. Mortgage = Death pledge. That’s where they want you. A pledge till death. But don’t listen to them. Z) HOW COME I’M ALWAYS ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN? By definition, if you are a little bit weird and a little bit creepy, and a little bit scared, and a little bit happy, then you are an imposter in everyone else’s life. Now is the time to live your life. Albert Einstein was on the outside looking in. Nobody in the establishment would even hire him. Everyone feels like a fraud at some point. When you feel like that, say, “this is the moment I’m being born.” AA) I CAN’T READ 500 BOOKS. IS THERE ONE BOOK I SHOULD READ? Give up. BB) WHAT IF I’M TOO SICK TO REINVENT? Reinvention will boost every healthy chemical in your body: serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin. Keep moving forward and you might not get healthy but you will get healthier. Don’t use health as an excuse. Finally, reinvent your health first. Sleep more hours. Eat better. Exercise. These are key steps in reinvention. CC) WHAT IF MY LAST PARTNER SCREWED ME AND I’M STILL SUING HIM? Stop litigating and never think about him again. Half the problem was you, not him. I lost a lot of money a few months ago on something that wasn’t my fault? Or was it – for burying myself so deep into something no good. It doesn’t matter. Opinions are for delayers. You and I are reinventors. DD) WHAT IF I’M GOING TO JAIL? Perfect. Reread “B”. Read a lot of books in jail. EE) WHAT IF I’M SHY? Make your weaknesses your strengths. Introverts listen better, focus better, and have ways of being more endearing. FF) WHAT IF I CAN’T WAIT FIVE YEARS? If you plan on being alive in five years then you might as well start today. Important: the best reinvention happens when you celebrate every small success every step of the day. Today, for instance, I’ve had a small success. Today I’m going to celebrate. Else, what if I die before I appreciate myself? GG) HOW SHOULD I NETWORK? Make concentric circles. You’re at the middle. The next circle is friends and family. The next circle is online communities. The circle after that is meetups and coffees. The circle after that is conferences and thought leaders. The circle after that is mentors. The circle after that is customers and wealth-creators. Start making your way through the circles. HH) WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I HAVE EGO ABOUT WHAT I DO? In six – 12 months you’ll be back at “B”. It’s a cliche. But “beginner’s mind” is the mind of reinvention. II) WHAT IF I’M PASSIONATE ABOUT TWO THINGS? WHAT IF I CAN’T DECIDE? Combine them and you’ll be the best in the world at the combination. I want to write a novel. I want to do stand-up. I want to help people. What if I write a funny novel that shares my experiences and helps people? JJ) WHAT IF I’M SO EXCITED I WANT TO TEACH WHAT I AM LEARNING? The only way to really learn is to teach. I write about reinvention and interview 500 success stories because I want to learn. But then I teach what I learn. That cements the learnings. Teach what you learn and you’ve just learned more. KK) WHAT IF I WANT TO MAKE MONEY WHILE I SLEEP? In Year 3, start outsourcing what you do. The first time I realized I could do this, my life changed. It’s like suddenly I was 50 people combined into one. LL) HOW DO I MEET MENTORS AND THOUGHT LEADERS? Once you have enough knowledge (after 100-200 books), write down ten ideas for 20 different potential mentors. None of them will respond. Write down ten more ideas for 20 new mentors. Repeat every week. Put together a newsletter for everyone who doesn’t respond. Keep repeating until someone responds. Blog about your learning efforts. Build community around you being an expert. MM) WHAT IF I CAN’T COME UP WITH IDEAS? Then keep practising coming up with ideas. The idea muscle atrophies. You have to build it up. It’s hard for me to touch my toes if I haven’t been doing it every day. I have to do it every day for awhile before I can easily touch my toes. Don’t expect to come up with good ideas on day one. NN) WHAT ELSE SHOULD I READ? AFTER books, read websites, forums, magazines. But most of that is garbage. OO) WHAT IF I DO EVERYTHING YOU SAY AND IT STILL DOESN’T WORK? It will work. Just wait. Keep reinventing every day. Don’t try and find the end of the road. You can’t see it in the fog. But you can see the next step and you DO know that if you take that next step eventually you get to the end of the road. The only thing worth thinking about is taking the next step. PP) WHAT IF I GET DEPRESSED? First, let me hug you. Second: eat, move, sleep. Be around people you love. Laugh. Write down ideas. When you are depressed, all of this is hard. It’s hard for me. But that’s when it’s most important to do it. The sharpest sword is made by fire, not water. QQ) WHAT IF I GET SCARED? Being human means feeling fear. Fear can always be felt somewhere on the body. Find it. Say hi to it. Eat. Move. Sleep. Take the next step. Be around people who love you. And who you love. Write down ideas. Because ideas are the helicopters to take you out of your fear. Be grateful for what you have. Else, you’ll always be searching for things you may never have. SS) WHAT IF IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING EVER WORKS OUT FOR ME? Spend ten minutes a day practising gratitude. Don’t suppress the fear. Notice the anger. Anger is never inspirational but gratitude is. Gratitude is the bridge between your world and the parallel universe where all creative ideas live. Can I tell you something stupid I do? When I get that “nothing ever works out for me” feeling (which is often, no matter what my successes are), I it my chest and say out loud, “Abundance!” Like I said, it’s stupid. But for me it works. TT) WHAT IF I HAVE TO DEAL WITH PERSONAL BS ALL THE TIME? Find new people to be around. Someone who is reinventing herself will constantly find people to try and bring her down. The brain is scared of reinvention because it might not be safe. Biologically, the brain wants you to be safe and reinvention is a risk. So it will throw people in your path who will try to stop you. Learn how to say “no”. Even it’s so hard at first. Learn how to Ask. Even if it’s so hard at first. UU) WHAT IF I’M MOSTLY HAPPY AT MY CUBICLE JOB? Good luck. VV) WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU – YOU’VE FAILED SO MANY TIMES? Don’t trust me. WW) WILL YOU BE MY MENTOR?

In 2013 during the 13th edition of the Marrakech International Film Festival, both Kashyap and Scorsese were co-jury members and Kashyap was thrilled to be judging beside his idol. This photo was taken during that film festival.    It was during this time that Anurag was shooting Bombay Velvet and he decided to show it to his idol. Martin was impressed by the film but felt that it needed to be edited well. His long time friend and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who edits most of Scorsese's films was brought in to edit Bombay Velvet to suit international audiences. Thelma Schoonmaker is considered one of the most famous editing hands in the world having won multiple Oscars for Scorsese's films “Raging Bull,” “The Aviator” and “The Departed"".  When Thelma saw the film she felt it was too long with unnecessary songs and she cut some of the songs from the film. Raveena Tandon had a full introductory song filmed on her, which is now only a few seconds on the released print. Similarly some of Anushka's songs were also chopped out by Schoonmaker.

These two contributors to the explosion of interest in photography also have their big brother, the Internet to thank too, along with their cousins, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  So, you can see, the landscape to capture, share, and distribute photos has grown since the old film and tube television days and this adds to that illusion. But while that entire technology family has grown the popularity of photography and can help these wannabe professionals make their mediocre images look great, especially in low-resolution formats, there is more than it seems when it comes to stake a claim as a professional photographer. First, part of professionalism in photography is the ability to capture with a consistent photographic, or artistic style. While I cover that topic more in-depth with my article, Artistic Personality of a Photographer, this is something most “social media and Internet photographers” do not have, though they often get some lucky shots. Consistent style also comes from the ability to choose the right lenses, apertures, shutter speeds, ISO’s, etc., something you can’t currently get with smartphones—hence the luck part.  Professionalism in photography doesn’t rely on luck, though it can help at times, as professionalism comes from years of experience, learned knowledge, and the ability to work with others while on an assignment or a client shoot. Rarely do you hear an award-winning photographer say, “I got the lucky shot.” You might hear them say, “I was at the right place at the right time,” and sometimes that does take luck, but once you have that luck, you need the experience to capture the shot perfectly at the right moment. That takes a thorough understanding of the fundamentals and principles of photography, not luck. So, while smartphones and apps, along with their extended family of the Internet and social media might make it seem like there are a ton of professional photographers out there, remember, that is just an illusion thanks to technology. Technology provides many illusions when it comes to other professions too, for example, when the written page went from the typewriter to the keyboard aided by print on demand and self-publishing, now it seems like everyone is an author.

The “professional” side won’t come until you have a considerable number of in-the-field hours under your belt, and you’ve acquired the ability to perform under the rigors of professionalism Online learning is chaotic and disorganized. The best learning is structured and organized from the very basics to complicated. Do not be fooled and lured in by the promise that joining an online club or forum, or subscribing to any of the 50-million tutorials found online can make you learn Photoshop. In the end you’ll have spent thousands of hours with very little to show for it. Yes they may help, and are useful once you already know the program. But 50% of them are bad, and merely clickbait. I work with self-taught Photoshop users all the time. Recently one wrote our Q&A lamenting about poor quality of her post card she worked so hard on. The photo was beautifully worked, and the ‘tutorials’ she watched on YouTube helped her create a respectable image. But the post card sucked, and wouldn’t even print. In two questions I solved her problem. She had learned the “glitz” of Photoshop, but was sadly lacking in the basics. She did not have a good foundation.

So during my Intermediate I met this girl(lets say her name is Seher and my name is Yash) on my first day of class. She was standing and talking to one of my classmate and as I entered we got introduced by that classmate. I don't remember what we talked just hi/Hello maybe. And I don't know but at that moment I feeled something that I really don't know how to describe? It's important that you people should know something about me. I'm homesick since beginning. I didn't liked going to school and having friends (just one friend at a time). I look little different (not in bad way), also I'm good looking but not a lot just a little above average. If I'm in a room one can easily notice me and you people won't beleive my whole school used to know me and still wherever I'm right now mostly people know me but the strange thing is I never talk to any of them. In my school I used to only talk to my friend and yet whole school used to know me. But the thing is I've always known and experienced that people judge you by your skin, hair, clothes, religion, money and whateslse not and the worst part is you get bullied. I was bullied for my brown hair, fair and soft skin, being lean, being good in maths, knowing more than toppers but still never getting a rank in top 10. I was bullied in my 12th Board's Farewell for being Mr. Farewell why because what happened is that in first round only all the best looking were eliminated by their own mistake and then I was announced Mr. Farewell. They bullied me for this till the board examinations and even some teacher also. I was at my friend house and we both were listening music in earphone suddenly our Ph.E teacher calls him so he picks up the call and one earphone is in my ear and other in his. So the teacher on phone tells him that the school management had done nonsense by making me Mr. Farewell and it would have been better if the school didn't announced any Mr. Farewell that year. So I've been bullied like this but it never bothered me. What bothered me is the incident which I'm going to share. Now I've told you guys enough to judge the context. Also Seher is the only girl I've been friend who is a girl. I didn't have any “girl” friend other than Seher till now. So let's start After going to school regularly for about 1–2 weeks one of the classmate made a whatsapp group and added 8–10 students of class. He added me and Seher. So one day actually in the evening 😂 I messaged in the group but there was no one online that time. After 1–2 minutes Seher came online, she read my message in the group and then she messaged me personally. The conversation was like this Seher: Yash🙄? Is this ur number Yash: Seher?? Hi 😅 hw r u?? Seher: Good, achha suno kya bolre the grp m Yash: are kuchh nhi bs Seher: achha Yash: jee haan, achha why didn't you replied in the group instead you messaged me here? Seher: just didn't wanted to disturb other people in the group. Yash: Ooo… btw nice☺️ Seher: thanks ……………………………. This was our first day talk and slowly and gradually we started to talk initially 10–20 minutes then half an hour and then an hour then 2–3 hours and finally around 6–7 hours a day in course of around one and half year. I can't say what it was because in school she used to sit in first bench and adjacent to her row I used to sit in the second bench and in the first bench one of my friend ( say his name is Raj). Seher and Raj used to talk whole day in class mostly talking about school and what's going with teachers and they always used to say to everyone that they are like brother and sister. Raj used today Seher is like her sister and Seher used to say Raj is like his big brother. So basically Seher and I rarely talked in school but after the school the situation would be opposite. As soon as she use to reach home she will message me and then we will talk for hours till our coaching time and then after coaching time we will talk and around 8–9 pm she will talk to other of her friends in whatsapp and that time she used to ignore me like in the class but again after 9pm she used to talk to me till we slept. So it continued for around one year till one month before pre boards exam. At that time suddenly I noticed it that why she behaves like this to me in class but after school she completely behaves differently with me. So I started to interact with her in class more oftenly but she started to ignore me more in class and always tried to avoide me in class. Whenever she saw me coming to her she would start talking or asking doubts to classmate so only to avoid me. So it frustrated me a lot and finally around December I decided that I will no longer talk to her and then I simply disabled the mobile data for my whatsapp and Instagram. And then I didn't talked to her for around one month. At that time usually our school are closed for giving time to us to prepare for pre boards exam. It was more than a month and what happened that I talked to one of my classmate asking some doubts in subjects. After talking to him. I suddenly got a call from Seher. She asked me what is happening and why I have not opened my whatsapp and Instagram for about a month. I just told her that I broked my phone (in actual I didn't). After that she talked to me for about 2–3 hours continuously on call. She told me that she wants to meet me as soon as school opens. I was like ok. After disconnecting the call I was like what the f**k happened. Why did she called me and what does she want? Why she treats me like shit in school and in front of her friends and talks so nicely when noone is around. And why all this is happening to me? And what does she want from me? So anyways school opened she treated me nicely for sometime in school but again started to ignore me and in all this time I was never desperate to talk to her but yet she always made me feel miserable in school and I don't know why? After pre boards we had to prepare for practical and during this time I came to understand that she will always make me miserable and it's better to ignore her. I was already ignoring her and for that I had to sacrifice my whatsapp and Instagram. Yet I did because there was no option. Now what happened that during practical exam she somehow knew that I don't want to talk to her and that's why I'm not using whatsapp. She never asked me this but after that she just started to bully me. And you guys would never beleive she bullied me in such a way that you can't beleive. In school she started to make me miserable. She made fun of me by in every aspect my hair, shoes, dress, moustache and beard, how I walk and how I eat. She started to call me tharki in front of me and my classmates and always making me uncomfortable by saying that I check this girl or that girl. And one time she got to her height by calling in one of the girls in class to me and saying to her that I love and she knows she also love her. It was so awkward for me but it was fun for her. And the worst part noone really cared what I feeled. She said to one of my friend that I look like gay and all girls call me gay whenever I enter into class in their mind and they smile by seeing each other's face and that friend told this thing to all my class 10 friends. And when I came to know this I for the first time felt that I'm really bullied and it's started to affect me. So I decided that as soon as the board examination ends I'm no longer gonna ever talk to her or see her. But she hadn't finished she wanted to make me more miserable and what she did that she started to talk to tis other boy and in someone's b'day party that boy whole time bragged that Seher is talking to her. It made me feel miserable and I couldn't resist and I slapped that boy indirectly by saying that he step on my foot but still I was more angry and wanted him to beat till he can't speak but I controlled myself. After the party she again called me after one month she was like why don't are you coming online on whatsapp and she misses me. I was like stop your bullshit. You're talking to that shit and why. How did he get ur whatsapp number why isn't he on ur instagram. I started to flood questions on her and she was like there's is nothing and then she talked to me till 11pm explaining me all persons in her insta followers list. Still I was not satisfied and I was angry at her and I decided not to forgive her. So in school I also started being rude to her and in the end of school we talked but never meant anything. Now she gave me one last and very big impact. So it was first board exam day and we had our English paper. After the paper I was outside waiting for everyone, she came but she ignored me like shit and didn't talked to me. She was going with Raj in his scooty. So my house is in the colony and the colony road is connected with the main road. I was in auto and when I reached to near the colony road I saw Seher and Raj standing in crossing of the colony and main road waiting for someone. I thought they are waiting for me. So I got out of the auto and took a moment so that they would notice me, they did notice me but ignored me. I was stunned and shocked. There was this one handsome boy who came to meet her. I was there seeing everything standing. The way that boy greeted her and was constantly blushing combing his hair with hand and seeing her. She was also blushing. At that moment I just wanted to do something take a brick and just hit the boy but I couldn't because then my father wouldn't accept me. At that moment a lot was going in my mind. I just bowed my head down and stated to walk and I crossed them and then I just walked straight to my home and then in my room closed the door opened my clothe went to the bathroom and just started to hit the wall and then I hit the geyser connection board. It shattered into tiny pieces and I think I was just a milimeter from that live wire. If it would have touched me I wouldn't be able to write this now. I was depressed now…….. That day I didn't eat anything and was in my room locked. My parents asked me to open but I didn't. I used to cry in the bathroom. I started to tear page in my notebooks in which she ever wrote and burnt them. I deleted all her photo and video's. I deleted my insta account. And the worst part is that I didn't ever loved her but when I saw her blushing in front of that boy it just shook me. Infact I was just bullied by her and I just wanted all the bullying to end when our school will end and we will go to different colleges, different profession and different cities. And all this bullying will end. But everything changed when I saw her blushing when she was talking to that boy. I didn't know why I was feeling so much pain and why it affected me so much. The next exam I had was Physics and I just didn't wanted to study and I just wanted to cry. I did just cried whole time. I only studied two hours before exam and went to give exam. It wasn't good but I wrote sufficient to pass. But her exam didn't go well. I was in the corridor when I saw her coming out of the examination hall she was crying so much, her so called brother Raj was trying to stop her from crying. I watched her crying but I didn't feel bad for her. But when I returned home I wanted to cry more. So I did I cried everyday. I just used to eat one time and didn't study. I locked myself in room and just used to cry. I gave my rest of exam without revising a single word. Just used to wake up in the exam day, dress up and go to exam hall. It was my Board's exam still it didn't bothered me. I just got depressed and I no longer could smile. My face looked like if someone has slapped my so tightly that I'm shocked by the impact and just couldn't hold myself. Finally last exam, we gave it and are outside the school. Everyone is saying goodbye to everyone and telling they will miss each other. We all were enjoyingvour last moment of school. Suddenly when noone was around Seher talked to me shyingly it was awkward situation. She was behaving awkward and asked me like this. So you're good, you're focused on exam, you must will get good marks And I was standing there saying to myself that what the hell is she talking, why can't she say me anything directly. So I just tried to smile, then she was like so you deleted your instagram I was like yeah I couldn't bare any of this more And she just acted that she didn't hear anything what I said. Strange na, what I was saying I didn't know but I wanted her to never leave me. I was crying from inside and I didn't know what to say. So anyways I went to my home after that till now we haven't talked(or maybe we have talked). It's going to be three years. Our board's result came almost after 2 months, I after giving boards exam went to my village and from there to Delhi to prepare for Medical examination. Note: I was still missing her a lot and used to cry some night and my roommate used to stop me crying. Well I got 4th rank in my class and she got 5th rank. When or results came we talked through whatsapp. She was like how did you pass I thought you will fail. Yeah she was again bullying me. She sent me the PDF of our photos and newspaper cutting that school published. Our photos were together and when I saw it I couldn't control and tears rolled down my eyes. I messaged her see we look so much good together. She was like Ooo Ohk! It was around end of May and then we again started to talk on whatsapp but this time it was not going to last for longer time. A hope arose inside me that if we talk nicely in whatsapp she might like me and then I could tell her that what I feel about her It was just matter of 3–4 days and then my life would be miserable forever. So basically she was at her home and I was in delhi and then I came to know that her college is finalised between two options one in Noida and the other in Bangalore. When I heard I was once she goes to college she will never get time to talk to me. So I decided that I will just tell her what I feel. I messaged her in the morning that Seher I wanna talk to you I just can't bare it anymore I hate you how you always had made me miserable in front of your friends And I hate that why you treat me like this And I really don't know but I think “I love you” and it's never gonna change. I don't know it matters for you or not but I just can't be away from you Promise never leave me. She read my msg but didn't replied later I agay messaged her to atleast speak anything She was like what this bullshit Why did you speak “tum bole hi kyu” And then she blocked me. Fact: After that she didn't till now mentioned my name or talked about me to any of our classmate. Even if someone asks about me she just tells them to never mention about me ever.  Here's what I always ask myself, from all her actions I come to know she just saw me as classmate and she never liked me in anyway. And just when I told her she got angry that how could I think this. Yeah ok But the real question is why did she treated me like this. Ignoring me in school and then being so nice to me on whatsapp and Instagram and talking for more than 5–6 hours a day and that too continuous for more than a year. Well it turns out to be I was just bullied by her so that she could stand between her piers and brag about it. That she has completely controlled Yash amd made him her dog and she can do whatever with whenever she want. She can treat him nicely when she feels and then she can make him miserable. All this on her will. I was just an object for her to brag in front of her friends. And she did it. It never meant anything for her.  Whatever it was but I just can't forget her and I always remember her in goodway. I wish someday she will just talk to me like we used to talk. I just want that. And I miss her a lot and I love her whatever you call it.  Love is strange. Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:43:28.559Z,"Have you ever witnessed a life ruined from a small mistake? ",Quora

While basic education may be enough for you to get a BPO job but a KPO job requires you to be competent in a particular field. Also, the training provided by the KPOs is more rigorous and sector specific. So if you are a 'Jack of all trades', KPOs may not be the right choice for you.

How do we get into this mindset, or as you put it, into a confident frame of mind? You can work on confidence-building habits, a little bit each day. Here are three for you to consider. Confidence-building habit #1. Become a MASTER AT ONE SKILL. Don't think that achieving mastery is reserved for the chosen few, whether it’s having a black belt in karate or getting a PhD in artificial intelligence. Mastery is a path that is open to everyone who wants to make it a top priority in their life and who will dedicate their time to build it. Having mastery in any field simply means you work hard on one thing, improve your skill level to reach advanced status, and over time become an expert in that field. How can you build this habit? Start by setting aside some time to ask yourself a few introspective questions. Your questions can sound something like this. Which skills do I have that I am particularly proud of? What is it that my close family and friends say are my greatest strengths?Next, write down a list of the skills or strengths you identified. Think about how they helped you achieve goals at different stages of your life. Maybe a grandparent showed you how to do your homework early so you don’t have to rush through it the night before it’s due — and that improved your time management skills. Or maybe you started drawing in your journal as a teenager — and now this skill is enabling you to be more creative and confident about expressing yourself through art or writing.From that list, identify one specific skill you'd like to focus on, then write down a goal that you can reach by practicing it. The goal can be something like running a 5K marathon that you’ll need to prepare for by building endurance. Or, it can be traveling to and living in a foreign country two years from now that will require you to learn a new language and become fluent in it. Once you’ve identified the goal, schedule a little time every day to practice your skill. Start small — even 15 minutes to practice is a good beginning.Confidence-building habit #2. Work on adopting the RIGHT MINDSET. Your mindset is the window through which you view the world. It affects your process of learning, influences the way you interact with people, shapes your attitude towards your skills set and what you believe you “must” or “can’t” be good at, and ultimately controls the way you experience your entire life. This is why investing time in building the right mindset is so important. What then is the right mindset? It is a growth mindset — the belief that you can develop your qualities through deliberate and continuous efforts so you don’t feel burdened with thinking you “should” be doing something because you were told to. A growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset, which is the belief that our qualities are set in stone, that we can only have a certain level of intelligence, personality type, or skills and there isn’t anything we can do to change them. How can you build this habit? Stay curious. Learn something new every day, whether it’s about the history of the world, which activities keep you physically fit, which healthy habits can improve your life, or which books you can read that will teach you something valuable.Befriend people who have a growth mindset. They are the ones who have a can-do attitude, who exhibit positive and optimistic behavior, and who are working hard every day on making themselves better people. Conversely, stay away from those who are constantly negative, critical in always pointing out what they or others are lacking, and who spend too much time talking about others and not enough time on themselves.Don’t limit your learning experience. Just because it’s not taught in school or at university, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend time learning about it. Get books on a topic that is interesting to you. Take an online class, Watch free tutorials on YouTube on how to develop a skill you think would be empowering to you.Confidence-building habit #3. Build optimism about your future by making any obstacle work for you (not against you). There’s the present moment in which we stand now, and then there’s the future we imagine in the far distance. And in between? There’s daily life, getting from point A to point B, meeting deadlines, juggling responsibilities, finding obstacles that stand in our way and that we must deal with. Wouldn’t it be great if we knew how to deal with these obstacles in a positive way? What if we actually created a plan ahead of time for dealing with them? When you have a plan like this in place, then you’re more likely to feel optimistic about the future. How can you build this habit? Get used to the possibility that you’ll run into an obstacle that might derail your day. Think of it this way: chances are high that something will happen that will impact your schedule and turn your to-do list upside down. The upside? If you prepare yourself psychologically, it won’t feel like a big deal when it actually happens. The trick is to anticipate that the obstacle will most likely happen, instead of ignoring the likelihood that it will.When you encounter the obstacle, brainstorm alternative solutions. If you’re stuck in traffic, listen to a podcast to give yourself some brain food. If you realize there’s less time to complete a project, take out a sheet of paper and write a list of tasks you need to complete, in order of importance. Then divide up the day into one hour increments, do one task at a time, and check off items from your list as you go along. If you find yourself struggling with time management, keep a log of your activities for one week by jotting down what you’re doing and how long it takes. At the end of each day, look at what you’ve written and identify areas where you feel you could’ve saved more time to do something more important (read or go out for a walk instead of spending one hour scrolling through Twitter, for example).Share what you learn with others. It’s a big deal whenever we overcome something that has been bothering us for quite some time. We start to feel good about our efforts, we feel smarter, and we have a more clear picture of where we’re headed. Once you find yourself at this stage, don’t keep it to yourself. Think how your experience can positively impact someone else’s life. You can literally change the way someone else thinks about life’s problems, building skills, or even changing their mindset for the better! Find a platform like Quora, or perhaps start a blog, and write about the challenges you’ve encountered and what you’ve done to overcome them. Be detailed in your writing. Recommend ideas so others can learn from you. Not only will this boost your confidence, but you’ll truly be helping someone else out there get on the right path and start seeing their life in a better, brighter light. To get to the core of this question, let’s first talk about what confidence (or in this instance, self-confidence) means. Confidence can be: A feeling of self-assurance arising from one's appreciation of one’s own abilities or qualitiesA feeling or consciousness of one’s powers or of reliance on one’s circumstancesFaith or belief that one will act in a right, proper, or effective wayA state of being clear-headed either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct, or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effectiveA positive belief that in the future one can generally accomplish what oContinue Reading",2021-03-05T14:48:55.114Z,"What are some good practices to work myself into a confident frame of mind?

When we are talking about “Art” we are talking about a creative process in which an individual brings about a work that manages to evoke certain emotions in people. This is Art in its purest form. A Career, on the other hand is using a particular skill and building a professional reputation around it in order to earn money. In the excellent answer by Matt Burrwood here in this question, he notes that “The skill is in being able to visualise an image in your mind and then make that image a reality.” I would like to re-emphasize that, and I’ll just borrow his words because he explained it much better than I can. And Art begins with one thing: the end result. That is, an image/concept/idea is formed in your mind, which you want to bring to life. This is already the end result! It is not just the beginning. It is also the end! The rest of your work, is just a means to bring about that image into reality. The precision which you achieve in bringing that image or idea in your mind’s eye into reality, is the true mark of your skill and the quality of your work. For instance, if I imagine a beautiful woman in my mind’s eye. The image is perfect. It is amazing. It is my ideal woman. Then I draw it, and I end up with this:  Clearly, there is a lot to go. My skill, the quality of my art and the precision at which I can bring it into reality is clearly lacking. But let’s say I train hard for ten years, improve my technique, and then holding onto the same image, I do the process again, and I come up with this:  Now, perhaps, my skill has come a lot closer to bringing the image in mind’s eye into reality. What modern photography tools — like Photoshop — do is simply act as an aid in the process of bringing the “mind’s eye image” into “reality.” But you still need the ability to clearly visualize the end result you want, and you still need the skills to execute it properly while transferring the image from your mind into the real world. You can call these modern tools a crutch, but that’s like saying a bulldozer or a crane are a crutch for engineers trying to build a skyscraper. They should have just stuck to oldschool slaves rolling stone slabs over logs of wood!  Photoshop, computers, these are just tools for the photographer to bring the image in his mind’s eye into reality. However, there is merit to this question. The thing is, in order to become a photographer back in the day, you had to have a dark room. You had to buy a ton of supplies like fixers, enlargers, timers, safelights, a stop bath, etc. Then you needed to learn the various techniques to move images from one shot to another. It was a much more complicated process. Today, you can do what oldschool photographers had to develop an entire lab to with a single digital camera (or even a smartphone) and a laptop. You still need to learn some techniques to use Photoshop, but it’s a lot less complicated than what the old boys had to do in order to reach the same result.  In other words, Photoshop and other modern tools lower the barrier of entry into the craft. What used to take years to learn apprenticing under a master, you can now learn in weeks through an online course. With a significantly lower cost of investment. Anyone familiar with economics knows that when a market has lower barriers to entry, a significant number of competitors can join the market and bring prices down low. This is just basic supply and demand, Economics 101. What Photoshop and other modern tools do, is that it enables a whole cadre of people to get into the market and offer their skills, skills that only a select few used to be capable of back in the day. It can even mean that most people don’t even need a photographer’s services. They can just do it themselves (DIY). So building on the woman’s drawing example earlier, while I maybe won’t quite be able to make a work as good as this:  Instead of making a mess like this:  I can achieve something on the level of this:  Which will be perfectly acceptable for most people. This means that the market value for photography skills is a lot lower than it used to be. So it is much harder to make a good living as a photographer today, because everyone and their dog can do it, due to the lower barriers of entry. There will still be those who have real skill and talent, a much higher level of precision to bring forth their creative image, but the bar just got a lot higher because of the competition. That is the real effect of modern photography techniques and methods, and how it affects people who are looking to have a Career in Photography. You now have to be even better, with even more skill, or have something unique to differentiate you from the rest, a Competitive Advantage that allows you to price better than the rest or get more demand than the rest, if you really want to make a Career out of photography. I’d like to distinguish between the “Art” of photography and photography as a “Career.” The two are not the same. When we are talking about “Art” we are talking about a creative process in which an individual brings about a work that manages to evoke certain emotions in people. This is Art in its purest form. A Career, on the other hand is using a particular skill and building a professional reputation around it in order to earn money. In the excellent answer by Matt Burrwood here in this question, he notes that “The skill is in being able to visualise an image in your mind and then make that im Continue Reading",2021-03-05T14:49:59.949Z,"Is the art of photography dying as a career with the use of Photoshop and CGI?

CareerLove / GirlfriendParentsCareer: I was born and raised in an upper middle class Indian family in Delhi. Had the best of the education/coaching provided by parents. But only could make into a Tier-2 Engineering college. After college, I somehow managed to get into a Major Indian IT Services company for my job. It sucked. Without going into too much details - I changed the company after working around 1 Year in IT. I moved into a Telecom Product (R&D) based setup afterwards. I changed 2 companies after that in the same domain. It’s been almost 7 years into my career, and sometimes I do feel a little clueless about it. I’ve had failed attempts in CAT & GMAT. I’ve worked internationally across US, Canada & Europe and I earn in 7 Figures annually. But still stay with my parents in Delhi, so money wise it’s not too bad. I’ve to admit that I’m in the rat race - Always looking for the next big (salary & position) jump, continuously giving interviews, but very particular about the job role. It’s been 2.5 years in my current company, and I’m bored, and not contended. I had multiple offer letters in the past few months, but something or the other did not add up. Salary, Job Location, or the Role offered. But the desire to get out of my organization remains. I’ve had many sleepless nights over it. Even though nothing bad happened. Cool boss, great working environment, good products to work on. I am still paranoid about it since I entered my “comfort” zone and the learning curve is going down. Love / Girlfriend: I’m not a very attractive looking guy. Over that I did not have a good physique or built up. Never really played any real sport. So naturally, I had never got (College/School) any attention from any woman. During 4th year/8th Semester of college, I casually started to hit the gym. Nothing serious. Boozing & hitting the gym were the only two things i did. See the contrast. Somehow started talking to a girl in Orkut (That was year 2009) This got converted into (6 hours+ daily) long telephonic calls. Apparently I was in love. I met the girl a couple of times, hung out in pubs. But had no physical relation. It got over in a few months. Life went on and I joined the corporate bandwagon. By this time I had worked on my confidence levels, had a decent looking physique (Continued Gym). Girls came flocking. But I was after a particular girl, who i thought liked me as well. She was from the same (office) department. We hung out during lunches & weekends (I always paid for everything) Nothing serious happened. I quit the company soon, and helped her move into my new company in a few months (Different department) We still hung out. And I paid for her food. One fine day I gathered my courage and proposed her. I got shot down badly. She was just using me. For food & career growth. Damn. This was the year 2011. After 2011, I worked on my career, learnt new things. I took the gym seriously, did crossfit, lifted big weights, did compound lifts. And had a look of a “Big” guy. Worked like a charm. Had many girls asking me out. But now I had the ability to distinguish the fake ones. Unfortunately, all were fakes. They were after me since I had my own car (Bought at age the of 24), had money to burn (Staying with parents), and had done multiple long international assignments. I never dated any of them. And i was too classy to get a hooker. So no physical relations even till the age of 27. Early 2016 (Age - 28), I got an assignment to be completed from Canada. I met an Indian Girl there. Started talking. A lot. She was from South India. A free spirited wild soul. She never asked how much I earned, or what exactly my job was. We talked about life and experiences. I was in love. She moved back to India soon. And I moved back in some months. She confessed her love for me. We are still talking. And I’m still in Love with her. She’s a divorcee. She’s my girlfriend. Let’s call her X. Parents: My folks have always been ultra liberal throughout, and I had a cool relation with them. They made it clear that they would be cool with anyone I chose to to marry. Any caste, creed or religion. So sometime back my folks started Bride-Hunting for me (Typical Arranged Marriage Scene of India). But they asked me many times if I had someone in mind. I did not meet X then. So I had to give my folks a green signal. I came back from my foreign assignment, and dropped the news about X. They got happy. But when I told them about her past {She’s a divorcee}, they lost their cool. Heated arguments happened. And it followed with my parents not talking to me for months. My mom did not eat for days. She stopped talking to everyone, including her friends. This affected her health adversely. I became sad. My parents were not happy as well, of-course. I grew concerned. Spent sleepless nights. One day I had to be admitted to the hospital for unusual cardiac activity. {This was a serious thing because i had no issues like this before. All my health reports from previous years medical checkup had shown all good signs. Plus I'm a strength athlete by passion} Fortunately, nothing dramatic got caught. Doctors advised it was due to stress and agony. After this, my folks started talking with me again. Though they don’t talk about my marriage at all now. I have no clue how to re-approach them for considering X. I do know what my parents want is for my good. And they are genuinely concerned. Things are normal between me and folks now. But we are just avoiding the bomb that is ticking. It is going to explode. But not sure when. So my parents’ health. X. And my Career. These are the only things that play with my mind now a days. Thanks for reading. …. Edit: Career: There have been a lot of changes going on in the Telecom software domain. To keep my self relevant in the industry, I’ve got myself enrolled in different online / paid web-based courses. So for the past weeks, I have been trying to update myself aggressively. But this is seriously hard, since I’m already leading a major module of the product I work in, that comes with a lot of responsibilities & meetings to attend, even after I come back home, till 10–11 in the night. Sometimes I do wonder if I should go into Project Management (since I have got the experience of managing a full product release cycle) or should I remain and focus on the technology side of it. I need to re-invent myself 0r fade into oblivion. Career is a hard thing to pursue. Love etc.: Long distance relations are hard to maintain. A few weeks back I flew to her town. Lying at home that I had official engagements to take care. Things were not exactly rosy, but still we had a lot of love. She’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever been with. She has a beautiful heart. She’s actually very good looking, and I don’t mean it just because I’m her lover - but she has had modelling offers in the past. She’s that beautiful. The only thing attractive about my body is the thick built that I have, which I gained over the years. And may be my beard. I left her town on a bitter note - Thanks to some misunderstanding. … Last week my folks were out of town, and I was home alone. Coming back from office and unlocking the doors of my home myself reminded of my college days, where I stayed in my campus-hostel for 4 years. You are free to do whatever you want. So naturally, I brought my best-friend with me - Johnnie Walker Blue Label Whiskey, that would go on to accompany me with dinner every night. And No - I’m not an alcoholic. Just 1–2 pegs on the rocks, with dinner. One day I gathered courage (Thanks to my best-friend) and sent X’s pics to my mother (Remember - Folks out of town). I got a reply that who’s she. I said she’s her. She understood. (Before this she did not even look at her photos) She got impressed by X’s pics, and said she’s gorgeous. And that she’ll talk to me when she comes back. This was perhaps due to the fact that she (mom) had seen me in a horrible condition when we were not talking to each other. The above was a clear sign that she got mellowed. And my folks might accept her finally. But right now, things between me & X are not exactly love like. We are not like Romeo & Juliet. Though I love her a lot, and making every effort to make things right. But honestly, I don’t know how things would unfold. Whether this would end up in a heartbreak or marriage - Only time would tell. This is probably the hardest phase of my life till now. 28 Year old Indian Guy here. Broadly, there are 3 things.

TAKE YOUR SKILLS TO THE NEXT LEVEL Hi, my name is Patrick Lavigne and I'm a professional graphic artist, photo editor, colorist (photo & video) and photographer. My main goal with this site is to teach you how you can create better photos by spending as little money as possible and it all starts with photo editing. No, you don't need a $3000 camera or a $1500 lens to take professional quality photos. In fact, the difference you will notice between a photo taken with an entry level DSLR camera + the kit lens and the same photo taken with the Canon 5D Mark IV for example is minimal compare to the difference you'll notice between one photo expertly edited in Photoshop and the same that wasn't. If you already have Photoshop, (you can download the free trial for 7 days btw) you can improve your photos dramatically by learning how to properly color correct and color grade. Then, you can take your photos to an whole new level if you can master the art of what we call photomanipulation, compositing and retouching. By mastering those techniques, you will be able to turn your photos into digital art! Some sites are selling their tutorials $25+ a piece, at only $5 per tutorial, I could perhaps charge $100+ for all of them, but I want to give you a MUCH better deal than that! When you join this site, you pay a one-time fee of $49 $39 (Limited Time Offer) for a Lifetime Membership which gives you access toALL tutorials. As I add more tutorials, the price will go up accordingly - by securing your lifetime membership now, you will have access to all the future tutorials absolutely FREE!! All source images for the tutorials are supplied to you so you'll be able to do exactly what I did. The tutorials were all done using Photoshop CS5 or Photoshop CC but as long as you have version CS5 or newer, you're fine! While a lot can be done with CS3/CS4, you will be limited when doing my tutorials. If you want to try out a more recent version, Adobe offers a Free 7-day trial. As for Photoshop Elements, it is definitely not recommended here as you'll probably feel like you're in an alternate universe following my tutorials! Happened a few times! If you are on this website and have read until this point, it's because you are a motivated artist that wants to improve and you realize that to fully unleash your talent, you need the technical knowledge you might be missing to fully express it. Learning all the ways you can edit your photos and images is like someone that finally learns the proper drawing techniques. Before, the person was making interesting doodles, now he/she's creating works of art. The talent was there but it was not fully utilized. And it's the same thing with digital art and photo editing, once you learn the proper methods, you then unleash the creativity in you that couldn't fully be expressed before. What you'll learn on this site is just the start, a glimpse of what's possible for you to achieve. By joining this site and practicing what I'll teach you, I firmly believe that you too can become a photo/image editing expert. You may doubt your potential at first but I guarantee you that after surprising yourself a few times with better than expected results, your confidence will grow and you will be believing in your true potential. It's important to have goals and that's why you are here, if it's career goals (photography, digital artist), to paraphrase the great Jim Rohn, get the skills, take the classes, be more valuable. If it's personal goals (hobby), push yourself, get the knowledge and accomplish what you want to accomplish. If for any reasons you are not completely satisfied with my training tutorials, I'm offering you a 60-day, no questions asked, money back guarantee: If you don't think LearnPhotoEditing is worth it, simply drop me an email - and you'll get all your money back instantly.

The barriers to entry in this industry are incredibly low: anyone with a laptop and a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud can produce work of the same technical quality as a big agency, but with much less overhead and therefore more competitive pricing.Graduate SchoolEvery single one of my professors advised us not to apply to grad school until we'd worked in the industry for a few years. Eight years out of school, that makes a lot of sense to me. It took me a couple of years to figure out and become comfortable with the professional demands and pace of the job.

I have used it since its first edition and, it as far as I am concerned, totally indispensable, especially for corporate portraits. For large companies this can involve over a hundred people!

Hence you’ll often see the difference between what you have seen and what do you see in the captured image. This is the limitation of cameras as of now. Both these points necessitate you to know photo editing or post processing (processing an image after it is captured). Else you may end up not using the umpteen possibilities of creating better pictures that you can, with that pricey possession named DSLR. So, my suggestion is to learn at least basic post processing, even if you go ahead and buy a DSLR right away.",2021-03-05T14:58:33.937Z,"Do I need to learn photo editing before buying a DSLR camera?

Most of the professional photographers are very much fond of using this tool for their bright career. Mainly graphic designers, website developers, advertising firms, catalog companies, interior firms and much more photo industries are already accustomed with this clipping path service. As this service has the huge demand in Europe or America so It is quite costly to hire, for that reason many firms are going for outsourcing service of clipping path from different kinds of photography firms.  The clipping path is also known as closed vector path or shape. In short, it’s a process of cutting out the clip from their background. In a broad sense, clipping path is a special technique of deleting or changing the shadow position, concealing some objectionable a piece of the image and changing the inessential image background by using some photo editors.  Though a special pen tool is mainly used to manipulate the overall image but, it’s really very difficult edge vector masking procedures since the main focuses are to separate various factors of a photograph. When clipping path is applied to any image, final cut of an image emerged as all the factors are included in the inside and other factors of the outside are discarded. Some of the images are having an intense and delimited edge, for those types of image, clipping path is the best option. There are few reasons why clipping paths are getting popular to the photographer day by day, they are such as:  1. Quality always matters. Where some others photo editors fail to give the exact outlook or lapsed to obtain the best quality, there clipping path is the best in making some extra effort to give its best result by using the pen tool.2.

Simple complex clipping path:Attached types of images are the part of the simple complex clipping path.

So I have an engineering/MBA degree, why should I choose a photography career? Questions like this often pop inside us while we think of changing careers from white-collar jobs to business, and it's completely rational. One may have a hundred reasons to opt for a job but just a crazy decision is required to run behind the passion. Well, for me, although I wasn't a failure in academics, I wasn't good either, but I believe that it's okay to be a good photographer than being a bad engineer. There are a thousand careers to choose but very few require just knowledge to make big money. Wedding photography is one of them because all you need is creativity and command over the camera. One can profit a lot even from small events like anniversaries, birthdays, etc. In our country, events like weddings, no matter how low budget, wedding photographers charge more than 25k, where the profit margin is beyond imagination. Once you have a handful of happy clients and experience over the field, a decent wedding photography budget starts with over 100k, and then the sky is the limit. What do I need to have to start a wedding photography business? Foremost, believe. If you think you can, you definitely will. Yes, the professional cameras, lenses, and photography gadgets are too expensive for anyone thinking to start a career as a wedding photographer but hey, do you know that some famous photographers like Ansel Adams started their career with a small budget camera. In the beginning, there is no need for any fancy camera or expensive gadgets. For starters, the investment may cost under 100K, which could be recovered in mere three-four wedding projects. One can also hire freelancer photographers just to kick start their business. But what about the market? Isn't there like a hundred photographers in my city, with expensive gadgets and experience? How can I possibly think of competing with them? Hundred, probably true but does it even matter? If you have a camera, you have the market. Investment or gadgets doesn't speak, work does. There may be hundreds of photographers around your city but have you ever wondered how many people reside near your locality? Probably thousands, isn't it, and everyone may not have enough savings to buy a car, but one day or other, everyone will get married for sure. Now imagine the market just around your house. Some may have contacts with some good photographers but most of them don't. The only thing you need to do is a little research about those clients and market your work. Once you get recognition in the market, people will definitely approach you, but it's important that your work must be a masterpiece. How does it feel to be at weddings, clicking strangers? One word, awesome. A wedding is always a happy moment and who won't love to snap smiles, laughs. Dancing, singing, and party, what else could be more joyful. Stories aren't just meant for papers but it's also captured in snaps and that's what a wedding photographer does, pens stories of love & emotions, via camera. Also, if you're a foodie, just like me, there can't be a perfect job like this. What we should always remember as a wedding photographer? Goodwill & honesty is the key to success in every business, and it comes with hard work and dedication. Wedding maybe a routine for a photographer, but for clients, it's an onetime event, so the one behind the camera must be an expert, because those moments pass in a jiffy but is remembered for decades. It's important to remember that every image is a frozen moment and so it must be captured expertly. One must not jump without adequate knowledge and experience over photography. In this field, fame and defame are just synonyms of success and failure. It's not important of how one captures or what gadgets are used, the result must bring smiles, it must satisfy the clients. A happy customer will bring a couple of more clients but an unsatisfied one will spread negativity, a real reason why some people don't achieve what they target. My view : Altogether, it's a perfect career for someone looking for lifetime adventure and excitement. Adventure because you'll have to travel a lot, eat a lot and excitement because you'll see new faces, meet strangers, and make new friends almost every day. There may be struggles at the beginning but once you master your gadget, people will book appointments. There is neither estimation of how much you can earn, nor there is any retirement age. The wedding business is always a stream of possibilities. As I told earlier, if you have the right gameplan, then the sky is your limit. * The things I have shared above is from my perspective only. It can differ from person to person & place to place. Continue Reading",2021-03-05T15:00:43.878Z,"Is opting photography as a career a good decision? ",Quora
