They typically specialize in one product category, such as automobiles, furniture or housewares. They must be imaginative and persistent to communicate their ideas about new product design. To become a good Designer first, one needs to develop a set of attributes which will help him/her to deliver good design results. These attributes are. Design Thinking Empathy Lateral Thinking Research Mindset Observation and Listening Skills Understanding Context Great Communication Business KnowledgeBeyond studying users, designers need to also grasp why projects were initiated in the first place and how the company measures product success. Non ConformistRather than forming a belief of what a solution can or can’t be, a great designer will often ask, ""What if?"" and ""Why not?"". Designers often see rules as guidelines. This freedom of thought is what many call creativity.[1] ConfidenceBuild confidence. Build confidence by asking for criticism (while having thick skin!), thinking logically about your design decisions, being brutally honest with yourself about your design decisions, working really hard, and developing great communication skills.[2] Now to become a good Industrial Designer, you should be good at: Sketching - It’s the way of communicating your idea and understanding of a concept for a design. ( If you are good at sketching, practice to become better and quicker. The key is not to just sketch better but to be able to sketch out quickly and easily even the most complex of ideas. Start with basic pencil sketching then transition to digital sketching using Photoshop, Sketchbook,etc. )Modelling and Rendering - After sketching of a design concept, the next step to perform for the Industrial Designer is to build a 3D CAD model for better understanding of the form of the product. Rendering helps to perceive the product in a realistic setting.( Master modelling skills with softwares like Solidworks, Rhino, AutoCAD,etc. and rendering skills with Keyshot, 3Ds Max,etc.)Solid Technical Understanding - To design something better you have to first understand how it is gonna work. Having good technical knowledge regarding a product helps the designer integrate technology with design and provide better innovative design solutions.( Keep yourself updated with the modern technologies to make the best use of them and try integrating them with a design idea )Problem Solving - At its core, industrial design is the practice of solving problems. Educate yourself with different problem solving techniques which will not only help you with design problems but also with any problem in general.( Explore courses on Problem solving in different websites like edX, coursera, etc. )Design is not like any other technical subject or course which you can educate yourself with to land up a job. Becoming a designer requires developing yourself first. That’s what is so great about a design course. They develop you to become a better person first then you become a designer. I’d suggest you to definitely read a lot of relevant books. Some of them to start with are: Change by Design by Tim Brown.[3]The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman.[4]Creative Confidence by Tom & David Kelly. [5]The Art of Innovation by Tom Kelly. [6]Design Thinking Methodology by Emrah Yayci. [7]Originals by Adam Grant. [8]Hooked by Nir Eyal. [9]The Art of Creative Thinking by Rod Judkins. [10]Well Designed by John Kolko. [11]Emotional Design by Don Norman. [12]Universal Principals of Design by William Lidwell. [13]Lateral Thinking by Edward De Bono. [14]Read more and more about design and technologies to understand the concept of design better.Lastly, remember that Discipline is the key to success. So practice everyday to master the skills.

Product design is about creating artistic product - taking ideas from scratch to finished solutions, most often sold as designer items in quantities of 1 or 2 pieces of finished quality. As a product designer it is not mandatory to have knowledge on manufacturing processes or producing CAD drawings. These products tend to be artistic manifestations and fit within novelty territory. Industrial design is about creating ideas for mass production, i.e, creating concepts that can be manufactured and be sold. Therefore it requires a bit more work in transferring and customising designs (product designs) to make it ready for manufacturing. You require knowledge of manufacturing processes and operations in order to do your work. Some key highlights Product design can be considered to be a subset of Industrial design.Industrial design can include - product design, furniture design, footwear, and in certain cases fashion and interior design.You can survive in product design without technical knowledge, but you definitely need to have technical/engineering knowledge to be an industrial designer. Unless you are doing early concept works.In industrial design you also learn about business aspects, in order to customise the products to match the business and market needs.In general, product design is more about creating solutions, industrial design is creating solutions and taking them to manufacturing. An industrial designer can be a product designer, but a product designer cannot be industrial designers. concept ———product———production———market product designer ——————————— industrial designer ————————————————————————— (previous answer) Product design is a subset of the industrial design. Industrial design deals with any manufacturable/produceable product, i.e. is requires industry processes and operations. It also covers the whole lifecycle - from initial research to manufacturing. These designers also work on producing manufacturing drawings and redesign for manufacturing operations. Product design deals with developing concepts from research to renderings and prototypes. It is one part of the whole lifecycle, primarily in the initial phase. These designers in principle are not involved in working with the manufacturing activities and handover the designs to them. But since there is overlap, most people and in the industry use the terms interchangeably. Further there are people from engineering side who also use similar or same terms. to summarise, industrial design is more of whole lifecycle focused on end-to-end design activities while product design is focused on conceptual designs and developments. UPDATE: a more concise answer is that: Product Design is focused on products , its design and development. It is more focused on the users, the product and the interaction between them. Product designers can be seen working with users and the product-systems Industrial Design is taking ideas from concepts to business integration. It is focused on the users, the products and the systems, the interaction and service in regard to the business value. The difference is in the business integration, which is mostly in form of CAD and manufacturing drawings, service design and system design. Industrial designers can be seem working more in relation to business operations and translation of designs into business value. (appended) The name itself conveys the difference.

To be frank, I really had no clue what PD is all about, when I first decided that I wanted to pursue design after school. Till the end of my first year, I really just did what we were told in class and that was pretty much it. No real process, a very vague, almost primitive understanding of what design is all about. It was only until I started doing a few projects, and interned at a system analysis and software development firm for 2 months, the design process started making sense to me. And that was when I took it a lot more seriously for every little thing I did. Some common stereotypes I found in PD was the big hype about sketching. IMO, all that matters is getting your idea across. More than sketching, design (any kind of design), is about story telling. How well do you captivate attention, to tell your audience the story. What is the story about? It is about why you do/did what you do/did, for who you do/did and of course, how you do/did. If you can answer all of these questions to anybody, you’ve really made your design count. If you’re an aspiring product designer in India, IMO, the scene is already overtaken with a HUGE number of engineers - undergraduates, graduates, and 50–60 year old people with a solid technical background who have merged into design fields such as ergonomics and form factor development. So if you think just sitting, ideating, sketching and digitalising your sketches and making things look pretty is going to land you a job, think more. The only way to sustain yourself as a strong product designer is to have a good technical understanding. Pick a field - education is my favourite. Crafts and handicrafts have enormous scope as well. Think about your role in the field. Study things, perspectives, people, culture, anthropology, languages, tradition, mindsets, human social interaction. Derive inspiration. Find loopholes. Learn more digitalising than just Photoshop Illustrator KeyShot Rhino. Envision the future. Read a tonne of books. Watch random shit. Live mentally stimulated. The country really needs some good Design Process. Policy makers, engineers and practically everyone else isn’t taught how to think. Your user study, market study has to be on point for you to develop a product - not just how it looks, but how it performs, how it behaves, how it interacts, how it is going to grow. A strong, true product designer realises their true versatility. Continue Reading",2021-03-05T19:20:04.432Z,"How does one become a better product designer? ",Quora

These signs certainly grab our attention more than the standard ones.  20.A wearable device that alerts if user falls suddenly; useful for old people, and those suffering from fits, convulsions, seizures etc. This will help keep an electronic eye (if integrated with mobile) on one’s loved ones to track if they were okay or not.  21.Basket ball hoop over trash can Trash cans where you can slam dunk your trash. It’s amazing how if you turn something into a game or a challenge, people become much more interested. This small addition probably made a huge difference to how many people put their trash in the actual bin!  22.A head worn device that cools down our nerves within a quick time after wearing. Believing that getting angry frequently may lead to unnecessary stress and hyper tension,  23.Mug coaster that converts cold/heat to charge your device A coaster that uses hot or cold drinks to charge your device, innovation at its finest!  24.Anti-tangle earphones Earphones that will never tangle! We can’t believe this idea hasn’t taken over the world! Tangled headphones are unbelievably annoying!  25.Space-saving bike racks Space saving bike racks that don’t take up any sidewalk when they’re not in use.  26.Backpack with built-in hoodie A backpack with a built-in hoodie. What a great concept! It would be cool if it was a detachable hood so that you can decide if you need it based on the weather.  27.Tile tracking device for keys This Tile has a tracking device that you sync with an IOS app so if you ever lose your keys you can locate them. Brilliant! What a great way of offering that extra peace of mind that all is not lost if you misplace your keys. Also, if someone takes your keys, you have a chance of retrieving them.  28.How about storing things under the stairs?This saves a lot of space.  29.Clean your head without using hands  This 15-minute shampoo treatment begins when you lean your head back into a machine that looks like a sink at the salon. First it maps your scalp, then it shoots streams of warm water and foam shampoo from its 28 nozzles before 24 silicone “fingers” work up a lather. One conditioning mist, scalp massage and light blow-dry later, you’re done. 30.  If you slump down when you’re typing on an ErgoSensor monitor , it’ll suggest that you sit up straighter. To help office workers avoid achy backs and tired eyes, the device’s built-in camera follows the position of your pupils to determine how you are sitting. Are you too close? Is your neck tilted too much? Algorithms crunch the raw data from the sensor and tell you how to adjust your body to achieve ergonomic correctness. The monitor can also inform you that it’s time to stand up and take a break, and it will automatically power down when it senses that you’ve left. PEACE!!

One example, by the Design Management Institute, revealed that design-led companies like Apple and Nike have maintained significant stock market advantage, outperforming the S&P by an impressive 211 percent. As a result, we've seen a shift in business priorities for many forward-thinking organizations where design is making significant impacts. However, it’s important to know that design-driven companies are built upon the company culture, not just staffing designers, and many startups make this mistake when hiring their first product designers. That said, especially if you're a young company, here’s 3 signs that you’re not ready to hire a designer yet: 1. You just want to make things look pretty. Steve Jobs said it best: ""Design is not just how it looks, but how it works."" Design has been historically associated with graphic design as a function for marketing and branding--and that association continues despite the changing role of design in technology. I've been amazed at how often design is assumed to serve as decoration--so much bad design is simply decoration. Design is more than an artistic craft. It's a strategic tool for achieving business objectives. In order to design great products, services or campaigns, you need to understand not just what you're making, but why you're making it and for whom. You do that by empathizing with your customers to feel their pain, understand their problems and motivations, and solve for those needs. Context is a designer's ammunition, and designers are ineffective unless they have a clear understanding of the problem. Which brings us to our second reason... 2. You haven't taken the time to understand your customer. This goes beyond just building a demographic profile of your customer. Great design requires sensitivity to many levels of context around customer touchpoints: Emotional Context: How does someone feel when they are using your product or service--not just during, but before and after. What's their mental state? Are they coming to you to alleviate boredom, or are they using your product during a medical emergency? Environmental Context: Where are they when they're using your product or service? What else is fighting for their attention? Do they have time pressures or spatial constraints? Social Context: How will they be perceived by others when using your product or service? Will it make them feel cool or proud? Or are you solving a problem that's too embarrassing to share with others? These are absolute requirements for designing products and services that customers love. Unless you're willing to invest the time to build a clear picture of your customer's problems and motivations, you run the risk of falling short of great design. This risk is worth taking seriously, because the alternative to great design is not no design at all, it's bad design. 3. You intend to silo design into a singular department. In my experience, I've seen too many designers hired onto marketing or engineering teams and tasked with visualizing user experiences or marketing materials. Oftentimes, the designer does not have access to customer data or high-level business goals, and management becomes frustrated with the designer's output and loses faith. The reality is, great design is an attitude more than a skillset. In order to successfully integrate design into your company, it needs to be done on a cultural level and from the top down. Design thinking is not just something that needs to be represented by designers, but the entire company. Everyone in the company becomes a designer the moment each employee is able to rally around the customer's journey. A pillar of great design is consistency, and design needs to be integrated into all customer touchpoints such as customer service centers, your website, social media, the product, or any conceivable interaction that a customer has with a brand. That said, it's no coincidence that design has moved into top level management. To become a design-driven organization, it requires more than acquiring design talent--it requires design leadership. Great design is not easy, but it's worth it. Realizing the magnitude of effort that goes into building a design culture, some companies choose the option to hire design firms or freelancers when they're not ready to make the investment of time, money, and attention. This is certainly a viable option, but if the rise in activity over the last few years has proven anything, it's that prioritizing this investment can lead to serious business outcomes that really do move the needle. Great design stems from a great design culture, and a great design culture is difficult to cultivate. Design talent these days falls under a large umbrella of writing and communication skills, coding skills, strong business acumen, and visual design. Individuals skilled in any combination of those areas are difficult to find, but they are worth the investment. After all, the one thing more expensive than building a great design culture is to have no design culture at all. Most successful startups these days are actually founded by designers (like Aribnb), proving that design should be at the foundation of the company from Day 1. Also, extensive research over the last few years has established a strong business case for the value of design.

Are you referring to the creation of the product or possibly the packaging design? Assuming it's product packaging, I'll chime in with these.  Note that this is in response to ""how to become"" and not ""how to design a product""  1. Depending on your living situation and if I had to start over, I would look for any way possible to get hired or even intern at an agency that has a track record of creating/launching successful products. You would save at least five years off of the learning curve and leapfrog others if you really plug yourself in. Follow the process from client briefing to market research, wire-framing, prototyping, testing and production. Watch and chart the experience and results.  2. Take professional courses on packaging design - WHY: this is very beneficial because many courses have you designing for widely diverse industries and products, each with different limitations. One common thread in my experience has been that you have to look through limitations and focus on opportunities. There are always limitations, whether it be money, time, content, politics, competition, etc. But thinking in opportunities is what makes it challenging and fun.   For example. I'm designing a package for a client who has a limited budget, an uninspiring logo and a small selection of photos to work with. My opportunities are that I can clean up the branding, retake the product photos and produce a final image that will not only add a higher perceived value to their offer but put them at a level visually with the most successful brands in their market. The before and after will be dramatic. This is a win-win.  3. Track down successful product designers and contact them as a student learning the trade (just as you are doing here, but you need to speak to them). Ask them for an interview, mentorship, q and a, skype chat. Formulate specific questions and get their thoughts. The more you interview the more you'll start to see themes and trends. Most people love to talk about their paths to where they are now.  4. If you have some skills as a designer, love psychology, marketing and have an entrepreneurial mentality, jump in right away and start designing for anyone who will hire you and work your way up through trial and error.",2021-03-05T19:22:07.252Z,"How do I become a product designer?

When you talk to a designer, ask them to describe their design process. What you're looking for is flexibility and drive. They should be eager to refine their ideas, approach problems from multiple angles, demonstrate empathy with users, and understand the larger goals of what they're working on.  Ask to see how they took a project from start to finish. Sketches show you ideas and the big picture. Flow diagrams can show you systematic thinking around a problem. Wireframes can illustrate how they addressed use cases.  Ask them what projects they're most proud of and why. Ask them about which projects were the most frustrating, and what they did to work through it. Were they able to turn it around? Were they able to present convincing arguments? Think specifically about what your needs are. Do you have a very complex problem that needs a painstaking hand? If so, make sure you can see examples of similar challenges or ask them to draw with you.  Present a problem and have them work with you to demonstrate how they would approach and solve this problem. Ultimately, if you get a good feeling that you can work together, inspire each other, and communicate—and you like what they come up with, that's your PD.

Some companies require that the PM also act as the PjM and handle product marketing as well.  If this is the case, the PMs job is pretty meaty as is often the case in startups.  The PM can also be considered the ""CEO"" of the product required to interface with design, marketing, engineering, finance, etc. The designer needs to follow the PM as the second most knowledgeable about the customer.  Once the problem space is defined by the PM, the designer works with the PM and dev team to identify the optimal manifestation of the product to the user.  This requires expertise in not only visual design but also interaction design, information architecture and conceptual design.  If this was not already complex, the principals for each of these differ for content sites versus web application sites. The key is to make sure that there is role clarity for both of these key positions.

In film and television, a production designer (PD) is the person responsible for the overall visual look of the production. Production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. Working directly with the director, cinematographer, and producer, they must select the settings and style to visually tell the story. The term production designerwas coined by William Cameron Menzies while he was working on the film Gone with the Wind. 1.Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called art directors. 2. It is sometimes also described as scenic design or set design. What Does A Production Designer Do? I’m explaining here international level.  Production designers may not be as well-known outside the film industry as directors, writers, and producers, but aspiring filmmakers learn very quickly that movies can never go from idea to the big screen without a talented production designer. If you’re a creative person with sharp visual awareness and great design skills, this career path might be perfect for you. To help you explore this option, here we’ll answer the first important question when considering production design: What exactly does a production designer do? There On Day One  As the head of the art department, the production designer is in charge of making sure each shooting location is perfect, prepared, and on point with the vision of the film. Film is a language of visual storytelling, and so the visuals captured by the camera matter immensely. Your locations, sets, costumes, lights, etc. all work together to create a world on screen, and this world is a crucial part of telling your film’s story. Having an incredible script and cast of actors onboard won’t be enough if what the audience will be looking at doesn’t tell a cohesive story. This is why the production designer’s job starts during pre-production alongside the director and producer of the project. The production designer takes the writer’s work, the director’s vision, and the producer’s plan, and synthesizes it into a visual story. Together, the pre-production team formulate ideas and plan for the visual context that will be used to tell a captivating story. This includes deciding on colors, themes, compositions, and other visual elements that work best to evoke the emotions, themes, and actions of each scene and the project as a whole. With their strong knowledge of art and design, including color theory, lighting, and more, the production designer will have a significant influence on the final look of the movie — and, indeed, on how the audience experiences the story. Doing the Homework  Once the desired look and feel of the movie has been decided, it is up to the production designer to make it happen. This begins with research. Production designers help identify which places and assets will be needed to create the right atmosphere for each scene. Whether it’s a sci-fi adventure set in the year 3000 or a story about the conquest of England by Vikings a thousand years ago, the product designer makes sure every detail is considered when crafting a believable set. Another big responsibility left in the hands of the product designer is the budget. They play a big hand in calculating the cost of materials and resources needed, including any CGI elements required for the movie. More often than not, the production designer is responsible for helping to steer a production around the common pitfall of a misallocated budget. Many film projects fail to bring a story to life in an enthralling way simply because money was spent unwisely, leaving certain departments with little to work with. Production designers must keep the whole film and the whole budget in mind at all times. Making the Story Come Alive  After countless design sketches and discussions with art directors, the art team is finally ready to turn all those drawings and ideas into reality. Since the art department is usually the largest on any film set, the product manager must have good management skills to make sure everything is being made with the same creative vision. This includes working with set designers, illustrators, graphic artists, wardrobe supervisors, set decorators, propmasters, makeup artists, special effects supervisors, and more. Like any creative project, things don’t always go as planned. A product designer is often called upon to come up with quick, effective solutions on set, all while making sure the whole team stays motivated, creative, and productive. The best product designers have enough patience to lead their team amidst script changes or unexpected issues so that each milestone is reached no matter what. Is Production Designer The Role For You? As you can see, product designers hold a position of unique and important responsibility within a film. As a production designer, you’ll be expected to be fully present and fully engaged from start to finish, working long hours every step of the way in order to make sure the movie looks as intended. Without the production designer’s organization, creativity, and knowledge, every area of the art department would have trouble staying focused and on the same page. And without a cohesive design, the look of a film may not be strong enough to tell its story. If you’re confident in your artistic abilities and boast a great amount of imagination, then the career path of production design may be just right for you. Even though it’s a demanding and exhausting job, few gigs in the industry offer more creative expression, fulfillment, and control than that of product designer.

Then, the engineers begin working on the product and create it. You may see as to why a product designer holds value in the current market. If you want to enter a career which is in high demand, you should choose product design. Companies require good professionals in this field because the market has evolved significantly. Designs are becoming obsolete faster. Companies have to release new products or update their old ones more frequently in order to stay in the competition. All of this demands the work of good product designers. The demand for the professionals is set to rise in the coming years so you should not worry much in this regard. Design is fundamental If you will join any of the reputed product design colleges in India, you will get to see why design is such a vital part of product development. Without design, one cannot develop a product. The design is 90% of the development as it involves visualization, conceptualization and creation of the product. Therefore, the importance of design cannot be decreased by any means. For example, in writing a book, the main work would be done by the writer. He or she would imagine an idea, create a story accordingly and then put it on paper. Even though he or she does not print the book or draw the cover art, without him or her, the book would not even exist. Such is a role of a product designer. You can take a diploma in product design to get more knowledge of this field. Conclusion You will be working alongside engineers, project managers, marketers and other professionals while creating your designs. If a product does not look good or if it does not solve any major problems, then it cannot succeed in the market. Marketing it becomes more difficult too. Therefore, the importance of a product designer is very high. Hopefully, this answer should solve your doubt. Continue Reading",2021-03-05T19:59:56.659Z,"Is product design a good career? ",Quora

A well-designed product today might feel cumbersome and outdated tomorrow. So we had to stop and ask ourselves, how does a product designer keep up with all these changes? Dan, a product designer at WalkMe, answers just that. He gives us a sneak peek at the toolbox his team uses to consistently push the product design envelope. WalkMe Team: Tell us a bit about yourself and your role at WalkMe. Dan: After graduating with a B.A in industrial design, I started my career at some of the leading advertising agencies in the world. Now, I’m a product designer at WalkMe, a role that combines both UI & UX design. WalkMe Team: What professional resources do you read? Favorite blogs/websites/magazines? Dan: There are tons of professional resources out there but there are only a few that I keep track of. They include Medium, Smashing Magazine, and 2 blogs named Hacking UI and Pixel Perfect Magazine. In addition, I follow 2 thought leaders in the digital design field with vast amounts of knowledge, Sagi Shraiber and Lior Yair. WalkMe Team: What’s been keeping you busy in the last month? Dan: We are currently working on redesigning WalkMe’s core product, the WalkMe Editor. It’s a super challenging and time-consuming process, but it’s also very exciting. Stay tuned!  “For me, a well-designed product is one that gets me emotionally involved. I love design that can create a strong reaction…” WalkMe Team: How would you describe good product design? Dan: For me, a well-designed product is one that gets me emotionally involved. I love design that can create a strong reaction, and of course should always have great usability and value. WalkMe Team: Where do you get your ideas/inspiration from? Dan: For inspiration and ideas my go to’s are Dribbble or Muzli (they are both on my homepage). WalkMe Team: How do you go about personalizing design for a large audience? Dan: Personalizing design for a large audience is always a challenge but if you can successfully keep your users in mind when designing a product, you are sure to come out ahead. At WalkMe, we do this by creating different personas that represent our user base. This process is critical because each persona helps us stay focused on our customers’ needs as we create new features. WalkMe Team: Technology is evolving so fast. How do you manage these changes and use them to your advantage when it comes to design? Dan: Staying on top of design trends, UX methods and new technology is not an easy task with the pace technology is evolving. However, I try to read often and attend community meetups where new ideas are shared. From there I am able to gain an outside perspective. WalkMe Team: How do you gather customer feedback in order to improve your product and its design? Do you work with other departments to gather this feedback and implement the results? Dan: One of the great benefits for product designers at WalkMe is that we have a lot of power users inside the company (professional services, customer success managers, sales), which makes the process of iterating design and new ideas very easy and quick. In addition, we try to make contact with our customers at least once a week in order to learn and share the insights and feedback with each other. At the end of the day, the design of the product is for the user, not just the visual aesthetics for you and me.

I believe this is something you can learn by doing. Here's what I would suggest: 1) Start with a problem to solve. Choose a problem that many other people/companies have solved in many different ways. For example: ""I wish it were easier to post photos online."" (Obviously there are dozens of products that do this but for, for the sake of this exercise, start off with the mindset that you are the first person to try to solve this problem.)  2) Ask and answer questions about the type of person who has this problem.Are they a professional photography or someone how just uses their iPhone to take pictures of themselves? Why do they want their photos online? Do they want to be able to publish them to the world or just to a select group of friends? Or do they just want an online backup? Do they care about adjusting the photos or are they just happy to upload them as-is? For this exercise it's ok to just make up the answers as long as the answers paint the picture of a realistic user. (This is usually called a user persona.) 3) Create user stories that clearly illustrate the needs of the user.The traditional format of a user story is the following: ""As a (user type), I want to (goal) so I can (reason)."" For example: ""As a professional photographer, I want to be able to upload my photos to the web so I can share them with prospective clients."" Do this for the entire experience so you get an idea of the various things that a user would need to do (upload photos, add information, view/edit/delete, share, etc). This helps you think holistically about the problem instead of being overly focused on a single aspect of the product. 4) Storyboard the overall experience.Before thinking about the user interface, create storyboards that walk through the user stories keeping in mind the user's context (where, when, why?). If you're not good at drawing (like me) just use stick figures. The idea is to get into the head of the user and look for insights that you might miss if you were to move too quickly to designing the user interface. 5) Sketch and/or prototype the user interface.Using a pencil and paper or a simple tool like Balsamiq, begin to sketch out the user interface of the things you storyboarded in the previous step. If you are technical, try not to think too much about the underlying data structures or technology choices. Instead, try to make it intuitive and straightforward using the persona from step 2 as your guide for how the user should interact with the UI (example: a professional photographer would want more capabilities than the casual user). Create a clickable prototype and use it as a real user would so you can see where things don't work and then figure out how to fix them. 6) Look at how others have solved the problem.Now that you've taken a shot at it, go to the other sites that solve the same problem and think about how they got there. See if you can figure out what specific problem they were trying to solve for which specific types of people. What makes Flickr different from Instagram? What makes SmugMug different from 500px? What choices in the development of those products make them different today? Look at how they approached the user interface and compare it to your approach. In a real-world situation, the designer is just one member of a team and the choices would be driven by business goals, user research, technology and lots of other factors. For someone looking to learn about product design, however, going through these steps will help you to think about problem solving, empathize with the user and deconstruct existing solutions.

My suggestion would be - as nowadays there are many ways to learn skills online, through sites like Coursera, Udemy, Lynda and all, that you begin your discovery by learning about a CAD tool works, and when you have understood the basics, you can focus better on what you want to achieve with it. As CADs are pretty costly, I suggest you to try a very cheap alternative - actually, it is free! Its name is Strata Design 3d SE from here and it is a pretty capable modeler and rendere as well. Then enroll in Strata Academy, which sports a lot of instructional videos so to learn the basics - and the first month is for free. This would help you dip your toe in the pool before diving in! After one month, you would probably have a clearer idea on what you want to do with your newly acquired basic 3d CAD skills, and find out the best way to pursue that goal. Good luck!

I'm currently working on a startup called Selligy (http://selligy.com), where we're building a pretty sophisticated service for field sales people with iPhones. We have three guys on the team; myself the designer, a hacker, and our CEO (who also codes some). The high level process for getting where we are today with a nearly-beta ready product looks something like this:  Determining what the product will do, could do, might doWhittling down #1 into something cohesiveSketching out and wire framing the app screen by screen, feature by feature. Every button, data field...Refining and iterating on the vision from the wireframes (we used Balsamiq)Pairing down the app to it's MVP, stripping out everything we can do without, and still having a cohesive app that solves a real problem.Design mode: go through each wireframe and lay design mockups on top.Iterate the design repeatedly and thoroughly. Then a bit more. I think we went through at least 4 or 5 initial design ideas, and a dozen or more iterations on the final direction.In parallel, our developer built a rough prototype of the app that was 'design-less', using just standard UI controls and basic functionality.We used tools like InVision to mockup the app based on photoshop designs, so we could navigate around it and make sure it made sense. This was the primary way we performed design reviews - get all the latest designs into the prototype, and browse around them on our phones.After we all agreed on the design direction for the app, and felt it was where it needed to be, I started slicing out all the individual images that go into the app, and building the screens in Xcode.More testing, more iterating, more tweaking.We use a bug tracking system to keep up with open issues, assign tickets to each person according to their roles, and work through tickets toward a final and polished product. For me as the designer that means lots of ""The font color is wrong here"" and ""Need to rework this part of the screen"" tickets. Rebuilding the design in Xcode from Photoshop mockups is a lot of work, and things often break for whatever reason.The above process has taken about a year. Our pace has picked up a lot after making all the hard decisions about what to focus on, and developing our processes and getting into a good team rhythm.    The photo above is one of the walls in our office, on to which we have mapped out our entire app, screen by screen. The large poster in the middle is a map of all the screens, and how they connect to each other. This started as an enormous full wall of wireframes which we narrowed down into the MVP. Being able to simply pull screens we weren't going to implement down made this process easy, and visual. As we did design for each screen, I would print off the latest and tape it on top of the wireframes. With further iterations, I'd stack revisions on top, so some of these screens have a half dozen versions under them, so we can easily flip back to see what's changed.  We also have used this as a visual indicator of progress. We'll attach colored post it flags to each screen to represent its status in development, from design-final, to implemented in-app, to design in the app, to functionally complete. (It helps that the Walgreens across the street was willing to stock all our supplies for us, and just charge us a few dollars when we needed to retrieve some. We used lots of paper and ink.) We also make extensive use of an internal Wiki for keeping track of decisions we make along the way, future feature ideas we want to hold on to, and documenting things that are difficult with static screens, such as interactions, transitions, expected behavior, etc.  Now we're finally at the point where we're testing and making design decisions from a functional and fully designed app. Further changes will go back to earlier phases of wire framing or photoshop mockups and then work their way back up to the app itself in an endless process of test>refine>design>deploy>repeat.   On a final note, I think there may be one step I left out above: debate. The right way to do things is sometimes self-evident, and sometimes requires an hour of arguing and debating and examining all the angles and repercussions. It's hard to plan for that though, it's just going to happen.  We'll be launching the beta in the coming weeks, and I'll probably be writing some more articles about our process on our blog - assuming anyone would find that helpful?http://selligy.com/blog/ Continue Reading",2021-03-05T20:03:11.400Z,"How do small startups manage their product design process?

Or if you have intimate knowledge of the customer from prior experience, you can highlight that and use genius design.  But without knowing more about the customer, you will either be choosing a design methodology that won't be effective, such as self-design for customers different than you or you will be spending unnecessary time and resources by going over the top and doing user-focused design when you could have used genius design. You should ask the interviewer about the target customer. 2. Understand your constraintsIt's important for you to ask about your constraints. What's your budget? How much time do you have?  What resources do you have access to?  If you dive right in, you are undoubtedly making some assumptions about these questions.  And your assumptions may be different than those of the interviewer.  If you are not comfortable asking questions or feel like it's not a good approach - you should state your assumptions, and make it clear that in a real-life situation you would have confirmed/tested these assumptions prior to moving forward. 3. It's the process, not the outcomeTypically, interviewers care more about the process you use in design rather than the outcome.  It's unrealistic to assume you can design anything within the context of an interview - personally, I wouldn't want to work at a place that wanted an outcome like that anyway.  Interviewers care about the process you use in designing the product.  Are you designing for yourself or using external knowledge or talking to customer, etc.?  This point relates to the two above - if you use the design style that's appropriate for your target customer and your state your assumptions, you will have likely articulated your process. 1.

Expired patents are a good place to start, although it is recommended to study current patents as well, to avoid infringing on other companies intellectual property rights. In the case of a brand new solution, a feasibility study is a must to ensure the solution is manufacturable. The sub-steps of this step are: Development Plan, Feasibility Study, and Design Research. Concept development is initiated after the solution direction is identified in the research step. It is then followed by designing the outline of the main features. This can be done using hand sketches on paper or digital drawing software. The tool we prefer is Sketchbook for its platform diversity, ease of use, and compatibility with Samsung Galaxy S-Pen and Microsoft Surface Pen. The sub-steps of this step are: Concept Development and Preliminary Design. Design is further developed based on the concept with all the details and parts being defined. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software is almost a necessity in this step, at least in modern times. The tool we prefer is Fusion 360 for its collaborative features that supports our online, remote, and global team. If the physical product has electronic or software components, they are also developed in this step. The sub-steps of this step are: Detailed Design and Technology Integration. Test is how a product is validated and how the design is improved. This starts with prototyping which can be digitally simulated or physically built and tested. The design is then reviewed and optimised. The step involves going back to the design steps multiple times to improve the design and reduce the risk of a future failure. We usually prefer to utilise FDM 3D printing for initial prototypes, and more time consuming high accuracy SLS 3D printing for final stage prototypes. The sub-steps of this step are: Design Prototyping, Design Test, Design Review, and Design Optimisation. Produce is the final step in the development process where final designs are documented into a standard technical format. Potential suppliers are then vetted to set up the supply chain. The production management then involves supervision of the selected suppliers, usually onsite for more complex products. Finally, quality control expert comes in to validate the products are being produced according to specifications. The sub-steps of this step are: Technical Documentation, Supply Chain Setup, Production Management, and Quality Control. At least that is what we do at my company MARND.

If you are an engineer and feel that you need a product designer for the soft issues (aesthetics/ergonomics etc) and are working on a tight budget, then by all means go for a freelance product designer. The reverse also holds true i.e. if you are a product designer. If you are a hobbyist/ inventor with an urge to contribute to the society in general with your product, I would suggest you try Quirky www.quirky.com . They will ascertain the marketability of the idea and with a huge community following, the idea can get refined over time. Your con: the idea may get rejected by their community and yet revealed to the world in general exposing you to copycats. If you have decided to hire a design firm then here's how you can go about it: Decide first whether proximity matters to you. Do you feel you need physical presence at meetings or the internet works just fine for you? (believe me, this takes precedence over everything else)Write down the tasks you would do and the firm should do.Identify 3 firms based upon 1 & 2. You could do this keeping 1 in mind and the rest, based upon their capabilities (listed on their sites/references).Create an RFQ for them to respond based upon the tasks you have written down in 2.You could go with either your gut feel (combination of cost and how you felt their presentation answered your needs, comfort level with the project manager in question etc) or the lowest quote similar to government bids.Alternatively, if you have the money, you could ask for a design shootout to assess capabilities with some money being paid to cover the costs to each of the participants. The winner then gets the contract for the overall project and everybody goes home happy, you for now the competition has thrown up the best possible candidate, the others feel they got a good shot and their costs were covered, plus you got to know two more approaches.Hope this helps.

The effectiveness of design, at the emotinal and aesthetic related level, will be minimized, will be cut down and summarized to only necessities. And as you may guess, that will be able to achieved by AI, at its best. Which is kind of great, cause most products and understanding of design, will be able to clarifed from shitty gimmicks and trends, to a point which is much closer to Dieter Ram’s manifest. Yes, minimalism will rule at its best ever. And instead of feelings, technology will dominate how things should be. (Maybe not for fashion or like similar fields) I believe, that change will happen in next 20 years, at a more visible and obvious way, exponentially. But humans are also unsatisfied creatures, which they will got motivated to rebel that minimalism trend and will come up with all kinds of shitty design approachs again, that will be defended by, naturalism, humane and anti-machinery like new trends. :) (as it happened after industrial revolution and around 70s by the effects of drugs) So at future of design, we are not going to witness anything that we haven’t experienced before.

Not only with yourself, but also perhaps with your spouse. Thus, when you age, perhaps you feel healthy, but you have to take care of a spouse who is physically challenged - this can also take a hold on you mentally. Many elderly use medicines which can give side effects as well. Side effects could be anything from dry mouth, loss of appetite/bigger appetite, constipation, feeling like you need to pee all the time, dizziness.  When aging, people deal with changes in different ways. Examples of challenges due to age could be vision, smell and appetite, problems walking or bending down, raising your arms (getting dressed), hearing, memory, control over bladder and in general the need to visit toilet, loneliness and isolation, feeling like a burden/nostalgia.   In my view, I think the most needed products for the aging population would be something that could make people feel useful and dignified, and perhaps help people continue their normal lives as long as possible. Managing on your own is very important for many people.  I have worked with elderly, both living at home and in an institution. Devices I have seen they actively use in their daily life, and find extremely important to their daily functions are: - Hearing aid - Blinking statue when someone is ringing the door or phone, or if the fire alarm goes on - Something that automatically turns off the stove after a certain time - A pill-organizer - Something to call your keys or things you loose - A device to pick up things you loose on the ground - Walkers, wheel chairs - In general the various apparatus that can assist a nurse when s/he assists an old person to get up in the morning. It not only is more comfortable for the old person, but it also takes care of the nurse health. - Crampons for your shoes if it´s snow and icey outside. We in Norway have 3 months of snow, and many elderly only stay indoor because thet fear to break their hips in the winter (which they often do). - An alarm-necklace (we call it safety alarm) which, if you fall at home, you can push a button and an alarm system calls you up on a speaker. The alarm central comes to your house if they don´t get any answer, or if the person communicates that that is necessary.  - Taller toilet-seats  - A digital calendar which tells you time and date. - Anti-slip mat in the shower/bathroom - Toilet-chair by the bed, so you don´t have to go all the way to the toilet in the night - Light that goes on when you enter the room, and turns off if you´re not in the room - HANDRAILS! In bathroom, in all stairs, close to the bed, whereever you may need something to hold on to.   ---- Devices/things I have thought of could be useful would be: - Something similar to Tinder, but for elderly who knows each other to meet up and organize to have a coffee or a walk together in the neighborhood. Could also be for people even in the same elderly home.  - A device/app that could pair up dog/pet-owners in the neighborhood and elderly that wanna have a walk, or a visit from a pet. I think this could be incredibly rewarding!! People walk their dogs many times a day, and if sometimes they could pair up with someone for 20 minutes, why not?  - A device/app that could somehow enable an old person to be of use to a kindergarden or a primary school once a week. It could be for reading a book for the kids, share stories, help with homework, or just sit and hang out with kids. Something that makes it easier for elderly to get out and be useful, but also not lonely. Almost like a job, or a purpose.  --- Now, I also would like to add that it seems like many of the hygiene and nutrition products for elderly are not at all taking into account being environmentally friendly. I don´t understand why this needs to be mutually excluded. Working in an elderly home, there´s SOO much trash from every single patient every single day and night, and I must say that it should be possible to think of a way to reduce the trash.

I did a double-major in Computer Science and HCI at Carnegie Mellon for undergrad, and then did a masters degree in HCI also at Carnegie Mellon (after completing the double major, getting a masters degree was just one summer session away). Here are the required courses for my undergrad/masters HCI program [1]. Each course was about 12 hours of work per week for 15 weeks, except for the capstone project, which was a ~4-5 months worth of full time work.  Communication Design FundamentalsCognitive PsychologyStatisticsHCI MethodsInteraction DesignUser Interfaces ProgrammingElectives x 5 (I took an Arduino lab course, a few HCI research courses, and a NLP course).Capstone ProjectOf these classes, the only course that's directly helping me working on Quora Product Design is (1) Communication Design Fundamentals, and it was taught by Jared Cole in 2007. This course taught me basic aspects of communication design inclduing form and composition, typographic design, typographic hierarchy, and grid systems. The assignments included:  Composing basic shapes like dots or squares to communicate a meaning.Designing a monogram for your initials using one of the four typefaces to choose from.Designing a flyer with limitations on typographic style. For the first few pieces, you can only use Helvetica Neue, 14 pt and no additional style. Then for the next few pieces, you can vary weight. Finally, you may vary size and weight.Designing a typographic art for a medium-length quote, communicating its meaning.Designing and binding a 50+ page book while utilizing and breaking grid aggressively.Designing anything (the final assignment). I designed a T-shirt using principles I learned from this course.We used Illustrator and inDesign (no Photoshop), but we barely touched on learning the tools (we had ~1 day each to learn both).I don't have my assignments with me now (it's on my external HDD), but you can see my friend Ann's excellent work from this course here: http://annakonyukhova.wordpress.com/ What's so great about this course was that the course heavily emphasized your design process over the final result. We were asked to make as many sketches as possible before coming up with one design to pursue (20+ sketches for each part of assignments), and then iterate on the design you chose over and over again (for a few weeks each). Jared really pushed us hard; each of us in the class was spending roughly 15 hours each week sketching and polishing. We also did biweekly design critiques, and each time I learned that even if I feel that my design is good, there's always a room for an improvement. At the end of the semester, we had to turn in a 3 inch binder with all the sketches and intermediate results (and it did fill up my 3 inch binder)! At Quora, product designers continue to iterate on design, facilitated by our weekly design critique (and daily chats). We pay attention to very subtle details, such as the languages used on our UI elements, down to the symbol level (e.g. whether to add a colon {:}, etc). I think that taking this design course really helped me set expectations on what it takes to be a professional designer. In order to be responsible for your design, you must go through countless number of iterations. A classroom setting focusing on design fundamentals really taught me how to do so. However, most other HCI courses I've taken had a wider scope and narrower focus; hence involved very few iterations on design. HCI methods and the capstone project taught me how to work well in teams (think: any MBA program), how to be a good design consultant (i.e. how to talk to your customers), and how to do usability testing; other courses taught me things I could learn by reading a book on the subject and doing some projects on my own. Those skills were nice to have, but you can pick them up along the way if you work on a startup. In summary,   Most HCI courses might not be necessary to become a successful product designer, although they could be educational and get you a job as a design consultant.However, learning design fundamentals could be very helpful. Although you can learn them by reading books on subjects such as typography and grid systems [2], learning to iterate is something you have to learn by doing, and a design fundamentals course can help you a lot with that [3].--- http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/undergraduate-program and http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/masters-program-curriculumSome design fundamental books I recommend are: http://www.amazon.com/Systems-Graphic-Systeme-Visuele-Gestaltung/dp/3721201450, http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/, and http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142.You might have heard that the only way to learn to code is by doing. If you are self teaching to code, you might get to the stage where your code compiles, but learning to architect might be hard because there's no compiler that says your code is designed well. Design is the same - you might get to the stage where your design looks passable, but getting past that point is difficult without others' feedback. And just like poorly designed code doesn't cut it to be a professional engineer, design that's just passable doesn't cut it to be a professional designer.",2021-03-05T20:09:29.778Z,"How are university-level HCI courses beneficial to future product designers?

And you can trust me, because unlike the scores of bullshit career counsellors and greedy coaching centers, I am not here to sell you snake oil and have nothing to gain from lying to you. So let's begin with clearing a lot of things up Firstly, product design is actually a vague term. “Product designer"" can mean a classically trained industrial designer, and it can also mean a person who designs digital products AKA a programmer. Both these terms tend to get conflated very easily. So its “digital product design “ that actually takes in money. Classical industrial designers do not make that much money and most of these even from top colleges like NID and IDC go do UX jobs. If you want a proper industrial design job a foreign country like the UK would be a much better option.The scope of “product design” is largely limited to digital products. Industrial design has much better work abroad, with much better companies. India cannot be a good center for design if it has no companies that export products. And it isn't. You can look this up for yourself by comparing openings right now between india and the UK or South Africa . Massive, massive difference.India is not the kind of economy that focuses on design thinking or design. We do not pay attention to good design at all, and form is only a bonus to function. Since attitudes in society are always a reflection of its economy, the reason why we don't focus on design is because india doesn't export more than it imports. India doesn't have a reputation for beautifully crafted goods unlike South Korea, Germany and Japan. So why would the need for an industrial designer arise in India?It's not a secret that India's manufacturing sector is very weak and it breaks during times of recession.India is laughably uninformed of the design industry. i have seen 3 lpa offers from some delusional companies who want fresh NID and IDC graduates! and one company wanted a UX designer from NID/NIFT only, completely unaware that nift doesn’t have ux (only a minor course)! Most companies in India don’t know which colleges are the best except for nid/iit-B and that too have no idea about fair pay. Ridiculous.The best of product design studios in the country aren’t on some hiring spree. Most of them keep it less than and around to 50 to 100 employees. Very closed off and secretive. If the rare job posting indeed does happen later, it’s very competitive and you will be phased out almost always by someone better than you, even if you are incredibly talented. Salary wise, it’s not really great. Very average payout for that kind of work. Graphic designers honestly have better opportunities, and the growth is better since the transition from “graphic designer “ to “art director “ or “creative director “ is much more streamlined and easy than the transition from “industrial designer “ to “creative director “. Plus, where do you jump to if you're an industrial designer? At least in graphic design one can branch off into marketing and communications and make a killing there. Most industrial designers remain industrial designers unless they pursue interaction design. Problem is, after age 40 to age 50 you cannot remain an industrial designer because there will 40 younger people smarter than you with a much better grasp of technology and trends.Of course, Industrial design is extremely competitive worldwide. If you aren’t in the top 8%, it will be hard to secure a job. Most product designs aren’t made in India. Big companies usually outsource their industrial work to foreign studios. The rare design by an indian is usually by a huge name in the industry (like paul sandip or Michael Foley . If you know anything about Paul Sandip, you would be aware he won the Red Dot award TWICE. The Red dot award is extremely, extremely prestigious and the fact that paul won it twice means he is a natural prodigy at industrial design. And even then, a significant source of his income is from workshops and seminars along with actually designing stuff. A top 1% industrial designer has to diversify in order to get a solid income. What does that say? And I mean, Foley designed a commonwealth games trophy for fuck's sake and even he gets a big stream of income from being a part time lecturer and visiting faculty to top design colleges). Becoming a huge name in the design industry is no easy feat and requires prodigious degrees of talent and years of skill. Not meant for everyone. At all.Industrial designers, Graphic designers and even animators from top colleges like NID and IIT's (who change their profession to ‘motion designers’) that aren’t extremely talented usually shift to Interaction design. Interaction design is extremely well paying, and its sub fields like UX, Experience and UI are also really really good. Most “15lpa 36lpa, 72lpa"" placements at NID, IITG and IITB are to software companies like Microsoft and Cognizant who employ these kids because “design thinking” is now a very important skill, so they need design researchers, or people they can retrain into Interaction designers/ UX designers. (It's also because HR departments have to report to higher management, and since they are held accountable they couldn't care less about portfolio and instead create “Super teams"" of ux designers and Ux researchers “ . Very few people graduate from these batches as proper “industrial designers and I doubt that most of them knew what solidworks was until their final year. IDC not being far behind, plenty of people who graduated from IIT-B's bdes product design 2015 batch shifted to graphics and Ux simply because of the competition, lack of jobs and growth.TLDR; Not much scope unless you are at the top 8% and most graduates transfer to better paying fields like upper end graphic design for print media or UX design in well known companies. Industrial design is EXTREMELY competitive. Like , cut-your-throat-bleeding levels of competition. To put things into perspective, nid itself acts as a design consultancy. It all depends on where you stand really. Indian colleges are very bad at training graduates in key industry skills like Keyshot,Rhino/Vray, sketching as well as actual design thinking itself. I'm including NID and IIT-B in this because we barely have ANYBODY in the very nascent 13 year old indian industrial design industry who is qualified to teach graduates. They are still your best bet because finding a person that experienced in the field who wants to teach is quite rare, let alone someone good. Finally, and most critically, a lot of students before college and during college show a very sparse understanding of what design and creativity is and they think it's art+science, which is a very very reductive approach. Design is actually a very complex field more closely related to marketing and branding , and the skill leverage required is pretty high Aka a software engineer and an industrial designer on roughly the same level of skill will not earn the same amount on graduating and the software engineer will earn more. There are way too many design studios out there, many of them making very sparse and generic content. There's so much garbage being flouted as “industrial design “ and “graphic design” that it makes me want to retch (and sites like behance and Instagram also falsely promote this fake idea of design being sketching products). It really hurts my soul to see cost burdening, inefficient, ineffective and ultimately mass manufacturing unworthy “aEsTheTic sTuFF “ being called product design when an imaginary term like product design art is a much more apt term. Graphic art is now also considered graphic design. Disgusting. The work of design graduates in india is terrible because the colleges themselves aren't up to the mark. Even Ohio state, Arizona State and California state long beach, despite being community colleges are far ahead of IDC and NID graduates at a bachelor's level. La Salle and NTU in Singapore are also leagues ahead of the so called “cream of the crop"". And when you compare these colleges to the world class stuff happening at ECAL, Umea, RCA, Loughborough and SCAD then you can see the massive gap in training industrial design graduates. The quality of industrial design at these institutions is world class innovation pushing the human race forward ,while the quality of indian graduates is generally not up to par, although a few here and there do extremely well. Design cannot exist if there is no direction. If there is no direction or brief given, it is just art. It is not design. Period. If you are an aspiring designer or a person who is the parent of an aspiring designer, please, please ,PLEASE don't take up design if your child is just “good at drawing “. Design is a very nuanced field and only the best of the best make it big. And since a huge section of the community is currently underground and away from the public eye, chances are you don't even know anyone who knows anyone from the industry. Don't be a fool. The industry is very unforgiving. The future is not in classical industrial design. Industrial and product designers have to get skills that change every year and must develop portfolios reflective of industry needs. These include coding skills, UX understanding, design research , user testing methodology etc. “Postmodern-industrial design “ is the future. Integrating industrial design with UX, animation and graphics are the way to go. A classical product designer is an antique in this new era. Do not depend on degrees, because Moore's law tells that the existing industry when you enter college is not the same as the one when you graduate, and this graph only grows exponentially steeper as we move forward in time. The only true way to create a career in industrial design or design in general is to participate in things that the industry recognizes and holds in esteem, as well as slight diversification. A degree is just a piece of paper in this industry that really holds no actual value ( and if a company asks for your college as a prerequisite, they are 9/10 times full of shit and don't have any knowledge of design). The true value in a graduate is shown in their accolades, their portfolio, their client list, their process and their network. This, is not easy. If you thought that you can make a career out of sketching things for four years, you were dead wrong. If you do make it to the top 10%, well it's actually a very satisfying business. Lots of ID departments pay at least 4 to 5 lakhs and most of them send you abroad for onsite client meetups as junior designers. I mean, who wouldn't like to live their life doing their passion? But ask yourself this: Do you honestly, to the bottom of your heart, think you're a top 10% designer? What about top 20%? Top 30%? Below that it doesn't matter. It's “cardboard box 4 lyf"" level. So burn your shoe and flashlight render sketchbooks, your shonen anime drawings and your nature oil paintings. That is art, not design. And it never will be. Design is the process, and I have yet to see anyone at a young age with a solid process. Dont waste your money pursuing this course. Industrial design is not about sketching products at all. Sketching products is only like 10% of the job and you are not going to be sketching 8 times a week. Here are some signs you are probably meant to be an industrial designer. You love “taking things apart"" and analyzing it in a deeper context. This could be as literal as taking apart objects and seeing what's inside, or it could be as abstract as critiquing films and solving mysteries.Obviously a no brainer, but you love art and sketching.You have a reading habitYou are empathetic to people's problems.Challenges exhilarate you.You are obsessed with the sculptural look of things, yet never knew what to call it. It's called “form"".You have extremely unique observations and thoughts about life.You can see things from multiple points of view.You are somewhat funny.You like “quantifying “ things.Yes, there are industrial design opportunities and yes there are jobs, but the initial pay is not going to be in double digits, nor is there a guarantee of one. It's a very very competitive industry and at least a third of every industrial design batch , even in top colleges like NID, IIT-B, MIT-ID, Srishti and stuff dont get ID jobs. Abroad too, industrial design is very very competitive and the salaries are not the highest. You need to really really be willing to sell your soul for this field. If you are passionate and will be satisfied with a lower pay, come here. It's for the very passionate and people who innately know that they have are ddesigners. At least 7/10 industrial design aspirants are not meant for this industry. And please understand that there is a much higher chance of you not getting a job vs actually getting one (around 6:1 in my opinion). There are three solid ways to make an industrial design career: Get into NID, MIT-ID or an IIT (B/G) at a bachelors level, research the field through subreddits like r/industrial design. After that work on Rhino/Solidworks from yout first year itself and build core industrial design skills. You have to be very very good. Initial salaries will be low, around 3 lpa or 5 lpa but if you can break into a big industrial design studio like maybe Desmania, Inventindia, Teqzo and such you can break into the senior design positions after a minimum of 2 to 3 years (can go up to 5 or 6 years) and can start expecting around 8 lakhs to 45 lakhs. If you are very very good and from a UG place like NID A/V/K then you can make a decent salary of 8 lpa through placements in corporate design roles. Corporate in house departments are excellent and they are vv good to get a job in and the growth, incentives and pay of these graduates is very good. At the highest of levels, industrial design is a very very fruitful career and is also very stable, because unlike UX or graphics, the basic principles dont change much and there will always be demand for consumer products.Get into NID or IIT at masters level after taking a mechanical engineering degree. This helps because industrial design requires people to know of manufacturing norms and practices.Take a basic bdes in some really really cheap college with a four year program and then go for a very good industrial design course abroad. I recommend Umea, TU Delft, DA eindhoven, SVA, loughborough, RCA , maybe a few integrated industrial design programs and such. You need to do a little research here.So if you want to know more about industrial design and its prospects, here’s a tip: Go talk to someone who actually designs stuff. Here’s a list of design studios region-wise. You should be try and talk to the people from these studios, ask about their salary, ask about job growth etc. Ahmedabad: Inventindia, Desmania. Bangalore: Empoise, Analogy, Lucid, Teqzo. Mumbai: Elephant Pune: Lemon design. Now make an informed decision. Don’t listen to stupid coaching centers or colleges trying to make a quick buck. Is it possible to have a decent, stable middle class life as an indian industrial designer? Yes. Are there companies that hire industrial designers in India? Yes, yes there are. Is it easy? No. But if you can become one, nothing really beats the stability to be honest. Very very hard to find good industrial designers, even harder to kick them out. Unfortunately, not good. And you can trust me, because unlike the scores of bullshit career counsellors and greedy coaching centers, I am not here to sell you snake oil and have nothing to gain from lying to you. So let's begin with clearing a lot of things up Firstly, product design is actually a vague term. “Product designer"" can mean a classically trained industrial designer, and it can also mean a person who designs digital products AKA a programmer. Both these terms tend to get conflated very easily. So its “digital product design “ that actually takes in money.

When most people imagine their dream home, they probably think of a large, sprawling vacation house that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. When Steve Areen thought about building his dream home, all he had to do was find $9,000 and a place to build. He did just that and, in a few weeks, he had a vacation home in the middle of Thailand that could make anyone drool.In just 6 weeks, Steve was able to create the home of his dreams.  With a Thai friend’s guidance, his son-in-law’s masonry skills and a lot of work, the team made progress quickly.  Steve was given a place on his friend Hajjar Gibran’s mango grove to build his home.  The basic structure only cost about $6,000.  In Thailand, materials are cheaper, but it’s still mind blowing to know just how little this cost to make.  The extra details and furnishings of the home brought the cost up another $3,000.  Totaling approximately $9,000 for the entire home.  It took elbow grease and dedication.  But it seems so worth it.  Not only does this dream home look cool, but the low-cost and quick building schedule is amazing.  Cement blocks and clay bricks were used to build the home, as well as some natural materials.  If he had the chance to build the home again, Steve said that he would use compressed earth blocks.  Whether it’s a home away from home or your new family residence, this dome would be perfect.  Imagine spending long afternoons swinging on your rooftop hammock.  Or gazing into your backyard pond, filled with beautiful lilies.  The dome is full of windows and natural light, really helping the house become one with nature.  On the outside of the house, Steve built steps up to the roof, you can climb the entire house if you’d like to.  Inside, all of the accents are natural.  His shower is the big stone mosaic you see here.  And the bathroom sink is made of natural bamboo and other materials.  It’s hard to believe something so cheap, relative to housing prices here, could be so gorgeous.  Every day would feel like a vacation.  Can I go here right now?  Hajjar Gibran, the friend that helped Steve build his dream home, has a dome building company.

Nonetheless, they submitted my CV. I should note that at this point I felt the overall process was a little disorganized but I was happy to hear what they had to say. I was receiving lots of emails from different people at Facebook, we bounced back a few conversations and a phone interview was arranged. For the most part, they were very helpful and friendly, quick to reply and supportive. It was really nice. The phone interview lasted just over an hour, if you include introductions etc. I only spoke with one person but I felt there were other people listening in as I was most certainly on speaker phone. This was something that was on my mind during the interview. The interview went on as most do, however I was repeatedly reminded that there were a list of questions that we needed to get through; which I found a little odd. It wasn't that we had questions to get through; I found it strange that I was reminded regularly during the interview. It preoccupied my thoughts and clouded the purpose of this initial interview a little. In a situation like this, where they came to me, surely it would have made more sense to allow the conversation flow more naturally. Afterward, I was a little unsure of how it went.  There were a lot of typical questions, but thankfully nothing ridiculous like 'If you could be a random object, what would it be?' or 'What is your greatest weakness?'. Overall it was quite pleasant. Over the next week a recruiter from Facebook was in touch to say:  After careful consideration, I don't think your experience is quite the right fit for the team right now. We love your enthusiasm and ideas with regards to Facebook, so keep them coming. This told me nothing. Also, the ""I don't think.."" got me a little. At what point was this ever a personal choice? I suppose it wasn't but I genuinely felt as though I had been taken for a ride. I wasn't disappointed that I didn't get the job I never applied for, I was disappointed because I believe this was a missed an opportunity for Facebook, I believe had I been hired Facebook would be better than it is.

An example- A new flavour of an energy drink is to be invented.Based on the different ingredients and the tastes and preferences of the target audiences with their age and the location that they stay in, their cultural food and taste-bud preferences are all collected in a computer system.Through machine learning, we can analyse all this data and create a blueprint product design, for the look, and feel as per the requirements of the company and the preferences of the design it is much easier and quicker for analyzing the outcome. The digitization of tools has helped revolutionalize the way we work and hence the product design and management space is also one sector that has largely benefitted with the machine learning technological advancements. With the help of the algorithm mathematical model is built from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. Machine learning can help understand behavioural and demographical data which can help in predicting end-user behaviour and hence the organisation will benefit in the process cycle from ideation to delivery of the products.With the help of machine learning systems, building a fully automated factory as and how we want it, is possible and we can operate all of the same with the computer systems and algorithms.An organisation wants greater outcomes in the quality and quantity of its products and the fewer the errors and greater the productivity will help us get better insights in the least amount of time with greater efficiency.To conclude, machine learning is changing the product design world. If you are enthusiastic about product management, you can look out for online courses that will help you understand more about how the products are designed and how product management works in a technologically advanced world.

604292aaed76476feda22f75,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-role-of-a-product-designer-at-Quora?-,"Joel Lewenstein At a basic level, a product designer's job at Quora is to mediate user needs, network trade-offs, and business objectives through changes to the holistic user experience. Our approach to product design is shaped around the problems we're trying to solve, which means we've developed a tailored, idiosyncratic role that’s difficult to describe quickly. Rather than try to fully unpack all of it myself, I'll instead point off to various other pieces of writing our team has done that together paint a picture of our work. Purpose Mills Baker describes why he chose to work as a designer at Quora, and why other designers should too: I think Quora is a great place to work for those who believe technology can serve human ends and want to use design in its fullest sense to make sure it does. Mills also breaks down a central theme in our team’s work: balancing and integrating both story thinking and system thinking: Story thought emphasizes subjective human experience, the primacy of individual actors, narrative and social ordering, messiness, edge cases, content, and above all meaning. System thought emphasizes 3rd-person descriptions of phenomena from a neutral perspective, the interchangeability of actors and details, categorical or logical ordering, measurements, flow, form, and above all coherence. Areas of responsibility Like all software product design teams, we are responsible for Quora’s user interface. We’re actively building out and unifying our design system, focusing heavily on typography and the core reading interactions. We primarily concern ourselves with clarity over cleverness, seeing UI innovation as a means to an end and not something to pursue for its own sake. Jackson Mohsenin explores this by examining Snapchat’s interface and the surrounding myths: I think the path forward is more research into understanding how users – and just not 18-year-old ones – understand non-intuitive gesture-based interfaces. I worry that a successful company has us confusing correlation and causation, as often happens in design, and the result will be a slew of apps that don't actually serve end user needs. In addition to the conventional focus on interfaces, product designers at Quora are also responsible for the core rules of the product, which we term the “mechanics” — a concept I’ve defined in detail: However, in a social network the “offering” is not a tangible good; it's the other users. The choices you make are not expressions of some underlying product, but mediations that govern how people interact with each other. This responsibility places designers much further into areas typically dictated by product management. And on the other end of the spectrum, our design team is also technical (CSS, JavaScript, Python, Git), responsible for building the interfaces we design directly into the production experience. I’ve written about our technical environment and how it changes the design process: These systems add up to create a design process that is not only interactive and immediate, but also represented in final context powered by real usage, mirroring the end-user experience more than a mockup or static HTML ever could. In other words, you're designing the real product, not an abstracted representation. In sum, UI + mechanics + implementation form the primary responsibilities of our product design role. Going both higher up into product and deeper down into engineering makes our process very broad and highly demanding. I’m often asked about the risk that we’re making designers jacks of all trades and masters of none. I take this seriously as an issue, but I also believe the preservation of a singular vision is powerful: The best implementation reflects the designer's intent, and the best design reflects the product's goals. There's a through-line that binds every step: the product needs to reflect a single vision, a consistent explanation (about human behavior, about the technology) for why it will succeed. The preservation of that through-line can be more important than any individual step, as a mis-aligned product competes with itself before it competes with the market. This holistic approach extends beyond the boundaries of design work, as we pursue this sort of alignment all the way from the high levels of the company’s strategy to the low levels of engineering details, a crucial dynamic for great products and something I’ve examined in other apps: In Messenger Day, we have a case where small user interface choices conflict with engineering logic, community norms, social graphs, and fundamental strategic choices. In Instagram Stories, we see harmony from top to bottom. In the design industry we tend to focus on and identify with the “pixels”, but our work is much more likely to be made or broken by the compatibility between these different levels of product and organization. This emphasis on alignment means we spend a lot of our energy on collaboration and debate, both within the design team as well as with our peers in research, engineering, product management, data science, marketing, and more. The problem space Given those responsibilities, what kinds of problems do we actually work on? A central task for us is managing the social dynamics of Quora: stewarding and nurturing our community by tuning incentives, feedback loops, rules, structures, etc. We study real world systems and the social science behind them, with the goal of making Quora a vibrant, inclusive, civil space that promotes the exchange of trustworthy and meaningful knowledge.

I don't want to be a product manager, but I still want to make the decisions in the design of the products I work on.  At Marketo, although we collaborate, the UX team has a very specific deliverable that we own top-to-bottom.  It is this spec that engineering considers the ""source of truth"" of what to build. So the answer is ""Sometimes"".  Just keep in mind, most product managers don't make good product managers.  And most designers don't make good designs. We live in a world of mediocrity.  Ugh, this is depressing.  I hope my answers helps.",2021-03-05T20:22:06.527Z,"Do product designers make good product managers? ",Quora

For my part, I tend to ask this question from the positive side though: What are some good qualities I should look for in a design candidate? I actually just finished a 3-part series on this topic last week. To sum up, the things I look for are Empathy, Curiosity, and Humility. Empathy because they need to be able to keep their fingers on the pulse of the hearts and minds of not only the people they're designing for but with their teammates, stakeholders et al. The red flags to watch out for here are indicators that they are apathetic towards the needs of others, or overconfident in their experience to solve all problems (esp. solve them alone). This aligns with Julie's ""negative energy"" point. Curiosity because we should never cease learning. Understanding how things work, how people interact with things lay at the heart of who we are as designers. Red flags to watch out for here are people who think they know everything they need to know, or don't find value in learning new things, tricks, tools, methods etc. Humility because it feeds the other two, but also because it ensures we approach our work as objectively as possible. It aligns with Julie's ""self-awareness"" point. Red flags here are designers who think they can do no wrong, or every project failed because of ""the other guy"" or ""they just didn't get me"" etc. Be very wary of others with no sense of the grand scheme of things. We're all part of a bigger picture, and while I feel strongly that the designer's role is at the hub of all of these, I believe we are there to ensure proper alignment of all of the goals of the varied stakeholders to ensure success all around, not to pursue and force an agenda at the cost of others.

It helps communicate in the same terminology and understand the constraints of the medium, even though it's nothing like writing code as an engineer.Helping engineers design abstractions that allow designers to iterate on design faster.At this point I'll defer to Designers Will Code which is much better written from the perspective of a designer first. I personally think it's a good learning experience to go build an application end to end, so my personal recommended order would be.  Learn HTML and CSS to build a web pageLearn JavaScript to handle behavior. You'll learn some basic programming and a little bit about data structures.Learn a server side language like Python or use Node if you already know JS and are hesitant to learn another. You'll learn more about data structures in the process, and this is a good opportunity to learn a little bit of computer science and algorithms along the way.Learn how to use a database to store state. This'll make you familiar with performance bottlenecks.Learn a little about software engineering, OOP, code organization, consistency and style.(Mobile Track) Learn Objective C, Swift or Java and write a simple Android or iOS app. You can use those database concepts to make it persist data and use your server side skills to create an API and make it an app that works over the web.(Optional) Learn about distributed systems, caching, replication and sharding to see how apps are built to scale. This let's you empathize with engineers and really understand system constraints.(Data Track) Learn basic statistics and the math behind A/B testing, then go explore other curiosities like machine learning. This way you can understand your design with data better and design products around data.(Optional) Learn about functional programming to see how elegant programming can be when programming itself is carefully designed. The SICP videos on YouTube are a good resource for this.(Optional) Learn about low level systems, assembly, locality, data representation, etc. basically how a computer works under the hood. You'll pick up C very well along the way.(Optional) Learn about CS theory, higher level algorithms and the limits of computation.Some would call 1 a designer who codes while others go across all of this. At about 3 you can work efficiently with an engineer. At 5 you have a decent vocabulary overlap. At 7 you can occasionally fill in and at 9 or above you can have bar talk with programmers having CS backgrounds. So people go all across this spectrum.

Designers at Khan Academy don't live in defined roles. In fact, the majority of the team came from a technical background. Over the course of my internship, I had the opportunity to grow in visual design, interaction design, and web development. At the time, the design team was spread fairly thin with only five people. On average, there was one designer per product (i.e. mobile, core, growth). We would convene every Friday for a design crit. These were great because I would get updates on each designer’s project, and also receive feedback on my own designs. As a Product Design intern, I had a great deal of autonomy. Many of my projects were self-defined. If I wanted something to change, all I had to do was ask! Outside of my responsibilities on the iOS team, I also led a design workshop with Tabitha, created invites for intern events, and redesigned the interns page.

Now an Engineer or designer seems to immediately foster the idea that you are a programmer or work in computer science. (Bare with me, almost to the point). The point, that as engineers we understand the multitude of types of engineers necessary to bring a product to completion. So, despite my initial frustration, the answer is the same for all designers and engineers. Julie is absolutely correct that you don't have to be an expert in the intricacies, but the better understanding you have the better you will be at your job. All products must be designed from the inside out once the objective or need has been established.  If the outside or boundaries are too confining the entire process will be stifled. There is also the flip side, if the designer knows too much about the intricacies this my stifle there ability to say, what if? This is what often makes engineers poor designers. believe for an engineer and designer to occupy the same body is quite rare. At Adept, Inc.

Customers’ requirements The product designers must consider and study the requirements of their targeted customers.

Production facilities The product designers must check that production department has got all necessary facilities to produce a product. Simple product design requires minimum production facilities. This will make the job of production department easy, and it will also minimize the cost of production.  3. Raw-materials to be used The type and quality of the raw-materials to be used, greatly influence the design and making of a product. The designer must have proper knowledge about latest materials, which are required to produce the product.  4. Cost to price ratio Cost is one of the main factors, which influences the design of a product. Sometimes the product designer is informed about the maximum cost of the product. So he has to design the product within this cost. In such a case, he has no freedom to over-design the product. The product designer is also guided by the cost of competitor's products. 5. Quality policy The design of the product is guided by quality policy, which is fixed by the top level of management. This policy gives, guidelines for quality standard. It sets the design trend for the future. It also builds a particular quality image of the company's products.  6. Plant and machineries The product design depends on the availability of plant and machinery. The designer must not design a product which cannot be manufactured by the machines available in the company. The machines to be used for production should be of good quality and in a better condition (well maintained) to meet the needs of the product designers and the quality standards. 7. Effect on existing products The product designer must consider the impact or effect of the product design on the existing products of the company. An upcoming new product may badly affect the sale of existing products. The designer must avoid this situation. For e.g. a company may design a low-quality product, but it may badly affect the sale of its high quality existing product. Secondly, if a new product is going to replace a former product, then it must be able to use the same manufacturing and distribution strategies of the existing product. 8. Reputation of the company The product designer must consider the reputation of the company in the market. Companies which have a good name and goodwill in the market will want their new product designs to match or keep up their positive image.",2021-03-05T20:27:32.606Z,"What are essential factors one must consider while designing any product?

Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.Good design is aestheticThe aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.Good design makes a product understandableIt clarifies the products structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.Good design is unobtrusiveProducts fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the users self-expression.Good design is honestIt does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.Good design is long-lastingIt avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today’s throwaway society.Good design is thorough to the last detailNothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.Good design is environmentally friendlyDesign makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the life cycle of the product.Good design is as little design as possibleLess, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.

(And maybe Joel Lewenstein and/or Shu Uesugi (上杉 周作) will weigh in with their experiences as well.)  Introspection. This may sound wishy-washy but it's tremendously important. I use Quora every day, observe the flow of content and the community, and introspect about my experiences with the product. In doing this I strengthen my intuitive sense of the way different parts of the product shape user behavior.Interface design & programming. Most, though not all, of our projects involve some component of interface design. It's worth stating that we do all of this work directly in code (see Joel's amazing post Life Without Photoshop). So I write a lot of Python and JavaScript, play around with what I've built, and make changes as necessary.  My desk. Not a Photoshop to be found!  Information gathering. We have a number of resources available to us to help us understand a problem better. Aside from conferring with my fellow Quora employees, I might browse through logs and look at data trends, read the feedback emails we get, consult with admins and reviewers, or even just talk to people through the site.Decision making. As Rebekah put it in her talk Design @ Quora, design is a set of decisions about a product. It stands to reason that decision making is a large part of what we do, and it takes a number of forms. We choose which goals to pursue, decide what our metrics of success are, and set priorities for the problems facing us. For every project I work on, I take the question ""Should we do this, and why?"" very seriously.Taking risks and guessing well. Push early, push often! There's no such thing as a perfect design. Quora has a life of its own and we don't have time to second-guess ourselves. Therefore, it's actually a big part of my job to trust my own judgment and be willing to make mistakes. Every mistake is a learning opportunity that will make the product better in the end.We apply the above toolset to everything we do, from building a new UI component to solving a usability problem to thinking about how a new feature will shape the direction of the product. Large or small, every project deserves this level of care and attention. It's also worth saying that none of this would be possible without the support and collaboration of the founders and a team of very talented engineers, who we work closely with on a daily basis. So I suppose the final point should be listening and working together. Great work doesn't happen in a vacuum.",2021-03-05T20:32:50.408Z,"What do the Quora product designers work on at Quora? ",Quora

Some of them landing the first job as an UX designer. Some of them choose to be a product designer. How about you? Which one do you want to be? You need to make clear a problem first. Product designer VS UX designer: what are the differences between them? Part 1. The Definition of Product Designer and UX Designer The product designer handles the overall function and working process of the product. They are the guardians of user needs. UX designers are responsible for the function of the user interface and user-friendly experience. Part 2. Product Designer VS UX Designer: The Different Responsibilities In fact, no one can accurately classify the responsibilities of product designers and UX designers.After all, different companies have different demands for designers. I summed up their responsibilities as follows. Product Designer Responsibilities  1. Study the user demand through the market research. Generate the market requirements document. 2. Be responsible for overall design of new product and draw up a design plan. 3. Take part in or supervise the prototype design of new products. 4. Organize the team for product development and follow up product development to ensure process. 5. Analyze product operation data, optimize product and put forward reasonable operation suggestion. 6. Improve the product or design the new product centers on user experience. UX Designer Responsibilities 1. Make an analysis of competitive products from several aspects. Interview users after collecting the relevant data and then issue the requirement document. 2. Draw a use flow chart, make low-fidelity prototypes and modify it. 3. Define interactive design solutions for product prototypes and create high fidelity prototypes. 4. Grasp the interface style and layout of the product. Design the text of the key page. 5. Test the feasibility of the product after finishing the interaction design. Find out the existing problems. 6. Optimize the design to improve the usability of the product. Above all, it is not difficult to find that product designers and UX designers job duties are similar. Product designers have a wider range of work. They not only need to know the user experience design process but also take part in the most UX designer work. Part 3. Product Designer VS UX designer: What Are Their Focus? Product designers and UX designers have different responsibilities, so the concerns are different.  Product Designers Pay Attention To The Following Questions. Who will buy the product and how to use it? How to make the product convenient and safe to use? How to make the appearance of products more attractive? How to make the product cost less? UX Designer Focus on Two Aspects. Is the product easy to use? How to make a user-friendly design? Part 4. Product Designer VS UX designer: What Tools They Use? Tools are an important part of UX and product design. To meet different design effects, product designers and UX designers should be different in using tools.  Tools for Product Designer Mind mapping tools: Xmind. It is easy to use and has a concise interface. There is no learning cost. Sketch tools: paper and pen. It’s simple, efficient, easy to modify, low cost. Low-fidelity prototyping tool: Mockplus. It is easy to use and quick to interact. It can quickly build low -fidelity prototypes. High-fidelity prototyping tool: Sketch. It can make rough wireframe more standardized and has good visual effects Tools for UX Designer Wireframe design tools: Wireframe.cc - minimal wireframing tool. It has no complicated icons and toolbar. Both of interfacestyle and operation are the minimalist. Interactive design tools: AdobeXD. It positions itself with a lightweight vector and prototype software. You can freely switch interface design and prototype interaction. Prototype design tools: Axure Rp. It supports high fidelity and low fidelity. It has good documentation support. The plug-in library of it can be customized.

Product design is not about, beautiful sketches, flawless renderings or precise 3d mockups. Its about first establishing the problem and a solution to a human need; then leveraging these solutions to build something. 3) Keep Thinking : Maintain an idea book. The luxury of a human mind is to travel back in time, into the future and stay in the present. The interesting thing would be to ask yourself a variety of ""what if"" or ""how might"" questions. for example; ""How might the healthcare system work in 2060?"", ""What if you were employed by the medici family as a war engineer, what would you build ?"", ""How might you encourage children to eat healthy food ?"" and so on. This is a tangible practice in understanding product opportunities. And a concrete solution is what ought to be practiced. As far as aesthetics and other gobbledygook is concerned, they only add to the designer's interpretation of a solution, as they are supremely subjective by nature; i.e, no one can judge it. (PLUS POINT : READ ! Reading about innovators and inventions {or anything for that matter} allows you to think expansively about problems.

Providing good solutions. Design Methodologies Instructional, Thinking, Agile, System, or X Problem? Design brings forth what does not come naturally. While science is concerned with how things are, design is concerned with how things ought to be. “Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state.” - Herbert Simon (Nobel Prize Winner & Carnegie Mellon professor)  The table below shows five popular design methodologies (Instructional System Design, Design Thinking, Agile Design, System Thinking, and X Problem). It includes definitions, visual models, primary focus and goals, values, main steps, and further readings. I don't claim these are the absolute parts that make up each design approach as the definitions, goals, primary focuses, and steps may vary greatly from source to source. However, the tables notes the key points that seem to separate them from each other. Going from left to right, the models generally are designed for solving semi-structured problems to increasingly ill-defined problems, however, the type of problem and the skills of the designer will generally depict which model might work best for a particular situation. In addition, choosing a primary methodology does not mean you cannot borrow or change processes with another model as you are in control of the design, rather than the methodology being in control—design is both art and science. If you would like to discuss any of these design models, please leave a comment on my blog post. ISD or ADDIE Design Thinking Agile Design System Thinking X Problem Visual Model Definition A systematic approach for developing learning platforms. Applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe complex, ill-structured problems and develop approaches to solve them. A method for breaking tasks into small increments with minimal planning that do not directly involve long-term planning. The iterations are short time frames that typically last from one to four weeks. Problem solving by viewing ""problems"" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to a specific part, outcome or event and potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences. Used to solve wicked or complex problems for 21st century challenges that defy conventional planning. Primary Values Obtains business results through improved performance. Focuses on the wider social space of systems and society rather than artifacts and aesthetics by expanding engagement, impact, and sales. Builds a vibrant learning environment through communication, collaboration, and small but rapid iterations in order to sustain agility that adapts to a changing environment. Uses a holistic approach to goal seeking rather than focusing on independent elements in order to build a systemic interaction that results in a goal or final state. Uses extreme adaptive approaches to innovate when solving wicked problems, rather than designated steps that normally do not work well when facing such problems. Key Feature An older methodology that has rapidly evolved into a robust model for solving more structured problems. While focus is primarily on the problem and product, the model does use customer feedback for solving ill-structured problems. The model relies heavily on customers being part of the team so that changing requirements can be adapted to. Best for complex problems that effect an entire system or organization. Used for wicked problems that borders on the edge of chaos. Example This methodology relies on a viable model to build the design (think of a guru who is the best performer to seek advice from): You have an Exemplary Performer or a model of one that informs you of how the task or process should be performed. This methodology relies on the designers or experts for building a best design (think of the iPad that no one thought they needed until it was available): There are no models of the task or process so the designers, and perhaps with the help of experts, develop a new task or process. Customer feedback is normally used after the initial model has been designed. This methodology relies on customers who have the insight to be major collaborators in the design (think of a complex process in your company that relies on a number of employees and needs improvement): There are no clear models of the task or process so the customers, designers and sometimes experts collaborate to build a new model. The design is built using small iterations so that the customers can ensure they are getting a viable solution that fits their needs. This methodology relies on gaining an understanding of the organization as a whole (think of a complex process in your company that spans several departments or borders and needs improvement): Similar to Design Thinking in that there are no models of the task or process so the designers and/or experts develop a new task or process. However, it is realized that the solution may have a detrimental affect on a large part of the organization, thus the solution must be fine-tuned to span the entire organization. This methodology is used for extremely wicked problems (think of a solution that often brings more new problems than it solves, such as diversity training or a new performance feedback program): The problem and its solution cannot easily be grasped by the customers, designers or experts. Thus a new set of “eyeballs” work alongside the employees with the purpose of gaining an insight. When a new insight is discovered, a “test” design or solution is tried to determine if it is viable (called a “Design Iteration”). This process is continued until enough viable solutions have lowered the problem to a desirable state. Main Steps or concepts: 1. Analysis: understanding and then describing the objectives needed to correct performance deficiencies (identify goals) 1. Apply critical thinking to gain understanding of the problem 1. Select the project and develop the vision. 1. Tell stories that focus on a narrative that will aid in discovering the issue. 1. Immersion: soak yourself in the problem to harvest customer insights and gain empathy. 2. Design: a process to achieve the goals in order to correct the performance deficiencies 2. Observe to understand the operational environment 2. Initiate the project by obtaining stakeholder participation, funding, and build team. 2. Look for trends in performance patterns 2. Convergence: bring together all things such as physical, technology, software, and services into a logical design 3. Development: building the initial discoveries into a process that will assist the learners to become expert performers 3. Solve the right problem by defining it 3. Deliver small working iterations that meet the changing needs of the stakeholders. Normally uses Release Iterations - although the release may not be fully completed or functional, the designers believe that it is good enough to be of use to the learners or users. 3. When a trend becomes visible, develop a focus question that describes the context of what you are seeking 3. Divergence: explore new advantages. Unlike Agile Design, which mainly uses Release Iterations, Problem X mainly uses Design Iterations — the iteration is performed to test a method, function, feature, etc. to a small population of learners to see if it valid. 4. Implementation: deliver the learning platform 4. Ideate: imagine or conceive solutions to solve the problem 4. Release End Game (deliver the final package). 4. Look for key causes and consequences 4. Adaptation: stay nimble in a fast-moving environment by going in new directions when facing roadblocks. Use your recent learning's of the problem to help guide your new direction. 5. Evaluation: ensure the learning and performance platform is delivering the desired results 5. Adapt to dynamic conditions by prototyping 5. Production — operate, maintain and support the system 5. Look deeper into the problem. Are beliefs and values causing the situation to persist? 6. Achieve the designated goals 6. Retirement — remove when no longer needed 6. Plan an intervention by basing it on your understanding of the structure. What approaches and actions are needed? 7. Assess the results and fine-tune.

Many other colleges offer traditional form-focused product design, but there is undoubtedly a modern and tech influence at Art Center—maybe even more so than at tech schools like Carnegie Mellon and MIT. Art Center is quite competitive for product design (>20% admission rate) and students who come here are generally more mature. While it does not lend itself well to a traditional college experience, you get to spend four years in sunny Pasadena. Rhode Island School of Design, RI, USARegarded as the premier art and design school of the world, RISD’s product design program is reflective of its reputation. The program focuses on traditional product design like furniture and is situated within a larger art program. The facilities are second to none and the ability to take classes in other artistic domains is great. However, for some students the foundation program and mandatory out-of-major classes can cut into valuable time spent learning commercial industrial design skills. Admission here is competitive as well (20% acceptance rate) Carnegie Mellon University School of Design, PA, USAAs the first degree granting industrial (product) design program in the United States, design at CMU has a long history. This partly explains what differentiates design here. While the program focuses on the more traditional product design, interdisciplinary learning is the crux of the CMU experience. It’s not mandatory to take many outside classes, but nearly everyone chooses to do so. Here, students can easily seek dual majors and minors or take classes in the humanities or drama department. CMU is also one of the only programs situate in a larger university and can offer a “normal” college experience. The design facilities are fairly mediocre, but I should note that this is somewhat mollified as students can access some facilities in other departments. The program here has a reputation for an intense workload and while this is true it is misleading if not qualified. Though the first year might be an exception, the workload is mostly self-driven. People at CMU are deeply passionate about some dimension of design and personal ambition and self-satisfaction is the primary reason people work through the night. Finally, I should note admission is quite competitive (7% acceptance rate).

Rewinding Live TV:Cox: If you're not watching the TV connected to your ""main"" DVR box you can't rewind. Well, you can rewind, but only after you press pause. Then you can only rewind the show back to the place where you pressed pause... So unless you planned ahead to miss something you can't really rewind live TV. Oh and if you don't press pause every few hours it stops working.DirecTV: Just press the rewind button... It's simple and easy. No long term planning required. Fast Forwarding:Cox: Every time you press Fast Forward it scans forward faster, but then when you press Fast Forward one too many times you go back to Play. HUH? Who though that was a good idea?!?! I pressed Fast Forward what made you think I wanted Play?!?!When you do press play you usually have to use the jump back a few times to get to the start of the show.DirecTV: Every time you press Fast Forward it scans forward faster. When you press Fast Forward one too many times you hear a soft beep and the show keeps fast forwarding at the maximum speed.When you press play, the DVR automatically jumps back a few seconds (based on your rewind speed) so I don't have to try and find the start of the show.

Now, you might not wanna make something that looks like this:  Or this:  Credits to artists Paul Schietekat and Katerina Kamprani who made these creations. Instead you might wanna stick to proven concepts, materials, manufacturing methods and market trends.

How literally you mean the question By this I mean: if you take it at face value - ""is product marketing part of ux design"" the answer is no, not really. They are adjacent parts of creating something. You can market a product incredibly well (or incredibly badly, of course) without doing anything to design its experience. There are many websites of various sizes that don't have anyone ""responsible"" for their UX design. However the caveat here, of course, is that in such a situation there is still an experience: it just hasn't been consciously designed. But if you take it a little more broadly and a little less literally, yes it is. You cannot, in fact, have an experience that isn't designed. Even if you didn't pay conscious attention to it, there's still an experience that, by nature of your working on the product, you have designed. And how you market said product is a small part of that experience, in that the user experience that customers have with your product is affected by how it is or is not marketed. A quick example of this is Google, of course, with the (relatively) recent string of tearjerker commercials they've had for Chrome and such. Your experience with Chrome, if you've seen the marketing for it, is likely affected by it because they're likeable. Now to take it still a bit broader, product marketing itself can be a much broader term. You can think of user experience as a part of product marketing, in such cases, because how people experience your product is, indeed, part of the way you tell the product's story to the world. What kind of organization is answering it Now this is a different question entirely, and it depends on how an organization structures itself. For myself I have worked in organizations where the UX team was part of ""consumer marketing"" and others where it was part of ""business development"" and others where there was no UX team, maybe just some web developers in the marketing or technology organization. I don't think there's any one-size-fits-all answer for this, even in the most design friendly of organizations. Consider Apple, for example. Apple doesn't put all of its designers into a user experience design department, instead putting them on teams that build products, but it does indeed have a separate product marketing department. But other design friendly organizations, Twitter for example, or Google (if you consider them design friendly) do indeed have separate teams for design and product marketing. One could argue that this works better for Apple than it does for Twitter and Google, as many of Twitter's and Google's marketing decisions don't appear to be particularly user friendly, but it's still true that they are all beloved companies with great designers and great product marketing people working for them.

This path-breaking solution offers a number of unique benefits including, 50 to 60% power savings compared to conventional ceiling fansLow noiseEasy remote control based operationEnergy Efficient Ceiling Fan: Brushless DC (BLDC) motors offer several advantages over conventional AC operated ceiling fans, including higher efficiency and reliability, reduced noise, longer lifetime (no brush and commutator erosion), elimination of ionizing sparks from the commutator, and overall reduction of electromagnetic interference (EMI). In general, BLDC motors are often more efficient at converting electricity into mechanical power than brushed DC or AC motors. This improvement is largely due to the absence of electrical and friction losses due to brushes. The Solution: The product enabled a complete solution to ceiling fan manufacturers including the power supply board, the controller board and remote controller. This solution has been extensively tested with a commercially available 24V BLDC motor and ceiling fans with blade lengths up to 1200 mm.  The solution includes the hardware and controller firmware for BLDC motor and IR receiver. The switch mode power supply (SMPS) is capable of operating from 190V - 270V AC. Detailed specifications are listed below.   Product Customization: This highly energy efficient ceiling Fan solution is available as a turnkey for ceiling fan manufactures.

Everyone on the team is nice, humble, and monstrously talented. We get to design the first system in the world that connects people to the things they love, and on top of that help them achieve their dreams in real life. What's not to like?   The Creative Team just one year ago at the end of 2012. Me and the team I'm the first product design hire at Pinterest, and have been with the company for nearly three years at time of writing. Our Product Design team currently consists of 9 full-time product designers, 3 freelancers, 1 product design manager, and Evan Sharp, our co-founder who leads the Creative Team as a whole. Product Design is not the only kind of design that we do here. The discipline lives within what we call the Creative Team, which is also home to Brand Design, Research and Writing. Altogether, we are 25 people in a company of around 160.   Design is a critical part of our strategy Design of all kinds, not just product, is integral to what we do at Pinterest because Pinterest itself is about inspiring people to live fuller, richer lives and take real-world action on dreams that were always just out of reach. While a well-designed product is friendly and easy-to-use, it also adds an air of authenticity to the idea that Pinterest can help you live the life you want to live.   Interfacing company functions From the beginning, Pinterest has been a company devoted to ""knitting,"" which we define as deep, cross-discipline collaboration. As great as it is, when many different kinds of people work on something together, keeping everyone's opinion heard becomes challenging. Part of our job as product designers is being the human interface between various company functions. While we share this role with everyone, product designers are directly responsible for taking opinions and ideas from all corners of the company and synthesizing them into solutions to a problem.   Employees participating in a “Design Play” session for a project. Design Play is our term for short participatory design exercises that convey the challenges of solving a design problem. In my opinion, the best projects are the ones where all members of a team are aware of the challenges and considerations of other functions and can adapt their own work accordingly. As a company, we are getting better and better at consistently achieving this cross-disciplinary comprehension at a really high level. When we perfect this, I don't think labels such as ""engineering company"" or ""design company"" will be accurate; something like a ""cross-disciplinary company,"" however weird that sounds, would make more sense.   Interfacing pinners and their interests ""Put Pinners First"" is one of our other more well-known company values. As product designers, this value encompasses everything that we do. Often times, we have to balance what pinners want, what is technically feasible, and if applicable, what is good for the company. This isn't easy; rarely is every party satisfied.  What pinners want usually aligns with what is good for the company. However, there’s no way around a solution being technically infeasible, or a team not having enough people to execute on an idea. When we run into roadblocks like these, working together so closely is beneficial because we can find reasonable compromises quickly.   Pinners talking to us about how we can make pins more useful for them during a participatory design study in early 2013. Interfacing with pinners also heavily involves working with other teams at Pinterest. We have to know what pinners want in order to authentically represent them. As product designers, the Research team is a common collaborator, helping us conduct usability and participatory design studies. We also work with the Data Insights team to solve specific problems highlighted by quantitative data, and with the Community team to hear first-hand about the most common problems pinners have and their most-requested features.  To learn more about how we work with the Research team, check out Gabriel Trionfi's answer to What's it like to work on the research team at Pinterest? What's the qual/quant mix? How often are you in the field? Does research have a place at the table?   The process of designing products   A product designer has many roles at Pinterest:  Product StrategyWe are involved in most user-facing projects from their inception to help lead direction.Interaction Design This is our core competency. Broadly, this skill encompasses system architecture, experience design, and cognitive psychology.Visual Design We maintain, and when necessary evolve, the design language of Pinterest. We also draw any necessary icons and gatekeep the visual quality across platforms. Sometimes, icons or illustration are outsourced to some of our extremely talented friends.Production DesignThis is a necessary evil that we'd like to hire someone for specifically. We cut out any assets needed by the development teams, which can be a real chore, but gets relaxing once you get in the zone.  Jason Wilson, one of our product designers, sketching out an impromptu solution to a problem. How product designers work (our process): Product designers are free to work in whatever way they find most efficient, so long as they communicate and knit with the rest of their teams. Different projects and teams also mandate different processes. It really varies, but at a high level we:  Gather inputs and insights (whether that be from data science, qualitative research, or pinners we know),Explore broad directions,Prototype, iterate and refine those directions,Launch and learn!In general, we focus on the problem first and the platform second. By thinking about problems holistically, we get a solution that generally works across all platforms. At that point, considering a platform’s unique context and constraints comes naturally.   A quick look at the process for just one direction of Place Pins. There were seven directions explored in total on the web. The technical nitty-gritty:  We mostly use Photoshop, with some projects done in Sketch. We use various other tools as well, including code and lots of paper sketches.We believe that designers should, at the very least, be technically adept. That way, even if we can’t build something ourselves, we are still speaking the same language as our engineers. That being said, most of us can prototype features in Javascript, and at least half of us can build our own backends as well for testing things out.We use Basecamp to share work and give impromptu feedback, but we're currently investigating other tools. In-person critique is held twice a week.  Pinkit is a Javascript tool that we develop on the product design team to make designing system units and building prototypes with real data really simple.   The Future Pinterest is a really great place to work for any designer because the problems are plentiful, solving them is rewarding, and they're difficult enough that you're always learning something new. That being said, as a product design team we're almost impossibly small compared to the rest of the company. We're always looking for more world-class product designers to join the team, so check out our open Careers in Creative and get in touch!

If you imagine a matrix with:1)  Horizontal access for ""design lead - i.e products whose goal it is to performs, look, act, feel a certain way, and this would lead the process rather than cost, practicality. So the more designed, the further right. 2) A vertical axis for price. Higher price is higher up. Most quadrants are well populated. Accessible and poor design.Now obviously there is a lot of cheap stuff that is badly designed, the entire world is full of bad Wallmart furniture, poorly thought out electronic photo frames, I need not live the pain of thinking of it all, just take a look in most peoples living rooms. Expensive and bad design.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I'm still sure there are a relatively large number of products in this area, guessing most would be either products of extremely high quality but boring design, think of Crate and Barrel, and the entire world of expensive traditional furniture. Also think of status symbols like most expensive watches with non unique workings. This may be contraversial but for my eyes a Rolex, Hamilton, Uboat etc, are not well designed. You could also put most fashion brands in here potentially and anything you may see in a penthouse in Dubai. Expensive and great designI'm not going to go to the lengths to list all the items here, but this is a world of incredible luxury cars, boats, furniture, home builders. You know the idea, people like DDC, Ligne Roset, Cassina, B&B Italia Accesible  and great design.So here is the elusive hotspot. Starting with the most accessible and going up. - Target ( really?), they have a pretty good reputation for some interestingly designed items, not everything obviously but a few interesting items per store and a attitude towards a design ethos makes me put it here. They don't make the items but they do source them. - Waitrose own label food!  Maybe this is a cheat, but look on google images for Waitrose food and it looks and tastes amazing - Zara - Maybe a little wrong, but known for innovative clothes and distribution techniques, and at a sensible price point. The clothes do seem to fall apart rather quickly for my taste! - IKEA. I know we hate it, but the reality is that this brand continues to product extremely well designed items that we all love. The problem is that too many people have them - Samsung. Obviously not every item, but over the last 4 years they have produced a deceptively high number of very interesting designs, very organic in form and challenging to the eye  - Asus - Not sure about this now, but there was a time when they ( especially through their Eee PC line, made a lot of crazy stuff. - Dyson. Not cheap, but probably the best example your looking for, a company that is totally dedicated to both design but challenging assumptions about what things should look like, expensive, yet VERY popular. - CB2. Maybe not to everyones taste, but funky stuff, popular, yet challenging. - Bang and Olufsen - Getting a little too expensive here maybe, but this company produces amazing designs that change the way we expect things to look. -Loewe Electronics - Similar to B&O above, perhaps a little more conservative and make fewer items, but still worth looking at. Thats all I can think of now, as I said earlier I have no idea how it is that companies like Apple are so appreciated for amazing design when in fact every company should be able to make products, if not AS beautiful, close to. Look at these items in particular, they are awful looking and badly functioning. - Remote controls - WTF?- Microwaves- 25 buttons and you only ever use about 4 of them. I have 6 buttons that only serve the need that you need to change the time.- Fridge-  I can't see my food.- Car Audio - x years after the iPod interface and it operates like this still?- Every secondary piece of electronics - control panels for security systems, for heating and cooling systems, security alarm panels, I've never seen a single one that is remotely intuitive!

Fans, journalists, and rumormongers who love it or love to hate it have long had to practice a sort of Kremlinology to gather the merest hints as to what is coming next out of Cupertino.A case in point is this story, which was to be about the iPhone–about how an innovative and gorgeous piece of technology was conceived, designed, and produced by the vaunted industrial-design team at Apple. Along the way, it would address the larger question of how one company can so consistently excel at making products that become icons, win design awards, and inspire customers.But the omerta that prevails at Apple proved too strong. Company representatives declined to speak with me, and sources only tangentially engaged with the industrial-design process said that they could not talk either. When I asked Paul Kunkel, author of the 1997 book AppleDesign, for tips on obtaining interviews, he laughed and said, “Go sit outside the design-group offices with a pizza.” What follows is as clear a picture of the Apple design process as we could get.Designers tend to speak about the “genetic code” of products and companies. Pontiacs and BMWs, for example, can be recognized but also distinguished from each other by their split grilles. In some products, such distinctive characteristics serve mainly to aid brand recognition. But in complex objects such as computers, they can also signal operational familiarity: a customer who knows how to use product A will be able to use product B.To whatever degree Apple can be said to make products with a distinctive genetic code, they can also be said to have inherited most of their traits from a single parent: founder Steve Jobs. Jobs left the company in 1985 and didn’t return until 1997. Nonetheless, according to many who have worked at Apple, sometimes in close proximity to Jobs, it was largely he who established the company’s emphasis on industrial design. Indeed, some would say that he made design a higher priority than technology.Mark Rolston bears the title of senior vice president of creative at Frog Design, a product-design and strategic-branding firm that worked closely with Apple from 1982 to 1988. (Rolston did not work directly on any projects with Apple.) The company’s projects have ranged widely: retail display systems for Victoria’s Secret; websites for Microsoft, Dell, and Yahoo; webcams for Logitech. In publicity pictures, Rolston sports a T-shirt and an indie-rock mop of shaggy blond hair that bespeak his years in Austin, TX.Even in the early 1980s, Rolston says, “Jobs wanted to elevate Apple by using design.” Jobs, he says, not only cared personally about design but saw that it could be a way to differentiate his company’s products from the PCs of the day, which often looked little evolved from hobbyist boxes. Ken Campbell, a codesigner of the Apple Lisa, was quoted in Kunkel’s AppleDesign as saying that Jobs wanted Apple to be what Olivetti was in the 1970s: “an undisputed leader in industrial design.”Through much of 1982 and into early 1983, Jobs searched for a sympathetic design partner; he finally found one in Hartmut Esslinger of Frog Design. Together, the two companies developed the “Snow White” design language that was meant to give Apple’s products a coherent visual ­vocabulary, the appearance of being related.

There are three main things you should do to decide which Industrial Design school or program is best for you. Decide your career path. Industrial Designers are in nearly every industry - furniture, toys, transportations, and so on. If you already know which area you would like to end up then narrow your focus to Schools or Universities that are known for producing those types of designers. If you are not sure where you want to go within the design inustry, don’t worry. Most Industrial Design programs send students through a “foundation” year while they are a Freshmen. Thus, you should focus on finding a University that focuses on helping students find their career path in the first year. You will want to decide your industry as soon as possible, as this will allow you to build up a portfolio related to that field. Don’t worry, you can always change industries once you start working in the field and have many pieces in your portfolio. Look at the Professor’s Resumes When looking at Programs always take a look at the Professor’s credentials. Nearly every College or University has photos, resumes, and Professor credentials on their website. Make sure that the professors haven’t been out of the industry for too long. Industrial Design is rapidly advancing along with technology. The last thing you want to do is spend thousands of dollars learning techniques or processes that are no longer practiced by professionals. “Make sure the professors haven’t been out of the industry for too long.” Some schools will have a good mix of young and older professors with a wide range of experiences, while other schools may only have one or the other. From my personal experiences you are better off with Professors that recently left the industry to teach, or only teach part-time, as professors that have been teaching for a long time typically don’t spend the time to stay relevant. Look at Portfolios of Current Students Looking at the portfolios of current students is one of the best ways to see the strengths and weakness of a design program. You can find current students by searching on Behance, Dribbble, and other design websites. You can also find students work by finding them on LinkedIn. Their profiles often have links to portfolio websites. Also, the website of the respective College/University often puts links of students who are graduating in order to showcase their students’ talent. Lastly, don’t hesitate to reach out to current students and ask them questions. I used to talk with prospective students all the time, often leaving them with a more “realistic” perspective of the program then the admissions employees sell them.

You and your mentor will continually align and realign these things throughout your internship. Disclaimer: I’m not involved with the internship program. This is just my personal experience as a 2x design intern. Like pretty much everything at Palantir, it varies wildly. The factors that play a role are, roughly equal in importance, your skillset, your interests, and the company’s needs at the time. Here’s how each can affect things. Your skillset: This isn’t just what you’re good at, but also what you’re not good at. A good internship is one where you are positioned and equipped to succeed, and also challenges you to grow into a stronger designer. I came in weak on visual design and I had to assess and re-assess whether I was interested in developing that skill, or instead focusing on leveraging my already-decent systems design skills. All it took was a few honest conversations with my mentor and teammates for me to shift my focus.Your interests: While obviously not everyone in the company can be working on Philanthropy projects, there are a lot of really fascinating problems to work on at Palantir. You’ll usually be able to talk with your mentor and find something that gets you excited. If not, that’s okay too. One thing that I love about working here is that even the most mundane use cases become interesting once you get far enough into the nuts and bolts of them. I recommend getting “close to the outcomes” whenever possible. The fields we work in are very deep, and filled with intelligent, hardworking people – engaging with them will expose you not only to interesting domain knowledge, but also to the impact that your software has in the real world.Company’s needs: Palantir is a business, and an incredibly agile one at that. The business needs can shift rather dramatically, so moving quickly requires all hands on deck at all times. This is actually a great thing for points 1 and 2 – you won’t be staffed on a project designed solely to keep you busy because Palantir simply can’t afford it. If you’ve received an offer, it’s because we believe you can help us build things that are valuable to the business and to the world.A combination of these things has a lot of possible manifestations. I spent the first half of my first internship completely in Sketch doing UX/IA mockups, and the second half writing frontend code. My second internship I spent a lot more time leveling up my prototyping and visual design skills. One internship was software for a specific client, the other was more generalized software. All you do is have an honest conversation with your mentor and teams and figure out how to get what you want out of the experience. Many internship programs would claim to be more challenging and rewarding than any other. Palantir is not unique in this respect – but I do believe it’s demonstrably unique in an even more important way: trust. What I hope you take away from this comment is that you have immense trust put in you as an employee of any sort here: engineer, designer, strategist, full timer, intern, you name it. You’re trusted to make and defend your own design decisions. You’re trusted to take on responsibilities outside of your role description. You’re trusted, ultimately, to do what’s right. As a young designer, I can think of nothing more challenging nor rewarding than that. TLDR: There’s no consistent “day in the life” description. You could be working really closely with clients, or many steps removed. You could be writing code, or living in Sketch. It depends on your skillset, your interests, and the business needs. You and your mentor will continually align and realign these things throughout your internship. Disclaimer: I’m not involved with the internship program.

It was customary, when a child turned of age, to offer toys of their youth to certain gods. - Source 2- Product design is durable. For the consumer, a modern product design is expected to last the longest time. But manufacturers now use programmed obsolescence to force the shortest limited lifespan of a product. Let’s look at some examples: 1. Using relatively unreliable parts in a product, so it mechanically fails within a relatively predictable period of time. This gets you to discard it and buy the same exact product again or a slightly newer version.2. Using software to program a product, like a printer, to fail after a set period of time or number of actions (like printed pages) even if mechanically and structurally the product is fine. A software upgrade incompatible with older hardware is another strategy for planned obsolescence.3. Using clever marketing and a basically useless or insignificant upgrade in a newer product to get you to discard the 'uncool' old one even if it works just great. Smartphone manufacturers are really great with this. Who doesn't want that 7.5 MP camera in the new phone when last year's model was a puny 7.4 MP and didn't have special effects like cinema mode!?The best and credited as first example of planned obsolescence is a conspiracy agreed to by the major light bulb manufacturers of the early 20th century. They were called the Phoebus cartel. Long story short, these guys colluded to purposefully reduce a light bulb's lifetime to 1,000 hours by the mid-20th century. - SourcePlanned Obsolescence is also famously found in those inkjet printers. Buy an inkjet printer for peanuts, but repeatedly purchase the ink cartridges that never fully empty themselves for a hefty price!

Another design point to notice is the slightly enlarged base area, around the 3 pins, which touches the socket when the charger is plugged in a 3-pin power socket. Now, coming to the flaws with the design.. i) The earth-pin dummy serves no purpose, atleast from an electrical point of view (since it is not a metal conductor pin used in earthing). Rather, it makes the charger unusable on a 2-pin power socket. ii.)The enlarged base area of the charger around the pin just adds to the woes. When you do find a 3-pin socket to use, you find it difficult to connect any other plug into an adjacent socket. Seeing is believing right?   Whereas with any other charger like this one below, this is a no issue  The sole advantage I have been able to find of such a design is that the charger is plugged-in solid & stable, staying unmoved by any external jerks, unwanted pull or disturbance.

My team always come back with the concern designer through put is not quick as expected and slowing down the dev cycle. Hearing this feedback, I initiated exercise of empathizing with my designers to understand their world, how they operate, what they wish product managers know. Following are my few learnings. # Design is a more of art than a science Designer operates from a right brain in which he/she tries to understand social, empathetic, qualitative challenges that user faces. In this process designer develops deep understanding of the user. Designers expects to work with product managers in engaging customers along the way, with iterative process of failing and learning fast as part of the journey. # Design is more strategic User experience is not just user interface and it is entire end-end experience of the product that user is dealing with. User experience is about how user engages with your product, service and all the touch points of a company. Designer needs to be engaged in all the aspects of product and service design to serve user with great experience. One of the good examples of designer who had a greater impact on strategy is Rebecca Sinclair, Head of User Experience Research and Design at Airbnb. She leveraged design thinking to see completely new possibilities in how Airbnb thought about which problems to solve and what to build # Design has many roles As a product manager you might be interacting with one person on Design. However, there are many roles that completes the design role. Following are few roles in design world. Interaction Designer– this role is responsible for developing a deep understanding of the target users (each user profile that you’re trying to satisfy in your product), and coming up with the tasks, navigation and flow that is both usable and satisfying. Generally, the interaction designer maps product requirements to a design represented by wireframes and passes them to the visual designer. Visual Designer– this role put the flesh on the wireframe and create the actual pages and user interface look and feel, which includes everything from the precise layout, colors, and fonts, but more importantly, the visual design communicates and evokes emotion in the product (which is far more important than you may think). Rapid Prototype – this role creates “disposable” software – the lifespan of the prototype may be less than a day – the purpose is to quickly try out an idea by creating something that simulates the intended user experience. Usability Tester – this role specializes in evaluating whether the prototype allows a given user to easily achieve his objectives. It includes recruiting appropriate test subjects, administering the tests, evaluating the results, and recommending alternatives. # Design is more iterative and cannot be time bound Keeping in context of all above mentioned points, by now product manager should have realized that Design must be iterative and cannot be time bound. Product manager should be willing to experiment, learn and iterate with the design. Design iteration helps rapid resolution of misunderstandings, brings out user feedback, and it gives team a certainty that their efforts are being focused and add valuing to customer. Product manager should engage and closely work with product designer at every stage of product life cycle. # Design is never done User expectations, constraints and context in which users interact with product are ever changing. It is very critical that design needs evolve, meet and exceed this ever-changing environment. Many firms constantly invest in design to raise the bar of craftsmanship and serve the user better. One such example is who Microsoft redesign window 10 Outlook and Calendar apps. Me and my team of product owners spend more time with designers than with our developer community.

It is a very common mistake, and the sooner you realize how to avoid making it, the better. But, unfortunately, many people neglect this seemingly simple truth - you have to realize what’s your purpose in the industry. See, a designer is a very different notion than that of an artist, and I consider it as a crime when people mix these two professions into one. You might think that this comparison has nothing to do with the actual question, but hang on with me just a bit, I will explain it. Artist. The main driving forces of an artist are opinion and self-expression. Artists create with the purpose of telling a story, conveying their thoughts and feelings to people, bringing their personal vision to the world. Let’s say, you draw a picture. As stunning and magnificent as it may be, it exists for bringing aesthetical satisfaction to those who see it. You can exhibit it in a gallery, give to the auction, and patiently wait until some person who enjoys it pays the money to decorate their home with it - and it might take long. This business model has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. If you are a great artist, you might receive an order to draw a picture devoted to a certain topic - family portrait, for example. But it still relies heavily on opinion, taste, and a simple like/dislike factor. Designer. When you design things (especially certain products) there is not so much room for a personal taste. First of all, you have a client with more or less strict demands that are aimed at solving certain business problem. In a nutshell, what you gotta do is come up with idea that would sell successfully. Each and every designer is also a marketer and has to convey a scrupulous market analysis to understand which idea would bring profit in an existing business environment and which would fail at that. The requirements are always considerably stricter, and you have to understand that the Rennaissance style of Sandro Botticelli that you fell in love with at the university will not work when you have to create a packaging for a dairy product. I would rather compare a designer to a mathematician who has to solve a problem that to an artist. Besides, let’s not forget about deadlines. Of course, there is an artist in every designer, but you have to control your self-expression ambitions to achieve a better and more efficient outcome. And it is not only about a designer’s tastes but also about the client’s thoughts. You have to be able to explain that too many elements on the design of a wine bottle collar that the client wants to use will not work in 2019 where minimalism is one of the main trends. Efficiency should take the first place, likes and dislikes - second. Thus, I guess that the most underrated skill is basically understanding the industry, how it functions, and what is the primary purpose of a designer within it. Some might disagree with me and say that it’s not a skill, but I don’t really think so - it takes much time and practice to realize it and use to your benefit. I do hope it was in any way helpful. I’ve scratched the surface of that topic in a couple of my previous answers, so thank you a lot for a question where I can develop my thoughts further :) Judging from my experience, many designers (especially beginners) rely too much on opinions and personal tastes.

(market cap)Go to the design and technology categories of product crowdfunding sites like Kickstarters, Indigogo, rockethub, and others  Look at the products, how they are presented, and how they are accepted by the crowd.  There are a lot of products that made it and those that didn't.  Those with projects even talk about their manufacturing and prototyping methods.  You also learn about how these entrepreneurs market their products, and the the selling points they use.Learn about Prototyping: Learn a solids modeling CAD program.  Solidworks is the gold standard it seems, but look at open source solutions such as FreeCAD (http://sourceforge.net/projects/free-cad/)Browse, and make your own product using rapid prototyping techniques at Ponoko, Shapeways, sculpteo, or any other rapid prototyping provider.  There will be suggestions in these sites about the tools you need (software).  In my mind, Ponoko has the most complete set of tools (2D and 3D manufacturing), Shapeways has the lowest price for 3D stuff, and Sculpteo the best service.Buy an Arduino learning kit, a breadboard, soldering gun, and learn electronics prototyping and some C programming.Look at products already made and think how you could gut them to create your own from them.Buy the tools you need as you go (for cutting, drilling, bending, soldering, etc, etc, etc).Learn about Production / Manufacturing: Look at everyday products, for example, a shampoo bottle.  It was made with plastic injection molding.  Think of why the walls are at an angle, why there are sort of unnoticeable sutures keeping the two halves together.

How technology is implemented in those devices. Including Android/Material Design, iOS and HTML5/CSS best practices.  Rather than being an in demand skill, I would consider the above must have. The tools required for the above are: Good understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. Also the various screen resolutions and features of mobile operating systems. A fair understanding of backend architecture. Enough to be able to carry out a decent (not heavy-duty) technical conversation with engineers and PMs. Next is the ability to communicate a design. You can use sketches to communicate. Or static mocks. Or Keynote. Or InVision. Or even actual code. There is greater value in providing higher fidelity. But if you consider the time to deliver high fidelity, the law of diminishing returns would come into play.  In common use, the above skill will be called prototyping. I like to call it communicating, though. Tools: Sketch (Photoshop is passé in my opinion), InVision, Pixate, Proto, Keynote  Next up is the ability to put the design in the context of a user. Engineers and product managers are good at thinking about technology and business needs. A product designer has to be the users' voice.  You call call it empathy, or designing with the user in mind. Tools: Persona development, story boarding, scenarios, use cases.  Then one needs some ability to look at the business side of things. Tools here could include service design, customer segmentation, value proposition and other artifacts that could feed into a business case. Having the above, apart from the regular design chops, can make you an in demand designer.",2021-03-05T21:06:12.554Z,"What are the essential skills for a Product Designer working on growth? ",Quora

Large corrugated boxes were especially valuable as they were sturdier and if you delaminated the outer layer you could get beautiful curves. Being a boy, and very much a child of the space race, my bedroom filled with models of spacecraft, robots, flying saucers, computers. I was around six at the time. My parents called me an inventor, although I confess at that age I was very much a copiest learning how to build more and more accurate simulations. True creativity came one winters night when I was about eight. I still remember the moment as clearly as if it has just happened. I was frustrated that I could not invent something for myself and struggled with the idea of visualising something truly unique, something that had never been seem before. I struggled for what seemed like hours, for long after my parents had gone to bed. And then it happened, just like that. I visualised new machines of all forms, spacecraft, aircraft, ships, robots, a steady stream of amazing new things. ( The first was a robot- I was a boy, I was eight years old, of course it was a robot!) It was a really thrilling moment in my life. Much latter on I realised what was happening. I was merging lots of observed objects in new ways. Many of the new designs had obvious origins, wing shaped like doves wings only smooth and made from alloy blending into a body equally streamlined and and organic. A robot with a head not dissimilar in its shape and optics as the angled twin lens headlights of a Triumph Vitesse. I now define the process of creativity as the unique combination of observations. I find the method is a powerful source of inspiration and new ideas. I also learned that all that had happened that winters night was I had learnt how to consciously access my subconscious, which is doing this sort of associative modelling all the time. I think that is what differentiates creative people from non-creative people. Its a trick anyone can learn if they really want to. So It was inevitable for me that I was going to be a designer of some form. I hustled along to art school straight after my A levels. The first year was a foundation course where you got to experience all the courses available at college. This was a very important year as it allowed me to evaluate all sorts of potential creative routes. I looked seriously at graphic design, which is invariably beautiful and powerful, and product design. The other disciplines were fun and productive, but instinctively I was drawn to disciplines that I believed would have the greatest impact on our lives. What I now know was that, instinctively, I was drawn to disciplines that increase civilisational wealth by adding intelligence to matter. Look around you and you will see you live in a world that is created from applying intelligence to base matter. Civilisation is many things, economies, societies, cultures, politics, but without the practice of applying intelligence to matter civilisation could not happen. So it seems to me that to be a designer is a valuable profession, one that builds more civilisation, creates more potentials for everyone. As our civilisation grows ever more complex there will be a demand for more design not less. Consider that we are now close to serious attempts to colonise the Moon and Mars. That’s two new worlds worth of designing to be done. Consider that todays virtual realities and game worlds are closing in on a fidelity that makes them as real and as engaging as the ‘real’ world. That offers us millions of new worlds to design, potentially billions. Design will be central to defining these worlds, just as it has been central to the development of our current civilisation. And that, in the end, is what motivated me to become a product designer. On a day to day level its just designing stuff. But step back and look at the big picture and its a way to define civilisations.",2021-03-06T06:57:04.580Z,"What are your reasons for becoming a product designer? ",Quora

You need a place, who can make the design and make it manufactured, like a turnkey service. First, at every design project, after design phase, mechanical design need to be made, which is not a part of the industrial design process. There are companies like that, but assuming that they can provide a good service both for industrial design and mechanical design may differ. Some design offices can be very talented for design phase, but have a bad network or sources for mechanical design. (Or exact opposite) but those 2 processes are very crucial, to able to get a good, reliable result as a product. Non of them are less or more important. Many designs, with great ideas, may need good and smart engineers to able to come up with a solution, that can evolve the design to a real product. A good engineer doesn’t mean, he knows the whole manufacturing processes.. It means, he knows manufacture tricks and also a creative one to able to come up with extraordinary solutions. At my whole work life, at most projects, I had involved with manufacturing process, and guided engineer friends for better solutions or lower costs.. Also they guided me.. Mutual work between designers and engineers are amazingly important. And those decisions need to be made according to the brief and priorities that you provided as a client. Cause there is never only 1 best way to proceed. Second, when you need to make that decision about picking the right company, also what will be your product also matters a lot. How important is design at that product? Is it an easy product to manufacture? Are there any mechanical functional challenges? All those criteria matters and may guide you to pick a better design office.. Why? cause like at every profession, designers also differs according to what you need. Their work life experiences, the product range they involved, are they better at mostly at artistry related products or consumer products at daily life. Cause their work life experiences, also builds their perspective and priorities. Of course a professional designer can be able to work for all segments and markets, but quality of result may and will also differ. For example, if you want me to design a domestic appliance, I would fulfill all the needs of a client. But if you ask me to design a car, or if you ask me to design ceramic vase, I may fail, cause I don’t have enough experience for automotive or I have no interest to design a vase or tableware like products. Now you may ask, you told lots of things but didn’t mention about any company names? Yes and I won’t. The things I explained above are more important for you to understand, when you need to pick the right one. Check the companies at the link, or make more researches over internet, check their portfolios, their understanding and philosophy about design, than pick the ones which makes you feel they may be efficient. Make meetings with those companies, and you would be able to make a good decision, if you are a good businessman or an entrepreneur as well.. Industrial Design Companies in the United States And if we examine the same issue for freelance designers, it differs x5 more. Who knows, there may be, and there may not be. I am sure you may find a freelance designer who may be the right person for you, but if you want a turnkey solution, most freelancers who already got that kind of experience and sources, are tend to establish a design office, instead of working as a freelancer. It would be definitely cheaper, but as I said you need to mention more about what type of product we are talking about? what segment? (low-end? high-end?) what market? what brand? (is there a brand?)

Let's say you want to start a business of selling unique cakes that people find delicious and irresistible, aside from the work of setting up your business, your most important task is to make good cakes that people want to have. So how do you start? Foremost, you get to decide who you want to sell your cake to, and what kind of cake can attract your target audience. So from here you start doing your research through surveys, meetings with potential customers and building personas to answer the two questions above. The result is a set of half-tested assumptions of yours about the potential customers and what cakes they like to buy. Base on the result of the first stage, you start making your cakes to fit with what you think the potential customers love to get. This is where you can unleash your innovation and creativity to craft and design the best tasting cakes ever. However, you need to have a constraint to your creative power or else you will end up with something far away from your earlier research assumptions. At the end of this stage, you should have a working prototype to give your target customers and see if they want it or not. By getting customers' feedbacks from your prototype, you verify the result of earlier research and see how close you are from reality. If it turns out that your assumptions were right then it's time for you to polish your cakes for final production and release, otherwise, go back to research and make another prototype. When everything above goes right, finally, it's about time to get your cakes out there publicly for real customers. The process of putting your cakes out for the market is called releasing, there's a lot to prepare at this stage. Now you have  unique and delicious cakes that people want, it never matter less to design the package, branding, images and marketing campaign for your cool cakes so you can maximize the amount of sells right on the first day. Your tasks this time is to pick a good date, getting your cakes ready in attractive package, prepare your stores, check the branding message, etc. If you get it right, on your first day of releasing, you should have people standing in line waiting desperately to have a taste on your ridiculously irresistible cakes. You rock already when you make it to the last stage, but it's not the end. Either your customers and business will ever have enough, things change all the time, that's why you need to redo the whole process again and keep making something new. New kind of cake, new customers, new way to sell, and it keeps going on and on... That's what product design as a whole is.

An Simple way to this Example is,  If problem is changing the horn in a bike, the design is ready, but the product is not replacement friendly, this involves redesigning the interfaces to facilitate ease of replacement in future, this is called as a value add, If the problem is the horn itself, i.e you replace any horn it does not work well, not durable etc.. then you may design a product that has its own way to handle this and gets as an add on to the bike making the existing part as vestige and in iterations if add on proves to be good then this gets into the main assembly line of the bike to incorporate the idea with in the bike's actual design. In any sort, the product that we design should answer itself if it is a value add or is it entirely new, your design will start to fall inline once this question gets answered.

There's also a lot of technical knowledge which designers need, which is not coding (i.e. knowing about colors, type, spacing, tools...) Product designers and engineers have two very different approach to solving problems. Designers will start from a given context and will try to come up with ideas on how to help users complete a specific task. They can (and should) come up with as many ideas as possible, and those ideas are unconstrained by any technical contingencies.  Engineers approach this the opposite way. They have an existing body of code, implementing a solution will require writing additional code and it will have consequences on existing code. The natural inclination of the engineer, when implementing a new feature is to do it with the least possible impact on the code base. When they reach a solution, they will iterate (change a little something, rebuild) until satisfied. Doing so is fast and cheap, but lacks the grand vision that designers bring. Neither of these approaches are optimal - the best way to build a product is to have a conversation between designers and engineers (and product managers, etc.). The problem is when this conversation is bypassed because of assumptions on either side. For instance, if a designer thinks: ""yeah, that would have been a cool idea to explore but it seems awfully complicated to implement, so I'm sure it would probably take too much engineering time. Let's not include it in a mock."" So, that's an example where knowing too much about coding makes a product designer less good at producing a good design.",2021-03-06T07:44:23.773Z,"Should Software Product Designers code? ",Quora

Sander Nizni My answer is four-fold but quite short. First, the generally-accepted, ‘classic’ major for UX designers is HCI, or Human-Computer Interaction. Second, many great UXers majored in computer science. There is an enormous overlap between UX and front-end technologies, and UX specialists who can prototype in code (e.g., Bootstrap) and/or are intimately familiar with HTML and CSS and JS are more valuable than all others, simply put.

Third, from observing the industry trends for the last 10+ years, I would say that easily every 2 out of 3 UX designers I meet majored in one of the following: (1) English, (2) Arts, (3) History, or (4) Psychology. Granted, people in these categories tend to be artistic and creative but often (I’d say 70% of the time) cannot tell the difference between pixel perfection and effective interactivity, which makes the vast majority of these people nice visual designers… but below-par experience strategists (which they often compensate successfully with people skills and project management skills… but still, many of these are simply not the greatest UX people - even when they have high-ranking job titles). Fourth and last, from meeting the best of the best UX designers out there, I would say that their educational backgrounds are all-over the place, while their UX skills are great because they are (a) curious people with (b) great imaginations, with (c) knowledge of modern technologies, with (d) solid discipline, and with (e) passion for making people - users or not, all people - happy. I personally majored in marketing and believe it makes me a particularly great designer because I understand the critical relationship between experience design and product strategy, which most modern UXers don’t (per prior paragraph).",2021-03-06T07:46:50.595Z,"Is Product Design at CMU a good place to learn UX?

I think you could find just as many smart and attractive designs, when looking for a 1:10, 1:4, 1:1, or any other simple ratio. Maybe if you'd let a large number of non-designers decide on a non-symmetrical division of an object in two parts, the majority could be inclined to intuitively use the Golden Ratio. But as a graphic design for a logo or a whole (web) page, is the Golden Ratio always and exclusively attractive, tantalizing, intriguing enough ? So don't get me wrong – I do believe in the ubiquitous natural occurrence of it, but that doesn't mean it automatically has to be considered as logical or uniquely beautiful. Like Chris Loughnane said: it's probably a safe choice, when you have no other compelling principle to go by. Book designers in earlier centuries came up with various Canons of page construction, and of course the Golden Ratio was one of them. But sheer laziness and easy-to-reproduce methods also defined many of these ""perfect designs"". One of the most influential typographers and graphic designers Jan Tschichold (who was a strong advocate of Modernism in the beginning of the 20th century) also worked on ""clear"" designs, with strong and repeating ratios, but didn't necessarily or solely adhere to the Golden Ratio. So I think using the Golden Ratio is not the only way to achieve Beauty. Using any strong principle or clear ratio to design something can be successful, but will never be a guarantee. Gosh, maybe it also depends on what your audience is looking for ? The Golden Ratio expresses a certain natural balance – am I subconsciously looking for that when I'm on the björk.com website ?

IDEO is a consultancy. They work on projects for other companies.Apple and Dyson are corporations. They work on projects that carry their own logo. In a consultancy you are often brought into a project that's been defined by the client ""We want you to design a new vacuum that costs X dollars, uses this technology we already have, and has these three features."" or (if you're very lucky) ""We want you to research the home cleaning field, come up with new ways that people can clean, and possibly create new product categories."" The Swiffer probably wouldn't have been designed by an internal team at P&G. It required an external group (Design Continuum) to come up with a totally new way of approaching cleaning.In a corporation you get to be a part of deciding WHAT to design, not just HOW it is designed. You will work on the project from conception all the way until it's in stock and beyond. There's a good argument to be made that the excellent vacuums from Dyson would never be developed by a consultancy. They are the product of years of engineering and design R&D that all happened internally. If those were billable hours to a consultancy it would cost a fortune. In a consultancy you will work on a project for however many hours the client paid for. Sometimes you'll work on it for a few weeks and then the work comes to a halt when they run out of money. When a project is over you often hand off your designs to a staff design team on the client's side and they will faithfully execute your design or maybe it will get butchered once the sales, marketing, and accounting teams get involved.In a corporation you are one with the sales people, marketing, inventory, and purchasing teams. You work on a project for a long time. You advocate your designs months after the sketching and CAD models are complete. The vacuum isn't selling? Go ask the VP of Sales and find out what's going on. In a consultancy you get to experience a wide variety of projects for different companies. Depending on your firm you might work on medical devices, retail experiences, consumer electronics, sports equipment, toys, etc. You rarely get to learn about the inner workings of your clients' businesses. You can't ask them really hard questions because there is often a protocol of not offending your client.In a corporation you will know a lot about your industry. You'll spend a little time attending trade shows, you'll listen in on sales meetings, know what a ""turn"" is in inventory-speak, understand sales margins, figure out how international shipping, product testing and CPSC standards work. You will learn how to source suppliers and work with them to get products made well on time.

A real designer forms the design in their brain. A design group works together with their minds in sinc. So quick sketches are the only tools they need to bounce concepts between the design group. By the time they get to the computers it is already basically thought out. Detailed drafting and illustrations are for the clients, accountants and engineers who will get the product to market. When starting with a computer is irreplaceable is when you are re-designing some item that is part of an established product or a product that fits into some physical set or location or shares major parts in a product line. Or, things that depend on specific engineering. Any error in any measurement or shape would delay the project and cost allot. Imagine a fashion designer drawing beautiful sketches for a client whom he/she had never measured their size, weight, age, coloring or the person’s taste.

Many UX people get shoe-horned into the ""UX/UI"" box and type-cast as pixel pushers, painting lipstick on other people's bad ideas. Its a horrible place to be, and many of us, (especially the more strategically-minded) get frustrated with the being told how to solve problems by bad PMs (the mini-CEOs who want to direct everything). Great PM's know how to form a special bond with a UX designer. In the best case, they can finish each other's sentences, and work together to convince others around a shared vision. Many of the PMs I've worked with over the years will tell you that being a PM is another way of saying ""I have all the responsibility and none of the authority"". PM's often have to push to get their work prioritized and scheduled, often against aggressive and immovable goals. PMs often are forced to ""kill their darlings"" features and products that could be 10x better, but things got reprioritized or scope got cut. In design, you don't necessarily get to prioritize what gets built, but you can influence. You are able to make improvements, and get your hands dirty. You can point to a ""north star"" vision, and be the voice of the user/customer, and fight on behalf of simplicity, holistic approaches, and holding a higher bar for what gets built. You will frequently be misunderstood and overruled, but sometimes you win and change the entire direction of a product because you bring together the big picture in a way that no one has looked at it before. The choice really depends on what you want to give up, and where you want to go in your career. If you go the PM route, you're going to have to let go of the tools you have always used to express your ideas. You need to collaborate with UX designers, not direct them, or try to do their work for them. You will be resented for interfering with design, and it will only end in angst if you try. Good designers won't stand for it, and will push back hard; as a result your features will churn, engineering and design will hate you and your features will ship late. You will suck at product management if you do this. Most of your ""design"" work will happen in Microsoft Office products, JIRA, confluence, etc and email. Lots and lots of email. If you go design, you have to learn to ""disagree and commit"" (as we say at Amazon). You don't own your roadmap, you don't necessarily get a vote, and its hard to hold the quality line all the time. You don't have veto power. Perfect is never permitted to interfere with the good in a product environment. The best decision will favor the role where you feel you will grow the most. Where are you going to stretch, strive and learn? All the benefits Chandra Kalle mentions are the same pro's I would call out for a really strong UX lead. I describe my job in precisely the same way, and defend my design proposals in terms of customer needs, data, AND business value, because that's the way great UX works too. I don't push pixels, I push user behaviors and strategy. Where you end up is going to be highly dependent on the choices you make here. In some ways, this is a one-way door. If you leave UX, your skills atrophy and you will be less relevant if you want to come back. If you focus on UX, you're more specialized and there is a definite ""glass ceiling"" for designers in the industry. For some reason we don't get the same opportunities to drive business initiatives that engineers, marketing, PM and other disciplines do. Hopefully that will change soon as companies develop a clearer understanding of the value of design, and the kind of thinking some designers bring to big problems (hint, hint) There aren't many C-suite designers, and in many places design ends up reporting to a VP, not someone in the C-suite. If you want to be chief product officer/head of product, having a mix of PM and UX can only benefit you. If you're smart and capable and lean into the opportunities that can happen, if you're willing to embrace the trade-offs that come with it.

The world we live in is not demarcated in such a way that a specific personality set will include or exclude you from your dreams and passion. Maybe percentages vary, but no industry will boil down to a single, exclusive personality type. If you truly want something, you go for it. Right? There’s no need (no need whatsoever) for you to be afraid of your introversion getting in the way of your dreams. If you truly want this, you will put in every effort to grow and develop... Right? Dreams don't come true by snapping your fingers… or they didn’t last time I checked ;) So. What do you need to do? Learn some social skills. That’s how it works. You go in the direction of the thing you lack. Challenge your self in small ways. Break the ice until you become certain of your power. It doesn’t matter where you break the ice. Just try. You could be in the bank and maybe the accountant lady’s coral-colored pants catch your eye because the color is so pretty. So… say so! (Happened to me yesterday and when I told her, she beamed!) Whatever you think you are missing, identify it and move towards it in that direction. It will be uncomfortable at first and your heart will pound and maybe you will curse under your breath ‘why did I listen to Ana?’ but in that moment just remember that it won’t be like this forever and this feeling of agitation will pass :) The introvert vs. extrovert thing is just a model. It’s just a theory. You can accept it and adopt it into your belief system and limit yourself with it… Or you can accept it and adopt it and go beyond it… You can challenge yourself in meaningful ways to identify your limitations and move past them.

Yes, you will have to directly interact with people, but (as you will see) much of it is observing, staying in the background, not meddling, and following a script. You want to stay objective and not influence the results/data in any way. So, maybe the fact that you are introverted isn’t such a bad thing after all.

Well, it could be alarming to know that due to an improper design methodology, even a demanding and valuable digital product could drastically fail. Hence, the importance of design. Don't you worry, I'll in my answer how to work on that.  The design has a large number of definitions for each of its fields of application. In the context of your question, it is a methodology for solving a functional problem with a proper solution. The design draws its inspiration from Software Engineering. The discussion on that could make this answer unnecessarily long, so let us confine here to the understanding of digital product design with the following example. Suppose somebody wishes to get a large number of visitors to his website. For that, he could search the internet and use the methods learned after studying from there. A digital product as a solution to the problem could be an e-book or an online course, which could save him time by offering all the possible solutions in a single place. Such a digital product would be perfect and useful if that meets its purpose. For that, as a designer, one should have sound knowledge of the relevant field the product is serving. Nowadays, the role of product design skills has come into the mainstream. To help visualize all this, some examples of factors to consider when designing a digital product are: · What is the target audience? · How difficult is it to use/learn to use? If it's a course, how much time will it take? · What makes the product relevant and unique to the market? How long will the product stay that way? · What is the core, singular purpose the product serves? This is called the golden thread. · Is the product priced affordably for the market, but high enough that you aren't undercutting your value? · How accessible is the product for different devices, different media preferences (video, text, audio), etc? · How connected is the product to other products, to potentially get upsell and cross-sell sales? If you would follow a proper, proven methodology for digital product design, then that product could give more value and perform better in terms of its sales. The reason for mentioning sales here is that as a supplier, promoter, or a designer of that product, everyone would be concerned about its sales performance. A design methodology contributes to making a perfect digital product. How could anyone create a perfect digital product? For that, either I could suggest you the necessary tips, or I could discuss the methodology that I follow. To keep my answer to the point, I would prefer to discuss the methodology I follow. I apply the Perfect Product Creation for that. It is an hour-long video program teaching you how to build an awesome digital product, such as an online course or tool, regardless of your niche or whether you have experience in eCommerce. The program focuses on building and launching a great product that practically sells itself, getting you the maximum amount of buyers for your hard work. My experience with that has been amazing so far. I would recommend my post on that as it could help you understand digital product design with the help of illustrations that I have used there. To cover all those additional details in this answer won't be possible as that has hyperlinks for better understanding. To read that post, you can visit my website mach5trafficDOTcom. You can also stay updated with my Quora profile, where I discuss various digital products frequently, such as One Minute Free Traffic for free website traffic, List Warrior for email list building, etc. In the end, I would say: As a well-designed outfit adds to your personality, so too does design to a digital product.

The easiest ways to view and integrate sustainability into products is to follow the criteria or requirements of Eco-labels or Eco-labels. Despite this, there is a great diversity of Eco - labels worldwide, so it is complex to know which is the most appropriate for a product and if it really has a real benefit in the environment . For this reason, we are not going to talk about any specific Eco-label, but we are going to focus on Sustainable Design. This type of design takes into account all actions, in the broadest sense, aimed at environmental improvement of the product or service from its creation in the conceptual stage, to its treatment as waste. That is, at all stages of its life cycle. Sustainable design has the following characteristics: The product must represent an environmental improvement.The product must be sustainable, producing an improvement in society and its environment, being economically competitive. This is a fundamental pillar on which its design and production must revolve. These benefits must be quantifiable and comparable. For this reason, all ecological or social labels have a system of objective indicators. Design by a multidisciplinary team and under methodological criteriaThe sustainable design of a product or service introduces sustainability criteria in its initial stages, from product awareness. For this reason, it is necessary to have a multidisciplinary professional team that contributes different visions to the project since the integration of sustainability criteria is a task of enormous complexity. From the composition of this team made up of professionals with high knowledge of production and sustainability sustainable design can be tackled effectively. The complexity of a sustainable product is not only reduced to the use of recycled materials or energy reduction. Sustainability affects both the natural and social environment, therefore a more comprehensive evaluation is necessary. A sustainable product must add value to both the consumer and the entire production chain.In the first place, this product must be viable and give a benefit to the consumer and the production components. The same will happen with consumers who if they do not perceive this value then they will stop consuming the product and it will disappear from the market. Internalize social and environmental costsSustainable design as Eco-design must internalize social or environmental costs, while traditional capitalism externalizes costs to be paid by someone else, such as suppliers. Make a design taking into account the entire Life CycleSustainable design comprehensively assesses the costs and impacts, throughout its useful life, of both products and services. The design will incorporate sustainability criteria both in its conception and in its use and disposal. Therefore the design has to promote durability. End the culture of use and disposal and implement criteria that allow the product to last as long as possible or, failing that, it must be easily repairable at an affordable price. The designer should also take into account in his project the ease of substitution of the defective parts by the user, trying to reduce the number of interventions of the technical services, with the consequent savings. In addition, the design must contemplate the recycling of the products in an effective and responsible manner. The treatment of the waste must favor the recovery of materials, the easy and safe dismantling, as well as the easy identification of its materials. Consumer products in general have to be ""Inclusive"".This criterion, which is rarely mentioned, refers to the fact that the majority of the population can have access to it or benefit from it. If a product intended for the general public is only accessible by a small public with high economic income, then it should not be defined as sustainable since it favors economic discrimination.  Sustainable products evolveA product if it wants to be competitive must be constantly evolving. Not only because of the technological and methodological improvements that make the processes vary by more effective ones, but also because of the changes in the market that make it necessary to adapt the product to the demands of society.",2021-03-06T08:13:22.840Z,"What is sustainable product design?

All industries that manufacture consumer products employ product designers. For example, product designers work in electronics, furniture design, general manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, and many other fields. More specialized fields include medical technology and telecommunications device manufacturing. While many product designers work to meet consumer needs with completely new products, many of the product designers' job responsibilities involve improving existing designs. Design improvement may be needed for a variety of reasons, such as improvement of functionality, improvement of appearance, and manufacturing cost reductions.Often, product designers work as members of multidisciplinary teams that include engineers, prototype fabricators, executive sales staff members, marketing and advertising team members, and others. As part of the design process, product designers employ a variety of technologies, including computer assisted design (CAD), drawings and blueprints, and 3D modeling. Product designers must have working knowledge of these technologies, as well as manufacturing methods, available materials, and budgetary and time considerations. Product designers usually work full time in an office environment. They may be freelance workers who contract with companies or full-time employees. In addition to working in offices, product designers make frequent use of workshops, studios, and even factory space to aid the design process. Additional responsibilities include meeting with customers or co-workers to discuss designs and commercial needs, working as part of the design team, learning about new manufacturing technologies and materials, researching products and how to improve them, producing models or drawings, and working with engineers to produce prototypes.  Most employers require their product designers to hold a bachelor’s degree in a related field, and relevant work experience is generally preferred.Product Designer Tasks Coordinate artists or layout designers to ensure accurate design communication and efficiency.Modify or revise designs to meet customer needs or production limitations.Create design concepts, sketches, drawings, and illustrations, and determine the best presentation strategies.Research and remain up-to-date on current market trends.Source: Product Designer (US) Salary Although the information below doesn't specifically apply to Dropbox, it describes what product managers and product designers in general: Job Description for Product Manager, (Unspecified Type)Generally speaking, product managers are in charge of supervising the production aspects of a given product or products.

These are the questions I don't hear often enough, so I'm skipping some more basic ones that most people ask. One theme that cuts across all of these: you should always get an extremely clear answer in plain English that you fully understand. I think too many designers accept vague handwaving because they don't have much experience in the industry, but you shouldn't shy away from asking questions that might seem stupid or obvious. No company is alike, so avoid making any assumptions about how the role will operate. How is the design role defined? What areas do designers own? What are they held accountable for? At many companies, designers aren't accountable for anything. They're just perceived as technical talent that are told what to do and how to do it — my pal Brittany Forks characterized this as being Photoshop hands. You'll hear lots of soft, vague language like, designers are ""really involved"" in product or designers are ""very important"" to the company. Everyone says that. The thing that actually matters is where the buck stops: the best roles pair the responsibility of getting the work done with the accountability of doing the right work in the first place. When a new feature is being planned out, which roles are involved and what are they doing? When a new feature fails, who has to come up with the next steps? If there are multiple design roles, make sure to understand how responsibilities are split between them. I'm personally skeptical of one-off or ""special"" roles that aren't standardized internally. You can't easily invest in tools or processes for them since there are no economies of scale, and it makes organizational boundaries difficult to maintain. Your mileage may vary. What are the boundaries between the design role and other roles in the company? Related to the above, you should know how you'll be expected to work with the other functions in the organization, particularly engineering and product management. Every company handles this differently, and it has a huge impact on how you work and whether you'll be happy with the results. How do designers communicate changes to engineers? What deliverables exist? What tasks do PMs do that designers don't? Who approves my work? What do I do when I get competing feedback from different leaders in the org? What standing meetings exist and who attends them? Meetings tend to be where leadership makes important decisions, so it's clarifying to to learn which people meet with each other and for what purpose. This will give you a lot of insight into where the organizational power lies and when design is actually involved. How do you resolve disagreements between designers and other roles? Regardless of how much you're concerned with resolving disagreements directly, understanding how the organization handles difficult decisions and trade-offs teaches you a lot about the overall culture and process. I don't think you should be looking for roles where designers have final say over every single thing they do, but you do want to hear an answer that sounds sensible and likely to produce good results. In particular, how are disagreements between the designer and the CEO resolved? What is the overall company strategy? How do you acquire more users/customers? How do you (or will you) make money? A good answer to this question is important for its own sake, obviously. But for your role specifically, the strategy of the business will determine what types of projects you work on. It will also tell you how important design is. The more design is directly part of how the business grows, the more input designers will have on decision-making. For example, many social products grow by virtue of being used, which means the design will directly drive business goals. Contrast this with a business that grows through sales or marketing, where other roles will be more directly influential to the bottom line. How are product changes prioritized? What are you currently working on and why? You should have a very concrete picture of how projects get prioritized, starting from the very top of the organization. You'll want to know very specifically how and when designers contribute to this process. You'll often hear ""designers are involved"" but without any specifics beyond that. Push past language like this and ask for descriptions of process or specific stories of how certain features/changes came about. Learning what they're currently working on tells you a lot about the nature of the work you'll be doing. Do any of the projects sound like something you'd be excited to work on? Be skeptical of promises about cool future projects that aren't actually being actively developed right now. Companies like to dangle these sorts of opportunities, but unless you hear specifics that make you very confident that they'll really happen, you should generally disregard stuff like that as bait. When people don't fit in culturally, what are the reasons? It's good to ask for general descriptions of the company culture, but it's really easy for people to say anything they want and have it come off as plausible. A practical way to define culture is in terms of the behavior it encourages or discourages. Learning what makes someone fit in or not will tell you a lot. This can seem like the reverse of the question, ""what is your greatest weakness?"" so you should expect answers that try to skirt the issue. Don't be afraid to press hard on this. Mature, confident companies should be open to discussing the difficult trade-offs and tensions inherent in fostering a coherent culture.",2021-03-06T08:17:28.509Z,"What questions should I ask when interviewing for a product design position at a startup?

He describes the book as broadly about explaining reality, thinking rationally, and the beginning of infinite human progress. It’s hard to overstate how deeply Deutsch’s philosophy —and several of its constituent sources, like the work of Karl Popper or Alan Turing— has influenced my thinking about everything, but especially software design. When my pre-Deutsch reasoning about this industry was accurate, it was mostly coincidental. What Deutsch gave me was a robust, satisfying, and deep framework for thinking about thinking —and thus about arguments, evidence, how data does and doesn’t describe reality, what sorts of things we do and don’t understand meaningfully, where AI is and why, what’s possible and what’s not possible for humanity through technology— and connecting that thinking to action in the world as I care about it. I’ve written a lot about David Deutsch, some of which applied his ideas to technology development: Design & CompromiseInterfaces, Empowerment, and the Human VoiceHow to Philosophize with a CursorFree Will and the Fallibility of ScienceWhat do you think the relationship is between an idea's reach and its accuracy?Why would Bill Gates recommend Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of our Nature?Is there a formal term for what Richard Feynman describes as a 'Vague Theory'?But in scores of larger and smaller ways, what I absorbed from The Beginning of Infinity and his previous book The Fabric of Reality helps me think about product design, development, technology, and all the systems involved. You can also find variously valuable representations of his ideas when he appears on podcasts or in videos. Other Sources In general, I’ve liked books and resources that Cover the history of human efforts —solitary or in groups— to achieve change or produce creative work. So everything from Folklore.org to even the usually-bad books on Apple to Alan Kay’s answers (and anything he cites) to scores of technological and industrial histories and videos and so on. Any sound accounting of how other serious, diligent humans have worked towards an end is great; I’ve found a lot of utility from reading about Vince Lombardi, military history, and space exploration. You’re looking for lessons about how to shepherd visions —large or small— through organizations, systems, people; lots of very capable women and men have labored at this and can be learned from.I think reading about the arts and artists and how they think about form, history, discovery, process, creativity, and unpredictability has been very helpful. In particular, I’d recommend just after The Beginning of Infinity Milan Kundera’s Testaments Betrayed (and, if you find it useful, The Art of the Novel). After that: Clive James’ Cultural Amnesia. The interrelation between ends and means, the management of inspiration and practice, the discipline of thinking about those experiencing what you make are among the sorts of things artists think and write well about.If you happen to be working on social systems, anything about humans (or about the sciences studying humans) can be great. Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind, for example, has obvious applications to how we design products like Quora. So too can books about psychology, economics, sociology, and so on. And this is to say nothing of e.g. general philosophy as it pertains to human beings and their motivations and perceptions, like that of Simone Weil.That’s probably a good sample of the ones I consider most useful, at least in my work. At this point in my career much or even most of what I read relates in closer or more distant (or more metaphorical) ways to what I do. But it’s honestly hard for me to imagine doing my job had I not been lucky enough to encounter The Beginning of Infinity, thanks to my dad!

So as a product designer who designs for the web or mobile that would mean a good understanding of how people use devices today. The capabilities of the devices. How technology is implemented in those devices. Including Android/Material Design, iOS and HTML5/CSS best practices.  Rather than being an in demand skill, I would consider the above must have. The tools required for the above are: Good understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. Also the various screen resolutions and features of mobile operating systems. A fair understanding of backend architecture. Enough to be able to carry out a decent (not heavy-duty) technical conversation with engineers and PMs. Next is the ability to communicate a design. You can use sketches to communicate. Or static mocks. Or Keynote. Or InVision. Or even actual code. There is greater value in providing higher fidelity. But if you consider the time to deliver high fidelity, the law of diminishing returns would come into play.  In common use, the above skill will be called prototyping. I like to call it communicating, though. Tools: Sketch (Photoshop is passé in my opinion), InVision, Pixate, Proto, Keynote  Next up is the ability to put the design in the context of a user. Engineers and product managers are good at thinking about technology and business needs. A product designer has to be the users' voice.  You call call it empathy, or designing with the user in mind. Tools: Persona development, story boarding, scenarios, use cases.  Then one needs some ability to look at the business side of things. Tools here could include service design, customer segmentation, value proposition and other artifacts that could feed into a business case. Having the above, apart from the regular design chops, can make you an in demand designer.",2021-03-06T08:20:09.843Z,"What are the most in-demand skills for a product designer? ",Quora

Both can't function without each other's input. Design is a field which lies between Art and engineering. A very thin line. If you go all aesthetics, in that case that product is just a show piece and if you go to the engineering side, then it's all about functionality.

I argue this because: A/B tests are cheap to run in internet software systemsThere are confounding effects in the network that only show up when you run a test.The single point of reference I’d recommend starting with is Wikipedia’s list of cognitive biases. For the same reason I recommend summary books instead of papers, my favorites at the time being: Predictably IrrationalInfluence — The Psychology of PersuasionOgilvy on Advertising (this is an unusual one but advertising is very relevant)But to illustrate the point, I’m going to take you over a sample of the Wikipedia list and offer some things designers would do with knowledge of that bias as they pop into my mind.  Ambiguity effect: The tendency to avoid options for which missing information makes the probability seem ""unknown"". Dark patterns — make the most user-centric option have the least information if it’s legally required to have. Anchoring or focalism: The tendency to rely too heavily, or ""anchor"", on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject) Used heavily in e-commerce. Comparing say a monthly subscription to a cup of coffee. Anthropomorphism or personification: The tendency to characterize animals, objects, and abstract concepts as possessing human-like traits, emotions, and intentions. Mascots, clippy when done wrong but works for kids’ software really well. Attentional bias: The tendency of our perception to be affected by our recurring thoughts. Used often in gaming. Introduce a concept and repeat it. People get stuck thinking in that way and find it hard to “think outside the box” Availability heuristic: The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater ""availability"" in memory, which can be influenced by how recent the memories are or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be. Referencing something that’s common knowledge in popular culture. Availability cascade: A self-reinforcing process in which a collective belief gains more and more plausibility through its increasing repetition in public discourse (or ""repeat something long enough and it will become true""). Repeating your value proposition as many times as possible. Bandwagon effect: The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Related to groupthink and herd behavior. Extremely common, counts in like buttons and social proof with faces of your friends. Cheerleader effect: The tendency for people to appear more attractive in a group than in isolation. Group dating products Confirmation bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. Used heavily in copywriting, position the pitch to align with people’s mistaken beliefs and fill out weak supporting evidence. Contrast effect: The enhancement or reduction of a certain perception's stimuli when compared with a recently observed, contrasting object. Understanding visual contrast is an underpinning of all visual design. Courtesy bias: The tendency to give an opinion that is more socially correct than one's true opinion, so as to avoid offending anyone. This varies by culture and influences how you write copy for things like content actions. Decoy effect: Preferences for either option A or B change in favor of option B when option C is presented, which is similar to option B but in no way better. This is a special case of anchoring. It’s used to sell travel packages often. Disposition effect: The tendency to sell an asset that has accumulated in value and resist selling an asset that has declined in value. Hugely important to know if you’re building an investment product, e.g. Wealthfront. Endowment effect: The tendency for people to demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it. Fear of loss of the familiar. This is why people complain so much when the design of a product they use a lot changes. Identifiable victim effect: The tendency to respond more strongly to a single identified person at risk than to a large group of people at risk. GoFundMe IKEA effect: The tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on objects that they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA, regardless of the quality of the end result. This applies to people who self-assemble their computers as well. Information bias: The tendency to seek information even when it cannot affect action. Product description pages, especially for more expensive products have a huge long-tail of information about the product.  Anyway, I can keep going forever at this rate and I’m only at 9/26 alphabets of just the first list of biases and my fingers are getting tired and you’re probably getting bored. Hopefully that helps illustrate that going wide is really important for a designers. Obviously, you’ll use some more than others but having many of these lenses to look through is going to serve you really well in the long-term. So pick the ones that seem most interesting to your field and dive deep from there. The Wikipedia articles usually reference the original study.

Well, it could be alarming to know that due to an improper design methodology, even a demanding and valuable digital product could drastically fail. Hence, the importance of design. Don't you worry, I'll in my answer how to work on that.  The design has a large number of definitions for each of its fields of application. In the context of your question, it is a methodology for solving a functional problem with a proper solution. The design draws its inspiration from Software Engineering. The discussion on that could make this answer unnecessarily long, so let us confine here to the understanding of digital product design with the following example. Suppose somebody wishes to get a large number of visitors to his website. For that, he could search the internet and use the methods learned after studying from there. A digital product as a solution to the problem could be an e-book or an online course, which could save him time by offering all the possible solutions in a single place. Such a digital product would be perfect and useful if that meets its purpose. For that, as a designer, one should have sound knowledge of the relevant field the product is serving. Nowadays, the role of product design skills has come into the mainstream. To help visualize all this, some examples of factors to consider when designing a digital product are: · What is the target audience? · How difficult is it to use/learn to use? If it's a course, how much time will it take? · What makes the product relevant and unique to the market? How long will the product stay that way? · What is the core, singular purpose the product serves? This is called the golden thread. · Is the product priced affordably for the market, but high enough that you aren't undercutting your value? · How accessible is the product for different devices, different media preferences (video, text, audio), etc? · How connected is the product to other products, to potentially get upsell and cross-sell sales? If you would follow a proper, proven methodology for digital product design, then that product could give more value and perform better in terms of its sales. The reason for mentioning sales here is that as a supplier, promoter, or a designer of that product, everyone would be concerned about its sales performance. A design methodology contributes to making a perfect digital product. How could anyone create a perfect digital product? For that, either I could suggest you the necessary tips, or I could discuss the methodology that I follow. To keep my answer to the point, I would prefer to discuss the methodology I follow. I apply the Perfect Product Creation for that. It is an hour-long video program teaching you how to build an awesome digital product, such as an online course or tool, regardless of your niche or whether you have experience in eCommerce. The program focuses on building and launching a great product that practically sells itself, getting you the maximum amount of buyers for your hard work. My experience with that has been amazing so far. I would recommend my post on that as it could help you understand digital product design with the help of illustrations that I have used there. To cover all those additional details in this answer won't be possible as that has hyperlinks for better understanding. To read that post, you can visit my website mach5trafficDOTcom. You can also stay updated with my Quora profile, where I discuss various digital products frequently, such as One Minute Free Traffic for free website traffic, List Warrior for email list building, etc. In the end, I would say: As a well-designed outfit adds to your personality, so too does design to a digital product.

Whether it is a good idea or a horrible one. A patent attorney will do just that -patent your idea. That’s how they make their money. Often times after spending thousands of dollars on a patent attorney I have had people come to me with a patented idea that just didn't fit their idea or even marketable and I had to tell them that the idea while patented needs to be developed which could cause the person to lose their current patent and have them to refile a new patent after the design is turned into something marketable. A good product designer will listen to your idea and offer suggestions on how to turn that infant idea into something tangible to reach a certain demographics and in the process - maybe create a utility patent. Now armed with a developed design you can take this and bring it to a patent attorney to do what they do best - patent. Now what to do with your idea before visiting the product designer. Outline your idea, what does it do? How do you think it should function, Who are your trying to reach with your design? File for a provisional patent - because it could change. Have the designer(s) sign an outlined NDA and discuss with them about your idea and see what they can do to help. Who do you hire..? There are some many designers out there. Never hire a designer who cant show you a portfolio. When choosing the designer make sure you get along with them because you might work with them for a while. Look at their portfolio.

It could go from just being an assistant to mechanical engineers at a fabric where manufacturing is mostly mechanized, or being part of a  design firm giving creative support and what not. At a fabric it would be likely to be in the design department, where parts that are produced are designed in a CAD program (solidworks, catia, inventor, etc). In other words, the product is designed in a 3 dimensional model on the computer, and drafting (or blueprints) of the part are drawn so the manufacturing department can take over at the production lines. Drafting is a big part of an internship as a product designer, since some engineers find it a tedious labor, they leave it to the interns to do it, and if you succeed to prove yourself among them engineers, you might get assigned your own projects.Being an intern at a big factory is a great way to learn how designing for mass production works, basically doing the same work as a mechanical engineer.  At a design firm or a small corporative, tasks could be a bit more challenging creatively, which is good I guess, letting you support with ideas for a new promotional stand, and exploring more artistic or crafty branches of design.Product designers are very versatile, I’m sure there a lot I didn’t include here but that should give you an idea.",2021-03-06T08:43:04.754Z,"What do product design interns do?

Questions may be different but all uses the very basics DS/Algo concepts to solve that) So questions related product design etc may be derived from the most needed computer science subjects (e.g. DS/Algo).

From candidate side e.g. the way CV (resume) was presented, the way the candidate carried the technical/non-technical discussion and many more ) You may design a approach which best suits to your skills/(and many others) related parameters  Example: someone may use  the following approach, for a two months plan - around 250 hours to prepare software engineer/software engineer in test type of interviews for MS/Google/...

Everything had to be in line with each other, and designed in a way that was appealing to the target market. To do that, it's not all that much different than working at other toy companies like Hasbro or Mattel.  You need to be familiar with marketing & design, especially with children.  Do you have a good feeling for what products match a particular customer profile?  How good are you at understanding and reacting to customer feedback?  Etc. Then there's what most people think of when they think of LEGO product designers: set designers.  Those are the people that actually figure out how to build the cool models that get sold in stores.  They decide which pieces to use and how to use them. For that, there's been a lot of insight (many set designers have commented on this online), so we have a relatively good understanding of what the job entails.  You need to be familiar with LEGO-- how do you use the LEGO geometry and elements to achieve certain results?  Which ones are sturdy, and which ones are flimsy?  You'll need that because your designs will need to change a lot, and you have to react. You also need a good design sense.  How do you make a model look elegant and cool-- as well as functional?  You may get an assignment to make a $20 land vehicle for a LEGO Chima character, and you'll need to make sure that it ""fits"" with the rest of the theme, has play features that kids will like, and is attractive enough that kids (and parents!) will want to buy it. There's also other design positions, too-- like designing new LEGO elements, or things like ""playing cards"", game components, and other merchandise.  And again, all of these really rely on having good design sense and experience.  Focusing on kids, if possible. Another thing to bring up:  LEGO in particular prefers to have its designers in Denmark, at their corporate headquarters.  There are design jobs in other places, but that's the central place where most of the magic happens.  So if you're not willing to move to Denmark, you'll have a harder time getting a design job with LEGO. Here's some other insights that might help: What's it like to be a LEGO designer?

Unlike Photoshop and Illustrator which have been adapted over time to support aspects of UX design, Fireworks is the only tool that was designed for this purpose.  Here's my top 3 reasons for using Fireworks: 1. Pixel perfect vectorWhen it comes to working on mockups I've found working with vectors to be much more efficient than working with bitmaps. This is even more true now with mobile workflows and multiple resolutions. Sure Illustrator is the godfather of vector but it wasn't designed for the pixel perfect precision of UX design, it was designed for print. In order to get Illustrator to work appropriately you have to set your keyboard increments to .5 pixels in order to deal with blurry pixels when moving objects. Photoshop has been adapted to include vector objects but it's much more clumsy to work with them than Illustrator or Fireworks.  2. Pages & StatesPhotoshop and Illustrator were designed for the single page document workflow  such as designing a poster. Fireworks is more like InDesign in that it was designed for the multi-page workflow. This makes a lot more sense when you are working on a workflow for a website where you would like to show the progression through a design in the same document. You wouldn't use Photoshop to layout every page in a book, so why would you use it to layout every page in a website.  Sure Photoshop has the Layer States panel and Illustrator has Artboards, but I've found these later additions to be less efficient than the Pages and States model in Fireworks. 3. Symbols and LibrariesSimilar to Flash Fireworks allows you create symbols and library from vectors or bitmaps. It also includes common libraries with rich symbols for OS or browser widgets such as dropdown menus, radio buttons, etc. In the latest version (CS6) there are common libraries for mobile such as iPhone widgets. You can also make your own symbols such as a footer for a web page and then edit it once have it updated across every mock for your site.  There are a number of other great advantages to Fireworks that have made it my tool of choice such as the contextual properties panel which eliminates the overload of dialogs that you get in Photoshop and Illustrator when manipulating elements and the CSS properties panel which shows you the cross browser CSS3 code for the selected element. However all in all I've just found I work faster and more efficiently in Fireworks. I think a lot of other people would find that too, but it means taking the leap in learning a new tool and fighting the muscle memory from the old tool. Once you do I don't think you'll regret it.

Through much emailing and time, you could weed throughly and come up with any number of people that you can “trust” with your ideas.

And as victory in the direction that has every artist struggling with point-and-purpose, at that time (point 3) because every artist goes through the season of wondering what the point or purpose was, in becoming an artist- no matter the classification) Right now, all over the world, there are literally tens of thousands of artist, designers, and inventors that just want to show ‘what’ they can do. think of it as volunteering their time, with potential to make money. After which, for those not selected, you'd let them keep their project. when the deadline is up, you’d evaluate which projects to utilize and secure, which have potential, and which ones are not going to work for you. you should only be out your time ( a year or more) and the amount that you budgeted for the process.

The project we're working on that I describe below is trying to tackle the energy problem in a different direction. While clean/green tech will eventually become more effective for the time being one way to reduce energy consumption in the home is through education and incentivization.  Project Overview:We are researching how to best display energy data in the home setting. With the advent of smart meters many homeowners are now capable of seeing their energy consumption data with a much higher level of detail than that of the monthly energy bill. Our belief is that through leveraging a combination of human centered design and behavioral economics principles we might be able to create a product capable of long term energy behavior change. The Interfaces:Over the past year, through extensive iterative design, we have narrowed down our project to three energy interfaces. Each interface has been designed to target a specific behavioral economics principles so that we may better understand what ""works"" when it comes to energy data. 1) Cognitive Interface - Powerbar  This interface is designed to appeal to the fact that, in general, people trust a source of information that has numbers/graphs attached to it, even if they do no know what this information means. In this case we are using this dashboard as a control for our other designs since it mirrors many of the energy dashboard currently out there (think LucidDesign).  2) Affective Interface - Kidogo   With Kidogo we are trying to appeal to the empathetic side of a given individual while reframing their energy consumption to make it more meaningful. Turning off a lightbulb might save an american a dollar or so a month but to someone in a developing country it might provide them with lifesaving medicine or seed. Think of this interface as a mashup between Kiva and Free Rice.  3) Social Interface - SplitBar*Still can't get this one uploaded :/The third interface is focused on leveraging social cues/pressures to magnify the importance of a person's energy savings. By anchoring an individual's energy usage to a friendly competition against friends or rivals you encourage the person to learn more about the number (energy used) that might otherwise remain meaningless. The usage of social pressure is another important factor, people are more likely to do something if they see that others are doing it as well.",2021-03-06T09:01:47.006Z,"What is the most exciting product design research going on at Stanford in 2011?

As I mention in my other answer though you need to temper rates with the fact that work is sporadic, and even ""full time"" jobs can only be a few weeks (obviously large effects films can involve months of prep, but they would be outliers). As to your profit sharing question, there can be some very minor profit sharing on large films with crew, but it's not generally a major source of compensation. Because of how films get released it can take decades for films to show a net profit (if ever) regardless of cashflow since there's always expenses to collateralize against and ""gross points"" are rare. On indie films it's difficult to profit share without sabotaging your ability to sell a title, and any such are usually limited to above-the-line personnel.

As a designer, you have to get comfortable building on top of abstractions you don’t fully trust, while simultaneously trying to understand them better. As a hyper rational math/cs person I found this really hard at first. I’ll explain what I mean in much more detail soon. Now, since perception and psychology are the building blocks for design, they’re very easy to learn about in a field entirely outside design without realizing you’re learning them at all, e.g. in architecture or art or public speaking, or just by living life. Now, what you end up with is people who have skill at design but can’t articulate how they built it up, because they’re not learning a human-created system from scratch, they’re bringing all their unobservable knowledge of the world into their work. This is why some people have the ability to evaluate whether something is good design or not before being able to build it, and they call this taste. A lot of designers start off their careers feeling like this:  Selected panels from Ira Glass’ Advice to Beginners via Zen Pencils  Let’s dig into why this happens. The commonality in the fields is that in both you build systems [1] to accomplish goals using some building blocks. For example an engineer writes a few lines of code to output the fibonacci sequence. def fibRec(n):     if n < 2:         return n     else:         return fibRec(n-1) + fibRec(n-2) This simple example above composes arithmetic, functions, recursion, etc. To even a beginner programmer this is very easy to read but what’s going on is that we’re combining rigorously defined, well documented, human created concepts to accomplish a goal. Meanwhile, a designer moves/manipulates the building blocks of text and color to accomplish the goal of warning someone on the road.  These examples may seem mundane but let’s analyze them: The color is deliberately bright red since many studies show it’s the most effective color at grabbing attention.The font is neutral and is condensed. It’s designed to be legible for short pieces of text from a distance and in the blur of rainThe sign is octagonal to be easily recognizable even when the elements of color and type don’t work, or when you see it from the other side.The building blocks with design are the rules of human perception and all the cognitive biases that come along with it, and we don’t fully understand the rules because we didn’t create them. They were handed to us by nature and culture, in ways the explanations have been forgotten to.  This mindset shift is the first thing to get comfortable with. You’re not going to learn design the same way you learnt math or programming, so get comfortable with that. With that in mind, here’s some concrete tips See lots of examples of good design. Your subconscious brain will learn to like it without you being able to compositionally explain it. Personally, for me this meant observing lots of furniture, documentaries like Helvetica, architecture, apps, signage, etc. with the attitude of trying to figure out why things work.At the same time, start learning some basics of communication design, I took one in college, but there’s plenty online for free now. They’ll start showing you some of the basic elements of visual perception and how to manipulate them. It’s really important that you do these two together. If you don’t it’ll be like reading a textbook and skipping over the exercises, you won’t really get it. And then it’s really just a matter of observing to build taste, and iterating to live up to your taste. One (admittedly fuzzy) analogy I like for explaining design to machine learning people is that you think of how something makes you feel as the objective function, the basic elements of contrast and layout and motion as the inputs, and you build things to do a forward pass, and then back-propagate the errors. Other than that, there’s already plenty of resources on the internet and I’m happy to guide you as well, but I felt like it’s much more important to get into the right mindset than any tools I can offer you here.",2021-03-06T09:11:14.327Z,"What is the best way for an engineer to get better at product design?

Second, by self education. Also in product design, there are two broad categories. One is physical product design,i.e. furniture, manufactured goods, accessories, etc. And second category is digital products ,i.e. websites, apps, softwares etc. Generally one is either interested in physical or digital one. So first decide what is your area of interest. If you are interested in digital product design, you better start with some graphic design or UI/UX design course. If your interest is physical products, then you can start on your own. The very first thing you have to do is just observe. Observe all different kind of products that are around us ..that we use everyday. Think about is there any way to make them better. Just think about it and try to make some concepts. Now suppose you have got an idea to make a killing key holder. But now it's just a concept in your head. The job of the product designer is to bring this concept on paper by sketching it, or on any CAD software (Computer Aided Design) so that others can see that concept before actually making that product in reality. For that, you need to have drawing skills. There's no shortcut, you need to learn drawing. My advice is to learn drawing on paper first. Dedicate 1or 2 years to learn it. After that you can proceed to CAD. This is how you bring the concept in some understandable visualization. The next step will be prototyping and continuously iterating and after that finalizing a design and actually making/ manufacturing the product. Then marketing and distribution. But marketing and distribution is not your job! But everything before it is a product designer's business and that's all you need to learn in order to become a product designer.

One thing that CAD cannot give you is experience - this is the training and experience you gain through practice, research and, lets face it, fooling around. You can gain a lot of experience in designing something fanciful, e.g. your own modernisation of a Ferrari 308, or reimagining the Starship Enterprise…or perhaps a kitchen tap, or a vacuum cleaner. There is no such thing as wasted effort to the practicing designer.

604348dbed76476feda266cc,https://www.quora.com/How-will-software-product-design-change-for-VR?-,"Jérôme Cukier There are many similarities to designing for VR and 2D: both are rooted on a user problem, quickly prototyping a number of potential solutions to that problem, then validating your assumptions with users along the way. The main differences I've noticed pertain to thinking in 3D and communicating 3D/spatial concepts. Thinking in 3D shouldn't be new to those with an industrial design or architecture background. However, those of us with a traditional graphic design or UI design background will need to adjust to a new way of thinking. In VR, designers have a few additional considerations to keep in mind when designing interfaces, like scale, distance, and position relative to the user. Think of a grid interface, for example; no longer can designers draw a rectangle and a couple squiggly lines and say “voilá it's an app!” In VR, we must answer questions like “how big is the grid?”, “how far away from the user is it?”, “what happens if I look behind the grid?”, “does it follow my gaze or is it static?” Communicating 3D/spatial concepts is one of the most challenging parts of the VR design process. Many VR designers rely on prototyping their ideas in a game engine like Unity or Unreal then trying them in headset—after all, there's no better way to test out an idea in VR than putting it on your face. However, VR prototyping tools are not as mature as their 2D counter parts, so prototyping complex VR prototypes today require deeper knowledge of C# than designers are comfortable with. In this case, I've noticed designers adopt a similar role to a Concept Artist where they sketch out story boards describing a flow, then work with a prototyper and 3D artist to bring those story boards to user testing. As VR prototyping tools and VR patterns evolve, I suspect VR designers will remain focused on solving user problems by exploring solutions that best use the spatial relationship between the user and the interfaces necessary to accomplish a goal.",2021-03-06T09:18:19.058Z,"How will software product design change for VR?

Whether you want prices for designing mechanical parts, architectural plans, residential or commercial buildings, 3D printing designs or even 3D animation designs, you need to get familiar with the steps of the creation processes and the tools that are used. CAD (Computer-aided design) software is used for creating, modifying, analyzing, or optimizing designs. CAD software come in numerous price ranges and different professional levels, and that is an important price factor. CAD is used in a variety of applications, including Automobile and ship building, and aerospace industries, architectural and industrial design, medical, and many more. For mechanical design either vector-based graphics or raster graphics may be used. Yet, it involves more than mere shapes. 3D software deliver required information about other aspects of a project, elements such as materials and dimensions.  Although all the above information is good to know, and it helps building a solid understanding of the processes involved, but I suggest that the best solution for pricing is looking for prices of similar projects. Whether you want to use a Freelance designer or a professional company to create your 3D design, connecting to several designers and comparing the results can pave the way for you. In order to give you an idea of the price ranges for 3D design, take a look at the following hourly prices, as well as some object prices. Freelancer designers charge: €15 to €140 per hour for Architectural 3D design.€10 to €75 per hour for 3D Modeling projects.€30 to €140 per second for creating 3D Animation.Note: The low range in the above estimates are numbers from India. There are much higher ranges available in the freelance market as well. Here is a list of prices for objects created by an entry level artist who makes €45,000 a year in EU: A barrel, drum, box or crate, €45 to €55A warehouse structure, Empty €480 to €570Construction objects, pillars, ceiling, arches, doorways, €710 to €810Small industrial plan without objects, €2,380 to €2,845Larger industrial plan without objects, €4,740 to €5,690Landscape of a city without objects, €4,742 to €7,5903D Character, small, under 1000 triangles, €7103D Character, medium, under 2500 triangles, €14203D Character, large, under 5000 triangles, €2370 and €4740 with animation The last note is that the 3D design world is very competitive.

You can’t program your way into being the next microsoft, facebook, or google. Product design means asking questions about users, not software. What do people want to do right now that is hard for them to do?When they need to do that thing, what do they have to do, and what’s wrong with what they’re doing that makes it hard?When users do this difficult thing, is this the end goal, or is there something else, something more general, that is really the problem they are trying to solve? (If so, restate the problem and iterate).Is there anyone else trying to help people do (whatever it is)? What product or service do they offer, and why doesn’t this product or service solve peoples’ problems?You can do this at any level, from designing a better file selection dialog to shooting rockets to Mars. But the point of this exercise is not the dialog or the rocket. The point is solving the problem you’re trying to solve using the dialog or the rocket. Elon Musk wants to send rockets to Mars. But that’s not the goal, that’s the means. He thinks we’re heading for an Extinction Level Event, and wants humanity to have a backup plan. In fact, limiting your thinking to solving a problem in a specific way (a file dialog, a rocket) is the enemy of good product design. There are, for instance, other ways to save humanity. I betcha there was a day when Elon Musk went down a list of ways to save the world, including undersea colonies, running for president, etc., and decided rockets was the best way. Once you have a worthy problem to solve, you can start looking at different ways to solve it. As a software person, you’re naturally going to think of software ways. If you limit yourself too much to software though, a competitor will come along after you’ve pioneered the product, and eat your lunch. Is there a software way to help people by automating a task?Can you centralize data about a task?Can software facilitate a task over the Internet?Can a community be formed, gathering users or providers together to achieve economy of scale?If you want to learn more about product design, you can learn about Quality Function Deployment, a Japanese visual tool for mapping why’s to how’s that Honda used to make great cars. You cal look at Triz, a Russian system for automating innovation. I’m sure there are other tools out there.

That said, it's not for everyone. Ultimately, you're the only who can know for sure what direction you want your life to go. If you're hard working and dedicated, you can do just about anything. However, there are some practical considerations to keep in mind when switching majors, so here are my thoughts: How far are you into the Mechanical Engineering program? Mechanical engineering is a powerful degree that opens many doors. If you are more than halfway through and making good grades, you should consider completing your degree and then pursuing industrial design as a masters degree. If possible, add iD as a minor or take some classes related to it. You can spend your free time outside of class developing your design skills so that you are a more versatile than other engineers in your program. The world needs more engineers than can also think creatively.Does your current school offer product design as a major? If not, you have to weigh the benefits of reapplying to another school and possibly starting over again. Many iD programs are studio based and you would have to complete all 4 years of their program from the beginning, regardless of how many credits you already have. And while most universities offer mechanical engineering, far fewer offer industrial design and the ones that do are very competitive and hard to get into.You said you're already good at CAD, but are you also good at sketching and freehand drawing? ""Ideation"" is a crucial part of the industrial design process. The ability to draw concepts quickly while working in a group environment is highly sought after. You can learn this, but it requires a lot of work and doesn't happen overnight. Many of the top schools will want to see a portfolio of your artwork before you can even be admitted into their program. Take a look at these sketches and think about whether this is the kind of work you want to spend hours getting good at. Notice that most of this is freehand, not CAD. (although most product designers also know and use CAD, it typically comes later in the design process). On a personal note, sketching is NOT my strong suit but I still manage to get by. I sketch just enough to get my ideas down and then do the rest in CAD (Solidworks, Rhino, Fusion360, Sketchup... I use them all). This is fine for me since I started my own company, but if I wanted to be competitive against other designers on the open market I would need much better sketching skills than I currently have (which is difficult now because I have a messed up hand). It's my single greatest weakness as a designer, but I make up for it by being an exceptional machinist, fabricator, sculptor, and technical problem solver. I'm also really good at material science and sociology- which helps a lot with UX and interface design. Sketching is the heart and soul of industrial design. Master it.Do you hate your current major? Or do you simply love industrial design more? If you find yourself hating your current program, then it sounds like you need a change regardless of whether or not that is product design. If you like your current major and are doing well at it, but want to work in product design, then there are ways you can set yourself up to be a mechanical engineer on a product development team. Find some iD students working on a project that needs a mechanical engineer and help them out using your 3D modeling skills while learning as much from them as you can. Read books on iD and practice designing products on your own. Get an internship at a company that specializes in product design. Mechanical engineering is a large field with many opportunities, but if you are committed to product design you can choose to work on projects that are more consumer product related and thus build your résumé with that as your expertise.Industrial design may seem glamorous, but designers are just part of a larger team that also includes engineers and business people so there’s more than one way to be involved in the product development process. The good news is that your current degree is closer to working in that field than if you were, for example, a ""heath and nutrition major.""

I picked up a double major in Human-Computer Interaction and am working in various groups where sometimes I'm the only engineer, sometimes I'm the only designer, or sometimes I'm among others and yet the only one who understands both. It allows me to use some of my CS knowledge to inform the design process, which can be pretty useful since many designers don't have that kind of technical background and will highlight different (although generally equally useful) facets of a product design problem. HCI can be a pretty academic subject (papers, research, conferences, etc.), which can be good and bad, but it does bear a bit more resemblance to CS that full-on design in that regard. Another thing you can do, if you haven't already, is to gain some experience in front-end development if you're currently more of a theory/systems/back-end/whatever-type person. It's kind of an oversimplification, but front-end development is another area that sort of bridges CS and design. And if you have at least basic skills in back-end development (probably strengthened by some CS know-how), front-end development, and design (ideally encompassing a bit of all the distinct areas of product, interaction, and visual, but whatever), you can be pretty self-sufficient at working on personal projects (time willing), which is a fantastic opportunity for design practice. Web design is a great place to get started, in my opinion, because having a programming background aids how rapidly you can work. One thing I've realized, career-wise, is that most companies are pretty bewildered at the idea of someone having both engineering (much less a theoretical CS background) and design skills. When I first started entertaining the idea of looking for design-related internships, I was pretty wishy-washy and was looking for the ideal position in which I could do 50/50 of both roles. But many companies wouldn't take me seriously, and the rest just didn't know what pile to put my application in. While learning more about design doesn't necessarily mean abandoning CS, I did have to pretty intentionally pivot into a design-oriented direction. I guess one piece of advice would be to carefully consider the direction you'd like to head in and be intentional about which actions you take to head there.",2021-03-06T09:22:38.820Z,"What can I learn to ease the transition from CS to product design?

Example: Safe drinking water; a passive solar desalination plant for use by evacuees in disaster zones in Bangladesh that is made entirely from local ceramics and has no envisioned expiry date; should it break though, it can be fixed with locally prolific techniques, or simply dumped without any ill effect on the environment, because it’s ceramics.

If it's a website or a motion graphic/video project, I would charge a higher hourly rate than if I were to do a logo design/re-design project. Similarly, if a client seems to have a bigger, more established company, I would quote them a higher price. If I like them because they keep bringing more work, it would also affect my pricing. And then you'd have to factor in some of the obvious - you won't be working 2000 hours/year freelancing. You won't get benefits. Other expenses also come out of your own pocket. All of those things affect how much you should charge your hourly rate. But all of that doesn't mean jack if the client won't give you the job. So we're back at square one - how good are you, or rather, how experienced are you? How many different types of design can you do (web, print, logo, video, animation, etc.)? So the initial formula is flawed in these regards. But it works well enough as a template for when you're just starting out. So if that's all you need, feel free to stop reading. Otherwise, continue on below to hear more about my experience going through the journey you're about to go on. And I'm also just close to a year in doing freelancing work on serious mode, so you can expect to soon encounter a lot of the points below as you start doing your own freelance work. —— Personally, I'm moving away from the hourly rate thing and getting more into charging by the project because of the flawed logic I pointed out earlier. To that end, I have stopped giving clients my rate up front. Rather, I would ask them what their ball park budget is and what their scope of work of would roughly entail, and craft a proposal that can navigate around these points. This requires a couple of things. I need to have an idea of how much a project is worth. And this requires working through a few projects of the same kind and play around with the pricing and scope of work to determine my sweet spot - the highest return rate for the amount of work I put out.I need to see how much a typical client is willing to pay for each particular type of project. This means I'd have to have worked with a reasonable amount of clients first, and the clients need to see how experienced I am with projects similar to what they're looking for.How comfortable I am with certain types of projects. The better I get with building websites, the more I get to charge people per website. If I have little experience in video editing, I might need to settle for a small monetary loss for a gain in experience and portfolio piece.Here are some lessons and philosophies that I employ which seem to be working in bringing me more business. I hope they can help you somewhat as well: I make it my mission to help them. And this goes beyond just offering them my service. I love talking to clients and prospects and explain to them little things I learned that might enlighten them or shed lights on some common confusions and misconceptions in regards to design and branding. You'd be surprised to learn that many clients are completely clueless and intimidated by words like SEO, CMS, PMS, etc. They feel like they have gotten free information from you and that you are genuinely trying to help them, not prying pennies out of them.Clients need to walk away happier, or at least neutral, than when they walked in. To this end, don't get frustrated, rude, or condescending to clients (you might think duh). They are better than you at what they do. That's how they found the money to employ your services in the first place. You can't control how they feel about the product, but you can control how they feel about you. Be friendly, be funny, be courteous. Feel free to vent out your occasional frustrations to a close friend or family, but don't go around complaining about your past clients to others. The world is a small place. I once had a client write me a not-so-nice email declaring he didn't want anything to do with my cohort after my partner at the time flipped out on a previous client for not paying us over a month after the completion of a project. I vowed to never let that happen again.To most clients, convenience > cost. Otherwise, they would have spent the time designing their logos themselves to save cost. But they realized, as any decent business owner does, that there are a million other things to tend to, and it's not worth the time to try and do everything themselves. Make things convenient for them. Work that mentality into your every step dealing with clients, from the proposal, proofs to the invoice, payment, and documentations. Clients don't have PayPal? Use Square. They don't know how to send the logo to a print shop? Include the instructions in the documentation.I avoid doing massive sales and discounts. I used to, but it seems fake and disingenuous to me now. We have all come across those sales where everything was marked 90% off from the initial MSRP. Hurry and act now within 24 hours before it's gone! You came back a month later and that price tag was still the same. My Dad taught me if you were offering a discount, work it into the equation. Show the client precisely where and why you could give them that discount. Show them that you were sifting through the proposal, the scope of work—down to the commas and the periods—to save them money; not just pulling some random amount out of your ass. Otherwise, it's better to just charge them whatever amount and work your ass off to earn that money, which brings me to my next point.Give them their money's worth. Don't just throw the clients the logo or the website and call it a day. Take the time to draft and design a nice proposal. Make the proofs look professional and meaty. Give them advices and suggestions, do the extra research to save them money when third-party services are required. Send them follow-up calls and emails after each and every proposal or proof. Send them a nice and detailed documentation with useful information on the font, the color profile, etc. Sometimes, it may feel extraneous, but remember that's it's hard to justify paying hundreds or thousands of dollars on a single piece of graphics. Give them quantifiable products along with the quality of the products themselves.Referrals and testimonials are great ways to bring in more clients from one previous client. Of course, you'd need a happy client first to get them to write nice things about you (refer to point #2). A good word from a client means thousands of dollars in advertisement. I usually offer them a small discount in exchange for a review if they found my services worthwhile and enjoyable. I'm not bribing them, but I make sure that they can only walk away neutral or happy after working with me from the start. If they're happy, I get them to write a nice little testimonial. If they turned out neutral, the small discount would still lighten their day a bit. It's a win-win.Cross-selling and up-selling are two useful techniques to generate more money out of a client. And this is something I'm working on so I'm not gonna say too much about it. But it does seem to go back to point #3, make it convenient for clients. If they got a website done, they'd usually need things like SEO, copywriting, social media outreach, etc. Offer to do some research for them and let them make the decision to take on those extra services or not. A recent client offered me to take care of Google Ad for them after I have explained to them how those things work. I got them to understand the importance of these things, but I also got them slightly overwhelmed at the thought of doing all that themselves. And boom, potential for extra income. Similar concepts are present with logo design and other stationery products that usually go along with it.So yeah, a lot of things to worry about, and it gets overwhelming sometimes. I haven't even gotten the chance to finish my own website yet, along with a billion other things to do. Check out some of the resources I collected that might help on your journey. Cheers!

Field testing In software testing, you use analysis softwares to validate the design. In a typical mechanical/automobile industry there are many analysis softwares, to validate their design. Each and every company has got their own/customised/licensed version of softwares, suitable to the requirement of their product. In Lab testing, you create artificial real time scenario environment and constrained parameters. For example, a car can undergo destructive testing in a lab testing methodology, where the impact of the load will be created artificially, under constrained parameters. In field testing, you can validate your design in real time scenario, with real time parameters. Although it will take good amount of time, this would give accurate results. If field testing gives you accurate results, then why go for the above two testings?? Because, every product design has got its own flaws, which are not know during design phase..So, after product design, it has to be analysed where you will conform the design to standards/norms of the organisation (or) the customer requirement (or) previous failure mode (or) new idea. Once, design is analysed, there may (may not) be redesigning of the product, depending on the analysis results of the product. Again there will be some design changes. Finally, once the design is gone through the analysis phase, it will go to lab testing. Some times, a trial batch will get manufactured and then real time field testing will happen. Normally, in industrial/mechanical/automobile companies they will do the design, perform analysis, re design the product (subjected to analysis results), trial batch manufacturing, lab testing (some companies prefer), field testing (all the companies prefer). This how normally, product design is validated. PS: Since I am from mechanical industry background, I have taken reference of an engineering industry procedure and answered this. Hope this helps.

The value of that distinction is what you make it. There are several different approaches to making UX design decisions, but one that works well for beginners is to design things with a focus on the user.

Those people will be able to tell you how they feel when they use your app, what their needs are, etc. If you're a product design genius, feel free to skip that step :P As a general note, there is one very important difference between designing a website and designing a product. A naive interface designer will make things that look pretty; good product designers, by contrast, make things that are simple and highly functional. Great product designers make things that are simple, functional and enjoyable. Here are some things that I think will be helpful: Study ""flows.""Workflows, signup flows, all kinds of flows. An important part of designing a great product experience is making everything feel natural and obvious. If you can, sign up for Path (social network) and screenshot every step in the sign up flow. It's pretty amazing how seamless it is. Compare mobile apps to their web counterparts.The constraints that mobile brings are pretty interesting, and it's important to know what can and can't be done.

Thank you for visiting our profile on fiverr.——————————————————————————————————go to Fiverr > & search karuzone—————————————————————————————————— Digital product design is an iterative design process used to solve a functional problem with a formal solution. A digital product designer identifies an existing problem, offers the best possible solution, and launches it to a market that demonstrates demand for the particular solution. The field is considered a subset of product design. Digital product design is a transdisciplinary field because a digital product designer sees the project from end-to-end; from recognizing an opportunity and understanding the customer's need through to final delivery. A digital product designer is an integral part of the creative team at every stage of the process who leads the UI and UX design throughout, and is also involved in the product strategy with an entrepreneurial mindset to help get it to the market. Although computer programming is not a required skill for a digital product designer, digital product designers need to have a high-level understanding of how all of the technical pieces work together in order to ensure that the creative vision is fully realized. Digital product designers who are able to code are far more likely to succeed in this career field. Although part of a digital product designer's job is to oversee the look and feel of the product as well as the development of the software system, digital product design is a different creative process and career path from graphic design and web design. ———————————————————————————————————— To get premium business logo for your brand go to Fiverr > & search karuzone ————————————————————————————————————- Check our creative portfolio-     I hope this will be so helpful to you.If you need more info please keep in touch at go to Fiverr > & search karuzone Bybyyy, takecare & namaste.

Check this out: How much does it cost to patent an idea 4. Do you have money to fight for the patent if someone does infringe upon it? This is the most important point. The point of a patent is to legally bar someone from taking your idea. It is putting an intellectual flag in the ground. If you do not have the resources to defend it, don't bother.

If the plan is to begin manufacturing it and have it a cornerstone of your business, then go ahead. If not, don't bother.  6. Does it work? The design needs to be researched. What ways does it not work? 7. Does it fill a need? Really think about the design. Is there something out there that can fill it without your idea?  How does your product fit into the market? What is its potential?  8. Who is your competition? If you are new with little resources, bigger players can evaluate your design and just steal it. You may threaten to sue, but they will have the resources to drive you out of business. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T09:46:17.323Z,"Is it worthwhile to protect your product designs? ",Quora

You should construct a point of view that is consistent with problems your prospective users encounter. Ideate: This is where you start coming up with solutions, as many as you can, seriously as many as you can. Be creative. Consider all the possible contexts in which your users will encounter your product, what they need it for, etc. You should begin to form and develop a cohesive solution to the problem. Prototype: Use whatever prototyping software you want or need to bring this idea to life. I’m an interface designer, so my toolbox includes Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, Sketch, Photoshop, etc. The first two are for fast, simple wireframes. The latter two are slower but better for more hi-fidelity prototypes. Try to stick more with the former because you don’t want to waste too much time on something that you haven’t yet tested. (At this stage, you should be primarily focused on the information architecture, the userflow, etc. not the “does this need a drop shadow”) Testing: This is where the magic happens. You can use usertesting.com, or simply find individuals in the target demographic to test your product. There are lots and lots of services/possibilities to test, just do some research. Repeat 4 and 5. Design is an iterative process. Use the feedback you get from the testing stage to refine or even reroute the solution. Best of luck.

A change by Amazon has led to the entire industry moving in that direction as it has set the standard for customer expectation. Your “product design” is an end to end experience and if shipment or delivery is not meeting the customer expectation you will fail. Same applies to packaging - customer now expects to open a package easily (and it has to be aesthetically pleasing like Apple), be recycle-able or allow for packaging to be left behind (iKea) etc. In each of these instance the product design has to include all the expectations of the customer.Change in technology: A few relevant examples are evolution of voice interface, AI/ML, AR/VR etc. As these are still evolving the full impact of these on product design is not clear, what is clear is they are changing the product design significantly. Customers do not want a complicated menu structure on a app or website, they want to be able to tell Hey Google or Alexa in natural language what they want and expect it to be done be it tuning to a radio station or controlling the home environment (TV, smart devices etc.) Customer expects you to know what the want (leveraging AI/ML to predict behavior patterns) and meet their needs. Customer don’t want to bring the furniture home and see how it looks, they want to be able to leverage Augmented reality to visualize it on their device or screen before buying it. Customer service is being done using Bots in many industries. All these technologies will go through their own cycle of adoption (hype,success etc.) and fundamentally evolve product design for every product.Adoption: Technology by itself is not sufficient, it needs to be adopted. As smart phone were adopted, they changed our life style. Similarly would today smart devices get adopted - will it be Alexa and Google smart devices? Would Internet of Things come to life? Would 5G bring the dream of IoT (connected things) to life? Adoption of these technologies dictates how products will get designed.Hope this helps!

He could search the internet and try some methods he learned there, after studying a few different blogs, forums, social communities, or other places.

It's a consistent, reliable problem or question people tend to have, at this stage of their website projects. If you have a similar problem in mind when designing a product, one that plagues your target customers, you will have guaranteed yourself a marketable audience. Beyond that, the following factors should be considered while designing a digital product: · What is your target audience and what do they want? As stated above. · How much time and effort is the design process going to take, and how much of that you are willing to skip past with money? · How long could you expect to make money off this idea? · Is the process affordable at your current income? If not, can you pace it out slower or make something more efficient? · What are the most successful products like yours, and what can you learn from them?

Physical models are important for controlling your concept; if it works or not, is your product fits to the target group, how does it look in real materials, is your margin of error during production is enough, and the questions go on and on.  In conclusion models' role in the design process is to take the concept from paper and bring it to real life.

This is due to the lowering of the barriers to entry and the greater availability of start-up capital (not Angel or VC money either). There are massive niches that consist of hundreds of thousands of potential users that want/need products that are too small for large manufacturers to target. So the future is rapid prototype PCBs and 3D Printers. It is toaster ovens rewired to become reflow ovens. It is Digikey and Mouser overnight deliveries and MDC 7722FV pick and place machines in garages or basements. It is running free PCB design software and home rolled Microprocessor code built on Open Source products. It is 2 or 3 guys being able to go from concept to Alpha in 6 months for under $10K. It is prototypes being enough to get customers through Crowdfunding and distribution channels if it is successful. It does not need a VC or Angel to write you a million dollar check to get started.

That process flipped the following year. The iPhone 8 took everything wrong with the iPhone 7…and fixed none of it. Yes, they added wireless charging, but only at the expense of added weight, thickness, and fragility. Apart from that and a minor spec boost, the phones are identical. I’m not sure you can even call it an upgrade! I’d argue that it looks and feels worse than the iPhone 7 in your hand. The iPhone X was and is even worse. With an all-new UI that makes everything take longer and is harder to use, the polarizing notch, and the strange vertical cameras, the iPhone X departed from the path of form over function and went straight to hell. It looks like an eclectic geek toy, not a work of art like some of Apple’s previous phones. The Apple watch is in a similar situation: it invented bizarre input methods used by no one else and applied them inconsistently throughout, all the while looking only okay. There’s nothing about it that draws the eye; again, it’s another eclectic geek toy. Samsung took the opposite route. It can be argued that the s8 is less practical than the s7; it’s certainly more fragile and offers no exterior upgrades besides looks. However, the phone itself looks amazing. The minimal front bezels easily blend into the background, and with the home button hidden behind the display, you don’t have to relearn anything before using it while still getting a beautiful full-front experience. The phone has a good heft and feel in the hand; still not quite as nice as the iPhone 7, but miles ahead of most of the competition. In conclusion, I’d say Apple fell off the path of minimalist form and fell into the pit of geeky weirdness. All of their current products try desperately to stand out using strange features that no one asked for and invite frequent pushback from their users: the crown-and-button input on the Apple Watch, the Touch Bar for the MacBook Pro, the notch for the iPhone X, etcetera. Samsung, conversely, has been simplifying and beautifying the products every year. What can I say? The tortoise has finally caught up to the hare.

You can design a product that is easier or harder to: sell, market, supply chain manage, profit from, recruit from, maintain, etc. For the end user it also affects a wide range of factors like: desirability, cost, durability, social acceptance, etc. Maybe the simplest way I've seen good design and its benefits explained is through Dieter Rams' Ten Principles of Good Design. Good design: Is innovative - The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.Makes a product useful - A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it.Is aesthetic - The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.Makes a product understandable - It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user's intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.Is unobtrusive - Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.Is honest - It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.Is long-lasting - It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today's throwaway society.Is thorough down to the last detail - Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.Is environmentally friendly - Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.Is as little design as possible - Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity. via Dieter Rams",2021-03-06T10:16:03.257Z,"What is the added value of product design? ",Quora

Unless your new product does something so obviously new and useful that it can convince consumers to change their existing behavior and preconceptions, in this case that iPod was the only serious game in town, you will never overtake that competitor. By the time the Zune players were mature enough to be an entirely reasonable alternative to iPods, there were iPhones instead that did everything iPods did and much more, and nobody wanted a stand-alone media device anymore. Looking at Zune purely objectively, it was actually an outstanding product with excellent design, arguably superior usability and PC companion software, and several other great points. But that wasn’t worth a hill of beans when the product category had already become obsolete.",2021-03-06T10:20:14.088Z,"Why did the Microsoft Zune fail from a product design standpoint? ",Quora

Sometimes those blunders come from the designer, but they also come from engineers or bad decisions from marketers or business leadership. I even admit, I have made these mistakes, but that’s what product development is all about. In my career, I have seen and worked with designers who believe their designs should not be compromised, irregardless of how it might impact the functionality, usability, manufacturability or cost. In my view this attitude can be as damaging as an engineer or marketer whom are not willing to consider the designers viewpoint. Designers must always be empathetic to their customers. Product Designers tend to be passionate people who care deeply about solving problems, and they really want to create great solutions to make the lives of others better. So be careful if you fault a designer for their passion, because you might be missing out on an opportunity to take a mundane product solution and make it great. The best designers know when and how to compromise with their business partners. They gain respect from working together, launching successful solutions. Designers are always juggling ambiguity. Design is not like finance. Finance deals with logical facts, while design deals with possibilities and emotion. People get uncomfortable with designers, frustrated by their desire to try something different. Let’s face it, most people in their jobs want to feel safe and minimize risk, but that is exactly why all companies should have designers. The best designers are not afraid to take risks and try something different. On the flip side, I have seen engineers, marketers etc. who are unwilling to compromise when a designer might have a good solution. Again this is a balance and the best engineers and designers respect each other and learn to appreciate what the other can bring to the table. Good, brave leadership in an organization can help a development team navigate this precarious process, take risks where appropriate, reduce odds of failure, but it is never easy. Now it’s also critical that designers attempt to understand the businesses they work in. They should have a good overview background on technologies, capabilities and processes. Having this knowledge, allows the designer to pull the appropriate levers when designing the ideal solution. Thus, the best designers, dance a delicate balance between consumer desire-ability, technical feasibility, sustainability and business viability. Having this knowledge in hand, solutions come from trial and error. Prototype, prototype, prototype. If the designer and/or the development team are not iterating solutions, working collaboratively as a team, then they risk missing the best solution. In the end, this is not a guaranteed algorithm for success. Even if the development team arrives at an outstanding solution, other variables outside the teams control could lead to failure or success. I don’t agree that product design has replaced functionality and usefulness, but I have seen many examples of bad functionality and lack of usefulness.

How do they influence a person when used together? How does a cyclist use a sleep monitoring product in tandem with Strava?Enhancing the product scope based on behavioral insightsOnce your product is able to help people achieve their desired outcome consistently and excellently, what’s next? Some organizations want to expand the scope of their product. Service design helps by providing opportunities to do that, without diluting the core product/service offering.Example - Stripe began as a payment processor. It is now a full platform/service online businesses can run off of. I don’t know if they have a service designer, but the path from a payment processor to a commerce platform falls within the capability of a service design(er) team.Providing clarity for the product (design) teamsEconomics teaches us that specialization is , but what it doesn’t tell us is that specialization also creates silos in a company. One of the biggest sell for service design is to create visibility horizontally, so everyone knows how different department works. A good customer support product, must be designed with the support agents in mind, not the “idea” of a support agent.Example - I’m going to show off. Sorry not sorry. The Bench product team builds our accounting software together with our in-house, customer-facing, accounting teams. This ensures that the features we build are valuable for our accountants as they interact with our customers. In the past, I have collaborated with the product managers to anchor the design efforts around actual sales team/accounting team behavioral patterns.Hope this helps!

Get some modeling clay, do all her lessons, it will change the way you think about 3-D. Learn the visual and written language of design. Drawing. Master drawing. Anyone can make cad models; successful sketches sell your boss, sell your peers, make your designs more original and dynamic. There is a specific style of drawing key in product design, learn this, you will have better luck communicating with your peers. This leads into: Drafting and Technical Drawing. Take those beautiful, original drawings and make them stable, make them work. Cad master? Awesome. Auto cad master. Beautiful. 3-d printing? Rad. 3-D max? Sketch up? V-ray? Studio max? Choose one that is most commonly used in your field of interest, and learn it.  While you are learning that you should pair it with: Physical making: So your drawing looks great but how does it stand up in the real world? Work in a 3-d laboratory simultaneously and begin exploring industrial products. Model making is key to product development. How else will you truly explore materials, human interaction, surface light, weight, etc unless it exists? How do the things you design actually look in the real world. A lot of the time, things that are designed in the digital space don't translate as well in the real world (read, strange unnecessary curves, pieces that look entirely too singular) Make a lot of models. Modify them slightly, make more. You will understand then how your technical drawings translate into the real world and what the limitations are when you ask other people to make your models. This part also includes finishes, welding, milling, etc.  When you're done making all your products, and you have concept boards, slideshows, drawings and your high end tea travel mug: Present them. Communication is most of product design. Why are you doing this? What's the concept? What problem are you trying to solve? A lot of projects die in the presentation stage. Learn how to speak about your pieces, learn how to present them with the proper software. Document all the stages of your work from sketches to final pieces in a lightbox with a decent camera. Assemble and post in your portfolio. Critique yourself. Ask other people to critique you. Learn to take enough criticism to make yourself the best, but keep your own style and interests alive.

At a very basic level, I'd sign up for a Wireframing site. A great one for only $10/month is Online Vector Based Mockup & Wireframing Tool · Moqups.For $10, you get access to multiple projects. You can build a basic design with functional buttons. If you're good at Photoshop or Illustrator, you can actually design on those and then upload those images to Moqups and hook them up for functionality. If not, don't worry, Moqups provides you with great tools that a 10 year old could understand. This will also help you ""develop"" the product on your own. When you visually see something, you're more likely to be critical about it. This way you can really evaluate your product and get rid of what's not necessary and add what is necessary.

CGPA: As the brochure mentions, any engineering degree is enough. (You can check this list for eligibility criteria) [2]. Course Details: Can't be exact, because the course structure isn't exact.

Empathy will create a sense of pain in you when your user hits a pain point or has to work too hard to get their goal/task/experience finished and in turn will force you to design a better experience for them.

These are simply artifacts that help you along the way of understanding what your user is doing. Once you know those things, you can reevaluate their experience and redesign it. My advice is to study people and find out what is the difference between wants and needs. An example is myself, about an hour ago, I went to the store to buy coffee beans.  Map the interaction and the goal:Lets break that down: Got in the car. Drove to the store. Got out of the car. Entered the store. Selected coffee beans. Made my purchase. Headed home. Made coffee.  Procedural Goal: Get Coffee beans (tactical) Realized goal: Feeling that I am having an exquisite cup of coffee (psychological)See my world as the user as a divide: Before coffee | Coffee. How do you get me to the goal ASAP as a designer. Design for both goals. Make the procedural goal easy to get to so that I can get to the realized goal, i.e. Perfect tasting coffee. My entire journey is about great tasting coffee because I fancy myself a coffee connoisseur. Its about ego and my perceived view of myself.

In sum: they keyword- and string-match to support few —and invisible— functions, or they let you input text verbally. They’re unreliable and hard to explore, costly to err with, excel mostly for setting timers / sending texts.If voice were to someday work well, it would be the most obviously natural interface for HCI apart from e.g. something involving the central nervous system and responsiveness to thought itself. It would be incredibly valuable for technology products and for societies.So the problem in imagining how voice interfaces will change software product is in predicting when voice interfaces will be more than what they are today and how they’ll get there. Because if voice remains as it is, I don’t think most software product designers will wind up deeply involved with it; it’s a niche, and for most applications it’s not the primary or best way for users to interact. But if we take the bull case —that voice interfaces will, via incredible long-tail string programming, or near-magical forms of ML, or even AGI become truly conversational, useful on the order of another human— it’s even harder to predict, as we cannot know what such interfaces will be like or will be based on. If, for example, AGI arrived, it’s not clear to me that designers would have much of a role, anymore than we “design” how e.g. customer service representatives, or service personnel, or lawyers interact with their clients; real AGI seems, in part, to definitionally not require design beyond the design of “policies,” which is a linguistic process (e.g. “The AGI agent shouldn’t curse at the user”).If before or instead of achieving AGI, we merely program enormous coverage of interactions —literally setting out an abundance of predicted interactions and responses— much will depend on hardware, as usual: for example, if AR is the platform, designers might be tasked with developing easy, comprehensible visual representations of interaction possibility spaces to make navigation of voice software easier. If the hardware is voice-only, designers may be charged with usability testing / evaluating e.g. failure states, areas where users struggle, etc. Designers could also help define when various interfaces “hand off” to one another, but this seems likely to indicate immature voice technology anyway.One clear point: it seems years and years away, probably too far to accurately anticipate much about what will be required for designers to contribute, or even what the split between engineering and design would be. As ever, if you’re interested in it, the best bet is likely to learn now how voice systems are designed —even “designed” by engineers, how they work fundamentally— and to experiment with e.g. making apps for Alexa or Google Home to both stay current and to potentially see meaningful ways to improve the field.",2021-03-06T11:06:07.420Z,"How will the rising popularity of voice interfaces change the nature of software product design?

(For example, a senior hire would be L4 or higher.) Leveling very generally is based on experience, scope of responsibility, and expected degree of autonomy. For every product designer, they will be evaluated across three areas – technical caliber, diversity, and values. The standards for the evaluations are set according to the intended level of the role. Technical caliber is the easiest to assess. We're looking for a portfolio of thoughtful, attractive, and useful product designs. We'd like to see finished UI work, not merely wireframes or post-its on a wall. The projects in the portfolio should generally follow the formula of: describe the problem, what you did to solve it, the outcome, and (bonus points) what you learned or what you would do differently. Technical caliber is what gets your foot in the door. Diversity – How does this person add something new and diverse to the Design team? Are they going to bring fresh perspectives, skills, and experiences? Or do we already have enough coverage for what they bring to the table? We believe we design better, more empathetic products with many, varied POVs. Values are what we spend most of our time assessing. Our design team has 8 values that we consider through our interview process: Collaboration – You value diverse experiences, personalities, and thinking. You know your own strengths and weaknesses and empathize with others. You lend a helping hand when your teammates are buried. Your positive attitude inspires fellow Earnies, and you always work for the greater good of the team and company over your own ambitions.Communication – You articulate complex ideas clearly in groups and one-on-one – both in speech and in writing. You are an active listener and anticipate questions and reservations from others in advance. You know when to give someone else the floor and when to speak up. You communicate empathetically to accommodate those with less domain expertise.Curiosity – Empathy, creativity, innovation, the ability to learn quickly — they all spring from curiosity. You ask penetrating questions that get to the heart of the matter. Your curiosity propels you on an endless quest for betterment; you continually challenge what exists and imagine how things ought to be. You’re a sponge for not only your immediate areas of responsibility, but also adjacent and unrelated disciplines. Your curiosity leads you to explore many different paths, yielding unexpected and novel solutions.Excellence – You never rest on your laurels. You push yourself, the team, and the company to be better. You have a high level of self-awareness, which translates into both humility and motivation to improve. Because you hold yourself to such a high standard, others trust you immensely.Impact – You understand the company’s goals and structure your work to achieve them. You think deeply about your role within the team and have an advanced understanding of how the work you do affects the good of the company. You organize your priorities to drive business value. You prioritize initiatives that help scale Earnest’s operations or culture and move us forward.Leadership – You take the initiative to fix unaddressed problems and move forward quickly. You don’t care about assigning blame or finding faults in others; your goal is to push the team to learn and improve. You act as a business owner and take responsibility accordingly. Your level of intrinsic motivation motivates others around you.Resilience – You are tenacious about achieving results. When faced with what seems like an impossible situation, you make it happen. When encountering setbacks, you are not dismayed and adjust your tactics to address changing contexts. You won’t let yourself be blocked because you value seeing things through and delivering results.Rigor – You are a methodical problem solver. You comprehensively synthesize input and make critical decisions quickly. Diligent about gathering context, thorough in interpreting information, and precise in implementing solutions, you engender the confidence of all stakeholders. You execute with rigor without getting bogged down in minutiae.Our on-site interviews typically assess 2-4 values in each interview. We have a rubric with Levels as the rows and Values as the columns. A L4 senior product design candidate would need to meet or exceed our values expectations for a L4. If someone checks all the boxes across technical caliber, diversity, and values then we'll gladly extend an offer to join the team!",2021-03-06T11:42:42.347Z,"What traits do you look for when evaluating a product design candidate?

Product design is about creating artistic product - taking ideas from scratch to finished solutions, most often sold as designer items in quantities of 1 or 2 pieces of finished quality. As a product designer it is not mandatory to have knowledge on manufacturing processes or producing CAD drawings. These products tend to be artistic manifestations and fit within novelty territory. Industrial design is about creating ideas for mass production, i.e, creating concepts that can be manufactured and be sold. Therefore it requires a bit more work in transferring and customising designs (product designs) to make it ready for manufacturing. You require knowledge of manufacturing processes and operations in order to do your work. Some key highlights Product design can be considered to be a subset of Industrial design.Industrial design can include - product design, furniture design, footwear, and in certain cases fashion and interior design.You can survive in product design without technical knowledge, but you definitely need to have technical/engineering knowledge to be an industrial designer. Unless you are doing early concept works.In industrial design you also learn about business aspects, in order to customise the products to match the business and market needs.In general, product design is more about creating solutions, industrial design is creating solutions and taking them to manufacturing. An industrial designer can be a product designer, but a product designer cannot be industrial designers. concept ———product———production———market product designer ——————————— industrial designer ————————————————————————— (previous answer) Product design is a subset of the industrial design. Industrial design deals with any manufacturable/produceable product, i.e. is requires industry processes and operations. It also covers the whole lifecycle - from initial research to manufacturing. These designers also work on producing manufacturing drawings and redesign for manufacturing operations. Product design deals with developing concepts from research to renderings and prototypes. It is one part of the whole lifecycle, primarily in the initial phase. These designers in principle are not involved in working with the manufacturing activities and handover the designs to them. But since there is overlap, most people and in the industry use the terms interchangeably. Further there are people from engineering side who also use similar or same terms. to summarise, industrial design is more of whole lifecycle focused on end-to-end design activities while product design is focused on conceptual designs and developments. UPDATE: a more concise answer is that: Product Design is focused on products , its design and development. It is more focused on the users, the product and the interaction between them. Product designers can be seen working with users and the product-systems Industrial Design is taking ideas from concepts to business integration. It is focused on the users, the products and the systems, the interaction and service in regard to the business value. The difference is in the business integration, which is mostly in form of CAD and manufacturing drawings, service design and system design. Industrial designers can be seem working more in relation to business operations and translation of designs into business value.",2021-03-06T11:44:14.709Z,"What are the advantages to majoring in Product Design at Stanford?

Both designers and engineers are anything but that.   So let's figure out 'what kind of engineer and what kind of designer do we need for this project to be successful' - and how much do those cost. My assumptions: We're building this for a client. We won't own the product after launch (though you might do bug fixes). So your client is primarily buying a product of you.The website is a marketing website for the apps, not a web app version of the product. Whatever the app is, it's not technically highly advanced. If it were, you'd have a web developer (cheaper because more of a 'commodity')  working on the site, and a (more expensive, because higher demand) software engineer building the actual apps.However, the (perceived) usability of the product matters - after all, you have a UX designer taking the lead on the design, not a UI or visual designer. That suggests you'll need to do problem solving and rapid prototyping  as part of the delivery. All in 2-3 months, so they really need to know what they're doing. (as an aside, I find that both commendable and pretty unusual - great choice to push the client in this direction!)Also, the real test for this product is the rating in the app store. If users feel it sucks, your client will find out quickly and through poor reviews.Since you lack a visual designer, the UX designer will also  need to do that - including for the marketing website / landing page / visual assets for the app etc.Given the project, the client probably will care 'how it looks' (because you're pretty much building everything for them - presence and applications!).If this were my project, I'd look for a relatively experienced UX designer  who additionally has a strong background in visual designa mid-level developer to build the applications (probably using web technology)The design profile is pretty unusual: folks who can both nail UX, UI, and visual design are sought after. The developer profile is relatively speaking less scarce. Still not easy to fill, but not impossible either. In the end, I'd budget about 1:1. Maybe slightly overindex on the designer (depending on how important visual design is for my client). But, given the assumptions, I can't really see a situation where I'd pay the developer more.",2021-03-06T11:44:33.224Z,"How do you value a software engineer and product designer when splitting a contract job?

Lynda (Online video tutorials & training) offers good content on product and UX design (though it's not free). For books, anything from the ""A Book Apart"" series is solid.  But to be honest, reading books and taking courses in isolation is a terrible way to learn product design. If you've got a year to work with, make something yourself!  Find an idea (if you don't have one, just steal it from somewhere -- do Uber's idea, or AirBnB, or Wikipedia, or whatever seems interesting). Decide who would want that idea. Talk to some potential users and build personas. Then sit down and figure out what features are necessary for your product (less than you think!). Mock up some screens for the major workflows of your product. If you can prototype or code, do that too. Document your process and journal every day about what you're learning. Supplement with books and courses when you need to know something that you don't already know. At the end, you'll have a solid portfolio piece, a demonstrated ability to do end-to-end product design, and proof that you're self-motivated and a hard worker.  Plus you'll learn a bunch of skills along the way (relevant skills, too, since they'll be done with your specific project in mind). If you can connect with a local meetup group or find some like-minded colleagues, all the better. Best of luck!",2021-03-06T11:45:15.906Z,"How can I learn product design as an autodidact? ",Quora

Either way, the virus has propagated its genes, which is all that matters from an evolutionary point of view. There is and was nothing wrong with the fundamentals of the testing technology and the PPE and medical equipment such as the respirators. All that is old hat. The failure was a social and political one. We were prepared for the hundred-year flood, but we were struck with the 500-year flood, to quote somebody behind a microphone. We simply didn’t have enough of this equipment in stock. For some reason(s), we wouldn’t adopt a diagnostic test developed and thoroughly tested in a foreign nation. It had to be home-grown, even if was faulty. As a result, we haven’t been able to track the infection accurately and thus are not able to quarantine victims while sending the relatively healthy on their way. Our political will was feeble, too. Our leaders weren’t pushing vigorously enough to gather the needed equipment and test reagents. Social distancing measures were initiated and enforced at the state and local levels only when it became apparent that guidance was not forthcoming from the federal, therefore nationwide, levels. The public was getting mixed signals from our experts and our political leaders. The President has the authority to manage the economy and take command in ways not legally possible in normal times. For example, there are millions of N95 masks sitting in warehouses around the country (the USA, BTW). They are owned by brokerage firms that broker sales internationally. As a result, masks that our hospitals need so desperately are out of their hands waiting to be sold to the highest bidder when, it seems to me, they could be seized by eminent domain or be kept within our borders by export bans. So far, though I haven’t read today’s news, our national leadership has not done this: I Spent A Day In The Coronavirus-Driven Feeding Frenzy Of N95 Mask Sellers And Buyers And This Is What I Learned.",2021-03-06T11:46:12.949Z,"Is the covid19 crisis a technology and product design failure?

So, studying science should strengthen your foundational skills when becoming a professional designer. That’s why science is valuable to design practice. Let me tell you why physics specifically is valuable to software product design: Physics (as opposed to biology or even chemistry) provides a framework for learning the most basic material properties of matter and energy. It’s obvious why this would be enormously valuable to designers of physical products. Software “product designers,” “UX designers,” or whatever name we give ourselves have a fundamental skills gap compared with other kinds of designers. As a cohort, most product designers do not actually have a good sense of the material properties of software (Obviously there are exceptions, but this is my assessment of the industry as a whole.) So, above and beyond the understanding of the scientific method physics or any other scientific area would contribute to a designer’s process, physics in particular offers a framework for learning the material properties of software as a medium.

However it’s quite obvious that this isn’t just the case. With limited experience and knowledge that I have on this topic I can provide basic advice. Do your research. Study other products, successful ones and unsuccessful. You need to learn why these products make it and why they do not. Gathering information and detail from simply their success is unreliable. These algorithms that are becoming a common addition to many popular social media platforms aren’t simply created and abandoned. They’re not complete AI either. Yes these feeds do adapt to each user/target, however there are specific additions and modifications that cannot be fabricated by AI. As humans it is programmed in our DNA to make mistakes and imperfections. These mistakes aren’t negative. It’s your choice to thrive off human flaws. Instead take this into consideration. Use it to increase your understanding of these algorithms and build on the knowledge you have to help foresee these feeds. Put your research into practice. Once you have gathered this research, put it into action and practice. You’ll never succeed completely on first tries. Simply designing a product that seems popular amongst society, products that are “hot” at the moment can bring success, however to really maximise your returns and profits from investing time, resources and money into these projects focus on developing/emerging technologies. Although some of these require a larger startup, they are almost always guaranteed to produce a stronger outcome. Emerging/developing-based products are harder to market with these feeds, however once you are able to work around these algorithms, the ability to market your products in a “Cold Contact” manner.

60436cdeed76476feda2acf5,https://www.quora.com/What-misconceptions-do-you-encounter-most-about-product-design?-,"Many misconceptions I consider frequent and pernicious —and which I encounter frequently among designers— fall into a single category: the confusion of where software product design is visible for what software design is truly about. That is: the mistake that product designers are, or should be, UI / IxD designers above all. Calling this a misconception, however, is a little silly of me: it’s probable that many more designers believe that than believe what I think, so if a vote is taken it may conclude that it is I who am in error. Nevertheless, I think of product design as being the function mandated to use the broadest range of liberal arts approaches and tactics to ensure that technology serves human ends well. Note that I am not talking about designers as people. Many product managers, engineers, operations personnel, and so on rely on liberal arts holism to think, evaluate ideas and processes, and produce software. What makes design as a function unique is that we are explicitly charged to do so, even when doing so means integrating into our work story thought, conjectural creativity, intuition, and reflection on presently-unmeasurable phenomena. In other words: it’s our job to represent what will otherwise be invisible. When designers talk about something like “delight,” or when they object that engagement metrics don’t capture the actual truth of a product’s quality or value, or when they assert that users should “love” or “find meaningful” a given experience, they are insisting that organizations admit that much of great human value is outside of our reductive systems of measurement and prediction;accept that in the absence straightforwardly scientific data, organizations cannot pretend their view (e.g. of values of features or qualities of experiences) is complete;consider the possibility that the liberal arts —and all that they contain, including design— may be useful for intuiting and conjecturing about human purposes, human reactions, and human meanings; andlet us try our hand at filling out systematically clear strategies with higher-risk, but very high-reward, creative bets.In the early days of a new technology paradigm, much of this work will naturally concentrate on HCI and its elements: figuring out how to make new functionality most usable, or devising new functionality and determining how to integrate it, for example. But as platforms mature, the leverage for designers shifts away from UIs —which rapidly commodify best practices such that usability is increasingly in tension with novelty— toward, again, all those things which are otherwise unrepresented: hence the rise of “UX,” a more holistic view of design than UI; and then of “product design,” a more holistic view still. The titles aren’t important, nor are the borders they imply. For different projects, designers should be ready to focus on different elements, layers, areas, and to use different tools, processes, and inspirations. At some point, it became far less important for e.g. a Facebook designer to be able to invent interface elements than for them to understand complex, multi-faction system dynamics in a space like News Feed, where the tensions that exist among individuals and groups of users make the challenges associated with new features more sociological than aesthetic. As an example, consider how Abhinav Sharma discusses the “engagement trap”; without having the capacity to understand and explain how metrics can rise while users feel worse and worse about your service, you will never prevail on others to consider the kinds of changes —the kinds of bold, intuitional bets— needed to forestall decay or competition. It’s not a matter of having good enough mocks; it’s about understanding what the organization doesn’t tend to understand, or more specifically about being mandated to represent what other roles are almost prohibited structurally from representing: opinions, theses about human behavior and ends that cannot be derived from dashboards, and so on. Many designers I meet are focused on the artifacts of process or the mastery of UI / IxD and related tooling. This is, obviously, not without value. But it’s also lower-leverage than many of them think, as they’ll discover when tasked with narrowly-imagined projects whose justifications flow from “what exists now,” or from executive fiat; told to “make this product idea beautiful,” they’ll do so, but they’ll hate it, and when the product fails, they’ll be blamed. The most important thing designers can do is understand that if they just invent UIs, they’ll almost always be working in niches or will be forced to adopt platform standards. At scale, usability is too important for products to avoid relying on those commodified platform patterns. So designers go upstream: to OS makers (or others they feel will define patterns), or to design tools (where they have leverage to help other designers). But there aren’t that many of those roles. Designers should look for organizations where the mission and the work require solving problems which are not fully reduced to systems yet, where there are still real human unknowns: work involving mind, self, love, community, morality, knowledge, quality, norms, and the like. In other words: work involving phenomena which cannot be fully turned into data, yet which are at the core of what they’ll be doing. In such spaces, the blending of liberal arts disciplines (and open-ended creativity) with technology gives design its greatest potential impact, as it can (sometimes) guess what will matter most for a new market, what will empower users and to what ends, what will be meaningful, not just measurable. What the work will be varies, but is less important. Because whether it’s UI, IxD, UX, product design, or whatever else, design’s unique role is to assert that we take seriously what most humans take seriously, whether we can log it or not, whether it seems obvious or not, whether the arguments involved can reach easy consensus or not (and honestly: especially when they cannot).
