Effective brand management enables the price of products to go up and builds loyal customers through positive brand associations and images or a strong awareness of the brand. Developing a strategic plan to maintain brand equity or gain brand value requires a comprehensive understanding of the brand, its target market, and the company’s overall vision. How Brand Management Works Brands have a powerful influence on customer engagement, competition in the markets, and the management of a company. A strong brand presence in the market differentiates a company’s products from its competitors and creates brand affinity for a company’s products or services. A brand that has been established has to continually maintain its brand image through brand management. Effective brand management increases brand awareness, measures and manages brand equity, drives initiatives that support a consistent brand message, identifies and accommodates new brand products, effectively positions the brand in the market, etc.  Brand Management and Your Target Market Developing a strategic plan to manage your brand equity requires a clear and comprehensive understanding of three things: the brand itself, its target market, and your company’s overall vision and goals. A good relationship with your target market is a must for brand management. If you have bad branding, it will be reflected in weak sales, poor client retention, and sluggish growth. To be effective, brand management must fully look after your brand, using marketing techniques in a way that ensure the entire brand is highlighted, taken care of, and promoted. Ultimately, it’s about making a commitment to your customers and then delivering on that promise. Identify the critical information needed to develop a product and brand strategy that generates both quick-wins and long-term value. Your unique selling proposition (USP) sets you apart from competitors. To create your unique selling proposition, you must understand where your product and company fit into the market. What makes the product different from its competition? Is it more durable or cost-effective? Why is Strategic Brand Management important? And how is your company different? Brand management is vital to the success of every organisation, and smart companies know that strong brands are not built by marketing alone, but require every employee to play a role. While each brand management strategy is different in terms of resources and execution, the goal is the same: to build a brand that is distinct and profitable.

Given my experience, summarizing the various parts of the role: 1. Brand Communication - There’s a lot of communication that happens both pre and during the campaigns. For that there’s lot of research done with the research agencies, both online and offline. These data points give you essential information about things such as users’ current preferences, the issues that you need to address, etc. Following this you need to prepare a communication brief and then get in touch with the creative agencies who will be your active partners in making both tactical and strategic communication. As a brand manager you’re not responsible for coming up with the creative ideas but the strategy and then work with the creative agency in order to deliver an effective communication. 2. Day-to-day Management - depending on the size of your brand, you need to launch communication or campaigns from time to time but not all the time. The bulk of your role is about ensuring the brand health is good and all key metrics are in an upward trend. E.g. after launching a campaign across various consumer channels you need to measure the brand metrics to get a clear picture of what worked, what did not and come up with a meaningful solution for the same. Everyday a brand manager is exposed to multiple data points - market share data, sales data, penetration data, consumption data, etc. Brand managers need to make sense of these data points and use the same for delivering better product and consumer benefits. 3. Brand Innovation - A large part of your future revenues do not come from your existing products and thus, there is a continuous need for innovation and upgradation of the product. This again is something actively done by the brand managers by looking at the various research and brand metric information.If you’re working in a consumer goods firm as a brand manager this is the very important aspect of your job role. 4. Business Management.- The final aspect of a brand manager’s role is to manage the business. There are a lot of things that you need to do in order to deliver business to the brand as per the monthly and yearly financial objectives. You need to make annual plans and lead the entire thing on your own. If your annual plans do not deliver the expected and estimated financial numbers then you’re solely responsible for that. You need to work closely with the sales team to ensure that the numbers are being taken care of and also with financial analysts as you’re responsible for the brand's P&L. These are different roles which help you get exposed to different things. But to become very good at brand management, you need to ensure that you get exposure to diverse roles to cover all of these things with time. Having said that, a tip which I got from my seniors and I have given to a lot of my juniors as well is that to become good at brand management, you need to be “Doing” brand management. Talk to colleagues and friends on various brands and their advertisements. Talk to industry experts on their experiences and how they have gotten good at their craft. Work on problems which are challenging - from a new market to a developed market. Get feedback on your work from expert practitioners. Having worked as a brand manager myself, I was lucky to get exposed to most things at a very young age on Brand MAGGI, and am now working in an organization called Kraftshala which helps candidates get exposed to all of the above. We are an online learning platform specialized in sales and marketing and having trained students from the top 50 b-schools, we have created a program for working professionals called Professional Brand Management in the Digital Age. The program encompasses all the above aspects and much more and we have a fantastic batch of people joining us every quarter who not only learn from us but also teach us so many things. We also host weekly sessions on marketing under the brand name Kraftshala LIVE and you can register and attend those sessions for free.

Its our responsibility to ensure that decisions spoke out from the brand teams and out to our colleagues in supply chain, sales, R&D, etc.Strategy Consulting - That sounds a bit weird, but we have been empowered to engage in strategic consulting on both tactical marketing plan executions and the cross-functional macro level marketing plan strategy goals.  These ultimately roll up to a director/VP level for integration across new product marketing and our other brand teams that serves as a 30,000 foot view for our CEO and Board of Directors.There's more to this list, but I think this is enough to paint a picture of what brand managers do, at least at my company.  And I would argue that many blue chip CPG food companies look to their brand managers for many of the same.  The job is a blast...one of the best jobs in marketing (that's what I think), but its not a cushy job where you only work 40 hours a week.  Being successful requires putting in work.

Therefore, managing brands in Unilever could be both very challenging, demanding, but also fulfilling at the same time. I have been managing Sunsilk for almost a year now. The business goal of a Brand Manager itself is to increase market share and be a market leader. However, my day-to-day activities include developing strategic actions for the brand, working with creative and digital agencies to execute activations, working on business cases before launching a new product/variant, etc. A brand manager in Unilever needs to know every single thing about the brand and products from A to Z, since it is still a raw concept, to be a finished good on shelf or completed activation. I have to be the know-it-all, may it be about Sunsilk's followers on Twitter, to about how much should we invest in buying a new spare part in the factory to produce different shape of shampoo bottles.  What I like the most is the fact that Unilever brands have great philosophies behind them. In Sunsilk, it really is about being on our girls' (consumers') side when they are writing their on stories. Sunsilk wants our girls to be able to work on their ways to reach their dreams (without having to worry about their hair, because Sunsilk takes care of their hair). This philosophy is very suitable with my passion - about reaching dreams, about writing our own stories (as I am a writer myself). The beautiful philosophies of these brands are something that keeps me working in the company everyday.  What I like the least, however, is how everything needs to be done so quickly - sometimes you don't really have much time to work on it. Big brands like Sunsilk would have so many projects going on at the same time, and there are only 3 people in our team (Senior Brand Manager, Assistant Brand Manager - which is me, and Brand Administrator). Sometimes the deadlines and pressure could be overwhelming, but I think this might also happen in other roles and other companies.  What I like the most about the company is how it is trying its best to work on initiatives to make the world more sustainable, by using less and less resources, while still being able to deliver exponential growth. Its CEO is a big supporter of Sustainability, and I'm happy to see this spirit is being cascaded through all parts of the organisation. I like the fact that by working in the company, I get to be involved in so many people's lives, given its scale... as Unilever products would probably be existent in every home.",2021-03-04T19:55:02.353Z,"What is it like to be a Brand Manager at Unilever?

However, I still want to include the brand management definition in this article so we are all on the same page. Sound good? (Feel free to skip ahead to the other good parts).

It is also the perception your company creates to the market and the relationship between the audience and consumer. Brand management is a vital piece of marketing, which utilizes various techniques and marketing copy to boost the value of the company. Yet, what brand management really comes down to is trust. Without developing a consistent brand experience that also delivers on those promises of what your product or services do, you lose potential buyers from choosing your company in their final buying stage.

I believe this is because of the nature of the job. As a brander, you are working with finance, trade, sales, market research, creatives, manufacturing plants and what not. But interesting part is that, you do not have formal control over the people in the other divisions ( although the ultimate responsibility of the P&L depends on you). As a result one is successful only when one is successful in getting all those various divisions work for her.  Also successful marketers are tough. They are not satisfied with any work that is even a bit short of perfect. Because I do not think in any other job, where you need to be so careful about every word, font, color etc. For example, a simple change in the curvature of a font can make your label less spot-able in supermarket shelf.

Modern globalized, technology driven world has thrown new challenges to branding. Customers/consumers have more access to information than ever before. Internet has become a strong tool through which product information proliferate raising expectation bar for companies. Companies have responded to this challenge by improvising in the way they run their marketing campaigns, by exploring new avenues to showcase their products. Like for example; sponsorship of events and teams or association with social cause. In a given market innumerable products and services are offered by different companies. The identity developed for this product and services over a period of time, through marketing strategies, sturdy performance etc is referred to as brand. A stage is reached where brand become synonymous with product e.g. - coffee-Starbucks, donut-Dunkin Donuts, online retail-Ebay etc. This process is called strategic brand management.

60413c5322d1c358659e676a,https://www.quora.com/Is-luxury-brand-management-no-different-from-brand-management?-,"Traditional brand management indeed is quite different from luxury brand management. You can not apply the same principles to Hermes what you would use on any ordinary shopping-mall brand. One should distinguish between luxury and premium too. For example — Mercedes is not luxury, it’s premium. And luxury is different from premium. Premium is always justified. For premium you pay more because it uses better ingredients or has more functions. It has gold, oak and leather. Premium price is always justified by reason. But you never justify luxury. Patek Philippe never argues why their watches cost 100.000 euros a piece. And they never play discount games too. And they never try to be below their competitors price. Instead they even rise their prices from year to year Luxury is sacred — and the higher the price the more sacred it is! How much does a Ferrari cost? — A lot! You don’t even specify the price because if you have to be specific about the price you can not afford it. That is what luxury truly is. You can think of ancient kings and pharaohs — they’re all in gold and that is luxury. It’s breathtakingly expensive. It’s splendid. And it’s the price that makes something splendid not the other way round. Luxury used to be prerogative of aristocracy and they had to upkeep their lavish lifestyle just because their position demanded it. Unfortunately it was so expensive that they occasionally went broke. Today they are replaced by court of celebrities and like. Luxury stratifies the society — it’s about social elevation. Then on the other hand luxury should never dump the mass market as well because there is simply not enough very rich people. Luxury is aspirational because it is the ordinary of the extraordinary people. You want to belong to the club? Here’s your ticket. Luxury is a reward people give themselves for getting rich and having the money. Luxury is not about competition. BMW may compete with Audi, but Aston Martin never competes with anyone because it’s not about reason. It’s about faith. You believe in it. That is luxury. It’s incomparable. It’s priceless. In a sense luxury is totally useless, it’s far beyond function and needs, it’s needlessly expensive, and in Luxury business demand should always be above supply. You never sell luxury in department stores. You should control the complete buying and interaction experience with the brand. Product should be excellent and made with attention and passion to smallest details. Each client should feel really important and therefore one-to-one relationship is encouraged. Luxury should never reduce costs. Instead it should increase prices. How can you be the dream for the rich if you price reduces? Advertising of luxury brands is not about sales — it’s about building a dream. Advertising for luxury is not expected to deliver immediate results. It’s aspirational. There are few things that are really important for luxury brands — they should encourage access to higher reality. Heritage, myth, history and legend are particularly important. Luxury should encourage timelessness as well. We all are going to die but luxury will endure — that is important because people are afraid of death and luxury gives a relief in a sense. Icons and symbols are important too. And luxury brands always are a little bit mysterious too. They celebrate and are traditions and rituals based. Their shops are the holy temples where luxury is worshipped. One very significant aspect is that luxury brands are about art but not contemporary. Fashion is contemporary but fashion has cycles and luxury instead does not. That is why luxury tries to be ahead of time. So that you can have today what others will have tomorrow. And luxury products are not created by designers, they are created by artists — that is how they’re positioned. And of course luxury is about limited access — by that meaning not only special invitations but limited amounts of production as well. If something starts selling well they may even discontinue it. Because you do not want Chinese copies of LV bags to be sold on every corner. Then it is not luxury any more. The very reason luxury exists is that you do not feed lions with the same food buffalo eats. And yes, luxury is eternal. Just see this ad from “la prairie” — and they sell creams at 200–300 euros a piece.",2021-03-04T20:00:19.889Z,"Is luxury brand management no different from brand management? ",Quora

But the good news is that if you end up choosing one course that is able to add required value to your marketing career, it is more than enough. Hence, if you know how to choose, you will know what to choose. If you surf online you will find a few certification courses that you can easily trust as they are affiliated to renowned universities. However, the university content is not always industry driven and that is the reason students from those universities find a huge skill set gap when they get hired for the jobs and start working on actual real time business problems. To upskill in Brand Management you need to do a certification which makes you practice the nuances of the entire brand building process on real brands. To find a certification that you can trust you will have to look at following factors. 1. Content and curriculum - A certification should provide you a lot more than just a few video modules and theoretical terms. The content provided should be industry driven and teach how they apply to different marketing problems. The approach of the content should be practitioner driven and not theoretical. Other than the content you must be provided with live/group projects, timely feedbacks on the same, doubt clearing sessions, reading resources, student support, etc. 2) Real experience in brand building - Brand management cannot be done through solving some equations on paper or watching related content videos. You can take guitar lessons online but to swim you will need to dive in to depths of water under continuous supervision of an expert. To be a real brand builder you need to go for a certification that understands this and makes you work on real brands so that you not only understand but also experience the brand building process with implementation of digital tools from scratch to hatch. 3) A-grade mentorship - No matter how good the quality of content is if there is no expert practitioner working parallel to provide you with detailed feedback on your project work and doubt resolution, you cannot improvise your skills to the maximum extent. Never go for certifications that cannot promise you a real person as your mentor and guide throughout the learning process. One doubt unattended takes you two steps back. If you get stuck or confused at any point of time you should have someone to help you clear the clutter and take you forward. 4) Career Support - A certification that prepares you for the job should also prepare you for the interviews. Only the most trusted ones are willing to do so. If a certificate provider covers you from all the four corners, from making you through with fundamentals of a good CV to taking your mock interview sessions to even recommending you to their network, then you can be assured of the quality that they are willing to bring in your professional life. As I mentioned above not many certificate providers have these features and it only makes your work easy. One that has and I have been following closely, is Kraftshala. You can check their website to find that a lot of working professionals and business school folks trust Kraftshala. A big chunk of their alumni comprises of students from tier one business schools who anyway do not usually have a lot of time to invest in other courses while doing their masters but they still make time for Kraftshala certificate courses. That, in itself is evident enough of their credibility. Their Professional Brand Management program is highly appreciated among working professionals and has added value to many young marketers. The key features of Kraftshala Brand Management program are - * Real time experience in brand management by working on real brands * Personalized coaching on projects from highly experienced brand managers *A powerful growth network comprised of young marketers and industry experts *INDUSTRYCreds certification score to highlight your marketing potential to recruiters *Targeted pushing of your candidature basis your profile and performance.

This includes your business name, logo, corporate gifts, design features and images, as well as other items that refer to your company's products. Importance of Brand Management Brand management aims to continually develop a positive perception among your target audience about your company. Every aspect of your content and marketing strategy needs to be aligned with your brand and what it has to offer. A brand is not established instantly, but requires time, patience, and repair efforts. It also requires a budget to optimize brand awareness efforts in digital marketing strategies. Online marketing strategies will almost always require some type of monetary expense, but this can be customized to suit each budget. Make managing your brand a priority, as it is important for a number of reasons. Reasons for prioritizing your Brand Customers tend to stick with a brand they know and trust. By consistently managing your brand, you convey the message that you are committed to providing a solution to the needs of your target audience and that you care about doing so with integrity and efficiency. Brand management provides the company with the opportunity to affirm its human touch and show its target audience that they care about their personal needs. Producing an emotional connection with your audience is considered the jackpot of the brand, as it generates repeat sales and a positive overview of your brand. It protects your brand’s reputation Rumors and scams are everywhere, and companies are often the victims of these types of illegal activities. Having a strong brand will protect you from controversy on all matters where you don't need to get involved in public relations. Examples include bogus chain messages; even the largest gangs have been the victims of malicious rumors intended to damage a brand. Fortunately, the stronger the brand, the more credibility the company gives to the general public, who seem to ignore these false accusations. It increases brand equity This is a big one. Brand equity is the value that your brand adds to your product and how the price compares to that of a generic counterpart. Of course, this is also backed by the quality and reliability of the product, but coupled with a polished brand, the margin can be considerable. Positive brand equity causes customers to voluntarily pay more for the same product with your brand because they trust and know your brand. Control the company’s recognition Want to move your small business into the medium-sized business category? Start managing your brand like it's bigger than it really is. By managing your brand, you can promote your brand and have at least some control of your position in the market. Do you want to be the next Apple? Start presenting your brand as if your company already is. Brand management is essential to differentiate a company from many of its competitors. It gives management some control over brand perception, but it also presents opportunities to take the company to the next level. If managed properly, a brand should be a company's greatest asset.

Kraftshala goes deep into basics of Brand management - 99% of the module is practical knowledge from marketers in FMCG/ E-commerce space.A large part of marketing is peer learning/ observation (since there are no right answers in marketing). The course is structured in a fashion that promotes this sentiment (group assignments + feedbacks from industry professionals). The discussions/ feedbacks I have had have always been enriching. Instructors are very very generous and willing to go the extra mile just to ensure you learn concepts correctly.I have always found myself irregular when it comes to online learning. With Kraftshala, I was (somehow magically) on my toes and at pace with the rest of the batch. I am not sure why, but I feel Kraftshala’s regular followups, reminders, guest sessions and project group had some part to play for good.I met my tribe at Kraftshala. With instructors and students from different industries and organisations coming together to create great marketing, it feels like home. It gives you a safe zone to discuss your ideas (on a live project), and learn + network/ connect with industry professionals.With that being said, DO NOT enrol for the course thinking: It will compensate for an MBA degree.But it gives you an edge and a more in-depth knowledge about brand management. You go in an interview with a lot more hands on experience. (Opportunity cost of 2 years residential MBA vs 7-8 months of online learning)It will guarantee you a marketing role.A lot of my batch-mates made it into core marketing roles through Kraftshala, but it was a lot of sweat blood that went in behind that. The Kraftshala team does more than anyone I know in preparing you for marketing roles - Arranging referrals, Helping with CV, Mock interviews etc. It will equip you will the ammo you need before firing. But please do not enrol with an assumption that the course will magically help you transition into a marketing profile right after you graduate.

Are you a college graduate , an MBA or a working professional? Since I don’t have an answer to that question I will like to address you as all of the above, one at a time. Case 1 : College graduate : The first step would be to build relevant skills if you want to become a brand manager. Skills which are most relevant for a brand manager role are – User centricity, Data driven problem solving and persuasion (both written and verbal). To build these, the best way is to work on problems which lets you learn these skills. You can do this by taking up an internship, a part-time project, or a job. However, do make sure that you are getting feedback on your work from an expert, someone who has done it themselves, made errors and perfected their approach over the years. It was assumed that brand management is only possible after you do an MBA. That reality is slowly but certainly changing and to be at the forefront of this change, you can work on real marketing problems (including digital) to showcase your potential, intent and experience to a recruiter. There are online programs which have changed this landscape and are even helping the smartest students land great marketing roles. Kraftshala is one such institution that I know of and have heard great reviews from folks who have taken up their programs. Case 2 :If you’re an MBA -The main problem is that there are very few marketing roles which come on campus and too many people who are interested in those. If you are also in that situation where you don’t see yourself getting a marketing role from campus placements, there are 2 routes – you do sales and then switch into marketing; or you find other ways (such as off-campus roles, referrals etc) of getting into marketing roles. But for either of the 2 approaches you need to differentiate yourself by building skills which set you up for a marketing career. Expose yourself to how marketing happens in the real world, get some real experience and talk to some real experts! Case competitions, part-time projects or online programs which offer great practical learning will be great ways to do that. Some of these programs also help their top performing students getting marketing roles directly after completion. Case 3 : If you’re a working professional - The problem here is that without any prior marketing experience, you do not get interviews. And without interviews, you do not get experience. So to break this unending loop, the only effective way is for someone to take a bet on you. And that can either happen through a company who does not believe in this which maybe startups, a strong referral or through an organization whose incentives are aligned to yours. Kraftshala with its Professional Brand Management program is addressing this need itself. They believe that marketing is skill dependent and not so much experience dependent. They have a brilliant hands-on curriculum where they train students on things exactly how they are done in the industry. They have a bunch of senior industry’s professionals who have created content as well as give feedback to students. Students themselves are trained by working on an actual brand and delivering business on that brand. And the INDUSTRYcreds certificate given by the end of the course will be a clear indicator of your marketing potentials. They select a small batch of students and I have seen a friend grow so much in the time that she was with them. All in all, look at building your skills, find a network which can help you and practice as much as possible under experts who can guide you along the way. I hope that was helpful enough and wish you the best! Your question does lack some specific or rather relevant information that could have helped a lot while framing an answer.

Others who have started are the Pearl Academy, New Delhi; FAD institute, Pune ; & very recently SP Jain, Mumbai. Suggest you to explore all and take a informed decision. You may see many similar questions answered by me on these topics on Quora to develop a general sense of direction and deeper insights.

Existing managers need to enhance their skills and knowledge frequently in between whilst the not yet employed need to understand their career motivation and ensure special skills are picked up through formal or informal education. What a formal education process do is to structure the learning, thoughts, past experiences through case studies, interactions with industry practitioners as well as strategy advisors etc. This structured education can fast accelerate not only the learning process but also the career progression.

English may not be your first language but if the brand position you want is in English, you would need to tighten that up asap. A brand person is often the face of the brand not to the consumer, but to the trade. You will find yourself presenting your ideas directly to management, other teams as well as people such as buyers or other companies (if you are in CPG or something similar). You are also the one developing the messaging that the end consumer will see so your ability to communicate clearly (and more succinctly than I am doing now) the product you are trying to sell is key.

One of the things I see constantly is that this position is only given to someone who a) has the requisite experience in marketing, branding, (sometimes social media) and b) someone who understands their particular brand.   In terms of education to get most corporate and management jobs in fashion, you need a bachelors degree. While fashion and retail have a history of people working their way up via retail roles, that is a much longer job trajectory and even with people who have retail work, they are usually getting a college degree alongside them due to high competition in the industry.  You also don't need a master's degree to work as a brand manager. While the theory will be helpful, the thing to remember is that it won't help you in terms of promotion as the industry is still very experience driven, so these degrees often don't allow you to skip steps (so if you're looking for entry level work, don't think that the higher degree will allow you to skip that step, especially for brand managers (and anyone working on branding) where the company will want you to understand all functions of the brand. I recommend only going back for your degree after you've worked for a few years to get the best possible experience from a higher education degree. Or if you already have a bachelors degree but haven't worked in fashion, find one of the programs (like LIM College's MPS program or Parsons AAS program) where you can do internships and get real hands on experience while switching careers.  Lastly, any fashion school you'll attend will have a focus on experiential education-internships and I can not stress how important that will be for you. Do as many as you possibly can, and perhaps try to work with a few different brands (so you can see how different companies approach this and ideally I would also recommend you work with a PR or Branding agency so you can see that perspective as well.) Coursework often does reflect what you see in the industry---but not the fast pace and pressure of working in real time on branding for a fashion brand. That can only be learned on-site and internships are the norm for all branding, marketing and PR roles within fashion. It's not that you can't get a job without them, it's just a lot harder because you're competing with students who are interning.

Brand marketing is usually done by very large companies such as Coke etc. Direct marketing is more oriented around selling a product or service now. If your business is very small you need to sell your products/services now, not tomorrow. So If you want to hire someone hire a manager who is expert at direct marketing. The biggest problem in hiring is that sales/marketing people generally grossly overstate their abilities to sell. Sorry to generalize, but salespeople often have this belief that sales are generated through force of character, charisma, ability to talk etc, rather than through hard work and ability to empathize with the customer. If you are selling to middle aged women, hire a hard working middle aged woman. etc. In the past I have hired commission based agents. I.e. the agent earns 15 to 18% of the order total. The problem with that is that the agent will only work at selling the easy to sell brands and if your brand is hard to sell it wont get promoted.

The case spawned the book Business Decision-Making with 1-2-3 (as in Lotus 1-2-3). Kajal says that all shampoos are exactly the same. But, of course, branding makes them all different.

Opportunities available are very limited and all the positions you can apply for is in retail and not well paid. Biggest reason is because India is not a luxury market. ( I added this example of india because more indians are asking about this! But this stands true for all the cities that are not the luxury markets ) If you wish to pursue MBA in luxury brand management, the best cities to look for are Paris, Milan, London, New york, Tokyo. These are one of the biggest fashion capitals in the world. All the big luxury brands have head offices in these cities. You will have great exposure in the luxury industry and will help building up your resume. Another important aspect for consideration is if you want to pursue the masters from B-schools or Fashion Schools. If your inclination is more towards Fashion/cosmetics then Fashion schools are the best choice, as they focus more on the brands and their functioning. B-schools will focus only on the skill sets like marketing, business planning etc taking brands as just an examples. Also, i want to add this information; “Luxury” is not a specific term, in fact it is an umbrella term. It is not just ONE industry!! It has several industries defined under it. So if you plan to pursue mba in lbm, you will learn about the follwing industries. Fashion Industry - LVMH Kering groupAutomobile Industry - Ferrari, Austin Martin etcWine & Spirits - Moet Hennesy, ChandonCosmetics - Estee Lauder, cliniqueLeather Goods - Hermes, BerluttiTourism & Hospitality Industry - Hilton etcWatches Industry - Audemars piguet, Richemont groupFurthermore, the scope after graduating depends upon your area of interest. There are numerous opportunities in retail & corporate sectors. In retail, you have merchandiser, commercial assistant, buyer, store manager, store assistant etc. In corporate, you have marketing digital & social media, PR & communications, content manager/assistant just to name the few. My personal advice to you will be, choose if this is what you want to do, and not because it is fancy and more people are opting for it. It requires dedication & passion to pursue your dreams. I wish you all the best . :) PS: I just finished my mba in luxury brand management from International Fashion Academy, Paris.

604142e322d1c358659e69fa,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-a-brand-management-and-digital-marketing?-,"I suggest developing a strategy first rather than trying different methods without a goal in mind. The following five steps will help you create a digital marketing strategy, track your progress, and stay focused on the relevant channels and tools. 1. Describe Your Target Audience There are too many social networks, online communities, social mobile apps, and chat rooms to be integrated into. It is almost impossible to be everywhere. The more online channels a business uses to promote its products/services or to communicate with potential customers, the more time and money this business needs to invest. Therefore, knowing where current and potential clients are is critical for effective execution and sound results. Describe a target audience for your business. It is crucial to collect as much information as you can: who will be interested in your product/service: What are they interested in?Where do they spend their time?What books do they read?What shows do they watch?Most companies have diverse clientele that can’t be relegated to a single group. In such case, the business needs to divide all customers into several groups with similar characteristics. For example, a social media consultant can target: Young 25-35 year old entrepreneurs who have limited resources but would like social media to be part of their marketing effortsMid-sized companies that are established on the market and have a substantial marketing budget and brand assetsLarge companies that from time to time invite speakers to educate their managers.A survey among your current customers can help to identify main target audience groups. If the business is new, then a manager has to delineate characteristics of potential clients. The bottom line is that different people use different platforms. Knowing who your target audience is will help to decide which online channels the business has to use. 2. Define Your Goals and Objectives No one starts the trip without knowing where he or she will go. So why then are so many companies doing random activities online without looking at the big picture first? One of the biggest mistakes in digital marketing is starting to promote the brand without considering what the business wants to achieve. A goal is a finishing line and an ultimate target the business wants to hit. By way of example, a restaurant can define its digital marketing goal as, “to attract more customers by building awareness among potential clients in the area.” Objectives are measurable steps that the business needs to take in order to achieve the defined goal. Sticking to the restaurant example–objectives can be described as, “launching an Instagram account where the restaurant will share pictures of the food and recipes and gaining 1,000 followers in the first three months.” Online strategies and activities, as well as channels that the business will choose, will largely depend on the business goals and objectives. Also, it is easier to evaluate the necessity of every activity by thinking how it can or cannot contribute to the overall business direction. Measuring success is more convenient against the business goals, too. 3. Determine Appropriate Channels Once you know where you are going, it is time to evaluate roads you can take to get there. Compare the target audiences that you described in the first stage with demographics of social media platforms. Many websites post research on demographics of the most popular social media platforms (Pew Research Center and HootSuite are just two examples where you can find this type of information). Choose several platforms that have users who are similar to your audience and then create accounts for your business on those platforms. Make sure to do research on content types that are popular on each platform. Start collecting email addresses of your customers and send them updates and useful information about the business on your social media profiles and in your newsletter. 4. Designate Measurable Performance Indicators If a business doesn’t have a record of previous digital marketing campaigns, it is not easy to define how many “likes,” “hits,” or “shares” are good. Almost every platform provides free analytics to its business users. Make sure to start collecting data from each platform early on, so you can measure growth after several months. Think of ways to measure results before launching each campaign. For example, offer discount coupons with unique code for different platforms to track how many customers came from each channel. Many companies now offer inexpensive social media automation tools that help you schedule and analyze online posts and campaigns. Buffer and Commun.it are just a few of such tools that can save tons of time and effort. 5. Develop a Plan Do not share content randomly and occasionally. With thousands of business accounts of all types in each area, it is important to be consistent to have your brand’s message heard. Plan your brand communication at least a month ahead for your newsletter and a week ahead for social media. A simple communication calendar in an Excel file can save time and help to focus. Make sure that all channels are integrated into the firm’s overall digital strategy–connect a website with social media, reuse newsletter articles in social media, and invite your newsletter readers to share their news and updates with you on social media.

The good thing is acquiring such SKUs(skills, knowledge, attitude) is no longer hard nowadays. You can easily follow part-time programmes, sometimes online courses. Later you can upgrade yourself with diplomas or post-graduate degrees in required specializations. To be a brand manager you can select and follow a marketing/ brand management or related programme. To be a brand manager you don't have to follow a creative programme. But necessarily you have to learn the business fundamentals, consumer behaviour, project management, and some level of analytics. Basically, you have to master both the consumer side and market competition. To be a graphic designer clearly you can follow a graphic design programme.

I worked with different brands as a consultant, and I basically did the same job as some brand managers. But I never officially held the title of a brand manager. With that out of the way, let’s dive deep into what it takes to be a GOOD brand manager. Being a brand manager is one of the rare jobs in the modern world where it’s better to be a generalist than a specialist. You need to have a solid understanding of many different fields - from marketing, advertising to design, UX, and communication. You need to at least understand what the specialists in these fields are talking about. It’s very important that you know how to navigate strategy and creativity. This is very hard, and many people have problems with this. Creativity and strategy are diametrally different. It takes a very special person to be able to do a bit of both. The ability to be strategic and creative is what will elevate you above the pack. How do we learn this? By trying. I wish I had a better answer, but I truly believe that experience is what molds brand managers to become really good at their jobs. There’s one more thing I’d like to add. You MUST, and I can’t emphasize this enough - you absolutely MUST be a great communicator. From public speaking to organizing internal teams. Most problems in the branding world can be solved with good communication. What did we learn? That not everyone is fit to be a brand manager. And that’s fine. We need both generalists and specialists in order to move our brands.",2021-03-04T20:31:00.864Z,"What it takes to be a brand manager? ",Quora

How Brand Management Works Brands have a powerful influence on customer engagement, competition in the markets, and the management of a company. A strong brand presence in the market differentiates a company’s products from its competitors and creates brand affinity for a company’s products or services. A brand that has been established has to continually maintain its brand image through brand management. Effective brand management increases brand awareness, measures and manages brand equity, drives initiatives that support a consistent brand message, identifies and accommodates new brand products, effectively positions the brand in the market, etc.  Brand Management and Your Target Market Developing a strategic plan to manage your brand equity requires a clear and comprehensive understanding of three things: the brand itself, its target market, and your company’s overall vision and goals. A good relationship with your target market is a must for brand management. If you have bad branding, it will be reflected in weak sales, poor client retention, and sluggish growth. To be effective, brand management must fully look after your brand, using marketing techniques in a way that ensure the entire brand is highlighted, taken care of, and promoted. Ultimately, it’s about making a commitment to your customers and then delivering on that promise. Identify the critical information needed to develop a product and brand strategy that generates both quick-wins and long-term value. Your unique selling proposition (USP) sets you apart from competitors. To create your unique selling proposition, you must understand where your product and company fit into the market. What makes the product different from its competition? Is it more durable or cost-effective? Why is Strategic Brand Management important? And how is your company different? Brand management is vital to the success of every organisation, and smart companies know that strong brands are not built by marketing alone, but require every employee to play a role. While each brand management strategy is different in terms of resources and execution, the goal is the same: to build a brand that is distinct and profitable.

Once a brand is in the open, customers form impressions of that brand. Unfortunately, they don’t experience that brand in a vacuum - culture and society add into the mix of how people perceive it. Do you remember the Dell Dude? As part an effort to make the Dell brand appear younger, the brand decided to bring in Ben Curtis, a young man, to appear in their ads as a sort of spokesperson. However, when Curtis was arrested for buying weed, this had an impact on the purpose of the campaign. So while the Creative Director might develop the idea to bring in a youthful spokesperson to make the Dell brand more appealing to younger buyers - Curtis’ run in with the law also had an impact on the perception of the brand. It falls on the Brand Manager to deal with that - perhaps leaning back on the Creative Director to find a solution, or the manager may lean on other options like Public Relations. To recap - the brand manager manages the brands investment. Ideally, investment in branding leads to a more sellable product. They do this by leveraging creative services to communicate the right message, to analyzing how customers perceive the brand in the market, and even to coordinating damage control. All of this goes back to ensuring that the brand continues to lift the perceived value of the associated product.

Throwing yourself into the throes of research and getting mentors. Some hours to intern is a MUST in my book and make sure it’s with a company that has internship programs that allow you to be more than the coffee person: a true lux agency treats an intern as they treat an art director - you sit in on all the meetings and can learn by osmosis. do you have any mgmt experience? This could change things. As project mgmt and forecast/ROI experience is similar accords fields the problem is the stigma in fashion - esp in lux. So you’d probably need some good letters etc to get you in, should you have exp than I’d ask what mgmt skills and accolates do you have in general atm? Why do you want to work in lux fashion?

If this is a possibility in your current work, then great for you! If not, you will need to try one of two paths: Move to a sales-oriented company that value sales experience so much, they are willing to hire someone without product management experience into a PM role. Some examples include sales tech companies (CRMs) or a product company where sales is the core competitive function (B2B tech).Move to a company where sales people work closely with, and commonly matriculate into becoming a product manager. Look to see if any of the existing PMs at the company have sales background.Lastly, leverage one of the most valuable function of your job as a sales person: your constant interactions with your users. Most sales people will try to sell a product to their clients, and if they fail, go back to the PMs with everything the client complained about and ask the PM to build it. The best sales people, however, are the ones that will see past the client’s complaints, internalize the underlying reasons why they lost the deal, and provide PMs with user data rather than a list of feature suggestions.

Also, I did my own research recently and came to know that their faculty consist of mostly doctorates from top international universities. This is very unique. I haven't seen a B-school with so many doctorates as a professor. And the fun part - as a student of Luxury Management at SP Jain Global, you get to spend one semester in Milan, Italy as a part of your the course. This is really thoughtful of the institute because there are so many things you will learn by being in a city which is now home to top international lifestyle and luxury brands.",2021-03-04T21:00:07.967Z,"Is the master’s in global luxury brand management from SP Jain good?

60414aa522d1c358659e6cf2,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-effective-brand-management-solutions?-,"Common Strategic Brand Management Steps When it comes to your company’s brand, it will take time to ensure a specific strategy is setup for success and growth. That’s where strategic brand management becomes necessary and important for your team to work on. Without it, your company brand can get messy and be inconsistent. Here are four steps that are most important in strategic brand management and will help your company build a brand in the long-term. Brand Positioning – Clearly defining what the brand represents, what your company wants to achieve, and how it should be positioned with respect to competitors. This might be the hardest step as it determines which direction the entire brand should go. This is where research into your industry and differentiators will help shape brand position.Brand Marketing – This is where your overall marketing and teams of marketers become important. Items included in this section are the overall marketing initiatives, programs, etc. needed to get the brand messaging and company visible to the masses. Again, research and creativity are necessary to make sure your company sees results.Brand Measurement – Once you start marketing the brand, it’s important that your teams are measuring results and monitoring brand performance. This analysis can ensure your progress, pivot where need, compare position with competitors, see how audiences view the brand, etc. Typically, a branding audit will be done and should be done often.Brand Equity – The last part of strategic brand management strategy is maintaining and expanding the brand equity and value. Making sure your brand continues to grow, improve products and services, and can tap into related industries to be seen as a leader. This part can take years to accomplish, but it is important for your company to work on it and stick with the plan.How Employees Can Shape Your Company’s Brand  There are a lot of brand growth techniques, but one that companies’ should focus on utilizing is what they have internally. By that, I mean your company’s workforce and the value they can bring to the brand. Of course, marketing and brand marketing is important and certainly shapes the way audiences view your company’s brand. But, employees from all departments will actually accelerate brand visibility and are important to include in your brand management strategy. Any good strategic brand management strategy should focus on how to get employees advocating on the company’s behalf. The simplest way is to activate them online and encourage content sharing to their social media networks. Here are two main reasons this is important: Employees protect and defend the brand As a business, it’s easy for the brand to become a target of unfair, incomplete, irresponsible, skewed criticisms and disparagement on social media. Hence, when a business can count on a team of employee advocates to help shape and reshape social-media chatter, the business stands much better odds of being able to control and bring balance to what’s being said. Of course, you will still have unhappy people and potential internet trolls via social or review sites, but prospects seeing employees being proactive, responsive, and sharing content can help keep the level of transparency and positivity flowing. Learn how to build your company brand by utilizing employees and transforming employees into thought leaders. Download the complete guide. Help grow brand visibility and develop brand trust Before I dive in, I thought it would make sense to share these few stats first: The average employee across the companies that use our platform has a network of over 1,500 connections (Source)Brand messages reached 561% further when shared by employees vs the same messages shared via official brand social channels (Source)Brand messages are re-shared 24x more frequently when distributed by employees vs a brand (Source)A Nielsen study showed that 84% of people trust recommendations and content from people they know (friends, family, and colleagues)Those four above stats should paint a picture in your head as to why employees are valuable assets for your company branding. Employees have a direct connection to hundreds if not thousands of people your company may not be reaching. Extrapolate that between your entire workforce or even a portion of them getting involved in sharing your branded content and your brand can grow exponentially without spending thousands a month on advertising. The more attention your company content receives, the more engagement and consumption that content receives, the greater your brand awareness and overall trust will develop. Final Thoughts Brand management is one of the most important pieces to fueling your company’s growth and without focusing on a trustworthy image, you can easily be losing in the purchasing decision. It’s important to understand what tactics and strategies can help your company continue to develop brand visibility and take your company to the next level. Also, just because you’re not on the level of Apple or Starbucks, doesn’t mean you actually need a massive budget to devote to branding. Your marketing department will have many tools and tactics that can elevate company brand, but it will take all departments to work together to make the branding great. It’s why all employees at a company are incredibly valuable in shaping the company brand and how your products or services are perceived by the market. Many companies underestimate the value their internal workforce can have on the image of their brand. But give them the opportunity and tools to make sharing company content easy. Your company’s brand will reap the benefits. Looking to amplify your company’s brand management, while boosting marketing, sales, and recruiting results through the power of employees?

Developing a strategic plan to maintain brand equity or gain brand value requires a comprehensive understanding of the brand, its target market, and the company’s overall vision. How Brand Management Works Brands have a powerful influence on customer engagement, competition in the markets, and the management of a company. A strong brand presence in the market differentiates a company’s products from its competitors and creates brand affinity for a company’s products or services. A brand that has been established has to continually maintain its brand image through brand management. Effective brand management increases brand awareness, measures and manages brand equity, drives initiatives that support a consistent brand message, identifies and accommodates new brand products, effectively positions the brand in the market, etc.  Brand Management and Your Target Market Developing a strategic plan to manage your brand equity requires a clear and comprehensive understanding of three things: the brand itself, its target market, and your company’s overall vision and goals. A good relationship with your target market is a must for brand management. If you have bad branding, it will be reflected in weak sales, poor client retention, and sluggish growth. To be effective, brand management must fully look after your brand, using marketing techniques in a way that ensure the entire brand is highlighted, taken care of, and promoted. Ultimately, it’s about making a commitment to your customers and then delivering on that promise. Identify the critical information needed to develop a product and brand strategy that generates both quick-wins and long-term value. Your unique selling proposition (USP) sets you apart from competitors. To create your unique selling proposition, you must understand where your product and company fit into the market. What makes the product different from its competition? Is it more durable or cost-effective? Why is Strategic Brand Management important? And how is your company different? Brand management is vital to the success of every organisation, and smart companies know that strong brands are not built by marketing alone, but require every employee to play a role. While each brand management strategy is different in terms of resources and execution, the goal is the same: to build a brand that is distinct and profitable.

Would it not be incredible on the off chance that another person better at marketing faced up that challenge and subsidized the marketing? You could pay them a little commission expense for every deal. It might sound unrealistic, yet it isn't. This is called affiliate marketing. This article investigates affiliate marketing, how it works and the advantage it gives to both the vender and the affiliate advertiser. What is Affiliate Marketing? Affiliate marketing is an underwriting based publicizing system, that procures advertisers (affiliate) cash when web clients follow up on that marketing. In view of a model of income sharing, sellers (vendor) offer a monetary motivating force, for example, a commission, through an affiliate program. Affiliates acquire a bit of the benefit for every deal through making marketing substance to attempt divert clients through a client URL to the dealer's item. Affiliates can bring in cash advancing items and administrations and make a pay, without really having any of their own. For the dealer, it utilizes the assistance of affiliate to put time and cash into marketing your items or administrations. To extend their scope on the objective (on the web) crowd. As indicated by Mediakix, affiliate marketing going through builds each year in the USA, with around a 10 percent yearly expansion in affiliate marketing spending. Affiliate marketing alludes to an online connection between the supposed vendor and the affiliate, where the dealer pays the affiliate a commission to divert possible purchasers to the trader's site. How Affiliate Marketing functions Affiliate marketing includes four distinct gatherings: • The vendor, • The affiliate, • The affiliate marketing organization, and • The client. From a marketing perspective, there are two segments: the vendor who has delivered the item or administration available to be purchased and the affiliate advertiser who advances it. With a customary plan of action, the dealer bears the danger that benefit surpasses the general marketing costs. Be that as it may, an affiliate takes on the advancement endeavors and afterward procures a bit of the benefit from every deal they make. This is typically through a predefined commission, and the deals are followed by means of customized affiliate joins. For the affiliate, they simply should be acceptable at marketing. It works likewise to someone utilized in deals on commission. For example, realtors. This boosts their exhibition. This is a tremendous advantage to the trader having an absolutely appointed deals power and unsurprising marketing costs. In the other hand, affiliates can make an income stream without putting resources into stock or foundation. ""The way to fruitful affiliate marketing lies in the development of a mutually beneficial connection between the sponsor and the affiliate."" 1. The trader The trader is otherwise called the merchant, seller, or retailer. They are the gathering who made the item to market — it could be an actual article or an assistance. They could be a sole merchant or an enormous enterprise. When the item is made, they are not needed to be effectively associated with marketing. They have others do the advancement, in return for a commission on deals. 2. The affiliate Otherwise called the substance designer or the distributer, the affiliates attempt to make engaging marketing to draw in clients to the trader's site. They make content for the items to share via web-based media, sites, and sites. Affiliates regularly as of now have a group of people or following via online media, so they pick items in their specialty that address the issues of their crowd. For instance, If I had fabricated a group of people posting content about wellness and wellbeing, I would not turn into an affiliate advertiser for a sweets organization. ""There are a huge number of affiliates, working for various sponsors all the while, driving steady traffic and deals in return for commission."" 3. The organization Numerous dealer/affiliate connections are overseen through affiliate marketing organizations. There are two key connections: The first is with the affiliate and the second is with the shipper. The organization functions as a mediator between the trader and the affiliate. Affiliate marketing organizations, for example, Linkshare, Commission Junction, and Clickbank encourage the following of deals exchanges, installments and item conveyance. Their innovation tracks all the exercises and deals with the commissions and the issuance of installments to affiliates. These organizations additionally fill in as an information base of items, out of which the affiliate can pick items or administrations to advance. The organization encourages the administration of candidates, making the cycle of support simple for both the trader and the affiliate. Amazon likewise has an affiliate organization (Amazon Associates Affiliates Program), to help advance purchaser items, for example, books and toys, sold on their foundation. 4. The purchaser The purchaser (or client) make this relationship work. On the off chance that they don't buy, there is no income and the affiliate won't get a commission. At the point when purchasers purchase the item, the dealer and the affiliate share in the benefits. There won't be a more exorbitant cost for customers buying through an affiliate, as the expense of the affiliate network is normally remembered for the cost. The advantages of affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is valuable to both the dealer and the affiliate. The relationship spreads the duties of marketing, utilizing the capacities of an assortment of people for a more viable marketing system. For the affiliate, it is an economical technique for bringing in cash with little overheads. It permits advanced advertisers to bring in cash as free specialists for an assortment of vendors. The affiliate gets a portion of the benefit and the dealer profits by unsurprising marketing costs as a level of deals. ""The technique speaks to a definitive in veritable compensation for execution marketing and, accordingly, speaks to one of the most encouraging long haul marketing procedures for web based business."" How do affiliates get paid? Affiliates get a commission installment from the trader, contingent upon predefined shopper activities. These incorporate Pay per click — redirect of a shopper, for example, a tick out to their online shop for a lead; or they may Pay per deal if an exchange happens. The a lot of the benefit is remembered for the retail price — there is certainly not an additional expense put on the client for a deal through affiliates. Tweaked affiliate URLs made by the affiliate marketing organization or organization for each affiliate, to follow their deals. ""Each time a deal is made utilizing the affiliate URLs, the shipper pays the substance maker a slice of the deal through the affiliate marketing organization."" Trader Strategy Accept you as of now have an item or administration to sell and there is a business opportunity for it. Dealers discover affiliates, regularly through an affiliate organization, to advance their item or administration. The troublesome part for the shipper is finding an affiliate who as of now have a drawn in crowd, that coordinates their objective market. The commission sum emphatically influences the quantity of leads. The affiliate will work more enthusiastically on their marketing. For computerized items, since they are effectively replicable, commission rates can be half or significantly higher. ""Affiliates place a wide range of sorts of promotions on their sites (pennants, text advertisements, even item interfaces) that rouse buyers (site guests) to make a move to survey and conceivably purchase an item or administration from the promoter. At the point when it works, the affiliate gets paid a commission."" Affiliate methodology Affiliate advertisers discover an item or various items, they like enough that they believe is advantageous advancing it. Sites, for example, Gumroad help affiliates to discover affiliates to collaborate with and permit them to gather commissions. On the off chance that an affiliate advertiser is beginning without having an after, they could start by inspecting items on a YouTube channel or writing for a blog with item surveys and correlations in their picked specialty. Some portion of this technique includes attempting to construct your contact list by boosting individuals to join your mailing list. At the point when an affiliate has a pay, utilizing pay per click publicizing will help scale up with quicker development. Dealers ought to give their affiliates different promoting media to suit various applications and to keep new in the commercial center. This will improve the aftereffects of the affiliates. ""Online media exercises indicated a critical impact on the quantity of leads produced by the affiliates. Affiliates transcendently utilize online media to draw in with their intended interest group. Particularly if an affiliate's business center is compatible with the merchant's, affiliates may utilize online media messages to cause them audience to notice the important vendor."" Marketing instruments There are a few marketing instruments that an affiliate advertiser can utilize. Initially, marketing should be focused to attempt to contact the individuals destined to be a client. In the event that you are selling a B2B administration, for instance, don't utilize TikTok. Utilize the techniques well on the way to contact them. It very well may be through web-based media, writing for a blog, email marketing or paid publicizing. In the event that you have picked an item in a specialty that you as of now have an enormous email information base for or a huge web-based media following, those are the most coherent spots to begin. It very well may be a pennant on a blog article on your site you wrote to analyze items in that classification that sends possible purchasers to the dealer's site. You may build up an entire site devoted to vendor's items. Brand Management You should be savvy about building an individual brand for your expert profession. In building this brand, your profile picture says a ton regarding you, so you should invest the time and energy into completing a few expert pictures and afterward occasionally changing your profile picture. Think about your web-based media accounts as ways to improve your expert development. I write to, trade remarks with and tutor a large number of my adherents on LinkedIn.

Utilize your records to drive your message and have a good time meeting new individuals as you develop your organization.

You need to keep your profile proficient, making a point to add your expert picture and life story just as a presentation. A decent hack to begin is to look for individuals you know in the business and audit their profiles to figure out setting yours up. Next, see joining gatherings to begin in conversations and just associate with individuals you know. This will give you an essential expert profile to which you can add substance, for example, articles as you meet new individuals and engage in the network. • Twitter On Twitter, it assists with making an account utilizing hashtag watchwords since scouts frequently lead look by utilizing these catchphrases, however remember that — like with LinkedIn or Facebook — employing directors will presumably survey your profile. You ought to follow specialists and organizations in your locale, and you can show your insight regarding a matter, share others' information and join continuous conversations. Twitter can be where you let your character, insight and thought administration radiate through. • GitHub On the off chance that you go after programming advancement jobs, it would be energetically prescribed to have a functioning record on GitHub or another code storehouse site and to remember that profile for your list of qualifications. You need to grandstand your undertakings that are presently being utilized by the network and show different tasks with which you are included also. • YouTube YouTube account is a brilliant choice for this substance. What is basic is that this is another incredible method to develop your brand and connect with the network safety network. In the event that you use YouTube, however, make sure to keep it current and make certain to share it over the entirety of your other web-based media accounts.

They think that all you have to do is tell the agency what you want, they go and do it and then you’ll get back fabulous work and that is that. However, in my experience knowing how to work with an agency can make the difference between OK and great work. 1. Choose your agency well. People move around A LOT in an agency.

If you don’t have the right team, talk to the management about shifting it Continue ReadingThis is a great question, because too many people think that this is the easy bit. They think that all you have to do is tell the agency what you want, they go and do it and then you’ll get back fabulous work and that is that. However, in my experience knowing how to work with an agency can make the difference between OK and great work. 1. Choose your agency well. People move around A LOT in an agency. Within an agency there are many people and teams with varied talents. Secure the talent you think you need for the work. If you don’t have the right team, talk to the management about shifting it. If you don’t have the right agency, define what you need and then ask other people who have more experience and contacts what agencies might fit you bill. 2. Write a good brief, ideally with plenty of time for the work to be done. Time is important here. You need to have enough information to be able to brief, but give enough time for the creative and decision making processes to happen. You should also remember that a brief is called a brief because it should BRIEFLY tell the agency what you want and what it needs to do. I believe good briefs are written WITH the agency (obviously with a little pre-work on your side) in order to get the right decisions onto the page so that the agency can use your brief internally vs having to rewrite the brief for their creatives and so risk missing off key requirements (this happens all too often). They should cover: a. The background b. The Challenge you face or objective - I like seeing this in ‘real people’ language. That is what is the consumer behaviour you want to change? My first one I did like this had a huge effect on the quality of the work because the people reading the brief understood exactly what we wanted to achieve. This type of language can be shown as “ I want people who currently buy X product to buy Y product instead” or “Change the way these specific consumers do something from X to Y”. c. Your core (unchanging) brand strategy (call this equity, brand character etc.) State it here. So it is in front of them to remind them what your brand stands for. This will help stop work coming back that is clearly out of character for your brand. d. You message strategy. One sentence that describes what you want to say (ideally with 1 verb only), plus (optional) 1 sentence which describes any support to overcome consumer disbelief or to support what you want to say. e. Any media elements you absolutely want to have (if you KNOW you will have to have a TV ad or a social media campaign, put it down) f. Budget. Yes, we all want to do something cheaply, but put down your cash so they can judge if you can buy the gold plated limo or the scooter, it will save time in the long run. g. Timing. Give them an idea of how/when and where. You will mostly likely want this next week. My advice is that if you want good work, plan at least 6 months ahead as good creative rarely comes from fast work. h. Mandatories. Put here anything which you absolutely have to have (or not have). e.g. at Duracell we had to use the Bunny in certain media. ideas which came back without the bunny wouldn’t be countenanced and were a waste of everyone’s time and budget. 3. Judge work at a strategic level before you think about the execution. God this is hard to get people to do. I worked with a Global Marketing Manager who looked at a pencil scamp of a Duracell bunny and her FIRST comment to the agency was ‘the bunny’s supposed to be pink’. Judge the idea. a. First ask yourself if you FEEL that you like it. b. Ask yourself ‘what is this idea’. c. Then ‘does it fit my brief’ (look at all elements of equity, media, budget etc.). If you don’t like the idea, tell them based on the points above, so that they can understand where they are going wrong vs you just saying ‘I don’t like it’. This will help them understand how you think. Remember some of this is gut feel vs black/white. 4. Once you agree the idea, then look at the execution, but try to feedback with OBJECTIVES vs execution ie. “I don’t feel like the brand is prominent enough” vs “can you make the brand logo bigger”. This is important. The people doing this work have WAY more experience than you and are more creative. They may find a way of achieving your objective EVEN better than you can think of. 5. Say thank you and make sure you always credit and congratulate them for good work. You will probably feel like this is ‘your work’ and it is in part. However, they put their souls into this - creativity is personal and emotional. This is a great question, because too many people think that this is the easy bit. They think that all you have to do is tell the agency what you want, they go and do it and then you’ll get back fabulous work and that is that. However, in my experience knowing how to work with an agency can make the difference between OK and great work. 1. Choose your agency well. People move around A LOT in an agency.

The brand manager is responsible for defining the principles / ground rules that need to be followed across product offerings. Brand managers do not know the best color combinations or UI objects to be employed for a particular application. The brand manager is responsible for defining the features that will convey a consistent sentiment. The best case of this would be Apple (USA) or the Virgin Group (UK). Apple brand influences in the UI convey a sentiment of uncomplicated, uncluttered, user-centric experience. This is done by defining guides for do's and don'ts for the color scheme and obiects in the GUI. Virgin is (in my view) even better. They manage to come across as human (friendly), can-do and positive in the things they do. The brand manager influences expouses a youthful organizational culture by virtue of how problems are explained and esclated to the user.",2021-03-04T22:02:58.999Z,"How much influence should a brand manager have on user Interface design?

Nowadays the job of product manager or product owner tends to be much more technical than business-oriented.  In the 80s, the job was always in marketing and was focused on defining markets, running the financials, and empowering other departments, particularly development and sales.  In the 90s and 00s, the job skewed more technical, more often reporting to the development VP and closely aligned with a specific product development team. In many ways, the job is more like business analyst than brand manager.  That said, 40% of product managers today have an MBA. They are schooled in business as much as in technology. The original definition of product owner in Scrum was intended to be a business role.  The way product management skills are deployed is different in each company.

Basically, creating a critical need. It goes much deeper that that, but enough for here.Obviously, a look at the products attached to the brand.We bundle all that up into a training manual for the company. Again, we have not even looked at the creative, logos, etc. That is not what makes a brand. People buy the value, not the graphics.Branding then shifts to marketing. We create the core messaging and hooks to the brand's story.That begets the creative and depends on a multitude of factors.Our approach also creates the CORRECT media to do the marketing. So, just because I have a top notch team of web people or video producers, does not mean that is what I sell the client. - Many companies are looking at pushing production as a ""full service"" agency. Totally irresponsible.Sustainable: Keep #1-5 maintained. Stellar customer service and customer experience. Keep the staff trained in that and keep it going, you don't need fancy creative. Marketing needs to be about return for your client, not an award on your shelf. So, even if I make a big profit on high end creative, I don't sell the client what they don't need. In fact some of our clients get the best results with the worst creative. The message is correct. I have one client that does about $5M/year and all his brochures are photocopied and his email marketing looks like a 5th grader did it and he gets results because of the messaging.

A brand manager is in change of what THE MESSAGE means. What associations does the product/service/knowledge/issue want people to have towards it?  Luxury, modernity, reliable, affordable, tough, sexy etc.  In other words when people receive THE MESSAGE how does it make them feel? Does it make them happy, sad, confident, strong, attractive. The brand manager will be the one who goes over the entire MESSAGE ensuring it is consistent with what emotions the product/service/knowledge/issue decided it wanted to portray during its market research.

The role of a brand manager can be divided into four categories as follows - Brand CommunicationBrand ManagementBrand InnovationBusiness ManagementAll these categories are quite comprehensive in nature, that is, each category has further sub categories and media planning is one of the sub categories of Brand Management. I know right now it looks too much to learn and be skilled with but the road isn’t that long as it looks like. What you need to focus on is learn the job of a brand manager, add the required skill set to your experience. By gaining access to industry-driven content, solving real business problems and getting personalized coaching from industry experts, you can bridge this skill set gap. There are some ed-tech companies today, that provide people with some best online certification programs that help you crack those hard to get branding roles. You can look up for Kraftshala. I will say Kraftshala is a brainchild of professional experts from Nestle, Unilever and Goldman Sachs. Here is the program I think will be helpful to you called Professional Brand Management program - https://kraftshala.com/professional-brand-management/ The course is so in depth that you might end up learning a lot more about your own media role. And the best part is that they don’t leave people with some video modules and theory based understanding. A part of their course curriculum is to make their students work on live projects with real brands and young emerging marketers like you. That means, they do understand that to be job ready you need to do the job by working closely with industry professionals. They have a tie up with over 200 industry experts whom you can contact and ask to mentor and guide you throughout the course. You can even set up mock interviews with them and get placement assistance as per your needs and requirements. Kraftshala is not just a learning platform but also assesses your marketing potential through INDUSTRYcreds certification score. I will still want to you to check out other courses as well since they might end up being a good fit to your requirements. Here are the links - Coursera - https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=brand%20management Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/build-successfull-brands/ - It is always best to do a thorough research and leave no stone unturned before you narrow down to one course given that time and money are limited and we always want to make the best of them but that should never make you compromise on quality.

If you neglect your customers’ questions, complaints, and other issues, your company’s reputation may quickly take a nasty fall. In short, you have to listen, answer, react, and be very quick. Most people expect an answer within an hour. The comments section is also a great source of honest product and company reviews, so it should never go unnoticed. There are social media tools which help a lot with social customer service. I personally use NapoleonCat. It has plenty of features regarding social media management and, naturally, it helps with social customer service. The tool allows you to keep a close watch on everything that flows though your social media channels - the social media inbox gathers it all in one place, and you can respond to everyone from that one place as well:  Oftentimes you will receive messages without the possibility of a quick response, e.g. when you clock out or when you’re asleep. If you want to offer instant replies to your customers, consider automatic moderation. I know what you’re thinking - chatbots with irrelevant, repetitive answers. Well, NapoleonCat can help you answer to everyone in need and solve their issues in a smart, authentic way. You can set up automated replies so that they answer to specific words or phrases:  If you know the most frequently asked questions, you can set up “moderation rules” and define specific replies. You can redirect your customers to a relevant article, provide them with adequate information or even forward the customers’ messages directly to your team by turning on automatic email notifications",2021-03-04T22:49:24.170Z,"What do you think about social listening and how important do you think it is for brand managers to listen to social chatter?

Because I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it people like me.” Pull out a copy of Think and Grow Rich or The Secret and flip to any random chapter, light a candle, and visualize the HR department patting you on the back telling you just how amazing of a candidate you are! Now that we got the bull-shit out of the way here is a headhunter’s guide to acing an Interview. Listen more than talk Harder to do than you think. You are going to want to talk on and on about your bull shit credentials and how amazing your mommy thinks you are. The hiring manager isn’t your mama. Coerce the manager into talking more than you. Ask open ended questions. Get them to talk about their greatest accomplishments. You’re uncovering clues about your future boss. Uncover the most painful part of the boss’s job The job that you’re interviewing for doesn’t matter. Getting the hiring manager to trust you and to be their confidant is what matters. Boss lady is looking for a bitch to unload work to. Be their bitch if you want the job. That’s how life works. Show them in the interview that you’re ready to be their bitch. Don’t actually say “bitch” be more sophisticated of course and use terms like “strategic alliance” or “vertical integration”. Whatever BS marketing term you can muster up that sounds nicer than being someone’s bitch. Big company means lots of hierarchy Lots of hierarchy means you need to find out where they want you to fit in the pack. You want to find out if the boss that is going to hire you is an Alpha or a Beta. If the boss is a beta you’re f*****. Beta’s get screwed hard time in hierarchal big behemoth companies like Amazon. Work for the Alpha. Alpha’s taking you farther up the food chain. Tie your performance to how they business made money Amazon corporate exists for one purpose. To make money. Some people will tell you that “It’s not about the money, it's about doing humanity good by providing toasters for $15 with free shipping……” You must communicate how your performance = money coming in the door. They call this “Revenue”. Yeah, it’s what keeps people employed. If you can’t tie one of your skills to bringing money in the door than don’t mention it. All behavioral interview questions are bull shit Humans love bull shit. HR departments are experts and bull shit. All behavioral questions are a waste of time and easy to hack. If you get asked behavioural interview questions just remember the simple rule of thumb is to answer them like you’re a manic depressive, work-a-holic who never confronts his boss. If you land a job with Amazon it’s mostly luck All hiring managers base who they’re going to hire off of subjective, feel good patterns. They’re not going to base it off of objective criteria. Never going to happen. Because that’s the case you should employ every subjective bias you have at your disposal which are not limited to the “law of reciprocity” and “confirmation bias”. For the next two weeks your life revolves around giving this boss every free piece of advice imaginable and agreeing with him on EVERYTHING! Send letters and emails through the recruiting process. Occasionally you have to sprinkle in some disagreement so it doesn’t appear that you’re brown nosing. But you have to brown nose. That’s how you get a little bit more lucky and ace the interview. Best of luck. I’m off to show a bunch of middle managers some medical software!",2021-03-04T23:34:27.756Z,"How should I prepare for a retail brand manager interview at Amazon? ",Quora

Your job is to make recommendations, test your recommendations, then implement any changes. Generally, that either means: Sales slowness is near-term and accidental - if you’re patient they will return to prior levels and above. In this case you recommend patience.There are factors driving that slowness and you need to make changes to get sales back to prior levels. In this case you need to recommend specific changes.If you decide it’s the second, then you need to determine what changes need to be made. You have an almost infinite number of options. But first you have to deduce WHY sales have slowed before you can recommend changes. Is consumer demand for products from your brand dropping? If it is, then why? Satisfaction issues? New competitors? Changing perception of your brand?Often, it’s not consumer demand but structural changes. Perhaps the sales channel has changed (retailers have changed, distributors have changed, etc…) and that’s the reason for lower demand.Sometimes it’s a problem feeding enough product into your sales channels. Are there any logistics problems or hold ups?What about your communication? Have you changed ad budgets or advertising types? Are the communication channels changing? Did you change type of advertising? Advertising agency? etc…Getting answers requires gathering every bit of learning you can (research, data, qualitative information, anecdote, etc.) and analyzing what you hear in order to derive a set of possible scenarios then work out an approach for choosing the scenario that seems appropriate. Not easy. And some of these questions are extremely hard to answer. What you must not do is fall back on a single source of information (big data being the current lazy man’s approach). This analysis is also classic in that it requires logic, data, reason AND intuition to arrive at a good conclusion.",2021-03-04T23:40:22.061Z,"Give an example of how you would have to use your analytical capabilities in a brand management role?

Done that. Early in my educational career I decided I wasn’t going to do any homework that was redundant. Basically this means I passed school via test scores alone, with a GPA of 1.14. I didn’t see a lot of prospects on the horizon, but knew I didn’t want to be a cashier at the local 7–11. I joined the Army for a short span, which allowed me to figure out what my aptitudes really were, and what genuinely interested me. When I got out, I took a handful of classes, paid mostly by my GI Bill and Army College Fund (mostly just combat arms jobs qualify for this), but not enough for any sort of degree. Somewhere along the way I discovered I had a knack, and genuine interest, in computers, and focused on a couple of computer classes at the local community college in the late 90s. This allowed me to have a basic foundation in a computer-centric job. Doing that for a year I found a new tangent that I thoroughly enjoyed, and that was Computer Security. From there I either took a class or self-studied for a computer certification (Network+ and Security+). These granted me access to other jobs that furthered my education. Flash forward nearly 20 years and I have a job that I love to do, which pays me enough that I cannot complain, and best of all, no student debt. I have two certifications that mean anything and less than 10 college courses under my belt and I’m living comfortably. Don’t let anyone trap you into thinking that a degree is the only way to make it anywhere, even from a community college. The important part is that you seem to be interested in how to move forward, and what direction your life (and career) take you. Hold onto this motivation, especially early on. Ultimately, once you’re in the workforce no one cares about what your GPA was in high school. Take a couple of college courses so that you’re not lying when you check the box on an application saying “some college”. This sets your groundwork for you to really delve into you. What do you want to do? Can you make a living doing that? Obviously if you can’t make a decent living with that job, you need to move to the next choice, and the next. Then you’ll have to look what are the requirements? College degree? Certifications (there’s a lot of careers out there, especially computer related ones that are more dependant on Certs than Degrees)? Don’t be afraid to do a “nothing” job for a few years to pay for those things you need to do a job that’s in your wheelhouse. Understand, no one starts in the upper floors (management), unless you’re put there because of neopotism, but even then you should start near the bottom and work your way up. That way your skills/knowledge grow with you in your career. Original Question: What should I do after I graduate from high school? I have 1.8 GPA. I am so lost. Yup, been there. Done that.

Therefore there is one such platform where you can build your Personal Branding which is EDU4SURE. They will help you to make your Personal Brand. Below are the some keys that will help you in Personal Branding:- Focus - “Too many people are unfocused when it comes to think press & coverage trying “everything” to everyone. Decide your message & stick to it” as said by Cooper Harris Founder & CEO of Klickly. You should be focus on our message & then only you will be able to target the main idea & therefore it becomes much easier when you focus on a particular thing.Genuine - “Be genuine & it will be much more easier to manage your personal branding” as said by William Harris Facebook Ads expert at Elumynt. If you are highly skilled in one area your Personal Branding becomes much more effective & it will built your reputation also.Tell a story of your Personal Brand - Your personal brand should tell a story about yourselves not where you were born or what education you did & from where; like what all have you learnt from that. It should be clear to the audience as not in the form of Monologues but in the form of written or videos. For that make use of the Smartphone & connect with your Workers & co workers.Consistency - Being consistent is similar to having a narrow mind & thus it helps focusing on one path as the personal brand idea sticks around it. “You have to demonstrate consistency across communication, gravitas & experiences. Don’t underestimate the tiny inconsistencies can derail personal brand effectiveness.”Ready for the Failure - Who likes to fail? Failure is one such which helps us to motivate & learn from the mistakes. Because we learn fro from that. There are many persons who didn’t succeeded at one go; like Albert Einstein, Walt Disney, Thomas Alva Edison & many more. So you will not become the Best Personal Brand until you fail & learn from it.Positive Impact - As you develop a Personal Brand there are two options you can either hop over others or burn the bridges & have a steady growth around your Brand. It will have a positive attitude & help the business grow in the long run.Live your Brand - One of the best way to make Personal Brand difficult on yourselves is detach your life from personal life. But it shouldn’t take a toll on our life. Your Personal Brand should follow where ever you go. As your personal brand is a refection of the job series you have done like Marketing ,HR & it should give thoughtful, mentoring & leadership.Let others tell your Story - Personal Branding is all about telling your story when you are not in that room. People are able to identify the work you did. And you will have a Name & Reputation.Leave a Legacy - Once you have build a Personal Brand & the next thing is to leave a legacy.As Personal Branding is a lifelong project that evolves & changes. And creating the right personal brand helps you to know your fields & consistency lands & it could bring a difference between “who are you?’ or “thanks for you being here”.

Defending a beleaguered name To date, Corona marketers have held their nerve, debunking the urban myths and defending their beleaguered brand name with substantiated stats from the get-go. Constellation Brands, which owns the US rights to the brand, said at the end of February: “With Corona Extra sales up 5% per the latest four-week period, our beer business continues its strong performance despite unfounded claims about the impact of Covid-19 on the business and consumer sentiment.” By countering rumors with the persuasive power of numbers, they’ve managed to shut down the gossip and carried on regardless. But in all honesty, they have good reason to be worried – Google has reported a global increase in ‘Corona beer virus’ searches. It’s not the first homonym involving disease and a brand. According to The New York Times, during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, sales of the diet candy Ayds dropped approximately 50% and the brand finally went out of business. At that time, the Ayds marketing team also held their nerve. After all, changing your brand name because of a new virus would have felt like a knee-jerk reaction. Surely a brand that had been around almost 50 years would prevail over a temporary pandemic? So, where did Ayds go wrong? Building equity Fundamentally, the reasons were twofold. The first lay in the fact that the product benefit of Ayds was rapid weight loss, which unfortunately was the public’s growing understanding of the AIDS virus victims’ symptoms. The other problem was the Ayds brand image. Despite it being in the market since the 1930s, there was no established and familiar look and feel, and no consistent or compelling visual expression. It had no long-standing equities to trigger an emotional response and gain affinity over the years.",2021-03-05T00:58:27.746Z,"How is Corona beer managing its brand with the Coronavirus pandemic?

Then the cabby shared with us the list of major tourist attractions we can visit during our 10 days stay in Singapore, the best food joints we can hop in for lunch or dinner and also talked about the rules and regulations being followed in Singapore, the culture of Singapore, the government and also about the people.

Having a successful online presence today requires a number of key elements. Namely and educated and driven Head of Marketing / Brand Manager, a team to support that person that has expertise on multiple social media outlets and search engines, and some tools either internally built or purchased externally to pull together the huge volume of information that needs to be handled.

The 5 companies below range in popularity but the lessons in there apply to all brands; there is so much to be gained from examining exactly why the stories were so effective.    Guinness   Guinness is no stranger to effective brand storytelling. This video reached three million views within four days of online release. This is another exercise in concise brand storytelling with a big heart – the concept sees a group of guys playing wheelchair basketball. A simple plot; a game of wheelchair basketball followed by a pint of Guinness. The twist is that only one of the men in the group is an actual wheelchair user – the rest, it seems, are his friends who are playing wheelchair basketball so that they can all play together.   So what on Earth does this story have to do with Guinness? It is when the voiceover kicks in that the storytelling really ramps up though: “Dedication, loyalty, friendship – the choices we make reveal the true nature of our character,” says a gravelly voiced chap.    The choice the men in the ad make to play wheelchair basketball is testament to their character, and so is the choice they make when they are at the beer taps. It almost tells viewers to be the best person they can be, and drink the best quality drink they can get their hands on. You simply cannot argue with that as a memorable and evocative piece of brand storytelling – and the image of the group walking (and wheeling) away from the court will stick with you .     Google If you haven’t seen this Google story, you can watch it here …a short 3+ minutes.    The story is this: a man in Delhi tells his granddaughter about his childhood friend, Yusuf. He hasn’t seen Yusuf since the Partition of India in 1947, when India and Pakistan became separate countries and the two friends were forced to separate. The man’s granddaughter arranges for the two to meet again.    This story is about as emotional as it gets. Stories like this provide a chance to experience a variety of emotions without the risk of those emotions themselves. Emotions like wonder, fear, courage, or love can be tested out in the minds of those as they listen to a story.   If you really listen to your customers, like Google has, you can leverage their stories to drive your creativity. By analyzing their stories of how your products and services fit into their lives, you can gain valuable insight into their needs and desires, which can be hugely beneficial to other aspects of your business. Like product design and development and ongoing marketing strategy. The reunion has done that well don’t you think?   The story is simple and direct. It’s beautiful, and honest, and true. The photography is spectacular. The music adds to the very good acting.      Dawn We recently viewed a Dawn Liquid Detergent story told in one of their advertisements that caught our eye for several reasons. An effective TV ad that combined traditional advertising with advocacy advertising and creative storytelling. Something you don’t see very often.    Have you seen this recent Dawn story in their TV commercial? If not, you should invest 1 minute now and check it out. It will prove beneficial in reviewing their great story.    Interesting information, well presented, showing emotion, always holds attention, yes? Keep in mind that people don’t watch ads … they watch what interests them. Your stories must be interesting to your target communities.       New Bell of South Africa Have you seen the remarkable branding story from this South African business? It was created to market and build the brand. It is a very simple story. It advocates learning to read no matter your age or status in society.    To us it creates pure magic with the story, the visuals, the music and the emotion. If you haven’t seen it, watch it now, it is only 2 minutes and it will inspire you. It is certainly easily in our top 5 of all time.     What makes this story so remarkable? Of course the whole thing was staged. Who cares? It certainly accomplished its objective to build on the brand. Over 1 million views so far for a business from South Africa that most of us have ever heard of. Of course, you can’t design a story for going viral. But you can target for being remarkable and engaging.      Lego Movie There is no better story example I ever seen than The Lego Movie. As I sat in the theater to a packed house along with 3 of my grandchildren, I marveled at what I was witnessing. Kids laughed. Everyone was thoroughly entertained.     All because a brand had managed to create a masterful story, using their product as the star, and at the same time created what is the most effective 90 minute commercial for a “toy” we’ve ever seen.   But the reaction of my kids is no surprise really. If one analyzes the film, it’s quite apparent what makes it so very effective:   It’s actually a good movie—incredibly well written— for kids and adults.    The product is the entire movie. Every scene is masterfully created with Legos.    There are deep messages happening within the movie, all of which are uplifting and easy to get behind:   -There is a “builder” within each one of us if we only believe -We’re only as limited as our imagination allows us to be -You’re never too old to create magic     Takeaway Can you see why these brands have hit such huge home runs with their tales? They are quickly becoming the mecca of “story telling done right” for brands big and small going forward.

To be relevant two things matter most:+ Enable the people working on your project to do the best job they can do+ Remove any obstacles that prevent your project form succeeding How do you achieve that? There is no recipe, but this is the help I can offer:+ Gain domain knowledgeUnderstand what is of value to your business and how you/your team can add to it, what is the business culture and how it impacts how your team operates. Learn as much as you can about the nature and content of your business. Find the experts in your team and in your company that have the know-how relevant to your project(s) and make them your friends and allies. To help your team, you will have to know your and THEIR stuff!+ Be socialShow that you care for the people you work with (not just in your team). In general, that should not be a chore, as most people will return any kindness offered. Take interest in the work and experiences of the people around you and see what you can learn from it. Be diplomatic with your peers and exercise ""give and take"" (try harder to give and they will reciprocate). + Manage ExpectationsNever promise anything that you're not sure you can deliver. It is OK to say ""I try my best"". Protect your team from being overtasked; if you think they are slacking, it's your job to ""remove the obstacles"" to their motivation. Don't be manipulative (if you can avoid it).  Be aware that you are now a ""Middle Manager"" and most people around you will not understand how your role adds value. That is why you have to make an effort to demonstrate that you do. Your team members will not see you doing work at the coal face, but they will also see that the big decisions are made further up the organisational tree. So you have a point to prove. But equally you are the hinge between these two parts of the business and that can offer opportunities to effect changes: look out for them and capitalise when you can. Finally: find something that lets you recharge your batteries! The biggest threat to relevant PMs is burn out. Burn out can be noticed, because it makes you grumpy and impatient, frustrated at the extreme. Look out for it and if it happens, make more time for yourself.  Hope this helps.

My tailor told me that jacket like these which i was wearing cost not more than 300 as these jackets were produced in mass and had cheap material. Yesterday i bought a Bluetooth speaker worth 600 that to of 880 watts…voila but wait…how!? Well the thing is they got it either from black market or from companies stock that's all. As per my experience palika is good if you detect product easily. It seems funny but before buying any cloth i ask shopkeeper to show product and then i first smell it to check whether its washed or new then i look for minor details.and finally i bargain for price.if you tell them your price range then be ready to get fooled. Pro tip is dont let the shopkeeper know how much money you have.always ask them for best quality material and do tell them to not to worry about price cause in the end its up to you,if you dont like it dont buy it.simple.",2021-03-05T01:05:00.354Z,"How do Palika Bazaar shop vendors manage to sell branded items at such low prices?

Or in a cattle farm. Here’s why Such an idea will harm your future and your life. Have you hear of existential reality and perceptive reality? The purpose of your life and your fulfillment in life depends SOLELY on how you VIEW your life. If you view it wrongly, it’s over before you begin it. Existential reality is what things are - you cannot change them. They really exist - like you are a human being and not an animal. You are flesh and blood and you are alive - and you can’t change that. You also have a unique personality that you acquired at birth. You can’t change that. And you have unique innate talents that you possess. You can’t change that! And you are a male or female. You have unique life experiences. You can’t change all of that too. You came into existence with a unique set of qualities for a particular purpose. It’s embedded in your DNA. You can’t change that. But if you want to deny all these and sacrifice your life in someone’s else experiment, the world will thank you for it. So, go ahead. Perceptive “reality” is what is perceived and not real - you can change it as you wish - like packaging, brand name, product feature, product colour, advertising slogan, brand “positioning”, “brand essence”, etc. All these can be changed to suit Marketing’s goals and purpose. Such “ideas” or “concepts” are empty of anything that lasts; and will evaporate into thin air the moment people stop talking about it. Do you want to be a product?? Be authentic. Be an existential reality. Know the difference between your worth and a product’s value. If you subject yourself to such a lowly, base and dead existence, soon you will lose all that you truly are. If you want to project yourself better, either you truly earn some merits or you simply speak and project your true self. Then, what follows will be smooth. That is what you are and that is enough - if you truly understand the worth of what you have. You have been given enough to succeed. Caution - don’t destroy your future before you begin But don’t be swept away by everything that appears shiny and trendy and impressive.. all that glitters is not gold - as you shall find out as you become a guinea pig for others “successful” ideas. Once you brand yourself in a certain field and your frivolity is established on the web and in all HR databases, you will have a serious problem erasing it when you change your “clever” branding over and over!! As I said, you exist. But products “do not” exist - only perceptively, only illusionary! The web is now littered with people with multiple “brands” in a series of failures in each one that can’t be erased. This totally discredits anything further that this person is going to do. Imagine an example like a Property Investment Expert who became a Branding Expert and then a Management Strategic Consultant - all in a matter of 2 years - and it is all there on the web for the whole wide world to see. And he still has 40 more working years left! This is a modern generational delusion. Be good at something. And that is all the branding you need. That is right. Show me someone with mediocre expertise who has a successful personal brand! NO successful business person or famous professional started out with a brand. Rather, it is their expertise and personalities that determine the brand - Colonel Sanders, Richard Branson, Robert Kiyosaki, etc. ALL successful brands are built on PROVEN expertise and solid reputation and not on outstanding packaging, clever sounding labelling/title or a perfectly cut jacket. All these come later. If you build your success on authenticity, your happiness will be immeasurable. If you think that so long as you have money by whatever means, you will be happy, then you will have another lifetime to learn - which you are unlikely to get - unless you are not a criminal. Note: I have said many times that people take one aspect of marketing (in this case, “branding”) and try to make it a “success factor” in another field (in this case, career coaching “selling”). This tactic has entered the Life Coaching business. Learn how to discern what is fabricated and what is true!! Stand on your own authenticity and conviction. That is worth more than anything that you are going to earn in a lifetime. There is no such thing as a personal brand.

I tried to nag Michael to answer some of these, but he's understandably swamped. I'll take a stab. My understanding of Everlane's very early funding (pre-product, or even product vision), was that the original duo of Michael Preysman and Jesse Farmer was very convincing. Michael said to me that he was the private equity guy and Jesse was the virality guy, and that was basically enough to convince investors that they were capable of bringing an idea to market. Clothing retail is a gigantic industry that makes VCs salivate, especially in light of a lot of recent successes (Gilt et al.), so it's not like tech investors are necessarily put off by the idea of attempting to break into a very well established market. To be trite, I think execution is everything here, and I think all the usual advice of how to sell investors on your ability to execute apply normally. That said, I think they definitely highly emphasized the ""internet"" part of ""internet retail"" in their pitches to traditionally tech investors, but I doubt there was anything more mysterious than that going on.",2021-03-05T01:06:12.029Z,"How Everlane managed to convince tech investors to invest in a clothing brand?

There are a lot of social media and content rock stars out there, but a few brands pop out from all the rest. Dove is one of these brands, especially with their #mybeautymysay campaign. Everything Dove does evidently steers away from promoting their brand. Instead, they send a social message that makes a huge impact on all the women out there. Through this campaign, they highlight sexist remarks about women athletes and reinforce the message that it’s not about a person’s looks, but about who she is and what she does that matters. Nike’s Instagram account is another great example. Instead of focusing on selling their products, Nike has been featuring amazing athletes who are perfect examples of determination and perseverance. The stories captured on the social media page are truly emotional, and are actual testimonies of people who listen to Nike’s call to “just do it”. Now Coke is definitely on top of the list not just in terms of social media, but in all their content. Their Share-a-Coke campaign was one of the best, as they take advantage of that connection among family and friends. And how can we forget their Christmas campaigns? Year after year, Coke releases ads that tug on every viewer’s heart, showing every tradition and symbol that makes one think about everything good about the season. United Healthcare is a brand that already has one relevant thing to promote – health. They do this is an amazingly engaging manner however, which allows them to earn top marks on the emotional aspect. Their #WeDareYou campaign has urged people to take part of a number of different activities, from answering quizzes to taking photos of healthy food they’re eating. That’s how engagement is done. Simply put, there are so many brands that have aced creating that emotional connection. From P&G to Sephora, Amex to Subaru, brands everywhere have learned the importance of tapping into what makes every human, human.

To add to Thijs van der Hoorn's answer they don't just control the company that makes the glasses - they are  the company that makes the glasses, for the brands they own and are licensed to. To break the cycle of domination, there would need to be considerable shake up of the market. Warby Parker have done this to an extent, the eyewear industry's Apple to Luxottica's Microsoft. However, Warby Parker are limited in their ability to take on brands like Chanel or Prada as those type of brands have a longstanding heritage in the fashion world. They have taken on brands like Ray Ban, however, and been fairly successful at it in the US. But bear in mind there is a huge European eyewear market.

There are some people who manage their social media very well and there are more who do not. After researching you are armed with information of why you are a solution to their problem. People are not with the same sales pitch through mail, e-mail amd phone daily. I first like to take note and KNOW what makes me different then everyone else. What I habe found is treating people like people not people like a business and being myself gets me further then anything. As well being educated enough in my product and in knowing how I SOLVE A PROBLEM for their business rather then slapping another sales pitch on them is a true rarity in today's industry. So for example if their Google Business Listing has some weird description of their business, the photo is all messed up and hard to identify then you just start out in a simple conversation. Not a sales pitch. Ask how their day is going empathize with their day by identifying some of the same issues in their day. Let them know that you were looking at their social media and first compliment what they are doing right amd then say but I did notice on your….fill in blank. Social media and reputation management take ALOT OF TIME AND ALOT OF EFFORT that often small business owners just don't have the time to give. Let them know how Facebook tricks them with boosts and that they are paying hundreds of dollars for boosted post and not seeing the likes on their page in return. Well of course they aren't because a boost goes out to people who already like your page. That is why a targeted ad set is so important. Then ask if they mind giving you 20 minutes of their time so you can show them you are a solution to their business even if that means doing a paid consult to help them have a better understanding. Say your Friday is crazy but Monday at 1 sounds good, how about for them? Most people would prefer the help when they know it is coming froim someone who is educated and genuinely cares about their business.

No, woman 35+ is not precise.- a real need: is your product solving a REAL issue, frustration, fear your target group have? Think how Uber solved many of them:  card payment, fast booking, low pricing, polite drivers...- credible proofs: do you give enough reasons to your target group to believe in the benefit you promise them? For a cream smoothing the skin, do you have testimonials and medical studies for example?- correct pricing: are your pricing and the value perception of your product matching? A diamond at 10$ will make people question the quality of the stone for example.- meborable brand and meaningful story telling: can people remember your brand name and tell a story to friends?- way to build scale: can you, in fast timing and and cost effectively, grow your offer and distribution?

FIND TRAINING ONLINE. No amount of school can prepare you for what's next in motion graphics. The basics are easily learned from others who have come before you. There are enough free learning materials online for motion graphics to get you up and running. Look for tutorials from people who are well known and produce great work. DO YOUR BEST: Strive to be as good as the people you are learning from. Strive to be better. Look at the motion graphics work of others that is appealing to you and others - openly appreciate it - and learn the steps to produce at those levels. Exceed those levels in your own work. TOOLS ARE SECONDARY: After Effects is a good starting tool, and more accessible to the beginner than Nuke at this point in time. But always remember, the tools are not as important as telling the story. Work with what you have access to, and use it to tell a great story. Focus on the message, the communication. The tools are just a means to produce the visuals - focus on what you want to show and don't worry about if your tools allow you to do it or not. There's always a way to show what's needed and you can search for others who've figured it out or develop a way yourself. CONTINUALLY LEARN: Learn on a project to project basis. Don't be afraid to take on projects you don't fully know how to produce. Get yourself to the level of confidence where you can take on jobs you've never done and figure out what it will take to learn and produce an effect. BE HONEST: Never lie to a client about your ability or promise that you'll have something done by a certain time until you KNOW.Just admit you've never done it before - but you know it's possible - and you will figure out the best way to go about it and get back to them on a time you can deliver. If they want someone more experienced, fine. Drop them. Move on. All you can do is be honest and do your best. Chances are, the next designer they find has never done it either, and they are going to be looking for a while. All the really really experienced designers are too busy to help them. :) YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IT ALL: New tools are released and improved on almost daily. You constantly need to be looking on a project to project basis for the new and better way of doing things. If you have a better idea of how to do something, check and see if it exists and is being used in the form of software or plugin and learn it and adopt it in your workflow. IMPROVE. ALWAYS IMPROVE: Continually improve your skill set with various tool sets and see what others are using to accomplish the work you are doing. Make your own personal projects when you can and try new things. If you discover a great combination of tools to get something done, share it openly with your peers to help them develop their skills too. You will become well known and respected in your field and get more work as a result. THE KEY INGREDIENT - BE HELPFUL: Above all, be helpful to customers and peers. Never look down on people starting out or view your peers as competition. They're not out to take your customers. They're your friends and family. You can learn from them and they can learn from you. I often send extra work to my peers and view several of them as superior to myself in skill. I look up to them and strive to be as good or better. Others ask me for help - which I always do my best to deliver on. You will truly be a self-made pro motion graphics success when you are at the point of being able to help others with your skills. People need professional motion graphics to communicate their ideas. They need someone who can help them communicate a concept to an audience. Be that person. Make it interesting and keep the audiences attention while brilliantly getting the message across in a way they can totally relate to. You will be beyond successful when you can (and do) train others to be successful in your craft. People who help others become successful have no choice but to be successful themselves. It's a law of the universe. The more people you can reach and help the more successful you will be. Money is just a measure of how many people you are helping. Look at anyone who is well known and successful in motion graphics and you'll see this to be a common denominator among them. They are all super helpful. You can only help a limited number of people with one on one hourly service. This will sustain you for several years and if you are doing a great job, you will make a name for yourself and people will seek you out for jobs and help learning what you do. With years of experience and knowledge in your craft behind you, also leave the knowledge you obtained in the form of a book or tutorial series to help people following behind you to get to your level. Don't wait till you retire to do this. Do this while you are still producing and share the knowledge of your journey with others. When you stop working, new methods will emerge and your books and videos will become outdated with time. Update the older ones as new methods replace the old. By writing a book or recording videos you can reach everyone who's looking for your solutions and help more people than you can imagine in your lifetime. And if your books and videos are good, they'll grow in popularity and help others that much more.

I started bidding jobs on what was at that time elance. Fortunately I got picked up by a group that I did a number of videos for. A few things that helped: That group gave me some templates, and I could work through them to understand how After Effects worked. You can easily get templates as well to help get started.I had training through Animation Mentor, which left me with a very good eye, and a good, solid set of skills in animation that I was able to apply to AE (character animation is decidedly more complex, so things like slow-in, slow-out were easy to control once I found where they are).I’m not big on using a lot of code or automation - I personally prefer to do everything manually - but I needed to find out where the code was being used in my templates and to understand how it worked.I looked at hundreds of examples so I understood what was possible, and I tried to imagine reverse-engineering some of what I saw. In some cases, I DID reverse-engineer it.I would only go to youtube or to articels to find specific answers to specific questions. I think Lynda is also quite good, but it’s expensive and I didn’t want to fool with it.For most people, I would say “just do it.” Don’t bother with a lot of school because it will only take longer to do it, unless the school invests a good deal of time helping you develop your thinking and your eye. To me, the thinking and the eye are the most important things, and AE is simply a tool to execute what you’re thinking about and looking for. Granted, AE is a complex tool, but if you understand layering and nesting, you’re at least 70% of the way there.

Of course you’ve viewed a “Hollywood film” (movie) recently, or from the last 60 years, right? Have you paid attention to the credits? Those, in very simple terms, are motion graphics, and need to be consciously and meticulously controlled to not only cross-fade or scroll in a readable manner, but to also complement the film’s style and theme. Of course, credits are not very glamorous, and are a very diluted form of motion graphics, or its Siamese twin sibling kinetic typography. Motion graphics, as a defined term, has an indeterminate origin in the 1800’s, but was explored in the film medium with the works of Walther Ruttmann, Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling, and Oskar Fischinger in the 1920’s. The impact and splash in Hollywood, though, would come through the work of Saul Bass and John Whitney. The former produced groundbreaking and award-winning title sequences for the films The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), Vertigo (1958), Anatomy of a Murder (1959), North by Northwest (1959), and Psycho (1960), and besides being a legendary graphic designer, is regarded as the godfather of motion title sequences in filmmaking. The latter collaborated with Bass often (especially on Vertigo), and founded the company Motion Graphics Incorporated, developing a mechanical analogue computer of his own design to tackle the task of animating typography, colors and shapes. Vertigo:  North by Northwest:  Of course, other filmmakers began employing graphic designers to develop engaging motion graphic title sequences. Harry Saltzman and Albert “Cubby” Broccoli made motion graphics famous with the James Bond:007 series, each opening with a new rendition of the same motion graphics construct:  Modern renditions of motion graphics include… Catch Me If You Can:  There’s a place for motion graphics within the film itself, from something as simple as a flipbook, like in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows…  … to something whimsical in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (one of my personal favorites):  and:  And then, there are some folks making incredible alternative motion graphic title sequences on their own that are incredibly convincing.

All of that makes a huge difference on what you end up buying and what will be the best computer for the job. One thing I can answer now is that if you are you want to use it for AE & C4D, the best CPU you can buy will be the one w/ the highest single threaded performance that has the most cores ( a minimum of 6). I always check the Passmark Single Thread Performance Chart as it is usually the most up-to-date w/ good amount of sample sizes. Currently the two best CPUs for that combo of software are Intel Core i9-7900X @ 3.30GHz and Intel Core i9-7920X @ 2.90GHz (Either one might be in the new iMac Pros coming out in December if that is your preference). Here is the comparison chart: CPU Performance Comparison[]=3035&cmp[]=3082 If you lean more towards the AE side or are split 50/50 I would say the i9–7900X is the better option. If you lean more on the C4D side and are using a CPU based renderer the I9–7920X is the better option. But probably a [Dual CPU] Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz or a [Dual CPU] Intel Xeon E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20GHz would be best. Checking out the MAXON Cinebench Ranking 15 Benchmark Scores - Cinebench R15 - Scores Database is also a good idea. The way I think about buying a computer is buy for the CPU and make sure you leave room to upgrade for your other parts. So you can start w/ 32–64 GB or RAM and go up from there. 512 SSD or m2 drive. For AE you are going to want a separate SSD for your cache and fast project drive (this can be a raid). GPUs, currently GTX 1080 TI is the best bang for your buck, however a Titan X might be more stable for AE. If you are nervous about building your own go to a reputable builder like: Puget Systems: Custom Computer Builder, Titan PC Workstations Best CAD Workstation PC Cyber Power Create the Custom Gaming PC and Laptop Computer of your dreams I hope that gives you a place to start for your research.

One way to hire a motion graphic designer is to ask your network for recommendations. This could be as simple as writing a post on LinkedIn saying that you’re looking for recommendations. This method is good as you’re able to get direct recommendations from people you know, however, you need to make sure they’re from people you trust and motion graphic designers that you can verify their qualifications and experience.Use a freelancer website. One of the quickest and easiest ways to hire a motion graphic designer is from one of the websites that connects freelancers with paid gigs like Twine, Upwork, PeoplePerHour etc. It’s worth remembering however that not all freelance websites vet their freelancers so you can’t be assured of their qualifications nor of the quality of their work and timely delivery. At Twine, we’ve put steps in place to tackle all three of these potential issues. For example, all of our freelancers are vetted before they’re accepted onto the platform to ensure we only have people of the highest quality. They also have to submit a portfolio of work and they have public reviews on their profile so you can see what it’s like to work with them directly from other businesses and individuals who have worked with them in the past. Twine also holds onto your payment until the work is complete, giving you protection that the freelancer cannot be paid until you have approved their final deliverables.Consider hiring a motion graphics agency. Another route would be to hire a motion graphics agency. A simple search through Google should allow you to find agencies near you and you’ll be able to see their reviews and testimonials. However, the downside of hiring a motion graphics agency is that generally, they’re much more expensive to use than simply hiring a freelancer because they have much larger overheads and more members of staff.Consider posting an ad on Craigslist. You could post an ad on a site like craigslist or similar to try and find a motion graphic designer. However with this option, there are less ways you’re able to vet the applicants' background or qualifications.I really hope this helps. Do let me know if you have any further questions. Thanks!

Watch some of your favorite movies and TV shows and pay particular attention to their opening / closing credits, and the role that they play in furthering the story (examples…end credits in Marvel movies, and opening credits on many Netflix shows). And look for examples of motion design that convey information using animation and voiceover, here's some examples: in a nutshell – kurzgesagt In a Nutshell, Kurzgesagt, youtube Design school isn't an absolute necessity, since there are so many tutorial resources available online.

And in school you’ll take courses in design theory will help you to be able to see the difference between good and bad design. Beware of taking out too much debt, however, since the earning power of designers is quite low the first few years after college. Look for a school with a good program at reasonable cost. Joining a designers association such as AIGA and attending workshops will help you develop an eye for design and inspire you to push past your limits and do better work once you’ve left school and joined the workforce. Never stop learning. If you’re passionate about what you do, this won’t be a problem. There may be times in your career when you feel burnt out, or have other priorities. At that point it’s OK to dial back your commitment a bit to take care of yourself. If you do that, you’ll return to your work refreshed and with a renewed sense of curiosity and thirst for discovery.

The rise of web video in the last several years has been in response to this intensified competition for people’s attention. Since that time, I've noticed a lot more motion graphics appearing on Facebook, YouTube and Vimeo. I'm not referring to demo reels or to to work created for broadcast or film, and uploaded to these platforms as an afterthought, but to work created specifically for these platforms. In particular, animated infographics that visually explain complex ideas are appearing left and right. A great example is the YouTube channel of a German company called Kurzgesagt, called, appropriately enough, ""In a Nutshell"" Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell I think we've already passed an inflection point that has made video central to our web experiences. YouTube (2005), Netflix on-Demand(2007), Amazon Prime(2006), and Hulu(2008), and the freedom of choice they've offered the consumer as a viable alternative to cable, made the idea of the web as a distribution platform mainstream. They’ve also contributed to the fragmentation of the marketplace and intensified the competition for eyeballs. With such a high level of clutter & complexity, demand for motion graphics services will only increase as companies attempt to break through the clutter to get their messages seen on the web, and motion graphics will become ever more central to companies’ brand building strategy. What sorts of companies will be the source of demand? I'd start with content marketers. If you go to websites dedicated to content marketing, you'll find that there are loads of discussions going on right now about web video. Here's an example: Which Animation Style is Best for Your Explainer Video? You can also look at companies that have a strong digital strategy that emphasizes advertising on YouTube and Facebook.

6041f9a3ed76476feda1a853,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-essential-skills-for-a-motion-graphic-designer?-,"There are several different categories and specialties in motion graphics that you can focus on. Deciding what is most interesting to you will determine what skills you need to learn. Do you want to do 2D explainer videos? 3D modeling, lighting, texturing, etc.? Hand drawing cel animation? I’m assuming you’re asking what are the essential skills to being a well-rounded generalist. Here are some good things to add to your repertoire: Storyboard sketching - You don’t have to draw like Aaron Blaise to be successful, but you do need to be able to quickly sketch out ideas to help clients understand and approve the direction you want to go before you invest a lot of time in building the project. Editing - my projects usually start and end in premiere pro. At the start, I create an animatic with my sketches. This is where decisions are made about pacing, how the music is going to cut together, etc. Design - The more design you can learn, the better. The best animation skills can’t compensate for a poorly laid out design. At the very least, have basic knowledge of photoshop and illustrator. Some animators prefer not to design and that’s ok. But you’ll need to know how to take the artwork a designer gives you and prep the files for animation. After Effects - learn this software inside and out. Study the principles of animation and particularly focus on learning the graph editor if you want to animate with 100% control over your keyframes. Cinema 4D - After effects comes with a lite version of C4D, but if you can afford to buy the studio version it is definitely worth it. As amazing as after effects is, it has it’s limitations. I could go on and on, but to wrap it up - if you have strong After effects skills, intermediate skills in premiere, illustrator and photoshop, and basic skills in cinema 4D, you’ll be pretty well rounded.",2021-03-05T09:28:03.109Z,"What are the essential skills for a motion graphic designer?

In some cases, I DID reverse-engineer it.I would only go to youtube or to articels to find specific answers to specific questions.

To me, the thinking and the eye are the most important things, and AE is simply a tool to execute what you’re thinking about and looking for.

If you can find a good niche and good product you can win easily. Finding niche is so easy. You can use Facebook Audience insights to figure out the audience size. And also be unique and different when figuring out the niche.Second I wanna tell you most is try to give more to the customer than expecting money from them. If you can give some quality stuff and better experience. You can easily get good amount of sale. Don't expect return first. You try to improve landing page experience. And also make them feel you're taking care of them so much. Reply to their email, comments and engage with them. Offer some discounts etc.,Most people struggling about Facebook ads and losing their money. But the actual thing is you need to understand Facebook is just a advertising platform. People come to Facebook entertain themselves not to buy. So you need to create a creative video or inage for your ad. Test multiple different types. And you should use the best working one. And also you should understand that you cannot spend 1000$ in a day and make 5000$ as you think. It takes lot pf time to figure out. Instead of finding winning product that sell 1000 product every day. You can find 10 product that sell 100 product each every day.Once you find the strategy that works for you. You can do it for long run and make some good amount of money. And I also again tell you. People expect some good amount of value from you. So you need to give them best. You can use email marketing or remarketing as others do and increase your presence. Branding your store instead of selling products give you high profit.You need to be updated with others , I mean you should spy them and find what they do for the success and also you should know their strategy and you need to do better than them.If you're getting started means. I suggest you to find a good mentor and learn from him. You should be clear finding your mentor because there's a lot of fake guru they haven't run a shopify before.

Shopify’s own Experts Directory is a good place to start, but it gives a pretty limited window into the opportunities available. What do you do?

The problem is, your competitors want to get a leg up on you too—if you want a better site than them, you need to hire shopify experts. Shopify’s own Experts Directory is a good place to start, but it gives a pretty limited window into the opportunities available. What do you do? Well, you know the old saying: you can have it fast, cheap or good but you can’t have all three. Start weighing up what’s more important to you: Fast: you need your site up yesterday. Your competitor already has the lead, and you need to get yourself moving as soon as possible. Often here, you want to look at teams with offices spread over multiple time zones: an international company can have its Shopify developers work in shifts, to get your storefront up as quickly as possible.Cheap: you’re on a budget. You’re a smart businessman, and you know smart business is about knowing where to spend and where to save. Again, it’s good to look internationally: outsourcing is a great way to save those extra pennies.Good: you’re willing to pay extra for quality. You want a boutique experience that will make your customers feel like kings. A quality UX is one of the hardest things to find, and requires real Shopify experts to pull off.Personally, when I need a Shopify developer, I go to CodeClouds. They’re a rare breed: fast, cheap and good. Most other developers wash their hands with a site as soon as they’re done with it, but their team of Shopify experts offered me support, maintenance and updates that keep my storefront on the bleeding edge. Their subscription billing model let me choose the deal that was right for me. Their company is based in India but has offices in the US, Australia and New Zealand that let you get the best of both worlds. It took me a long time to find the Shopify developer that was right for me, but it was definitely worth it in the end.",2021-03-05T12:19:30.415Z,"Who is the best Shopify expert? ",Quora

And also be unique and different when figuring out the niche.Second I wanna tell you most is try to give more to the customer than expecting money from them. If you can give some quality stuff and better experience. You can easily get good amount of sale. Don't expect return first. You try to improve landing page experience. And also make them feel you're taking care of them so much. Reply to their email, comments and engage with them. Offer some discounts etc.,Most people struggling about Facebook ads and losing their money. But the actual thing is you need to understand Facebook is just a advertising platform. People come to Facebook entertain themselves not to buy. So you need to create a creative video or inage for your ad. Test multiple different types. And you should use the best working one. And also you should understand that you cannot spend 1000$ in a day and make 5000$ as you think. It takes lot pf time to figure out. Instead of finding winning product that sell 1000 product every day. You can find 10 product that sell 100 product each every day.Once you find the strategy that works for you. You can do it for long run and make some good amount of money. And I also again tell you. People expect some good amount of value from you. So you need to give them best. You can use email marketing or remarketing as others do and increase your presence. Branding your store instead of selling products give you high profit.You need to be updated with others , I mean you should spy them and find what they do for the success and also you should know their strategy and you need to do better than them.If you're getting started means.

Longer answer: First separate the platform from the business model. Many people equate Shopify with drop shipping due to Shopify’s low barrier to entry both in terms of cost and technical knowledge. It’s very easy to use. It is also easy to list products from AliExpress on Shopify (more on this later). There are other platforms however that would perform equally well as a base for a drop shipping business such as BigCommerce, Magento or Wordpress with WooCommerce. Now to using the drop shipping business model to generate enough net profit to provide a comfortable living wage. Let’s assume that your target living “wage” is $10K per month (that would be very comfortable for alot of people). I’m going to rough out how you would get to this amount using two different drop shipping methods that can work below. I’ve been lucky enough to one on one coach over 200 drop ship business owners, I make the following observations based on this; Here’s where people go wrong with drop shipping and ultimately why so many people don’t find success with drop shipping; They believe it’s easy (this myth is peddled by a number of less than scrupulous online courses)They believe that you don’t need capital to be successfulThey don’t understand that they are really running a marketing businessThey either don’t or can’t be bothered to learn how to apply and master the marketing techniques that are a best fit for the products they want to sellThey don’t know how to pick the right products to sell using a drop shipping modelBroadly speaking here is what you need to master to reach $10K per month in net profit using drop shipping; Product and niche (market) selectionIntermediate web design (could be outsourced)Basic sales copywritingCustomer service (could be outsourced)How to pick the right marketing channels for your products (e.g. Google Adwords, Facebook Ads, Instagram)How to generate profitable sales using which ever marketing channels you pick from number 5.If you are choosing to produce most of your initial website traffic using paid traffic sources like Google Adwords or Facebook Ads then you should have a small amount of start up capital (e.g $3K - $5K). It is possible to do it with none but I have seen that done successfully very rarely.I would have to stress points 5 and 6, this is where most people fall down. If you want to market your products using Facebook Ads for example you need to develop strong knowledge in how to successfully run Facebook Ads. If you don’t you will fail. Now here’s two models of drop shipping that can be used successfully in 2017. Here’s an overview; High Value Dropshipping using local suppliers This method involves identifying a specific niche market and set of products in the country you want to sell in. Generally you would aim for products that retail for $500 USD or more. My example could be that I want to sell wine fridges (also known as wine coolers) to wine lovers in the United States. Here’s an example of such a product  While there are cheap wine fridges the average is probably around $1000 USD. I would source my products from suppliers of wine fridges based in the US. My target market would only be wine lovers based in the US. I would market these products using a combination of Google Adwords, Facebook, organic traffic (SEO) and email. If I know what I am doing I should be able to generate sales at cost of $50 or less (this includes platform and transaction fees). The average gross profit margin for this type of drop shipping is 30%. So if I sell at $1000 I will be buying the product at $700. I then minus my $50 cost of sale and I am left with $250. This equation may vary depending on whether you are offering free shipping or not. So if I can make $250 per sale, to reach $10K per month I need to sell 40 wine fridges or about 1.3 per day. Not that hard. Keep in mind also that wine fridges can retail for up to $3K+ so if I sell a couple at that price point I need to sell even less per month. I personally use this model and I have seen many others do it successfully. I’ve also seen a lot of people fail at it. Low Value Dropshipping The second method of drop shipping that could generate $10K in your pocket per month is low value dropshipping. This is the method that most people are talking about at the moment and most people equate with Shopify and drop shipping. In this method you are selecting products in the impulse buy zone. Maybe $20 - $40 USD. A price point that people don’t need to think to hard about. The idea is to source those products at a very low price so that your profit margin is much higher. To achieve this most people turn to manufacturers in China via AliExpress. I mentioned earlier that Shopify is popular with people operating this model. This is because it is extremely easy to list products from AliExpress to your Shopify store using an app called Oberlo. In this model you might be buying a product for $4USD and selling it for $25USD with free shipping from China to your customer. So your goal here is to acquire customers at a price that leaves you a profit from the margin of $21USD.  I might sell something like these little hip bags. I would go through a similar process as with high value drop shipping. Identify a target audience and market products to them based on their interest. There are four things that are particularly crucial to making this model of drop shipping successful; Identifying your target audience and their interests.Picking the right product to suit your identified target audience. Many products are duds from a quality perspective and many are already being flogged to death.Being able to acquire traffic at the right price. It is most common to use Facebook/Instagram to market you products. You can only find success if you properly understand how to use these platforms. This takes time, practice and a little bit of money.Having upsells to squeeze more money out of each customer. This could be onsite or via email.In this example I should be able to walk away from each sale with at least $8 net profit. If I was selling just this one item I would have to sell 1250 per month to get to my $10K profit. Sounds like a lot but I wouldn’t just be selling this one product. I would have a range of upsells and other products to double or triple the value of many orders. What I’ve outlined above are very broad and limited explanations. A lot more goes into making either model of drop shipping successful. The crux is however that drop shipping can work and quite well. But like every business model more people will fail than succeed. Many people at the moment like to prattle on that “drop shipping is dead”. They are wrong. I will clarify that as well as coaching people who run drop shipping businesses I also have run and sold my own drop shipping businesses for the last 4 years. I hope this helps.",2021-03-05T12:33:00.507Z,"Would a Shopify expert or partner consider a bot builder company for partnership? ",Quora

Shopify’s own Experts Directory is a good place to start, but it gives a pretty limited window into the opportunities available. What do you do? Well, you know the old saying: you can have it fast, cheap or good but you can’t have all three. Start weighing up what’s more important to you: Fast: you need your site up yesterday. Your competitor already has the lead, and you need to get yourself moving as soon as possible. Often here, you want to look at teams with offices spread over multiple time zones: an international company can have its Shopify developers work in shifts, to get your storefront up as quickly as possible.Cheap: you’re on a budget. You’re a smart businessman, and you know smart business is about knowing where to spend and where to save. Again, it’s good to look internationally: outsourcing is a great way to save those extra pennies.Good: you’re willing to pay extra for quality. You want a boutique experience that will make your customers feel like kings. A quality UX is one of the hardest things to find, and requires real Shopify experts to pull off.Personally, when I need a Shopify developer, I go to CodeClouds. They’re a rare breed: fast, cheap and good. Most other developers wash their hands with a site as soon as they’re done with it, but their team of Shopify experts offered me support, maintenance and updates that keep my storefront on the bleeding edge. Their subscription billing model let me choose the deal that was right for me. Their company is based in India but has offices in the US, Australia and New Zealand that let you get the best of both worlds.

Dropshipping stores in general have a massive fail rate. 29/30 will not profit within 6 months. Most people quit. It’s very possible to make it in dropshipping, if you are willing to put in the time and passion needed for it. The advantage you get is that you have $2000 to put towards paid advertising which can make or break you. $2000 can go a long ways to advertising 3–4 products using Instagram Influencer Marketing and Facebook Re-Targeting ads. I would spend about 4–6 months learning about Instagram Influencer Marketing and Facebook Ads before jumping into it. I’ve seen people pay $2000 on ads and generate 0 sales. If you don’t know what you are doing, you are setting yourself up for failure. Another option is to use that money to teach yourself, first hand how to market. $2000 should be enough if spread thinly for you to get some experience in Ads and learn targeting, and the various methods of Facebook Advertising. But then you’ll need to come up with more money once you’re confident enough in your abilities to put it use. During all this, you can still start your store. There are many free methods of advertising you can do to start building up your content, SEO, and brand trust. Post on Facebok, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest of your own 2–3 times a day, each and every day consistently. You can write a blog post each and every day. This will slowly build up your brand while you figure out the paid advertising of things. The other option is hiring a marketing expert. But even some of them fail, and you’d be spending $800–900 in service costs and only have $1100–1200 left for actual Advertising content. And that’s for an amateur marketer. Professional marketers who have more experience and better chance of making you sales easily cost $3000–4000 a month or more in service fees. But you’ll want to be spending $12,000 or more in Ads to be worth it for them. Finally, you can hire a coach. Someone to teach you how to spend that $2000 on ads. Much better than learning it yourself. You’ll probably pay them $400–800 in coaching fees and use that $1200 on ads, but you’ll have learned more, learned faster than doing it by yourself, you probably will generate sales too using a coach where you might not doing it by yourself.

Just because you're excited about a hot new product doesn't necessarily mean that there will be other people out there in sufficient numbers who share your excitement. Second, you have to drive the right traffic. In other words, you have to know where people who are interested in your product hang out online and get their eyeballs to your shop. This is easier said than done. A lot of people think that you just need to slap on an ad at Facebook and that's that, No, You have to know their interests. You have to psychologically profile them, you have to understand how their minds work to get to where they are on Facebook. That's how it works. Finally, and most importantly, you need to have the right product descriptions. It breaks my heart to tell you this but a lot of people who are able to finally figure out how Facebook works and gets one penny clicks. from American consumers end up dropping the ball. Why? They master Facebook, but they screw up when it comes to their Shopify store. Now from the looks of it, it seems that they did everything right. They have the right pictures. The online store seems to be set up properly, everything's formatted well. There's something missing. The product descriptions are copied and pasted from the manufacturer. In other words, it says if they found a fishing spot where fish are just jumping out of the water and ready to bite anything, but they drop their line with a hook that has the wrong bait. It is no surprise that these Shopify store owners fail to make the kind of money they could be making. They drop the ball where it matters most. They screwed up their product descriptions. Thankfully, you don't have to commit this error. You can put in the time, effort and energy to write product descriptions to work. You need to get into the minds of your target audience members and really appeal to their needs. This takes months. If you're a lousy writer to begin with it can even take years. Thankfully, there is a shortcut. You can hire expert product description writers who have a track record of success like Gene Eugenio to write solid product descriptions for you.

Shopify has all of the structures you need to start your business. Shopify is packed with tools to launch a website in minutes, and you don't have to be concern about self-hosting or buying a domain name from a third party. In that regard, you could call it the flawless out-of-the-box solution built with pricing plans this applies to both small starter businesses and businesses that bring in millions of dollars in sales. Step 1: Register with Shopify The first step in creating your Shopify store, which is also the easiest. To use Shopify, you just need to register. Navigate to the Shopify website and click the 'Get Started Now' button. Enter your desired e-mail address, your password, and your shop name. Remember that you need to choose an available name for your shop; otherwise, Shopify won't allow you to buy the domain. After you click Next, let Shopify know about yourself by indicating how much you intend to sell and if you are already selling. Click the 'Go to My Shop' button when you're done. You will then be asked in which industry you want to operate your online shop. If you do not want to select an industry, click on 'Skip'. On the following page, you will be asked to enter personal information such as your name, address, and phone number, all of which are used to configure currencies and tax rates. Step 2: Add Items to your Shopify store. Once you've properly registered with Shopify, the software will take you straight to the administration screen of your new website. This is where you can start customizing your store and uploading products for your customers to flip through. If you go to your Shopify backend, it shows a nice step-by-step process on how to fully set up your shop. The first button asks you to add a product. It is recommended that you start with this. You can enter details such as title, description, price, and supplier and complete the product page as you wish. Make sure you save the product in the end. It makes sense to choose images that appeal to your target audience in order to increase sales opportunities. Don't make the mistake of underestimating the importance of the visual design of your website. You can also put together collections or product groups according to your individual needs. For example, if you run a clothing website, you could set up a page dedicated specifically to men's clothing or specifically to shoes and accessories. With Shopify, you can ensure that the same products appear in several different collections, making it easier than ever for your customers to find the items they want. When you add a collection to your Shopify store, you can choose how you want the products to appear on your page. For example, you can have products that meet certain criteria automatically added to your shop. Step 3: Customize your Shopify website. Go back to the administration screen and select the 'Customize Your Website' button. In this section, you will be asked to customize everything from logos to colors. This takes a little tinkering, but the main part that you want to focus on is the link that prompts you to visit the theme store. This is where you can browse through the hundreds of themes in Shopify to make your website look great. While free themes are great, premium themes can be very engaging. Premium themes come with additional modifications. So, if you want to dive into the smallest details of what your website looks like, then it might be a good idea to pay a little extra for a professional theme. You will find that you can make a ton of customizations to the look and feel of your website when you access the CSS and HTML aspects of the theme. Some of the things you can change about your Shopify theme: · Select fonts · Set the color scheme · Products that appear on the page · Related Element Functionality · Upload homepage slider slides · Upload logos There are plenty of Shopify experts out there who specialize in product descriptions, Shopify themes, email marketing, and much more. You can use the Shopify expert community for almost anything. Step 4: Set up your domain with Shopify. After you've chosen your template and designed your website the way you want, it's time to choose a domain to go live with your website. Go back to the dashboard and click 'Add Domain Now'. You will be asked whether you want to transfer a domain or register a new domain. Select the domain you want and follow the steps to purchase. You'll also need to specify which Shopify payment method you want to proceed with. You can either buy a domain from Shopify and have it added directly to your store, or you can buy your domain name elsewhere and add it to Shopify - it's entirely up to you. However, you will need to update your DNS records if you want to upload an existing name. After activation, your website can be accessed under your chosen domain. Step 5: Activate your payment methods. Click the tab to the left of the dashboard labeled Payments. In this section, you can choose from dozens of payment methods such as Stripe and Authorize..net. Shopify also has its own payment method - Shopify Payments, which is very easy to implement. Follow the steps to activate your payment method. This enables you to accept payments and deposit them into an account. Step 6: Check last shop information When you are in the main section of your Shopify website, make sure that the following information is complete: · General Information: Leave all of your information in the settings section completely filled in, including your billing information and legal details. · Taxes: Make sure the box next to “Calculate Taxes” is checked in the Variants section of your website to help you with your bookkeeping. · Shipping: You need to click the 'Shipping Required' option next to the products so you know which products require additional postage and packaging. Remember to either choose a weight-based shipping method or something that will help you sell as many products as possible. Creating a business with Shopify is relatively easy and inexpensive. In addition, there are verified Shopify partners who can help you with the setup, individual adjustments, and optimization of your Shopify business. Creating an online shop with Shopify is so simple that anyone can start their own online shop. In my opinion, Shopify is one of the best for a company that is just starting out with an online store.

So if you own a business and let us consider for the moment, a small business that has limited product variation and counts, it is one of the preferred ways in today's date to proceed with a simple Shopify store. The User-Interface and experience that this SaaS-based platform provides are very handy and you won't find too much trouble understanding the knick and tricks on how to basically use the platform and set up a good-to-go store. The core idea as on why this platform was built would clear the fact that it was meant to provide the various merchants and businesses with a place where they can build their online presence and sell their products and services online. Considering the merchants and business owners to be a part of their end users, they created a platform that is easy to setup and use. Thus, Shopify provides benefits to all its users alike. So if you are an amateur or newbie looking for ways to establish your store online, Shopify is one of the easiest possible ways on how to do it so. BUT, these are the facts that weigh up more for the asked question, where more emphasis is on the fact that whether one can USE Shopify for his/her store set up without any need of web developer skills. So why is there a need for web development skills to run a store on Shopify? Before we put up a valid answer to this, let us look at some related facts first! 1. Shopify has nearly 800,000+ merchants and this number is on a constant rise!  2. The best way to take advantage of technology is to use technology itself!  The very first factor puts up enough emphasis on the fact that if you really need to make a difference in the market, you will have to try something different. The only thing that exists here is to make good leverage of technology for doing so.  Fortunately, there are a variety of technological benefits that Shopify provides by itself such as custom themes, mobile application creation for your store and various other extensions to enhance your store applicability for users. And in order to make a feasible and workable impact of the use of Shopify, you will need to hire an expert Shopify developer to do make use of all these benefits. To create an online presence that replicated your business, you will need to have a proper store developed from an expert and for that, you would need to hire an expert. As a business owner, if you have this strong feeling that going online can be helpful for your business, the benefits of hiring an expert Shopify developer are endless. You can customize the look of your store - from the visual design to the back-end extensions. You can connect a variety of your brick and mortar store elements with your online store! Moreover, this all can come to you at a price that is cheaper than buying the actual elements from Shopify itself.   To conclude it all, if you are talking about 'using' Shopify for your store, you wouldn't be needing any high-end software development skills, but if you are seeking to make an impact with it, you might want to hire an expert Shopify developer in order to get your website developed.

If they demonstrate expertise and commitment with the very first answer to your inquiry, strongly consider them.
