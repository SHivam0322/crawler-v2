My best platform is different, these are the requirements for me and maybe for some of you, so I can develop my app very fast and also go deep when things get sophisticated (my experience says, it always gets sophisticated eventually). No blocking when I want to do some advanced stuff,No proprietary languages or technologies,Support favorite UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular etc)Open Source ModelMicro service supportNo pre-compile or code generation, immediate previews and deploymentDeploy anywhere (AWS, GCP, Azure or any Kubernetes cluster) with one clickFull featured web based IDE without any browser plug-insTeam support, Live collaboration and version controlNo code support for basic development (forms, grids, dashboards, workflows, notifications)Advanced Access ControlMobile UI supportSo far, Code2.io (was iCodeBetter) is the only solution that I could find for my needs. Main Page of Code2, you can jump into the wizards without writing any code and you can start building your business app.  You can always see what you’re doing and how the tables, queries, forms and grids are related to each other. If you are developing a big project, it will save your time and mind. It visualizes all the impact analysis for you.  You can always see your ER diagrams and tables. Code2 generates DDL scripts for you, but if you’re an advanced developer, you can customize those scripts and put extra indexing and partitioning parameters.  You can see the wireframes of your forms. You real forms are in your favourite UI framework. Yes, Code2 stores everything in metadata, so you can see your UI in your own choice (React, Vue, Angular or ExtJS) and you change it and its templates anytime you like. You can also manage best practice conditional statements from the wireframe previews.  Every business project requires Access Control List, sometimes it gets very complex, so you need a tool manage those things. In Code2, you can manage everything from IDE and track it visually. Row based or column based ACL is a just few clicks away. Btw, everything you set here applies both for your frontend and backend side.  Although Code2 generates responsive UI pages for you, you can also create more mobile oriented user experiences by leveraging Code2’s mobile UI capabilities. You can also convert these mobile UIs to a native application.  You can also manage your Kubernetes cluster inside Code2. You can monitor, deploy or change its parameters.  Managing APIs and integrations are also realities of all business software. In Code2, you can create your APIs from your business objects, but also integrate external APIs by just importing Swagger (OpenAPI) or Google Discovery Documents with a click.  I cannot say Code2 is for everyone, but if you are looking for a platform that helps you develop really fast and when things get sophisticated and you need advanced deeper interaction with platform, Code2 is the real winner.

60428402ed76476feda225a6,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-usage-of-a-no-code-development-platform?-,"Disclaimer: I’m the creator and head architect of a No-Code platform, as well as the company’s CEO. Having said that, I will try to be as unbiased as possible. No-Code platforms, of course, take the code away from programming. But what they don’t take away is the LOGIC behind the coding. The element of conditionals, loops, structures, etc. remain. No-Code platforms are also aimed at a certain segment of the market. Our platform, for example, is aimed to business applications, therefore, completely useless for, let’s say, game development. But with a No-Code platform, I can build a product over 10 times faster than programming it the traditional way. Sure, I have more constraints, but most companies are willing to live with those constraints than spending much more money into traditional development (yes, it gets expensive), and get results much faster (again, 10 times faster or more means you can get to operate faster). But, again, No-Code is not a standard. Not all No-Code platforms aim for the same target market nor do the same. There is no alchemy. As any other technology, they are tools, not magic wands, nor useful for every situation. They will not displace traditional programming, but they are there to fill a space where time and money saved is an issue. In our case, we are really proud and happy fo the tool we’ve created. Our customers really love it. But we are not to create a “No-Code trend” or “No-Code religion”. We have our space in the market. And we are happy with it. We built an awesome tool for the market segment who needs it, and we stand by that. Is it better than traditional programming? Well, again, it’s about WHEN and WHERE you use it. There is no magic behind “No-Code”. There’s no “Holy Grail”. Some people see our product and they claim to be amazed. And that’s cool! But we did not build it to amaze people, but to HELP people and help businesses. I hope this explanation is clear enough. I’m open for comments and questions, of course. I’ll be happy to answer any of those.",2021-03-05T19:18:26.929Z,"What is the usage of a no-code development platform? ",Quora

I work for API Fortress and we build an API testing platform you can script without actual code (but you can use code if needed). We built this code-less feature in the platform to help people that are not particularly skilled with code, or without any code experience at all, to build API tests. However, when things get really nasty, some code here and there becomes inevitable, and my feeling is that with these code-less platforms, things follow the very same process. Sure, you can drag this and drop that, the platform can give you guidance, but the objective needs to be suitable and not too particular to stay “code-free”. We’ve seen this happening before. RAD (rapid application development) for applications and, most of all, websites have been out there for a very long time and they worked, but I don’t seem them working out for complex applications or complex websites, unless you can inject your code wherever needed. Now I may be totally wrong and point me in the right direction if I am, but I suspect this is going to happen to this “new” industry as well.

The moment you need a special feature you are forced to build custom code. Integrating that code can take longer and cost more than a bespoke solution.Every platform seems to lack something important. One of them for example lacked the ability to create proper API connections which severely limits its potential. One normally hits their boundaries quite quickly.The fact that there is little to no coding doesn't mean anyone can do it. Oddly, I found that you still needed to understand programming quite well in order to use the platforms effectively.Last year I was asked to develop an app that was started on a low code platform. The original app got stuck because it needed some custom Javascript. Using Python and Flask with Bootstrap allowed me to develop a full custom solution with some twisty requirements in about four weeks.

But if you think about it making $100K per year for putting in 80 hours a week or more isn’t really that great. But that’s the way it goes. Not only that but it really doesn’t matter how good you are. You will be discriminated against because of your age. But hey if you are young and talented get it while you can. I was very, very fortunate when I was a young software engineer to learn how to invest. The couple of weeks I spent learning (pre-internet) permitted me to retire very early. Those couple of weeks meant more to our ability to retire early than my graduate degree from a top engineering school - because they don’t teach you how to handle money. The money I made went into a diversified portfolio of stocks and stayed there with the dividends re-invested. My advice to you is to try to find work at something other than a state of the art high tech company. Almost all companies need software developers and whatever your skill set someone will need code written or maintained. At 42 if you can get into somewhere and thoroughly understand their legacy code you will become irreplaceable. They won’t be pressuring you to meet new product deadlines and they will pay you a fair salary. Just make sure you learn how to invest. Because I am feeling generous I will tell you EVERYTHING you will ever need to know about investing right now. Put as much money as you can away in 401ks, IRAs, HSAs and Roth IRAs. Whatever you can. All of this money goes in with nice tax treatments. If your company offers a matching IRA no matter what make sure to put in enough to get the maximum match. Try to keep at least 6 months worth of expense money in a high interest checking account to deal with day to day stuff. Live within your means. You do not need a flashy car or to drink $5 Starbuck fru-fru drinks every day. Keep debt down. The only substantial debt we have ever incurred is mortgages. And if you do have a mortgage pay it off as quick as you can. Your investment choices for all of it: Total Stock Market Fund or EFT with lowest expenses Total Bond Market Fund or EFT with lowest expenses That’s it. The only thing you need to vary is the percentages in each. I’d start with 60% stock, 40% bond and adjust to more stock if you can tolerate risk or less stock if you are risk adverse. 60/40 is typical. Don’t lookk at the stock market news. It will even out in the long run. Re-balance your investments every 13 months or so. Good luck. Software is a young persons game. Companies do not want to hire people like you because you are unlikely to be willing to put in the long hours that younger people (who typically have a more up to date skill set any way) will. If you look around great high tech companies you see things like free meals, game rooms and various other amenities. These flashy benefits appeal to younger software developers who are pressured into working large numbers of hours for “great” salaries and flashy benefits.

60428fb8ed76476feda22cdb,https://www.quora.com/How-is-super-computing-code-developed?-,"Every supercomputer these days is a cluster of many nodes. Jobs that need all the nodes at once are probably rare, so there will be multiple jobs running at once. This actually depends a little on policy. Some clusters encourage large jobs, other treat them as an exception. For instance, Argonne National Lab encourages large runs and discourages smaller once. On the other hand, on Stampede you can easily get an account that allows you to run 256 nodes (4096 cores) but for larger you have to submit proof that you know what you're doing. My point is that if you have an account on a supercomputer, you don't necessarily get the whole machine: you get a subset of the nodes. And so you can do a limited run to test your code before you use a large number of nodes. You may never even use the whole machine. I think the question also speaks to a limited understanding of how codes on a supercomputer are structured. The vast majority of them use the MPI library to achieve parallelism, which means that an instance of your program runs on each node, and these instances talk to each other through teh MPI library. So you test your code by limiting your data set and running on a small number of nodes. You may even develop and test on your laptop or desktop. Putting it differently: the size of the cluster you're using is a simple startup parameter of your code. Depending on the nature of your input data and such, you can run your same code on a small number and a large number of nodes. The main difference is that with many nodes your simulation can be faster, or more precise.",2021-03-05T20:08:24.271Z,"How is super computing code developed? ",Quora

By looking at input data and out put results the coder’s efficiencies are evaluated. Now the question is, since we are not hard coding anymore with AI infiltration, will the job market shrink for coders? It appears as though the programming jobs will be taken over. However, the truth is, programmers are liberated from manual coding drudgery and can focus on finer aspects that satisfy the market. Here is a simple example, today’s website builders hard code everything. The result is many websites are either horrible at worst or mediocre at best and most fall far below customer expectations. One simple change requires a series of meetings followed by coding plans, implementation plans and it is highly time consuming inefficient work we are doing. No wonder the results are always far below customer expectations. Come AI, the situation is different. Now, the coder will feed zillions of websites and human behavior in those sites to the AI, and AI will come out with a thousand possible solutions. Now the coder is empowered with so many workable solutions and have to pick the right one. The coder now has to tweak the right data and get the best out of AI. The coders of the future have less coding to do and more power in their hands as they are coding the AI to behave as expected. It will be both challenging and self satisfying work. The results will be satisfying for the consumer also. Which means the market expectation will go higher. Human standard of living will be much higher in the world of AI. I believe, most of the websites will be revamped once we get out of the manual coding nightmare and get the intelligent AI to redesign these websites so they are user friendly. Which means we are looking at Zillions of sites to be reworked by AI and the coders are busy at it with the customer expectations growing exponentially. We are looking at building a smarter Internet. This is just one example, however, similar challenges and opportunities exists in other sectors as well, taking our standard of living much higher.

60428ff3ed76476feda22d0f,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-low-code-development?-,"For the new or modern app development, speed is one of the essential components one seeks. The business demands new solutions faster than ever. The problem is, IT is already overworked. Today, let’s explore the concept of #1 low-code development, and I’ll try to explain how it helps developers solve this problem. Today, I’ll uncover a few ways that provide #1 low code platform, and could benefit your business. 1. Speeding up the process. Speed is the greatest and most obvious benefit of the low-code approach. With a low-code platform, developers can create new applications in a few hours or days, rather than weeks or months. Rather than waiting around on IT to develop their reports, business users can create them on their own. 2. Boost’s IT productivity (without expanding the team) Genuinely speaking, development projects go through the IT department. However, they also handle maintenance, software & hardware, the company network, and more. As a result, they’re stuck in a no-win situation: They can’t dedicate all of their resources to completing development projects, and the business can’t afford to hire new staff. How do low-code development tools help? While they do improve development speed (as mentioned above), they also help IT departments offload some development projects to the business. They let business users create basic applications without coding. 3. Prevents Shadow IT As mentioned above, Shadow IT is a growing problem. When business users don’t get the solutions they need from the IT department, they search for their own solutions. With the rise of easily available SaaS options, these solutions aren’t hard to find. How can IT give the users the solutions they need without compromising security? That’s where low-code development platforms come into play. They give users the ability to create their own solutions while letting IT control the data and user access. 4. Keeps you updates with new features Application development has evolved remarkably over the past few years. New languages and frameworks have emerged. Mobile devices have drastically changed application development. The new developer must have a variety of skills and stay ahead of the changing tech trends. Low-code development platforms offer a simple solution. In many cases, they can connect this skills gap–giving developers modern capabilities. Best example that can be considered is mobile, Low code tools let developers build for all platforms, without the need to learn about mobile development. 5. Reduces project failure Earlier, application development projects took a “waterfall” approach. Developers collect requirements from the users and then create the entire application to fit those requirements. The problems with this method: Speed and communication. The project often took weeks or months to complete. During that time, there was little or no communication between developers and users that didn’t let user clearly communicate their requirements. Or, maybe the developers misunderstood the user’s goals. Low-code tools help resolve these problems, as they help developers create applications more quickly. As a developer can quickly mock up an application and get user feedback before dedicating weeks of time to develop. These are just 5 benefits of #1 low code development platform according to me, but the list could certainly be longer. If you would like to add anything to this list, I’d love to hear it.

Core Java SE itself is pretty big, and adding JEE for completeness will require you to learn a dependency injection framework, a persistence framework, messaging framework, and a services framework. All of these are available in core Java plus JEE, but in the wider industry, you’ll see implementations of those frameworks that you’ll also want to learn (Spring, Hibernate, TopLink, ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Apache HTTP, Kafka, etc.). In order to do the work above, you’ll need to learn the scripting/configuration language of at least one build tool—Maven, Gradle, Ant, etc. You’ll also need to learn SQL and JPQL to do anything with persistence. Finally, you’ll need to learn one or more source control systems (which is more of a command-line tool than a language, but it’s so important, I figured I’d better mention it). The vast majority of Java software is written to serve web pages. In order to serve that effectively, you’ll want to learn HTML and JavaScript, and maybe the conventions in JSP and JSF (java server pages; java server faces). Day-to-day work requires that you do a lot of repetitive things. For that, you need to learn the scripting language of your operating system—these days, bash or Windows PowerShell. You don’t need to be a master, but you need to know how to get things done. The world is very very big, and unless you want to try to learn everything yourself, learn how to do really effective Google or Bing searches. Learn their whole search language—not just “type words in the blank”. It’s not hard, but it’s a key skill if you want to be effective. You’ll want to learn other things along the way as well, but with those items under your belt, you’ll have enough core language experience to get a job as a mid-level to senior java developer (depending on your design and interpersonal skills).",2021-03-05T20:10:38.840Z,"Do you want Java code development?

As a fairly typical example, the IP policy of Carnegie Mellon is here: Intellectual Property - University Policies - Carnegie Mellon University (This policy dates from 1985, and probably should be updated to reflect new developments, both in technology — increasingly valuable datasets and corpora, for example — and changing requirements of various sponsors in government and industry. As it happens, I played a fairly central role in producing the first draft of this policy, but then it went through a lot of debate and revision, and then “lawyer-ization”, so there are some bits of it that I don’t especially like.) A very quick summary of the CMU policy, as it would pertain to the case you asked about: The default is that IP resulting from a student’s research — copyright on papers, code, and the thesis document and any (rare) patents arising from the work — belong to the student. However, the university gets a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty free license to use the work. There are lots of exceptions (see below).Work for hire — basically, as part of paid employment, the user creates something specifically requested as part of the job — belongs to the employer.If the student’s work is externally sponsored — for example, done as a Research Assistant with funding from government or industry — any specific agreement with that sponsor covering IP rights takes precedence. In the case of federal funding (DARPA, NSF), the usual case is that the federal government (all parts of it) gets a non-exclusive license to use the resulting IP.For federally-funded projects, ownership and control of the work is generally granted back to the university, and not to the individual creators. This has been the cause of some friction in the past (though CMU seems to be much better now when it comes to respecting the creator’s wishes).It is the responsibility of the university and the faculty advisor to inform the student of any IP restrictions that come along with the student’s funding.For some inventions owned by the student, the student may ask the university to “develop” the invention, which means obtaining any patents and handling any licensing agreements. The university may or may not agree to this — they have to see enough value in the work. University-developed work is owned by the university, but the creator(s) generally get 50% of the net profits.For IP developed with “substantial” use of university resources, but not otherwise encumbered, the university gets a 15% cut of net profits. This provision was put in back when computer time was really expensive, and seldom applies today, at least for student-developed code. Work that made significant use of a university wet-lab, for example, might still fall under this provision.“Substantial” means that the value of the resources used, if rented from some outside party, would cost more than about $12,000 in todays dollars, so anything done on a university-supplied laptop or desktop machine, or modest use of a server farm, would not fall into this category.Textbooks and other writings, not including code, are (following a well-established academic tradition) the author’s property.That’s just an overview of CMU’s policy. Some other universities are significantly more restrictive. Read the policy for your own university to see what their rules are, and consult a lawyer if you’re getting into something that (you hope) will form the basis for your (soon to be) billion dollar startup company.",2021-03-05T20:12:06.548Z,"Do algorithms and code developed by PhD students in their dissertations belong to them or the university?

It’s at the point now, where people with barely any coding experience who type with 2 pointer fingers can write a full stack app in a matter of weeks. Everything is so ridiculously easy compared to the past…I don’t see where no/low code solutions even fit in. There are people that literally just Google and StackOverflow their way to a full app in weeks/months. Not even kidding. And those are fully customizable apps built from the ground up with code. I’m not saying that low/no code solutions are worthless. I do think they add value to a certain narrow audience. However, in an industry that is already perfectly fine letting “kids” write full apps for them in code, I don’t see how no/low code solutions are going to change things. Remember, no one gets paid by lines of code written. People are paid for their time. In the long run, a low/no code solution doesn’t save time, especially since there are similar pre-made solutions that you can drop in that DO use code. So, if I can just drop in something that someone else made, I’d rather have the code because customizations are quick and easy and I can see how it works. If I have to use no/low code solutions then I just don’t have that kind of insight/access to what’s going on. In the long run I just don’t see it making a big impact. Can you even imagine a single big tech app of today using a solution like that? I can’t. I’ve worked for some of them…they won’t even use cross-platform. They are purists.

Easily discern which LOW-CODE platforms are duds and which ones are growing fast. 1- First step find your way to their website. Look for a PRICING link? If you don’t see it at the top, it may be at the very bottom of the page, where all the other site links are listed. Sometimes you may have to step through their menu bar to find the pricing page. If you see, REQUEST A DEMO, instead of pricing, then you KNOW the price is going to be outrageous, and only affordable to well funded development teams. 2- If they do have their pricing tiers listed, the next most important thing to ask yourself is this. Does this price include UNLIMITED USERS or will you have to PAY PER USER. When I see pay-per-user, this tells me this technology is just too slow for wide scale adoption. ALSO, way too expense for anything I might want to market. 3- Next is the all important FORUM. Look for a Forum. If the don’t have a forum, this means the technology is just too buggy. If it wasn’t buggy, a forum would allow the existing user base, to support new users and save a lot of support costs. But if the platform is buggy, they can certainly keep this from the public, by not having a PUBLIC FORUM. 4- Then you must look and see what kind of TRAFFIC is happening on this forum? You want to see dozens of posts a day. Not two or three a week. And you want to see how long it takes before questions are answered. Look at the answers. Are they viable and posted by enthusiastic users. Or… are all the answers posted by one company support rep. 5- Finally, if all else looks good, go ahead and join the forum. Post some questions, even if you haven’t even taken the time to get hands on for evaluation of the platform quite yet. See how well you are treated. The way inexperienced NEWBIES ARE TREATED will tell you a lot about how easy or difficult if will be getting up to speed on this new platform.UPDATE: Finally… I have found the BEST no-code platform.

60429358ed76476feda23012,https://www.quora.com/How-does-no-code-app-development-work?-,"To explain how no-code app development works, I will give a quick overview of what standard app development looks like. To develop the app with the ""standard way"", we need to have experienced developer(s) who will write the app from scratch, part by part. Developers sometimes use ready code or samples and adjust them to their needs. But mainly developing the apps means to write code for them and test it. In no-code approach developers use specific software (ex. Bubble, Pega etc), which allow them to create app on a very high-end level by using ready-to-use components.That means that they don't write the code (ex. database set up, custom interface) - the software is constructed this way, that it allows you to drag & drop needed modules,choose interface elements from built-in ones and set any features by just marking the checkboxes. It's like building with Lego :) : - in standard development you need to create blocks, check if they are well-done and compatible and set them up to create a thing - in no-code development you get some pack of blocks and everything you need to do is to put them in place. Of course, there are advantages and disadvantages of both methods, in many cases, we can achieve similar results from both. But we need to keep in mind that no-code solutions have their limitations.Also to achieve the higher quality in no-code solution advance professionals (experts in no-code tools) are needed - they are expensive as this is a niche position right now.Next thing to keep in mind is paid subscription for the tool. All considerations come together to one thing: How much custom-made should be the app? If this is app, which features and construction are common, you can go ahead and develop it in no-code approach. But when you need the tailor-made app, which has uncommon features, construction and security, it would be better to use the standard approach.

And most of that work is “reinventing the wheel”, “stepping on each others’ toes”, “at cross-purposes” etc. How much Not Invented Here syndrome do we see? Or “me too” reinventions of frameworks and tools. Because someone didn’t know that a perfectly good solution already existed? I have so many ideas for things I want to write. We have so much powerful software available. Stacks of libraries upon libraries upon operating system services that already do 99.99% of what I want to do. And yet … when I sit down to write something … I can imagine the algorithms for the genuinely new part and probably sketch them out in an afternoon in a few dozen lines of code. And EVERYTHING ELSE, the “unnecessary complexity”, the months of dreary grunt-work, is basically “fitting in” with the existing cruft that has built up. I’m used to a framework that runs fine on Linux but not Windows. Or is great in the browser but not on the desktop. So I have to find a new framework. And if I get that choice wrong, I have the hell of an inappropriate framework. Or I run off and reinvent something didn’t need to. I have to install the tools to use the new framework. Install the dependencies. Worry about incompatibilities in packages. Incompatibilities with the Java version, with the operating system version and other resources. Then … once I’m actually in the programming language. I sketch my algorithms out in a sensible way. But when I come to draw a picture on a canvas I have to learn a new API because the way I learned to draw in another context doesn’t carry over. Or I have to learn how to connect to a new kind of database which does the same thing as another I have used, but uses a different vocabulary from the old one. When I want to put my application as a web service, it doesn’t scale and isn’t secure. Despite the fact that scaling and security are widely studied and have been implemented properly dozens of times, they still aren’t just available to me trivially. I have to do the work myself because reusing techniques doesn’t fit into the format of an include-able library. Or I have to adapt myself to an existing re-usable framework. Pattern languages exist because patterns can’t be reused with an “include” statement, only by programmers reading “how to do this” in a book and then doing it themselves. Seriously guys … the world is full of millions of working programmers today. Spending billions of hours creating code. And almost all of that code is unnecessary. But we simply don’t know how to co-ordinate with each other to properly reuse code. This is a problem that goes by different names. Reusability. “Composability” is another nice high-level abstract concept for the challenge. Why can’t we compose our 0.1% of original idea with, and re-use, the 99.9% of work that already exists? As Richard Kenneth Eng would note. Smalltalk tries to solve this problem by dissolving “monolithic” applications / operating systems into a single large collection of objects, like a big box of reusable Lego bricks that can be reused and recombined by each new application. It improves productivity because in Smalltalk world there is little need for anyone to reinvent existing functionality. It is already there visible, available, waiting to be reused. Unfortunately we don’t live in Smalltalk world. All our operating systems and cloud providers etc. work on a different model. And there seems no way to bring this Smalltalkness out into the rest of the world. So at the next level we have the open-source movement, git and public hosting services like GitHub / GitLab etc. And package managers like Debian and npm and Maven etc. All ways to share and reuse code. They help. But they don’t help enough to actually make a dent on the problem. The number of reinventions keeps on proliferating. The cruft builds up. The Haskellers and advanced type system people think they have the answer to composability. Better type-systems. Which allow us to know exactly when and how different bits can be combined together. You could presumably even have search-engines that could figure out when two hosted projects could be plugged together, via their type compatibilities. Or which could explain exactly what kind of adaptors you’d have to write in order to make them work together. But then again, we aren’t all using Haskell. And importing our existing code into the Haskell type-system is a big and unlikely task. Perhaps artificial intelligence can help. Bots can scan all those public repositories of code, building models of the codebases, of the data-structures created by them. We can infer Haskellish data-types from the code. And then use that to help. But without humans involved working to those data-types the result is still likely to be a lot messier and unwieldy than if humans actually co-ordinated and co-operated to begin with. So this is the big challenge. As the population of programmers explodes, and the amount of existing software - both source code available to use in code-repositories, and depths of the stacks we actually use - grows, how do we stop all our gigantic efforts being wasted by reinventing, working against each other, and fighting cruft, technical debt and (in)compatibility issues?",2021-03-05T20:26:42.644Z,"What are the biggest challenges to no-code development?

The fundamental difficulty is turning vague, incomplete requirements into precise code. People who don't write code very often underestimate the level of precision you need to have. Computers are stupid, so we have to explain everything to them. For any input you pass in, programmers need to consider all possible situations, including those that sound absurd to the people who request it. This is fundamental. That is, no matter how much we develop the technologies, it will still be there. Maybe at some point the AI will do parts of it, but it's still unavoidable. The conex difficulties come from the industry the software is for. There's an inherent difficulty of the problem you're trying to solve that varies from project to project. Writing the navigation system for a space ship has fundamental difficulties of its own. Writing accounting tools is also difficult but in a different way. If you're in a startup context then you're learning what the problems are, what the best solutions are, and implement them at the same time, and this adds additional difficulties. Accidental difficulties refer to factors that can be alleviated or eliminated but still exist. One of them is code rigidity: the more you write code, the more difficult it tends to be to add features. This can be alleviated by following certain design principles and practices (SOLID and TDD of you're curious), but not enough developers do that. Another accidental factor is lack of proper education for software development. In university we typically learn algorithms and data structures, but only a few universities teach how to avoid code rigidity and how to maintain large code bases. Yet another important accidental factor is improper communication. People coming up with requirements typically need to communicate them to developers. Since person to person communication is lossy, things are missed. Add the fact that you need to add the features fast, and it becomes a real issue. Unless there's a fast feedback loop, it's virtually impossible to correct the communication errors. That's one of the core ideas in incremental development: find mistakes early, so we can fix them early. And, of course, there's technology. Each technology we use has its peculiarities. Developers have to learn and live with them. I could go on, but I think I made my point. We can remove some of the accidental difficulties in time, with systemic approaches, and if we come together as a community. The fundamental difficulty will stay with us unless computers somehow become smarter. Hope this answers your question.",2021-03-05T20:27:02.927Z,"What is no-code contender in software development?

The way it works is in principle quite simple: if you have a program, this program will be written in a programming language. What ShiftLeft does, it seems, is to transform this in an Abstract Syntax Tree first and then combine the various ASTs to form a graph describing how the entities in the code (classes, apis, etc.) interact together and then querying this graph to extract potential security issues. The breakthrough here is not the graph or the AST per se but rather using the former to inform the latter, which means you get a much more detailed view over the code. This also means that the more languages are added, the more powerful the product becomes and the more detailed and precise its warnings can be. Because of this, according to its website, the feedback has very minimal false positive and catches by far many more things than competing products. It’s worth noting that my explanation is based on the website, which obviously tries to be as flashy as it can. The reality could, of course, be slightly or totally different.",2021-03-05T20:31:25.038Z,"How does ShiftLeft catch vulnerabilities during code development? ",Quora

My best platform is different, these are the requirements for me and maybe for some of you, so I can develop my app very fast and also go deep when things get sophisticated (my experience says, it always gets sophisticated eventually). No blocking when I want to do some advanced stuff,No proprietary languages or technologies,Support favorite UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular etc)Open Source ModelMicro service supportNo pre-compile or code generation, immediate previews and deploymentDeploy anywhere (AWS, GCP, Azure or any Kubernetes cluster) with one clickFull featured web based IDE without any browser plug-insTeam support, Live collaboration and version controlNo code support for basic development (forms, grids, dashboards, workflows, notifications)Advanced Access ControlMobile UI supportSo far, Code2.io (was iCodeBetter) is the only solution that I could find for my needs. Main Page of Code2, you can jump into the wizards without writing any code and you can start building your business app.  You can always see what you’re doing and how the tables, queries, forms and grids are related to each other. If you are developing a big project, it will save your time and mind. It visualizes all the impact analysis for you.  You can always see your ER diagrams and tables. Code2 generates DDL scripts for you, but if you’re an advanced developer, you can customize those scripts and put extra indexing and partitioning parameters.  You can see the wireframes of your forms. You real forms are in your favourite UI framework. Yes, Code2 stores everything in metadata, so you can see your UI in your own choice (React, Vue, Angular or ExtJS) and you change it and its templates anytime you like. You can also manage best practice conditional statements from the wireframe previews.  Every business project requires Access Control List, sometimes it gets very complex, so you need a tool manage those things. In Code2, you can manage everything from IDE and track it visually. Row based or column based ACL is a just few clicks away. Btw, everything you set here applies both for your frontend and backend side.  Although Code2 generates responsive UI pages for you, you can also create more mobile oriented user experiences by leveraging Code2’s mobile UI capabilities. You can also convert these mobile UIs to a native application.  You can also manage your Kubernetes cluster inside Code2. You can monitor, deploy or change its parameters.  Managing APIs and integrations are also realities of all business software. In Code2, you can create your APIs from your business objects, but also integrate external APIs by just importing Swagger (OpenAPI) or Google Discovery Documents with a click.  I cannot say Code2 is for everyone, but if you are looking for a platform that helps you develop really fast and when things get sophisticated and you need advanced deeper interaction with platform, Code2 is the real winner.

It was the idea that you could create visual editors with predefined blocks and you could just put together any program with a few clicks. This never got off the ground and remained a niche phenomenon for a simple reason: it’s not the code that’s the problem but the complexity of the task. And this complexity cannot be magically waved away by choice of tools. You can of course build tool boxes and click together programs in diagrams but for complex solutions you would simply exchange complex code for complex diagrams. You will still need people who are able to control that complexity and we already have a name for those people: software developers. The idea that you could have anybody else do complex programs simply is a delusion fuelled by mindless profit maximization dreams. Therefore no code will have a few niches where this kind of approach actually works but it will not have any big impact on software development in general or game development in particular. As long as the game is not a completely trivial rebranding of the same concepts, no code will not help you with it.

We are just changing how that happens. Code is a complex dialect, and there are few people who are fluent at it. Most people code with at very least a very bad accent, but more and more as the industry pulls in new people who are not adept at such complexity, they are struggling to be understood at all. No-code will be the ‘universal translator’ to mediate between humans and computers. Leaving each to communicate natively without worrying about it. It is what our industry needs, and we should be grown up enough to embrace it. To quote a certain famous Guide, Don’t Panic! Coding isn’t going anywhere soon. It will be 5–10 years I expect before the majority of new applications will be No-Code based. Then it will be another 20 years of supporting and enhancing code that is already in production. The job of coding will be with us for some time. I also expect the initial No-Code offerings to be 95% solutions, where 5% is just too fiddly and will be coded and plugged in. This will fade as the concept evolves. Yes in 25 years coding will be back to being niche, for highly optimized applications where nothing but a hand crafted solution will do. I expect the number of people coding will be about 0.001% of what we have now. This might be something worth thinking about for teenagers looking ahead at a career, but right now it really shouldn’t put anyone off. Software development will still be booming, we will likely just be configurators, rather than coders. We will be focused on functional problems and not technical ones, I suspect we would end up a hybrid of developer and business analyst and all the fluff and chaos around development teams will fade away as humans become abstracted from any type of technical implementation. People might still code for fun, but no business will be able to justify having people hand writing code, like in all aspects that ‘universal translator’ will be robotic and accurate and it just won’t make any sense taking the risk of having people do it. It will likely be much more productive and cost effective. Most of the overall cost of development is maintenance and technical debt management, these become outmoded concepts when humans aren’t involved. Everything has it’s time, and then new things come along to occupy human activity, this is how we grow. We wouldn’t want to go back to washing clothes in the river (if we have access to washing machines), and at some point coding will look just as archaic and undesirable.

Use an intelligent IDE, something like Visual Studio, to step through the program cycle when you just have a skeleton program - to confirm that the main structure works - before adding detail. Perform desk checking on the control table to ensure specification is met for the detailed entries. When trying to diagnose bugs, use your IDE to pause at significant points in the logic to check values of variables or sections of control flow. Don’t guess what might be happening - Know What is happening. Use a profiler to check if your program has unexpected “hot spots” that may be indicative of future scaling problems. Repeat the profiling after making any changes. There are always multiple layers of potential hot spots that are only exposed by eliminating the previous problem first. Check for unexecutable code (not all compilers provide this feature). Use a run time profiler that counts actually executed statements to find paths that may not get reached by the existing test input.",2021-03-05T20:39:48.567Z,"What are ways to slash debugging time throughout code development lifecycle?

Microsoft Power Apps, Google Appmaker, Betty blocks, mendix, tulip….. and many many more! Depending on what is needed… you could even build something on a spreadsheet. Now…the question about whether it is more expensive is extremely complex! First, there are three costs to take into account to make this decision. Money, time and wellbeing. I’ll give you a quick synopsis on each. Money: most no-code tools will charge you an ongoing fee that will scale based on the amount of users you have. If you build it yourself, you would not pay this over the long term. However, if you build it yourself you may have to pay to maintain and host the code which can also be expensive. Time: you can develop much faster on a no-code platform, providing that the platform is able to fulfill your requirements. If the no-code platform can satisfy 100% of your requirements, you might be able to build an app in a few hours instead of months. This time saver can be incredibly valuable. However if the no-code platform does not satisfy your requirements, even 1% of them - and that one percent dictates that you must take more time to integrate the custom code with the platform - it may end up taking you more time. And that brings us to wellbeing…. Wellbeing: this is the intangible cost that must always be taken into account when building software! Making custom software is usually AT LEAST 10x more difficult than you think it will be. I don’t care if you are Google or writing your first “hello world”… this is a simple unavoidable axiom in software development. This process can be painful and frustrating to those that don’t quite grasp why it becomes complex so fast! Think of building software like building any complex engineered system, a bridge, a car, a plane, etc. You could build new designs… but do you really want to? For your own well being, if you can build your app on a no-code platform you probably should do that. At least test your hypothesis using no-code, then change platforms if you need to later. Save your energy for what you are good at! The first thing you need to do is get your requirements well defined, then talk to someone who knows no-code to tell you how much can be made on a no-code platform. You can reach out to me directly for help with this part I’d be happy to give advice.",2021-03-05T20:41:21.219Z,"Why are no-code app development softwares so expensive? ",Quora

There are also Municipal codes and County Ordinances that have laws with criminal consequences. In general there are four bodies of code: Local, County, State, and Federal. Local codes are done by city counsels, county by a board of supervisors, state laws by your state legislators, (the first three can be said bodies or by voter initiation/referendum), and lastly by congress and the house of representatives. It should be noted that the Mayor, Governor, President, or other CEO of any government body does not make laws. They can approve or veto laws, but the legislative branch can override a veto with enough votes. I personally don’t think this is a fair and equitable system, as we the people have no way to challenge our federal representatives in a meaningful way, however, it beats the church or a king writing them! If you meant the mechanisms that make a law a law, it varies by jurisdiction. Pretty much every law written is to keep people safe or serve an general public interest, therefor, every law starts with the identification of a problem or area of improvement. The main problem here is perspctive, but thats a whole other subject. At any rate, the problem is identified and a solution is created. If this solution requires public behavior to be modified, it is brought up in the respective subcommitee for the appropriate government body and from there it has it’s own process that is specific to the locality. In the end it either gets enough votes or not. If it does, it goes to the CEO to approve. It approved it becomes law. If not it gets shot back to see if the legislature wants to attempt to overrule the veto. For laws we vote on, there must be a certain amount of signatures to get it on the ballot and after that, depending on what is being modified, a certain percentage of votes is requires (normally in CA that’s 50% unless the law is modifying the state Constitution, in which case it requires 2/3 I think). I could be wrong on that last part, but searching “(STATE) Voter Referendum” in google should point you in the right direction. At any rate I hope this helps and feel free to comment and ask for specificity or elaboration of a topic.

For example, here is a screenshot of SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services):  The tool above generates ETL processes. As an author, you can still write and integrate code, but this tool can reduce the effort by a substantial margin. Microsoft will continue to make tools like this. They also put their money where their mouth is when supporting open source platforms like Github. They changed their culture to support open source, as is evident by the fact you can now run a Linux shell on Windows (WSL), supporting tools like Docker (which was Linux only before). Imagine something like that happening 15 years ago. Yeah, I can’t either. Microsoft has a business necessity to keep up with technology. After all, that’s where they made their name.

The biggest token of support Microsoft has given to the OSS community is buying Github for $7B. They also bought npm. While I don’t believe it’s all benevolent (see Corey Butler's answer to I must be missing something obvious. What benefit does Microsoft get by buying GitHub? It is certainly not generating enough revenue to warrant the high price paid. and Corey Butler's answer to Why is Microsoft buying NPM?), it is still one heck of an investment in open source. Low-code is just another part of the software development world. Microsoft has been producing tools like this for many decades befor Continue Reading",2021-03-05T20:55:08.872Z,"How is Microsoft supporting open-source and low-code development to help companies keep moving?

Which operating system will your app going to run? Is it going to be deployed on the premise or off the premise (in the cloud)? Each programming language has their own advantage and disadvantage to build these diverse technology. Another limiting factor to consider is what skill-sets does your developer has? For desktop app you have options: C++ is the oldest and fastest language since it directly compile into machine language. However it is the most difficult language to learn due to rigid notation. C# is the second fastest language that are popular for Windows app, it has the best UI designer for Windows app. Objective C is another language that are popular for OSX app. It has good UI designer as well. Java is another technology that is popular for it’s cross platform app. It is popular for enterprise application as it can run on multiple platform, but are lacking on UI looks compared to native app. Now days C++, C# also support cross platform development through C++ Builder and C# Mono. Python is popular scripting language for data science app due to it’s massive library develop by open source community, but it’s lacking in speed and framework to build the UI. For web app basically HTML, CSS are the core knowledge to have. There are two type of web app based on processing location, one is server side and the other is client side. Server side app PHP or ASP are most popular one. While for client side Java Script and all their derivatives (ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS, etc) are most popular now days. For Mobile app development there are at least three area: first is native programming language (Java/Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS), the second one is hybrid programming language (Xamarin), and third one is wrapped web app which is web app that run for mobile browser. So the choice is depend on your requirement and resources. Good luck.",2021-03-05T21:01:56.608Z,"Which one is the best programming language for no code platform development? ",Quora
