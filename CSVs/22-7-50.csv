Whether selling a product or service, selling the idea of a trip to your museum, or ‘selling’ the concept of helping orphan children, a website that doesn’t persuade and influence is wasted time, money, and pixels. There are 4 essential required for a website that sells: Mechanical: It has to be responsive, go fast, have built in SEO, be easy to maintain, and other mechanical characteristics Visual: needs the expertise of a graphic designer who understands how the eye moves, colors, fonts, pictures and graphics and their interaction. Not some wannabe, but a trained professional. Copy: The words used to persuade and influence are called copy. It’s an expertise lacking in 99% of websites. It not just words, it’s a methodology leading people to a conclusion. Whether a video script or words alone, it is crucial to a website that sells. Sales flow : Without someone who sells involved, it’s only guessing how to get people to buy. A sales person must critically examine every step to see if it helps or hinders the sale. It’s a progression that blends with the copy writer, starting from the front page and leading through to an efficient sales process. Without those skills it’s like having a car with great paint, shiny bumpers but no engine or transmission. Looks nice on the outside but can’t get you anywhere! Same with a pretty website that doesn’t sell. It has no engine because one or more of the skills above are not used to build it. Now, if you have these skills, you can build your own website. But I doubt whether you do because most ‘web designers’ don’t have all these skills. It takes a team. and there are several other reasons WIX/Squarespace/others may not be a good choice which is a different question… You can hire an expert who has access to all these other skills. With that list above you can evaluate so called ‘web designers’ to determine if they can create a website that sells. if you want a shiny car with no engine, do it yourself or hire some cheap website business that doesn’t have the 4 skills. It’s your money, if you choose to waste it and not get results, at least you have been warned! Expect a lot of answers from people who build websites. But I am not one of them.

Wix and Squarespace (and like services) are good for what they do. But if you read many developer forums you will find countless posts about the frustrations over what they are limiting in the way of design. We do need to define the difference between Wix and Squarespace - Wix is not a content management system (CMS) but a page building system. If you have to manage a great deal of content on a site - you want a CMS, like WordPress, which is dominating the market now. And with WordPress, you get the CMS plus the ability to insert a theme and pagebuilder, like Divi or Elementor or Genesis, etc. WP is very extensible. However, because WP is very extensible, it is not something you can learn in one day. The same applies to Squarespace - which IS a CMS, but it is more or less managed for you - they provide the things you need for a business site (hosting, email, SS, ecommerce option through Stripe, stc) for a flat fee per month - though ecommerce sites cost more than the plain website - and 3% transaction processing fee from Stripe. This is very attractive to most users because they do not have to learn how to put all those things together to make them work, or pay someone to do the same. The trend is to start on a platform and then move off of it when you hit limitations. That can be frustrating when you find out that it is not that easy to move. For example, when trying to move off SquareSpace this is what will not be exported for you: Product pages, Album pages, and Event pages will not be exportedAudio, Video, and Product blocks will not exportStyle changes and custom CSSFolders and index pages will be left outIf you had more than one blog page, then only one of them will be exportedWhich means they have to be moved manually. A big pain! And on the import into WordPress - the WordPress importer cannot import images from your Squarespace website. You will have to manually import those images, though thankfully there is a plugin to automate the process. All that brings us to the conclusion, given the current complexities of things, that there will be web design jobs (and redesign jobs) for a long time to come. The better question would be - What cool tools are going to emerge to make designing and building websites more intuitive and less frustrating? Like any market there will be winners and losers - so pick carefully!",2021-03-08T09:04:17.603Z,"Do you think web design jobs will vanish as it gets easier to make websites through services like Wix or Squarespace?

What will remain are experience-oriented professions. Jobs that require one-on-one training and passing of information between parties. How does that relate to web design? Well, it certainly means that Squarespace can help you build websites for clients faster. That speed becomes less valuable.

With some of the DIY tools, it’s a lot cheaper: Squarespace is anything from $140 to $480 annually depending on the plan you pickWix is from $60 to $350 annuallyLast but not least, building a site with WordPress is usually in the $60-$90 a year range.Then, there's the topic of how comfortable you are with DIY tools. Though, I wouldn't worry too much about that since the tools of today (Squarespace, Wix, etc.) are all user friendly and can be used by beginners very effectively. Essentially, you just sign up, pick a design, get through the settings, and you walk out with a perfectly functioning website. You do need to spend an afternoon going through these things, but it’s time well invested. Overall, I’d advise trying to build a site yourself first. Giving it a good couple of days to pick your platform, select a design, and set everything up. If you feel overwhelmed and can't figure things out on your own, this is when you should consider finding some help. My personal favorite tool for all-things website building is WordPress. It gives you more control than Squarespace or Wix, while also letting you go the easy path if you want to and simply select an off-the-shelf design and install it with one click. Not to mention that currently more than 30% of all websites run on WordPress.

From simple things like changing the behavior when you hover over buttons & links, to more complex alterations to the layout using flexbox... there are almost no limits to changing the appearance of your website by using Custom CSS, without needing to open Developer Mode. To make the most of it, I recommend opening up a separate window for testing and debugging with Inspector (preferable in Incognito mode). Some fun things I like to do: customize mobile styles, change the color/shape of form fields, and add fun background gradients. Custom Fonts:There are a number of ways to do this, but one relatively easy way is to link it to an Adobe Typekit account. Embedding SVGs:Another very underutilized area on Squarespace (and on the web in general) is utilizing lightweight vector graphics instead of heavy PNGs and JPEGs. You can draw in Adobe Illustrator or Sketch, export as SVG code, then paste that code into a Code Block. Style points if you add CSS code to the SVG files themselves (careful, they Cascade) for hover effects, keyframe animations, or other cool things! Custom Favicon:This one is really obvious, but I really can't stand when someone leaves ""Pandora's Box"" as the favicon. Just looks really unprofessional. Custom Secondary Navigation:Have a ton of link to go into the footer? Don't like the way your template displays your Secondary Navigation? No sweat. Just disable it in the Style Guide and add the links yourself into the footer. Just remember to update it when you add new pages. One tip: you can great effect by using a Bolded Heading for a column of links, hit <enter> for a hard return, then between items use <shift + enter> for a soft return (or line break). This will give it a nice ordered look.

As such, you don't really have to think about the site design. Creating your website with the site builder is simply a matter of choosing the appearance you want to have.     Step by Step Wizard     The site builders typically provide a step by step wizard, that takes you through the steps of selecting a design and entering your site information. It gives the user the impression that the whole process is very easy, and doable.    No Need to Upload Files and Whatnot     Since you design your website online, with the site builder, there's no need for you to upload (publish) your web page and images. The site builder creates the files directly in your web hosting account. To newcomers, the process of uploading a website can seem daunting at first, and so this painless procedure has tremendous allure. Why You Should Not Use the Online Site Builder If You Can In spite of the above, when visitors ask me this question, I normally recommend that they forgo the online web builder and learn to use an offline, standalone web editor. In the short term, this may seem like it increases the hurdle of getting your site onto the Internet, but there are far-reaching long term benefits.    Flexibility, Control and Transferability of Skills     Building your website using a site builder only seems easy on the surface, since it provides the illusion you don't need to dream up the visual appearance of your website. You can simply use their provided templates.     But despite what newcomers think, designing a website is more than creating an pleasing visual look. There are far more important aspects to web design, including usability and search engine friendliness.     As you learn more about these things, you will want to modify your website so that it is more usable and search engine friendly. When you limit yourself to a site builder, you are surrendering flexibility and total control in exchange for initial ease-of-use.     Now, of course it's possible that some site builders provide you with facilities to modify every aspect of your web pages. To do that, you will probably have to spend time learning the interface and working with it (or even around it) to accomplish your task. Why bother? All the skills you acquire in working with the site builder are not transferable. The moment you leave that web host, you have to re-learn everything again. You might as well have spent the time learning a standalone web editor. Your skills will then be usable no matter which web host you use, even if they don't provide a site builder.  Content     When I said that using a site builder provides you the illusion of ease of use, I really meant it. The most important part of the time creating any website is drafting your content, whether it is your product description, sales pitch or some other thing. When you use a site builder, you still have to invest time and energy writing that content. There is no shortcut. If the pretty face of the online site maker led you to think that creating a website will take you no time at all, think again. The only one that can generate good content is you. The site builder will not write it for you. All it can create are the pseudo-Latin ""lorem ipsum"" gobbledygook meant as placeholders for your real text.    Transferability of Web Design: Are You Locked into Your Web Host?     I have had visitors to Website design, promotion, CGI, PHP, JavaScript scripting, and revenue earning. writing to me to tell me about how their website was locked to a particular web host, because they used their host's website builder. The template and graphics used by the builder were copyrighted, and licensed to them for use on their website only if the site remained on that host. If they were to move to another web host, they could no longer use that template.     This, I think, is the most serious problem of all. Does your site builder tie you to your web host? Will you be able to move to another web host simply by transferring all the files to the other host? If you find that the terms of use of those templates do not allow this, you should not even consider using the site builder. Never allow your site to be locked into any web host. If the hosting company deteriorates, or unreasonably increases their rates, or even goes out of business, your website and your business will be held hostage.

However, this does not mean that you should let SquareSpace or any other service take all design decisions away from you.  As a UX professional you should still design the way information will be presented on each page. You, not SquareSpace, are responsible for the presentation of your work, and there are still choices to be made for any designer. Which works you want to present, how you wish to present it and the visual aesthetic are things you still have control over and should think through when building the site. And you should definitely get a custom domain. Treat designing a portfolio is like any other website. The time and care whether you use SquareSpace or not, with be reflected in the final product. Which platform you use is only a design constraint. Yes its entirely okay for a UX professional to use sites such as SquareSpace, Wix, Behance and other sites that offer portfolio services.

Currently, Squarespace is paying more attention to enriching itself by optimizing eCommerce features. As a matter of fact, 2,478,031 users chose Squarespace to start their online businesses. 1. Pricing plans Wix Speaking of price, the criteria for choosing proper Wix’s pricing options greatly depend on the user’s purposes. The first option is Website. It charges you at least $4 each month for the basic package with limited features and on-site ads.  You can save up to $66 and $168 respectively if payments for Website pricing plans are made one year and two years in advance. Squarespace On the other hand, Squarespace users are able to choose from four pricing options: Personal, Business, Basic Commerce, and Advanced Commerce. The price for each plan ranges from $16 to $46 per month.  The verdict: Wix is cheaper with better features. 2. Support  Similar to other platforms, Wix vs Squarespace both aim at improving customer satisfaction. Therefore, whatever website builders you will settle in, please rest assured that dedicated, professional support is always at hand. 3. Website Builder Features Comparisons:  Interestingly, both Wix vs Squarespace get their names on the score sheet thanks to the drag-and-drop interface. This saves you a lot of time on customizing your eCommerce store compared to open source carts like WooCommerce or Magento. When it comes to website appearance, Wix seems to surpass Squarespace in terms of the number of templates and themes. But not all Wix designs are as nice as you expect. 4. SEO  No matter which one you will go for, both Wix and Squarespace offer SEO features to get your online store a higher rank in the search engines. In detail, store owners can edit meta tags, URLs, keywords, anchor links, heading tags, alt text and so on. 5. Blogging  According to our research, Squarespace offers a large number of blog-oriented templates. Therefore, Squarespace somehow brings a better experience to the table over Wix in regard to blogging.

If all they want is a blank, empty template with no text, no logos or branding, no SEO and no direction or marketing plan in place and no plan for ongoing site maintenance for updates, then whatever that consumer would get back in terms of value is very very negligible and I would submit would be a waste of time for them (it’d be akin to buying business cards with no phone number or e-mail address or URL on it). There’d be no value for any developer to do the work, it’d be an embarrassment for their portfolio (better hope no potential clients look at your actual site), and more likely than not the customer would not value the work done at all - since they have low level work to be kind.  Also, if you are creating a “free” site using one of these DIY template builder services it’s important to bear in mind that (in most cases and I’m not a lawyer here) they own all content, images, everything, can plaster ads all over the site (and probably will), can delete it at will if anyone (including a competitor) complains they don’t like it, and you’d have to pay quadruple what you would from working with a real developer to remove ads, get a professional sounding domain name, pay quadruple (if not more) for SEO help, and on and on. I know everybody loves cheap stuff, but at some point people who want actual qualitative results realize that when it comes to marketing and business services you usually get what you pay for. There’s no value in an empty template that doesn’t differentiate itself and has no marketing onus propelling it forward - so personally I would refer the consumer to a local agency competitor (most of whom charge 10 grand at a minimal to begin a project because of their considerably larger overhead).  If you are going to customize the work, utilize SEO, content marketing, write content, help with logo and branding development and help their business thrive, then I would charge a percentage of the returns I can guarantee or at the very least by the hour based on common industry standards (and no professional developer will work for less than $75 per hour even if they live in a post Apocalyptic wasteland, as it’s just too much specialized work to do for less).

There is also a Site History feature that saves any change you make and lets you undo it whenever you wish. Weebly - is a lot easier to use than Squarespace. Their templates are not quite as good though. A big advantage of Weebly is their flexible page structure that allows very deep site hierarchies and therefore is suitable for larger websites. At $8 for the cheapest ad-free website with a domain name it’s almost a bargain. Free plan available. Jimdo is also a lot cheaper than Squarespace ($7.50 per month). Similarly to Weebly it’s super easy to use and there’s even a mobile app for iOS and Android that allows edits on the go. Their choice of templates can’t compete with Squarespace, though. Find a comparison chart here:  Source: Website Builders: Side by Side Comparison (for an optimal view, right-click the image and select “open in a new tab”) Webnode is a solid choice for multilingual projects. At $9.95 per month you can create your website in two languages, which is a rather difficult undertaking with Squarespace. Webnode’s blog and templates are weaker than Squarespace’s though. But they do feature a free plan. One.com is extremely cheap. While the editor is certainly not as powerful as Squarespace’s, it’s a pretty decent alternative for budget-conscious site builders. Currently, their cheapest plan starts at $2.45 per month (domain not included). They offer 24/7 chat support in English, whereas Squarespace has limited live chat hours.

Poor management, ill-timed market entry, shoddy quality, hostile customer service, etc. will sink a company. Who cares if they look good while doing so? Attached to a well-run company with solid products and services and a good marketing campaign, a good logo will absolutely provide tangible benefits—retention of the company’s name in people’s memory, association of that logo with the positive qualities of the company, unconscious recognition, prestige, etc. It may make the company easier to sell (if it’s a private firm). There is a huge “but” attached to all of this. Much to some of my clients’ dismay, I have pointed out that the strongest brand of the 20th century, in the West, was the Nazi swastika. It was very well-designed. The standards manual is really well done and the implementation was comprehensive. The swastika was a powerfully positive symbol until the actions of that group, together with that symbol, became the brand of evil. Great design, really competent and comprehensive execution of the identity but attached to a “company” whose product was profoundly evil. It still has a deep emotional effect today, even though the “company” is long since gone. I counsel my ID clients to create the brand first—the elements that will be noticed and remembered by customers and clients. Then once that is established, we will work on a corporate ID program and a systematic way to strongly associate the two.",2021-03-08T09:42:25.463Z,"Does a good logo actually transfer into tangible benefits for a company?

Go to a place like themeforest or styleshout and look at the different examples they have for download (use the live previews). Without CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript you won’t be able to do everything they do, but that’s ok, you just want to try to learn how you can do some things so do what you can. After getting good with HTML, learn CSS and likely Bootstrap. This way you can start to build beautiful responsive sites. Once you have these down to a point of being dangerous, you should be building some awesome sites. In case 2, can you write CSS? If so, when you are designing the site, build some of the things into CSS so that implementing them in html would be a no-brainer. You can do a lot of cool stuff in CSS, so this would be ideal. The more I think about this, the less likely I think case2 is, because if you are designing a site, unless you are strictly designing in photoshop, you likely already know html and css and wouldn’t need to hire a rookie to fill that gap.

Will I design it myself? Probably. Might I start with a nice template? Sure, why not? That said, I do understand the portfolios that go the extra mile, are truly personal and impressive, and show a great deal of innovation and attention to detail. That is a mark of care. But it's also simply a mark of time; so it shouldn't be the only indicator of quality. It reminds me of a piece of feedback I received when I was one year into a startup solo UX position. The company thought I was doing a great job, but my visual UI design abilities weren't quite up to their expectations. I took this pretty harshly and spent some time trying to prove them wrong, and I showed them what I could achieve if I put the time into it. What happened, though, was that the important architectural, research, and overarching UX guidance I was formerly excelling at took a backseat, and I lost my grasp on the needs of the product as a whole. I re-balanced, and spent just a tiny bit more time on visuals to try to impress, while keeping priority on the real needs. During that time, I never had a second to spare for my portfolio. I haven't since. So when you're looking at portfolios, just remember it's more a reflection of how a person chooses to spend their time, than their raw abilities—even though it should be the latter, it's not always realistic.",2021-03-08T09:43:48.407Z,"How would you interpret someone who applies for a UX position and has a WordPress template for their online portfolio?

And I found myself at the mercy of the developers (who were great) for what the end product ended up being (which was always surprisingly different than the designs I created...). Basically, I didn't know how to code, and didn't have the time/effort/mindset/insert-designer-excuse-here to do it. And why do it anyways? Designers shouldn't spend their time writing in a language that only 1% of the world understands. We design things - that's what we do. And yes the web is built on this strange language called HTML (and CSS), and it's important to understand its principals - but I could never get to the point of fluency in writing it all by myself. And I know I'm not alone. I meet thousands of designers (some of the best in the world) that feel the same way. We want to create with our eyes. We want to design from our gut. We don't want to write code. (Steps off soapbox) Then Webflow came along (on a bright summer day in 2013). Funny story - was passed along from one of my developer friends, who I'd worked with many times before. It allowed me to take the teensy weensy bit of knowledge I had about code, and apply it in a visual way that felt good to me. Within weeks I was already building real websites for clients (Although back then they were only one-page wonders...). Within months I was designing full-blown production websites for large companies, some of which receive (to this day) millions of visits per year. All custom built/designed from my own design brain, and made a reality by using Webflow. I never would have been able to do this with a tool like Squarespace/Wix/Weebly, simply because what they give in consistency and well-designed templates, they lack in creative freedom and allowing the designer to create something unique/from scratch. Those other tools enable, but Webflow empowers. Now - That doesn't mean that Squarespace (and others) don't have their place. Because they most certainly do. They play an equally as important role in the web ecosystem. I've met many folks that simply need a website now. They don't really care what it looks like, but need something that looks good, and need it in a short amount of time. The fact that someone can go to a source like Squarespace and get online in a matter of minutes is one of the reason the web is so amazing today. Squarespaces of the world have lowered the barrier to entry and allow people that couldn't have gotten online before, to be able to do so. The side effect of this? Now we are seeing a standardization of the web, where we see the same templates over and over again on sites all across the web. This is where Webflow shines. It breaks this trend by empowering designers to surpass the constraints of template tweaking and build amazing sites like these: http://booking.timekit.io/http://www.dariostefanutto.com/http://moreofthesa.me/https://www.newstorycharity.org/http://minewire.webflow.io/http://wars.webflow.io/http://geospace.webflow.io/ And literally thousands of others. They couldn't have been created in Squarespace. They couldn't have been published live in Photoshop. Webflow combines the two to empower designers (and anyone) to build the future of the web without the limitations. Have any more questions?

Warning: this is for advanced users. Most people should not use both platforms. But this is I don't recommend this if you're starting out – just start one. But if you're a crazy person, with a wild look in your eye, you might be able to pull this off. Squarespace offers support for the integration of Shopify cart buttons. If you’re happy with an existing Squarespace site, this can be especially beneficial. Rather than trying to transition a whole site over to Shopify, you may simply want to build a store or cart subdomain that utilizes the platform while keeping everything else on Squarespace. Again – I'd rather you pick just one. But it is possible to jerry-rig a system together like an old pirate and make both work. Alternative: Webflow with Ecommerce Add-On Another upstart website builder product that's been gaining a lot of traction recently is Webflow. It's essentially a more advanced website builder that's highly flexible and built for visual designers. Although a bit more complex than the above two products, many people absolutely love it. So consider reading some of their reviews and Webflow pricing, then start testing out the product yourself. Conclusion The big issues that potential customers need to look at when choosing between Shopify vs Squarespace are cost and functionality. If you’re worried about how much does Squarespace cost, you’ll see it’s the clear winner, especially for those who want to be able to scale up massively. On the other hand, Shopify pros tend to love the platform’s high level of extensibility and support. Each system comes away the clear winner in certain aspects, but the differences in specific advantages will compel you to think about what your online store is now and what you intend it to be in the future.

Those kids were studying Buddhism in that monastery. They have never a computer or a touch screen in life. Their digital experience was limited to a TV. I (for better or worse) showed them my iPad and gave them Paper to play with.  In less than 60 seconds, they understood it. I repeat: 60 seconds. They were doing all kinds of gestures: bringing tray in and out, switching color and using pen or other writing tools. If there is one indicator of an intuitive interface, that was it.

However, I haven’t stuck with anything as long as I have with Squarespace! My top 5 reasons why I choose Squarespace are: 1. modern & responsive design templates Squarespace has a number of sleek modern templates to choose from. Now, the platform may not have as many templates as WordPress — but ever heard the phrase “too many options make it harder to choose.” Yep, exactly! Squarespace lets you view each template on a live demo website. So, rather than just pictures, you actually see and manipulate how the site works! It also shows a handful of websites using that template. You can see the versatility from the client’s perspective. An up-to-date look is crucial for any website. Squarespace takes some of the pressure off modernizing your site by supplying you with trend-setting designs. All the templates are mobile responsive. That means that your website will be flexible and easy to view on any device. Plus, you don’t have to do anything — these capabilities are built in! Check out Squarespace templates here → All this just makes the process that much easier, especially for the do-it-yourselfer — which brings me to my next point. 2. easy “diy” interface One of my favorite things about Squarespace is how easy it is to build a website. Squarespace keeps everything simple and straightforward, unlike many other web builder platforms. You can easily navigate the back-end of the platform — adding pages, updating blogs, and changing your site design through an easy-to-use style guide tab. For some users, there may be a bit of a learning curve. But, honestly, once you start playing around, you’ll find that there’s nothing you can’t manage. It’s literally step by step. 3. all-in-one package What other platform gives you everything? Well, what do I mean by everything? With Squarespace, you can have eCommerce, blogging, templates, email marketing, hosting, and domains all in one. No third party integration is necessary. For most users, being able to tap into all of these resources easily is a must. This is especially the case for businesses where a small team, or even one person, is trying to tackle all of these elements at once. Having the ability to update, manage, and build your business in one space is a dream come true. 4. super responsive customer service Even the best of designers may run into a situation where they need support. Thankfully, Squarespace customer services is awesome sauce — for real! It’s a super-responsive live chat with people who actually know what they’re talking about. To date, I have yet to leave Squarespace customer support chat without a solution. We’re not talking about a call center that sends you to several different departments and so forth. I mean open a live chat, wait in queue for your agent, and get instant support on your site with a rep who is actually knowledgeable about the platform. I mean, how often does that happen? And that’s not even mentioning the resource area, which has support for all aspects of Squarespace. There are helpful articles and plenty of tutorial videos to get you through any issue imaginable. 5. squarespace listens! Squarespace Circle is a community of designer using the Squarespace platform to build websites (DailyMode Studio is one of those designers!). Squarespace actively communicates with this community and takes heed of its advice, using it to better the customer experience for us designers and you clients. Story time… Squarespace recently made a change to the order of the back-end menu options in hope of creating a better customer experience. Most of the Circle members were thrilled about the majority of the changes, but there were updates in the design section that we KNEW were going to complicate things for everyone else. We expressed our concerns and, by the next day – literally – Squarespace made changes based on our feedback. That, my friends, is called listening!!! Squarespace cares about your experience and ability to grow your business. I’d rather choose a platform that listens than one that doesn’t care.

Are you just not getting what you want? Are the colors wrong? The font you selected not looking right or hard to read? Are the images not aligned the way you want? Making a website is a publishing task that requires multiple skills. You have to have good page content copy. You need a good layout structure best for your site theme and purpose. You select colors and font that is clear to read and go well together. You need to select and place your images. There's the logo to make and perhaps a video or image slideshow to make. Your content may include an events calendar, contact form and a membership form. You may need a way to sell products or put up an image gallery. When I create webpages first I choose whether to make the page from scratch (Notepad) or get a template and adapt that. I learned all my web programming by myself as I went. I never learned it in any school or course, but I learned the basic fundamentals that apply to any design project. If I type a page, I follow a set of code formatting conventions to make my code easy to read and prevent coding errors. I put comment labels on my sections and choose easy to identify names (#bannerbox). For help in choosing colors and fonts, I don't trust my eyes, I find pages that help me make the best choices. A CSS guide can help choose the best objects to use for your text and image content. If I am adapting from a template, I study the template to determine what features I want and how the sections work. The general idea is to start with a website design that you can realistically use to build your site. Choose the simplest for your first site and work with that. Determine what features your site must have as a priority and work to build that first. As your skills improve work on more difficult pages or features. I have a club website that I am proud to say works very well and has been running for 14 years. It's got an events calendar, contact form, membership form page, an officers page and an ""about us"" page. It's essentially a web version of a brochure. What I did not know how to do from scratch, I found a plugin or service to help me (like the calendar). One thing I want to have someday is a membership login but I am not sure how to do that with what I have or how to make that work with the multi-platform template. My approach to this is to find a service or help page to walk me through it if I decide to go through with this upgrade to our site. So start with the basics on your site. Do first what you know how to do to create a good site that people can use. Get feedback from your visitors (very important). Expand your site as you learn new skills and determine what features you want to have. =====Added: Links to very useful web design sites you should have next to your projects so they are handy. I focus on color since that is probably the first decision you will need to make when creating your site. Try other similar sites until you find ones you like best. Web Colors: (there are many)Some pages are for selecting specific color codes if you are looking for a matching code or colors. Others help you select good combinations to use. HTML Color Picker - W3 Schools color chart - pick a color then lighten or darkenWeb Color Chart - Hexadecimal - by VisiBone - Chart with hexadecimal codes, this is good for studying web color variations and getting to know them by code. (#ffffff is white and #000000 is black)Web Color Codes - This one uses your choice of picker options. You can start with a chart. Adjust it with a color picker. Choose by name or RGB code if you prefer.Eyedropper, Color Picker, Gradient Generator and more - Chrome plug in helps pick matching colors using eyedropper method. Cool if you want your site color to match your site logo or cover photo.Color Combinations | Color Schemes | Color Palettes - This helps you choose color combinations that work. Choose a range of best options and try them all. You won't know exactly until you see it on your pages and try different browsers and screens. Use search and replace to swap out color options.",2021-03-08T09:47:12.709Z,"How can I develop good-looking websites if I have learned HTML and CSS? ",Quora

For example, there’s an English Rhetoric and Professional Writing major who is working on Google Maps as a User Experience Designer, and a Math / Business major working at Facebook as a Product Designer. And University of Waterloo doesn’t offer a single (UX) design course. They don’t even teach front-end development, yet many of our designers are proficient at it. What University of Waterloo offers that other schools can’t offer is the culture. Many students are ambitious and self-learners, working (together) on side projects to build amazing things and solve problems. The University of Waterloo also has a wealth of programming talent, so when you team up with any of these students, you help each other take the projects further and you get to practice working with an engineer.

It’s a hosted site builder primarily designed for DIY users starting out (and hobbyist photographers and the like). The best “workaround” is cloning the page and marking it private or other basic content operations of that sort. For actual development, using Squarespace makes very, very little sense in practice. 6",2021-03-08T09:50:27.958Z,"Is there any way to set up a staging site on Squarespace? ",Quora

Quora, facebook etc are essentially web applications that require continuous bug fixing and introduction of new features. Now, Facebook and Quora are big examples, but there are lots of startups and small companies that provide services through their web and mobile platforms. These web applications are not build using Wordpress or Squarespace, these are built using powerful front-end, back-end and database tools like React, Angular, Backbone, D3, CSS, LESS/SASS/Stylus, Gulp, Django, Node, Express, Ruby on Rails, SpringMVC, PHP, YII, MongoDB, MySql, PostGres and so many other components. Apart from that there are other crucial tools that help in delivery like Continuous Integration tools like Travis CI. Then there comes another amazing tool like Docker. There is another component called testing which is done by using tools like Mocha, Jasmine, JUnit, Selenium, Karma. For becoming a professional web developer, you need to master few or more of such tools which in my opinion takes years. Creating static websites like the ones provided by SquareSpace and Wix is just the beginning. Though they have really elegant designs, and to manually be able to develop such designs is also a kind of an art. If you are interested in doing that, then I recommend you master CSS and using tools like LESS/SASS/Stylus and Photoshop. Then you will be a web designer.",2021-03-08T09:51:30.107Z,"Is it still worthwhile to learn web development now that there are DIY tools anyone can use? ",Quora

At the time WordPress couldn't do what I needed and Joomla had too many deal killers for what mattered to me. I worked with Drupal for 2 years but I could never love it and I wasn't quite sure why. About 1.5 years ago I had someone ask me to do a WordPress project (developing admin components in PHP) to which I agreed with the intention of returning to Drupal.

At the time WordPress couldn't do what I needed and Joomla had too many deal killers for what mattered to me. I worked with Drupal for 2 years but I could never love it and I wasn't quite sure why. About 1.5 years ago I had someone ask me to do a WordPress project (developing admin components in PHP) to which I agreed with the intention of returning to Drupal. But by the time I was finished I had realized that WordPress was far easier to develop for than Drupal and that it had a much better model (IMO) for separation of code from design so I decided to switch. In Drupal the URL enters and Drupal figures out what to do with it by delegating work to ""nodes"" and ""blocks"" and then collects up all the output and send it to the browser.   In contrast when WordPress receives the URL it figures out what to do with it then turns over full control to the template and its the template's responsibility to call back in to WordPress to get data for ""posts"" and ""sidebars.""   On the surface the WordPress approach looks like more duplication, and it is, but it turns out to be brilliant because it enables the necessary flexibility to get a project done like the client wants without any ""Sorry, we just can't do that w/o rewriting/duplicating much of the core engine.""   What I found from my own experience is that I could get 85% done with Drupal in no time and then work for months to get the last 15% done, if ever. With WordPress the first 85% takes longer, but not much longer, whereas the latter 15% can get done in weeks, comparatively speaking. There are two (2) places today where I can see Drupal still has the upper hand;  1.) Where there are no existing plugins for WordPress that do (though unlikely) and the Drupal feature set enables a user to get 100% of what they want without coding, and coding in PHP is not an option,  2.) Maybe in certain enterprise scenarios (although I'm just giving Drupal the benefit of the doubt because I don't know for certain what these situations would be.) For all others WordPress wins hands down in my book. Of course, this is all just IMO. Hope this helps. -Mike",2021-03-08T09:55:33.949Z,"Why are some people using WordPress rather than Drupal? ",Quora

After 7 months I was hired by a local company as a WordPress Developer. After that, my life has changed. In this 7 months I haven’t worked anything. I am 28 years old, I have been doing video and sound editing for 7 years. This was my only income. But, in my country, with this profession you can’t make a good living and sustain a family. In fact, you can, but you have to sell your soul for that)) So, in these 7 months I have leaved with my lowest income and have spent very few money. I was dedicated at least 6 hours a day to learn web development. It was a blast for me! Never though that this will be such an interesting topic. So much to learn, so many resources, so many answer to all of my questions. I am bad at math. I don’t have an analytical way of thinking. I was a creative guy… and that’s all. In programming world is good to be creative, but it’s not the first soft skill you must have. After this 7 months, I have decided to begin apply for jobs. 50 resumes sent and 12 interviews. I was lucky. I was hired. 11 interviews was failed ones) So, after that, I have begin to work in a modern office with all the benefits. Good salary, and a pleasure of doing my work. The feeling when I write some code and this is the result of a beautiful, full functioning website is a delightful felling. Now, I am learning C#, ASP.NET and focusing to go back to my freelance life as s full-stack developer, but in this case with a good income and a pleasure to do my work. In this domain, I am way more free and creative than I was in the video and domain. So, my answer is DEFINITELY IT IS WORTH IT to invest time in Web Development, if you want a steady income and a pleasure to work. It is not for everybody, like all of professions, but this domain is quite large, so you can dive in many different aspect of web development (front-end, back-end, web design, testing, etc).  But, if you are already in a sphere of programming, different then web development, then I don’t know what to say to you. I think, in this case it’s very personal issue for you.

However, every industry and business is different and what is important for you, might not be important for other companies. When choosing an ecommerce platform for your business, there are some things to consider: easy usage, flexibility and integrations, features relevant to your business and, of course, pricing. However, let’s focus on some of the features of BigCommerce and Shopify: BigCommerce  BigCommerce is considered an Open SaaS platform provider and a growing headless commerce provider based on low total cost of ownership and highly flexible APIs. The platform offers small business and start-up plans as well, with built-in features and SEO control. The integration options, like our headless WordPress plugin, make the platform a frontrunner across headless commerce solutions. Businesses that have already used BigCommerce claim that these are its main benefits: Customizable design themes.Professional SEO features.Great built-in sales features, with no need for installation.Up to 600 variations per product.24/7 customer service.The cons of BigCommerce are: Small learning curve required for advanced features.Not a lot of variation between different store themes.Features options aren’t as customizable as Shopify’s.Shopify  One of the best ecommerce solutions is definitely Shopify and therefore, it cannot be missed out on our list of 5 BigCommerce alternatives. This software is one of the most comprehensive platforms as it helps not only with online retail, but also with offline retail. As other options of our list, no software installations or hosting services are required. Feature-loaded, scalable, and offering numerous templates for different niches, Shopify stores are plug-and-play ecommerce. Opposed to Wix, Shopify is a great option for omnichannel commerce including Instagram and Facebook. It has powerful tools that help you find customers, drive sales, and manage your day-to-day. However, its solution is among the more expensive ones. You should also know that Shopify charges transaction fees on every sale (+ the payment processor’s normal fee) unless you use their proprietary payment provider, Shopify Payments. Shopify stands out with these awesome features: Easy to use. In comparison to BigCommerce, it is more user-friendly as you don’t have to worry about technical stuff at all.Attractive designs. There are 70+ quality designs & themes that are also mobile-friendly. You can also create your own design.24/7 support. Unlike open source solutions, Shopify has a 24-hour customer support team.Comprehensive analytics. With Shopify, you can expect actionable dashboards, Google analytics, product reports and much more.The cons of Shopify are: Poor for international scalability – relies on third party apps for multi-currency supportTransaction fees apply unless using Shopify PaymentsSwitching templates means reformatting your siteConclusion However, there are more great BigCommerce alternatives than just Shopify. If you are interested, I’ve written an article about 5 powerful ecommerce solutions that you might consider for your business. Also: It’s worth knowing that every software offers either a free plan or free trial so you can test the solution before purchasing. Good luck!

Firstly, because both services are very reputable and have millions of active users. Secondly, because the former is a website builder, while the latter is an open-source platform. It’s like comparing the strength of boxers belonging to different weight categories. Nonetheless, one day you can find yourself deciding between these two services for your next online project. Which one to choose Squarespace or WordPress? Read this review to find out the benefits and disadvantages of these web publishing solutions. 1. Ease of Use Squarespace. The latest version of Squarespace is much easier than its predecessors. Its interface is cleaner and less complicated. To create a website, Squarespace users don’t necessarily have to know how to code. Unless you want to get under the hood, the builder is completely code-free. At this point, the key advantage of Squarespace over WordPress is its coherence: you get everything you need to design, customize, publish and maintain a website in one place, with all the heavy lifting done by the system (hosting, maintenance etc.). WordPress. WordPress is a rather intuitive CMS, but it still has a slight learning curve. If you know what it takes to get a site online, WordPress can be a great option. But if you’re looking for an ‘all-in-one’ platform that supports WYSIWYG and drag-and-drop editing, you’d better opt for a site builder. Wordpress editor squarespace vs WordPress. The answer seems obvious. Of course, the site builder is easier than the open-source CMS. While Squarespace is mainly targeting the end user who has no idea about how websites are being made, WordPress is meant for those who know a thing or two about website creation. Squarespace includes a library of themes, ready-to-use widgets, and hosting. This is a secure, managed hosting platform, which means you don’t have to do anything in terms of hosting. With WordPress, you have to purchase and manage a web hosting account yourself. This is both a disadvantage and advantage. It’s an advantage, because in WordPress you have full control over your site and can transfer it to any other provider, at any time. It’s a disadvantage because website maintenance is a complex process for a newbie.  2. Feature Set and Flexibility Squarespace. Squarespace is a feature-rich publishing platform. It offers a decent selection of in-house apps and widgets, and also leaves enough room for customization. In my opinion, it provides enough tools to build a quality website. These include: eCommerce. Squarespace gives the ability to sell both tangible and digital goods, ShipStation integration, Stripe and PayPal support, customizable order confirmation emails, the ability to add store managers who’ll have control over inventory, but not the rest of your website, data export, coupons, taxes, and more. Squarespace eCommerce Blogging. Squarespace blogging engine supports scheduled posts, built-in Google Author Rank, tag support, post display options, multiple author support, geo tagging, customizable URLs etc. Importing and exporting. You can import your blog content from WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr or Posterous. Import products from BigCartel and Shopify. You may also export your Squarespace content to WordPress. Multiple contributors with different access levels. Squarespace gives access levels include Administrator, Content Editor, Billing, Reporting, Comment Moderator, Trusted Commenter, and Store Manager. Connected services. Squarespace provides Dropbox file synchronization, simultaneous posting (auto-posts to Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr). Moreover – you can import your blog from WP to Squarespace. For power users, Squarespace offers Developer Platform, where you get full code control, from the opening doctype tag to the footer. Besides, all templates are exposed via Git, meaning that you can work with a team and roll back changes easily. WordPress. WordPress is very flexible. Whether you need to build a webstore, a portfolio or a blog, WordPress can be the right choice. Thanks to the extensibility of the platform, you can create almost any website imaginable. However, you should know that almost any new feature in WordPress requires a plugin, be it an SEO pack, a social media plugin or a commenting system. Though these are quite easy to install and configure, the flipside of this concept is that over time your website accumulates many plugins which can overlap and also make your WordPress website heavier. WordPress vs Squarespace. Though WordPress seems more flexible, I wouldn’t call it the clear winner. It depends on your needs. Don’t get caught up in the “more is better” mentality, unless you really need it. But you should also realize that if your website expands outside of Squarepace’s capabilities, and you don’t want to sign up for the Developer platform, you’ll have to migrate your website to a more scalable platform.

Fields that are expected to take off: Science/engineering - Bioelectronics and bioengineering in general, Robotics, AI & deeplearning, specialist coders such as parallelism and a lot more. You will see big growth in some areas but they can decline very fast, so be careful with this. This could be due to massive government funding for example and as soon as that is taken away most companies lose interest. Although I agree with most the answers I feel some need fleshed out a bit. Wi-Fi will move fast and there is alternatives proposed already such as Li-Fi, the key jobs relating to this that will be relevant into the future would be the embedded programming of this and the RF design.  If you want to keep a job in the future and you can adapt quickly I believe computer science is a great field for the future. Everything is becoming autonomous and computer based from computers in your car to toothbrush to washing machine, these things need coding, even today taxi companies need programmers to program apps for them.   If money is your priority then it is good to find a niche and a skill you can fill, makes you valuable. On a different note depending on how good you will be at business, moving up the ladder will always make you more money and this can be done with many different degrees: finance, engineering, science and with a MBA. There are massive amounts of fields out there in management and finance. Having a particular skill in engineering/science is a good way to make money too though, for example analogue IC verification specialist, audio engineer, quality assurance, high voltage DC-DC designer etc.  These days as a programmer you can code your own little projects and sell them quite easily. I think it is good to follow a path you enjoy and you find interesting, try to make this relevant to still having a job of course. If you can't decide I can tell you all engineering fields, computer science, law, medicine, finance/management or any trade skills you will be fine :).

The logged out portions of the site will still mostly be HTML enhanced with jQuery, but the logged in portions are being rewritten to use Ember.js. The backend services are written in Ruby and Java. We're moving all of our services to the JVM. We have one service (the largest and oldest) running on REE 1.8.7, but all of the newer ones are either Rails 3 apps running on JRuby or Java web services. Deploying and running on JRuby has been a surprisingly large hassle, but we're writing a lot of infrastructure to make it much easier.  On the Java side, we have developed our own service framework that has built in logging (Log4J), metrics (codahale/metrics), RPC (Protobuf+TCP+SSL), containerization, etc built on top of well known Open Source tools.  We use Postgres, MySQL, HDFS and log files to store data, along with Redis for transient information that we're ok with losing. We're exploring some more exotic data stores, particularly as we start looking into running multiple data centers.  We host our own servers for security reasons. We're currently doing a lot of work around making it easier to spin up new servers and services, distribute configurations and, of course, keep everything secure.

Now to the more complex and pressing question, which is how do I learn how to design interfaces for products. I'm assuming that, as a product manager, you've got a basic idea about product design, workflows, user research, and things of that nature. It is quite possible to teach yourself how to be a user experience designer, as opposed to a visual designer, who typically just does finish design work based on someone else's ""how it works"" wireframes, flows, and mocks. If you want to only be a visual designer, look at local or online art school programs in graphic design. Don't waste your time with web design courses as often the teachers don't know much more than their students. Notable exceptions would be places like Treehouse (online).  So, where do you start learning about user experience design? Read. A lot.  Start with Steve Krug (Don't Make Me Think), Don Norman (The Design of Everyday Things), and The User Experience Team of One (from Rosenfeld Media).

Karen, The pixel dimensional size or Pixels Per Inch (PPI) is dependent on the resolution of the 4X6 inch digital photo. Your 4X6 inch photo if a traditional continuous tone print can be scanned, or digitized at any number of resolutions. You can take the Photo using a digital camera and it can be set at different capture resolutions. The end result is a image viewed on the computer screen at 100% of size if it was a 4x6 inch print when it was digitized, and it was digitized at a low resolution such as 72 pixels per inch (PPI) it will have a pixel dimensions approximately 431 pixels x 288 pixels, and a file size of around 364 kilobytes. The same 4x6 inch photo if digitized at a higher resolution such as 300 PPI (pixels per inch) then will be approximately 1800 pixels x 1200 pixels, and a file size of around 6.18 megabytes. The pixel dimensions are dependent on the image resolution. Web images work differently than press printed images. With press printed images, we must pay close attention to resolution to ensure we get a high-quality print or image reproduction in ink on paper For web images, we must focus on the pixel dimensions. This image below is a basic web image it is 3 inches by 2 inches at 100 PPI and it has the pixel dimensions of 300 pixels by 200 pixels and the file size is 175.8 kilobytes:  The next image this is almost the same image, but higher resolution it could be printed with printing press. It is also 3 inches by 2 inches although it is 300PPI resolution. It has pixel dimensions of 900 pixels by 600 pixels and the file size is 1.54 megabytes. It is still 3x2 inches.  These images are of different resolution and correspondingly different pixel dimensions and file sizes, but they are the same 3 inch by 2 inch display size. A very long answer to your question “What is the pixel size for a 4x6 inch photo?” The answer in relation to the digital world is going to depend on the resolution. as the resolution is high or low the pixel dimension are in turn affected. Hope that makes some sense to you. Is 4x6 a standard photo size? Photo print sizes in the era of Fotomat  The different available print sizes had to do with the many film negative or color negative film size options, along with 35 mm sprocket slide films and the corresponding enlargement paper sizes all handled in photo lab machine processing. This was all related to the aspect ratio of roll films; 126 (28x28 mm), 35 (32x44 mm), 135 (24x36 mm), 828 (28x40 mm), 620 (6x9 cm) film, and few other older film sizes, and the enlargement equipment used to make photo prints. These common aspect ratio sizes still are used today in making prints, specifying prints, even if captured with digital camera; 4x6 (4″x5 7/8″), 5x7, 8x10… Picture frames are made to accommodate these typical sizes, with or with out matting used in the frame. The context and understanding is important to answer the question. The answer is YES; 4 inches by 6 inches is a standard photo print size. And frame choices are available still today that can accommodate that size, as are the mats and larger frames.",2021-03-08T10:11:02.417Z,"How do I design on sketch for a specific pixel screen size?

Multiple designers can work on Sketch files easily because of its size and simplicity in design depth (if Photoshop is a pure designer tool, and InDesign is a simple design layout suite, then Sketch is in between). The simplicity allows for a ‘standardized’ practice of design methods so that not everyone has to figure out how to design something specifically. You may have read about the importance of ‘design systems’ for product organizations of all sizes. The proliferation of ‘design systems’ has grown quickly in the last year. Sketch has played a big role in that.Until recently, Sketch was also the only software to utilize Symbols – design presets that allow other designers (and engineers) to quickly create layouts utilizing already created design elements. This has increased efficiency and allows design teams to have a central governance of design. There are no more ‘one-off designs’ that engineers then waste them implementing. Plugins The open-source nature of Sketch means that outside developers and companies can create plugins that help further the efficiency of designer work flow. Photoshop has had plugins for a while, but it was unruly – Sketch streamlined and encouraged this behavior, making support for quick behaviors possible through plugins. This means that our additional prototyping software plays nicely to Sketch since there are supporting plugins with one another.The support from the design and engineering community is great. Bohemian (makers of Sketch) listen to the community versus someone like Adobe who take forever to update, and spend time on features that they think we want, and not what we need. They simply feel out of touch at times (lately they’ve been better). Which brings me to my final couple of points… Accessibility Sketch and its files are small. Photoshop files can bloat to over 1GB if not carefully designed (smart objects, hi-res assets, etc.). Sketch files are crazy if they are over 100MB. Big difference. Allows for cloud hard drives like Dropbox to be cost-efficient for design teams. Because Sketch has a strong focus on collaboration, the ability for it to work inside of other programs (especially prototyping programs such as Framer, InVision, and Origami) means that the workflow is streamlined. My team is made up of designers who are also user experience generalists. There is a stronger focus on the visual aspect, but Sketch allows to have an all-in-one work flow process versus multiple software to create a specific thing. That’s important. Not from a price perspective, but from a collaboration sense. Output Startups ship fast. The life of the company depends on it. The way the files and designs are created means that engineers can spend less time identifying the CSS and front end development portion, and more time on polishing the interactions. This is crucial for successful products. There are no fancy styles and blending modes and such that simply don’t translate over on the web. Instead, the program enables and pushes best practices in design and therefor allows engineers to develop stronger relationships with their designers.Additionally, the ability to simply export designs at multiple sizes to account for retina, etc. means that we have the flexibility to design where we are comfortable, and expand/iterate from there.",2021-03-08T10:17:38.557Z,"Why is Sketch becoming so popular compared to Photoshop for interface design?

We design for the medium that they use. A designer is someone who deeply cares about the lives of who they design for, and try to solve their problems in the most profound way. 10 years ago, we were designing for a 15-inch computer screen. Every pixel was magnified and resolutions were at 1024x768 at most. We designed for people who were computer literate, so tools like Flash and Photoshop made a lot of sense. We were just looking for the wow effect, trying to impress with every technique in our arsenal. 5 years ago, we were designing for the iPhone. It was the beginning of a time where computers didn't seem scary anymore so the audience grew in big ways. Suddenly, people of all walks of life started using technology. Because these people were unfamiliar with devices, we had to create strong metaphors and use obvious visual cues to make technology more approachable. Again Photoshop made a lot of sense. It's a mature application that makes heavy use of textures, styles, filters, image editing, etc. Today, we want simplicity. There are too many tools, too many devices out there. We now need to filter everything from that technology overload because we have become technology addicts. We want simpler tools to create better products in a more efficient way. We are shifting from products that try to do everything to products that does one thing really well (think Messenger, Paper, Instagram, Vine VS Facebook). And now that people have matured with technology, strong visual cues aren't needed anymore. We want functional designs. iOS 7 came out simplified for the modern user. It relies more on typography, colors, gestures and transitions instead of heavy faux textures and skeuomorphism. Because of that simplicity, design becomes more approachable from a technical perspective. Designers want to learn code because it's more focused on the function and engineers want to learn design because it's easier. Design has become a necessity. The need for design has never been greater and new designers are emerging faster than ever. Photoshop still makes sense for designers who have grown with Photoshop, but because it's so complicated and because it tries to do everything, learning how to do simple UI tasks isn't as obvious. Engineers, product managers and new designers don't want to learn Photoshop. It's costly (a month of Adobe CC is the price of Sketch), innefficient and the learning curve is steep. Sketch is a tool that does user interface design really well. It's more focused on designing multiple screens and it's simple enough for anyone to learn design. Every designer, engineer and product manager understands pixels, smart guides, vector, screens and assets. Sketch does all of those things faster. Photoshop has all of these options buried in a plethora of options for Photographers, Digital Painters, Photo editors, 3D artists, etc. User interface design rarely need those options. They're still handy for experienced designers, but not as essential. Is Sketch for fake designers? I don't think there is such a thing as a fake designer. Everyone is a designer in one way or another. Understand your audience and you'll pick the right tool for your job.",2021-03-08T10:19:14.510Z,"Is Sketch 3 for fake designers?

What I like: You’ve probably already know it, Figma has lots of similarities with Sketch, moving from Sketch to Figma is fairly easy, almost like moving between Adobe Illustrator to Photoshop or Fireworks to Sketch. Shortcuts are the same, Artboards are the same, general layout (left layers, right properties) are similar and so on. Your team probably won’t have major issues switching between Sketch and Figma even on day to day basis.The Symbols aka Components feature in Figma is impressive in terms of the amount of overrides and how you could have 1 component for multiple states of an element, styles (look and feel such as colors) can be unique for each instance of the same component.Team versioning is awesome. As the projects we work on these days gets bigger and bigger, the need for more than 1 designer (e.g. a lead and a junior) to work on a project is needed. We no longer have to deal with multiple Sketch files in Dropbox (we haven’t tried Abstract yet) and merge different art boards into a master Sketch file and deal with sudden multiple instances of the same symbols etc.On collaboration, reviewing of designs done by each other is also very easy, we can both be looking at the same art board, make adjustments to correct mistakes and improve the designs. This is where Figma does really well in supporting pair design (the equivalent of pair programming). We learn together as we design together.Because Figma is a web-based tool, feature releases are almost transparent, no downloading, different versions of Sketch, everyone has the same version every time.What’s driving me crazy: Figma is like a kid that doesn’t play very well with other kids, not even his elder brother Sketch. The only kids that Figma plays well with are weird kids on the block like Dropbox Paper, JIRA (where’s confluence?!) etc. Although he has opened up now to play with Zeplin and Avocode, the other major tools we use for animation, detailed prototyping, client review is still a big hassle.In the Sketch world, when Sketch doesn’t play well with other kids, we have plug-ins to bridge that gap to extend Sketch’s features. Invision Craft, Real Time Board, Zeplin, etc. I really miss the days where I could just copy an art board in Sketch and just paste it off things like Powerpoint, Google Slides, Word or wherever. Figma? Select, set the export settings, Export, Find the file in Finder, Drag and insert into another program. If I’m dealing with 100 screens, I’m gonna waste way too much time moving things around and not focusing on solving problems.“But why can’t you just let people view your designs on Figma directly? That’s what Figma preview is for right?” A developer whom we worked with just sent me this:I just did a quick benchmark of it with Chrome's task manager Just loading the page (""Unee-T-Designs"") is under a peak CPU load of 250% (with a 7th gen i7 CPU), and memory foot print of 350MB After it's loaded the memory foot print climbs up to 1.1GB and then finally settles around 950MB with a constant CPU load of 10-30% :scream: Loading ""Unee-T-Inspection-Report-v3-01"" in comparison, causes a CPU load during loading time that is almost as high, but the memory foot print peaks at 450MB, which makes it more manageable Previewing the designs on Figma for clients whether for developer hand-off or commenting is simply horrendous. We as designers can endure the kind of resources Figma uses on our machine but our clients can’t. The loading time of 1 screen on Figma vs Invision is 15 seconds vs less than 1 second. This is by far the biggest issue we have. Because clients and developers can’t preview or view the designs on Figma well, we have to export our screens to the usual platforms (Invision, Realtime Board) and this process wastes time. Then what’s the point of using Figma in the first place when it’s suppose to be where “everything” takes place in 1 single tool? During the last 3 months of using Figma, theres often times where I felt “Damn, I needa move back to Sketch” only to realise, sorry, Figma is a one way street. Unfortunately, 3 of my projects are all moved into Figma with the grand vision of it being better in the future, I can only hope Figma improves rapidly to address customer needs as soon. A tool has to cater not just for the Designer persona, it has to consider the entire eco-system of users around it and how the tool plays well with these different “stakeholders”. Hope this helps for everyone who wants to move into Figma. Continue Reading",2021-03-08T10:20:08.626Z,"How does Figma compare to Sketch? ",Quora

As an example, say the same subject is being sketched by two different people, the aesthetics of which would depend immensely on the way that they perceive the subject. One of them might focus more on the details while the other might find “perfection” in smudgy contours!  Graphite sketch by Jono Dry (Source: Google images) This a very detailed (hyperrealistic) graphite sketch by Jono Dry, a South African artist.  Charcoal sketch by Kwangho Shin (Source: Google images) This one is a charcoal sketch done by Kwangho Shin, a South Korean artist. Look at the drastic difference between the two sketches! (Although the subject of the two sketches are entirely different, I hope the idea that I want to convey is clear). This concept of “perfection” should be the driving force behind the choices that you make. The most important materials that you need for any sketch that you work on, which you expect to turn out to be your perception of “perfect” are actually common to all the artists and anyone trying to achieve certain goals in life. They would be the four Ds Destination: To be aware of your perception of “perfect”. Depending on it you can set your goals. Deliberation: To think through a strategy on how you would go about the process ( The strategy can be anything, either editing a reference pic to your liking or techniques that can help you get a better finish for your sketch). Determination and dedication: To never loose sight of your goal and to have your heart set on it with absolute commitment. This might be quite tough for people who have taken up art just as a hobby (like I have). To be a dedicated artist, you would need tools that can help you sketch (Obviously!😝). Personally, I love Jono's work. The details in his work are just too brilliant! His work that has been depicted above was started on November 2015, and he completed it on January 2017! The amount of work that he has put in for this particular piece is worth all the praises. To get such a detailed sketch you have to be careful about your choice of paper, graphite pencils, and the techniques that you adopt to get the desired texture. You can look at the tools that Jono use for his works in the video below.  (Source: YouTube) Choosing the perfect tools for your work can be tricky, as there are a wide variety of tools out there in the market. You can get overwhelmed easily. The only way out of this is to choose the tools of your liking and then based on your experience with it, you can keep using it or move on to the next. However, this process would mean a high amount of financial investment, which can be kept at reasonable limits by going through the suggestions of other artists having similar interests as yours. I am an amateur artist (cannot call myself an artist as I am no where near my perception of “perfection”), using the following tools Paper: I had initially invested in Strathmore Artagain 400 series. It had papers with different tints and the thickness was 160gsm. The paper was tinted so that the artist can make use of the colour to blend it into the work. This was not an easy task unless you know the techniques.  Strathmore Artagain 400 series (Source: Google images) Right now, I have switched to Strathmore Bristol 300 series with 270gsm thickness (will update once I finish the sketch that I am trying with this paper).  Strathmore Bristol 300 series (Source: Google images) Graphite pencils: Using Staedler 6 Mars Lumograph pencils helps me acheive darker shades. There are better versions available.  Staedtler 6 Mars Lumograph (Source: Google images) Mechanical pencils are the best to be used wherever you need a sharper finish.  Mechanical pencil (Source: Google images) Blending: I use Paper stumps for blending in a localised area.  Paper stumps (Source: Google images) Cotton stubs can be used for a larger area and it helps to distribute the graphite powder much more evenly on the paper.  Cotton stubs (Source: Google images) Rubber: Kneaded eraser is a must for sketching, as it can be deformed into any shape that we are comfortable with, and can be used to remove graphite from the surface to capture any desired effect.  Kneaded rubber (Source: Google images) Another tool I use for removing graphite from the surface is tombow eraser, which is helpful in highlighting sharp corners.  Tombow eraser (Source: Google images) Scale: To make grids if necessary. Hope this does guide you in choosing the correct materials.",2021-03-08T10:21:11.724Z,"What are the best tools for sketching?

Continue ReadingYou have to understand that even if the data quickly catches eyeballs, still it requires a language and story to make it compelling. 1. Story That Engages The Users Yes, there has to be a story that engages the users. Something that attracts their attention immediately and not make them ignore it altogether. It need not be detailed or complex in the first place, even a single picture is good enough make a story effective! Why use twenty images when a single picture can equally suffice. But if the story demands twenty pictures to convey the meaning and work, then don’t risk in cutting the number. In the end, it all comes up to the need of the story; no excess, no shortage. 2. The Logic Wait a minute. Are you thinking why Designers have to worry about telling stories? But storytelling is not just about creating a tale of romance or rescue or vampires with superpowers. Storytelling is very much a part of our daily lives, like when we see a protest for a cause with hand-painted slogans or a man helping a blind cross the road. All these are stories; brief instances of people resorting to action and contributing to the world around them. To think of it, that’s what the essence of every story is. 3. Express The Vision As you try framing a storyline your objective should be clear. Why is this story necessary? What is the belief that gives rise to the story? What is the focal point? What are you trying to tell the audience? What will persuade your clients? After all, this is not about sales or brand talk; it is a story, a thought, a vision. 4. Words vs Images For designers, visuals carry a lot of significance. Pictures are employed heavily to tell stories. Be it a smiling mother with a shopping cart in a print ad or sight of abundant crops on sustainable farming, all are stories. How do words complement? You might have an impression that writing is the job of writers, yes it surely is, but that is not all about it. When you are handling type, it means you are taking care of the words, i.e., placing them in a manner that captures the reader’s attention immediately. 5. Users as Characters One of the best tricks of storytelling to engage users is to convert them into a character. The website becomes all about them rather for some indefinite entity. This is a brilliant approach. The users have a keen interest in what you are telling as it discloses something unique about themselves. Contemplate of ways in which you can convert your user as a character in the story, either by connecting to them directly or by personalizing the content that is to be displayed. 6. The Reward Game Next tactic that proves to be really fruitful in storytelling is to gamify your site. In other words, follow a system of risk and reward. You got to find methods to make your story reward your users on undergoing certain actions. This practice is common in web and mobile apps, but you can also employ it for your website. The best example to explain gamification is the websites that give credits or points as a way of reward for completing tasks. Rewards, if useful, are great motivators for customers. But do measure the stakes the user has with the level of rewards that you are offering. 7. Interactive Value Some actions are quite predictable online. For instance, clicking and scrolling are actions that are obvious for any user, so to make it interesting add interactivity. If they are trying to click, use images to stress where the users should undergo the action and what it will result in. Do maintain consistency between the tone of your copy and images. A high-resolution image can do the deed well or you can go for Parallax scrolling to narrate a linear visual story as a user scrolls down. Take note that interaction design doesn’t mean adding vibrant animations at every corner of the site. Incorporate additional interactivity into the present user actions and give the users advantage of a powerful experience. 8. Active Visuals Create visuals that respond to the user actions. Yes, even a simple animation can give the leverage and trigger more reactions. This can be through clicking, scrolling or even a complex action like a form submission. 9.

The Bigger Picture Well, we all know every story has a beginning, middle and an end. Even a story supported with a single image runs on the same narrative format, but it is much more relevant for a detailed, complex story. Think of the beginning, middle and end of experience with vigilance. You must consider it from the user mindset- the beginning grants stimulus to the user journey, the middle is the stage when you’ll connect with them and the end marks the accomplishment of the final goal. You have to understand that even if the data quickly catches eyeballs, still it requires a language and story to make it compelling. 1. Story That Engages The Users Yes, there has to be a story that engages the users. Something that attracts their attention immediately and not make them ignore it altogether. It need not be detailed or complex in the first place, even a single picture is good enough make a story effective! Why use twenty images when a single picture can equally suffice. But if the story demands twenty pictures to convey the meaning and work, then don’t risk in cutting the number.

Breaking news: the new version of Adobe Experience Design is just in, reeling in more and more Windows users. There’s a lot going on in this area, and the dust is still far from settling – on the contrary – the battle just started. And there are already many excellent answers in this discussion, covering crucial considerations. Sketch was the first app getting serious attention from routined designers, and Adobe is finally realising that Photoshop isn’t the right tool for everything. Seeing designers use Photoshop to create decent web and app mockups is like an watching an episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race. If you already know and use Photoshop and/or Illustrator, you’ll be happy with the smooth and increasing integration. However, XD doesn’t look and feel like a regular Adobe application at all. The tools look different, there are no movable windows/panels, some shortcut keys are the same, but obvious others aren’t (like zooming in). I’m not complaining, merely observing. But it’s not more or less “seamless” to learn XD than any other decent design tool. And maybe it’s a good thing that Adobe let’s a new application like this take a different approach, in stead of forcing them into the Adobe straight-jacket. If you’re not yet familiar with Adobe tools, you might appreciate Sketch’s fresh approach in stead of the popular but ballast-burden Adobe jumbo’s. Why bother with decades of historically and weirdly grown features, catering for media you’ll never intend to work with ? I’m not very ‘hands-on’ familiar with other UX design tools, but I noticed that Adobe has all its cannons blazing, to let their new prodigal puppy grow in all directions: design, navigate, animate, collaborate, communicate, review, and even… production ! Check this out:Peter Villevoye's answer to: is Adobe XD here to stay? Being biased towards Adobe, I’m happy they’re offering a serious and promising alternative to the many tools out there. It’s good to have a renowned brand taking up this challenge, coming from a history of many decades in all kinds of other design and media tools. But we’ve seen such promises before with e.g. the “Edge” suite… So tune in, and stay tuned, on all channels !

Focus on getting as many conceptual ideas out of your head and onto paper as you can. You can worry about quality later.Critique. This is often missed in the design process. It stems from architecture and industrial design. Basically, you present the goals of the design and your concept to your team. They get to critique the design based on the goals and must provide 2-3 things that work and 1-2 things that either don't work based on the stated goals, or that they'd like to see fleshed out in the next iteration. Follow this process and you'll go from quantity to quality quickly.Iterate. Quickly. The exercise is intentionally time boxed to 5-10 minutes. We use 5 minutes for 6-8 concept sketches. Other teams we've taught the process to use up to 10 minutes. By shortening the amount of time allowed, you force people to focus on the core concept of the design and prevent them from getting lost in the details, which can come later. I've tested 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15 minutes and found that typically 5 minutes is optimal. In fact, the longer I let teams go, the worse the results—they get stuck putting too much detail in one design and not enough time explore alternatives.Sketch. Sketching is a natural way to explore concepts. We're visual thinkers by nature—our first written language was cave paintings. Sketching is also non-commital. The fist time you draw a line in Illustrator, or a pixel in Photoshop, or that first line of code you write, you're committing to an idea. Sketching on paper or a whiteboard is non-commital. You're less attached and can more easily toss it and start over than a digital sketch, which you'll just continually try and revise.Level setting. All the team members get the same tools—sharpies and paper. Designers don't get to use Photoshop. Developers can't use code. Executives can't touch powerpoint. Everyone has the same tool, which instantly levels the playing field. And anyone can sketch. Some sketches might look prettier than others, but my 18 month old son can sketch and you can too.We use this method internally in our design studio as well as conduct half and full day design studio workshops with clients. The results are pretty astonishing. It will change the way you work. We use a similar method we call design studio at messagefirst http://messagefirst.com/.

As per 2016 reports the size of the global fashion e-commerce market is US$332.1 billion which was 28 percent of total e-commerce market. Over the next decade, fashion and apparel industry is expected to be marked by double-digit sales growth driven by an expanding global market and experts are predicting that online fashion business will increase to $706 billion by 2022 which was $408 billion in 2017. Starting online fashion business is obviously a good idea to make money, but it’s not so easy to drive the business to success. However, before discussing some common challenges I’ll give you step by step process for starting an online fashion business. Step. 1 In fashion there are three main segments which are clothing, shoes, Bags & accessories. Decide your ideal customers based on products you have planned to sell or based on current fashion trends. Step. 2 Research the market competition for that products and customer interests, above all, the product you are selling should have demand in the market. Step.3 Start promoting your brand and products on social media before you start selling products online. This helps you in building followers and creating some brand awareness for customers. Step.4 Prepare a complete business strategy from online order confirmation to order delivery. This can be done by studying and analyzing competitors in your niche. Step.5 Once you are ready with the website with payment integration and the products to sell, use the benefits of all available advertising channels online like Social media ads, Google ads, Affiliate networks, Email, etc. Tips for Online Fashion Business Customers these days are expecting free shipping; brands that don’t offer free or low-cost options risk shopping cart abandonment. You may also want to determine what your store’s return policy will be; many top fashion stores online offer free returns. Apart from the payment methods, as customers these days are also expecting free delivery and easy returns, it is better to look into these options as well. In fact, big online sellers like Amazon, myntra, etc. increased their revenue to more than 300 times after introducing these services. Due to the high competition in online business, it is very difficult to gain customers attention by simply promoting products. So you should promote products with discounts, special offers and other attractive gifts to attain the customer attention. Always be available and respond to customer queries, feel like it’s a golden opportunity to understand the customers. The more you understand the customers the better you can deliver your services and products. A website is the core element to your business, never compromise on website UX, the quality of the product images (always use high-resolution images), and never delay in fixing website issues. Challenges in online fashion business Most of the online entrepreneurs spend lots of money on advertising to drive the customers to their website but they end up with very fewer conversion rates (sales) out of all visitors. Most of the people on the online are web surfers, they will not buy anything but sucks all your advertising money, try to capture quality leads by targeting quality audience Demand forecasting is another challenge for small business owners. Since they don’t have any existing records of online customers they couldn’t predict which product has more demand in the market. Fast fashion is the other major challenge that fashion business is facing nowadays by online sellers because, in order to run online business we should show new designs in our websites as users have plenty of options in the online market, they will stop coming to your website.

Just be careful to not get pulled into the seductive blackhole that is the digital toolset.

It's better than trying to 'sketch' in Ai but not as fruitful, on average, as a cheap pencil on the back of an office memo. The more experienced you get, you might find that the more you value your first little doodles. These are often the simplest, freshest, most 'unthought' ideas and therefore the best. Be sure to keep the first sheet! I come from the time before digital. To this day, I lament the loss of the thumbs/roughs/comps workflow. When the client had to discuss and even approve pencil scratches. Why? Compared to the popular workflow today of totally 'finished' looking first drafts, it gave everyone a chance to look at a piece in a more abstract and meaningful structural graphic way. The unfinishedness allowed a more stepback and discuss environment between client and designer. More of a 'I can see the direction you're taking this' at a stage where changes could still be easily made -- rather than, ""I see where you HAVE taken this."" The difference might sound subtle, but in practice, it's crucial. It also firmly separated the designer (who we assume could draw fairly well) from a client with a mouse and a browser. The staged approvals also gave the client more of a sense of the thinking and time that goes into designing a piece. Now they just imagine we click a few menus and we're more or less done. Drawing skills were once the best insulation between professional design skills, and client micro-management. Whereas before they freely admitted they couldn't draw their way out of paper bags, they're much more likely now to think that they don't need to. They'll just Google 'paper bag drawing' instead.",2021-03-08T10:36:26.473Z,"Do designers need to sketch on the board before creating a design? ",Quora

Lastly, as a semi-related tip: Don't take the act of drawing/rendering too seriously. After a certain point in your studies, drawing ability only matters for you, personally, as a designer.

And they DO sketch on napkins because a real designer does not unplug his/her mind when they get up from their desk, drawing board. turn off the computer or have to charge the laptop. They often design at breakfast, or any other time. My partner/husband dreamed all night his problem and then sketched out a freehand plan with critical measurements on bond paper 1:1 before breakfast. Then he’d hand it to me to draft the changes or the missing detail on our project plans. With no ruler or triangle I could even measure details that he had not marked the measurements or work out any points because most everything was there to size. He could not have sketched it so fast with a computer. Years later I did the final drafting in Autocad and/or SolidWorks just the same, off his HB pencil sketches. A real designer forms the design in their brain. A design group works together with their minds in sinc. So quick sketches are the only tools they need to bounce concepts between the design group. By the time they get to the computers it is already basically thought out. Detailed drafting and illustrations are for the clients, accountants and engineers who will get the product to market. When starting with a computer is irreplaceable is when you are re-designing some item that is part of an established product or a product that fits into some physical set or location or shares major parts in a product line. Or, things that depend on specific engineering. Any error in any measurement or shape would delay the project and cost allot. Imagine a fashion designer drawing beautiful sketches for a client whom he/she had never measured their size, weight, age, coloring or the person’s taste. A product designer who has tight specifications must design within those limits. Get out your sketchbook gang! Continue Reading",2021-03-08T11:09:00.438Z,"Do product designers sketch freehand?

Just like with an workflow decision, you should weigh the pros and cons to see what’s the best choice for you. (or in some cases, your team) Play around with a few options to start, mature in one, and re-assess down the road. If you’re into web-based tools, Proto.io is a decent choice. It has support for some JavaScript calculations to further tune your animations, especially for more complex tasks when numerous things are moving. However, like with any web-based applications, Proto begins to slow down as you add more screens and animations, which can be a huge pain when you’re trying to work with many screens. If you’re looking for a short learning curve, shoot for Pixate. After Google acquired it, it’s been showing some promise as one of the better beginner/intermediate tools. The application can generate native prototypes so interactions on mobile devices seem far more realistic than an augmented sequence. Their Sketch integration is still in the works, but should be here sometime soon. If you’re looking for fine-tuned detail, Framer is for you. You’ll see every review or comparison between prototyping tools mention Framer as the ‘one that needs some coding’. That is very much the case - you’ll need to know JavaScript/CoffeeScript to use all that Framer has to offer. Being able to run calculations through the engine and render on a mobile device is done well. There is definitely a learning curve but you’ll end up with more customized results. If you’re looking for a Sketch-esque experience, Principle is great. Integration with Sketch is a breeze, animating pieces to move based on gestures is great, and its preview mode can be recorded to showcase on Dribbble. First gestures are automatically transitioned too, so your prototype can come to life just after one animation. (plus, the UI is very similar to Bohemian Coding’s Sketch) Though future updates may help improve the animation structure, I find Principle’s animation states to be messy once you have a few elements moving from one state to the next. If you’re looking for the best, well, that’s subjective. As mentioned earlier, you should be looking for the tool that’s best for you. (some people say Google Maps is best because its been here longer, but others say Waze because its shinier) As someone who’s tried all tools (as every designer should before locking one in) across all types of projects, I find Flinto to be the best-fit to earn a spot in my workflow. It integrates beautifully with Sketch, has a straight-forward UI, is capable of advanced transitions if you know what you’re doing, and has a before-and-after take on transitions which makes visualization and fine-tuning simpler to accomplish. It does have its performance bugs from time to time as well as some annoying grouping issues from Sketch which get better with each update, but all-in-all, has been my go-to for a while now. I’m looking forward to seeing Silver Flows make its way to Sketch. (an animation tool for Sketch which Invision acquired in March of this year) It’s claimed to be a ‘lightweight’ tool which generally means its not going to be capable of the more advanced animations right out of the box, but with community support, should be able to see great things come to fruition. Something to consider: you’ll notice I didn’t take pricing into consideration here, and for good reason. Money shouldn’t be holding you back from doing great work. Find a way to get the tools that you found worked for you, will enable you to deliver great products, and tool up your design workflow to work effectively. TL;DR: Use what feels right.

Mainly because the world isn’t balanced. I mean, not all have the money and facility to purchase and use a digital device right now. Maybe in the future, if we extrapolate the rate of development of electronic devices at low cost, it will be possible. But it will take some time for the whole world to get accustomed to digital drawing.I guess that won’t happen any soon. Till then, drawings on papers will have it’s part, and people will keep seeing it around. Possible future Remember Wall-E?Remember the Captain?Remember the scene when captain actually finds a ‘Book’? A manual book used for controlling the axiom?  Probably that’s how people might react in the possible future, when they see or hear about drawings on paper! In that case, paper drawings will be treated rare. There will be a time when they become a luxury. Probably. And that’s before people see it as a way to earn a lot of money.

From my perspective Sketch is made for designing graphics that are easily replicable in webkit. No effects that can’t be coded with css and no shapes that cant be coded with SVG.  Illustrator has some very powerful functions when it comes to creating shapes: Art brush - by creating one you can wrap any shape on any path - it’s not always perfect but it’s very impresive (How to Make a Custom Illustrator Brush)Variable stroke width - you can change the width in any point on the path (Mastering Variable Width Strokes in Illustrator CS5)Perspective grid tool - will put things in perspective (Create a Shimmering Cityscape in Perspective, Using Illustrator CS5)Mesh tool - allows you to blend colors from point to point on the grid (Basics of the Mesh tool in Illustrator)Blend tool - creates intersections between selected extremes live!

Sheet steel is not easy to manipulate into shape. Car panels are stamped by enormous presses from very thin (around 1mm!), flexible sheet metal, and strength comes from curvature. As a result you will never find a completely flat surface on any car! Almost all these metal cars are welded together from these sections or panels of steel, creating joins we call panel gaps. all surfaces are curved The first principle to follow is that of curvature. No matter how subtle the curve, every single surface on any car is curved. To keep design and manufacturing simple, cars tend to concentrate curvature in one direction. Most of the form is horizontal to the ground. 21st century car design is certainly changing this simplicity though, with many new vehicles such as BMW’s ground breaking designs showing complex interactions of differing curvature. the shoulder  the shoulder Using this simple example we can see what is called the shoulder of the car, or otherwise known as the catwalk. All cars have this form, varying from being barely visible, to being the dominant feature of the car (Audi TT). The shoulder can rise or fall (BMW Z4), but is generally almost perfectly horizontal along the length of the car. The best view is from the front. This straight horizontal shoulder is present along the door of nearly all cars. The yellow line is a basic outline that can be applied to all cars. The width of the shoulder will vary, but the principle that the widest part of the car is along the center, between the wheels, rarely varies. The curve of the shoulder decides where the light and shadow divide along the car. Sometimes this point can be exaggerated by a sharp edge, or even a crease, as on the BMW 3 series. The top half in front view is also extremely similar on every car. The angle of the side windows is known as tumblehome and is always angled in from vertical apart from very rare exceptions (eg. Fiat Multipla). The side glass is not curved from the front view. The roof also follows the principles of never being flat, and is usually curved in both directions for maximum strength. plan shape  plan shape Nearly all cars will have curvature in plan view. Aerodynamics are the main reason for this, along with styling issues involved in hiding front or rear overhangs. The main area for curvature in the plan view is the glasshouse, the top half of the vehicle shape, where the windows are. The glass on cars is only ever single curvature. This is due to the lens effect of double curvature glass! The yellow lines show the usual shape of the glasshouse, tapering to the rear. There are also some regulations governing the windscreen angle, which must never be less than 30degrees from horizontal. Plan view curvature can vary a lot on the bodywork of cars, with larger cars often showing much more shape than smaller ones. Large front and rear overhangs (overhang is literally how much the bodywork hangs over the front or rear axle line) are hidden by rounding the corners of the car in plan view. wedge  wedge The side view shows how the screen has no curvature from top to bottom. Also we can see how the main shoulder line of the car is horizontal, with a slight angle to the upper part of the bodywork. This slight angle is known as wedge, and is also a matter of aerodynamics. Also note the slight wheel arch lip. This is nearly always present to finish the edge of the metal panel neatly. Some cars have large wheel arch shapes. Traditionally these blend into the body smoothly, but a more modern trend is to emphasize the join (Opel Astra, Ford Focus). packaging Probably one of the most restrictive aspects of vehicle design is known as packaging. This is simply the way that a designer must fit all the components that make up a car, inside specified dimensions. The largest and most important objects to be packaged are the occupants, and the engine. These two components completely dictate the overall dimensions and proportions of every car. Vehicles involve some of the most complicated packaging problems of any product, as there are so many components, and endless safety considerations to integrate. Modern technology means that engines and other components are getting smaller, creating more space for occupants through innovative solutions (Mercedes A-Class), but traditionally there are still only four main ways of packaging a vehicle. The diagram shows these solutions, using the basic components of engine, transmission, cooling radiator (grey) and driver (red). It should be clear how these components affect the overall silhouette of the car. The position of the driver and glasshouse also dictate the position of the doors, which are not shown. All the cars have front mounted radiators, which need an aperture to feed air into them, but additional venting is usually needed around the engine. This results in apertures in varying positions, so it is important to always consider the internal architecture of the vehicle.  common vehicle layouts Most of these examples are 2 seat cars, but it should be clear that the number of seats in a vehicle will have a major effect on the size and shape. For example, the diagram of a front wheel drive car could present a different silhouette if only 2 seats were considered. Also a mid engine vehicle can sometimes have a radiator mounted beside the engine. This will remove the need for an aperture at the front for the radiator, and increase the size of the apertures along the side of the car (Lamborghini Diablo). Another aspect of packaging is the fuel tank. This is subject to regulations, and must me located within the wheelbase. It is usually behind the driver, even on the mid engine design. The location will dictate the placement of the filler nozzle. A rear engine design is the only exception, where sometimes the filler nozzle is located in the front wing of the car (Porsche 911) wheels These are another major component to package into a car, as they not only have to move up and down, the front wheels must also turn. All car wheels are roughly the same overall diameter of no more than 600mm, or 300mm radius. The proportion of the wheel to tyre is the part that will vary, along with the width. Race cars will sometimes have larger diameter wheels, but only at the rear. A key difference between road and race cars are the number of wheel nuts. 4 or 5 for road cars, but usually only one on a race car. rules & regulations There are almost unlimited rules and regulations involved in vehicle design. Each market has Type Approval regulations that need to be met by all vehicles. The regulations cover every aspect from the weight, safety, standard equipment required (lights, horn etc.), to detail design such as door handles, and interior fittings.

Illustrator is just better at working vector art, icons, logos, etc. If I’m downloading someone else’s brand elements, they’re going to be in a version that Illustrator can edit, but Sketch will flatten into an image. I can copy the vector from illustrator and paste it into Sketch no problem and retain that control. Photoshop is simply better at image editing. It’s interesting to see Adobe hide a lot of the “UI” design elements in the default tool layout. Last week I needed to mock something up that would show a lookup for an aircraft. Found a graphic that would do but I needed to invert it and adjust the levels so it read correctly when I used a screen transfer mode. Sketch just doesn’t do that kind of image editing yet. In addition to that, I am often doing print pieces in InDesign, mocking up web animations or doing text animation and bumpers in After Effects, cutting training videos together (I use Final Cut Pro, but Premiere is totally capable), and recently been experimenting with Adobe’s UX prototyper, “XD” (using screens from Sketch). InDesign is also great when preparing client presentations or generating requirements documents (if you’re not collaborating with an engineering team directly). Oh yeah, and I manage 20 years of photos with Lightroom (classic, not that new cloud crap). I don’t use a lot of the other elements in the suite, e.g. Audition, as I have a full ProTools HD rig and studio here (20+ years of playing in bands, producing, and remixing). And if I’m color grading, it’s in Final Cut with Red Giant plugins. I don’t expect a designer to be an expert on every tool in CS. I expect a designer to at least be proficient in the trifecta: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign. Any day-to-day design work will often use all of these. Similarly, you need to be able to do the basics in Word/Excel/Powerpoint (or OpenOffice, or the Apple variation of Pages/Numbers/Keynote, which I prefer). This is just the reality of working in an office. Similarly, if you get in there and I ask you how you’d do a card sort or how you’d break down this user story into component parts ranked by need and you were unable to do that, you’d be missing skills required to do the job. If you don’t know these tools, run through a basic digital getting started book from Adobe. You won’t be an expert, but you’ll be capable enough to not stare at the interface blinking in a stupor when put in front of it.

ID sketching is seeking to get as close to the literal appearance of how the eye would see the form of a product. So my advice to you would be to find an art class or design art fundamentals that teach these basic things to be an effective ID sketcher: Understand 1, 2 & 3 point perspective drawing - “worm eye”, “bird’s eye”, etc. practice these with round objects (ellipses and spheres), blocks and still life drawing of everyday things. Quick and long stroke techniques utilizing line weight to add character and depth to the line work.Understand shadow and color - learn how light plays off the surface of an object. Using the color and/or gray scale (pencil) techniques of shadow core, back lighting and reflections. How detailed depends on desired objective, but the quicker the better, so you can burn through as many iterations as you can dream up.Life drawing! This has been invaluable to me since ID requires so much of the human element in the composition. Drawing hands and the silhouette of the human form all in proper proportions adds the right setting and context for your product sketches.Just do an internet search for “industrial design sketches” and you’ll see a plethora of examples of the above skillset.

Sketching does precisely that and lets you see whether what you have in your head will work or not. This applies to problem-solving as well, since problem-solving actually is the essence of every designer’s work. But here’s an interesting thing: your sketch will hardly ever be the same as you pictured it initially, and although it sometimes happens to beginners due to lack of skill, it is not the case I am talking about. The thing is that sketching jumpstarts your thinking process, and the idea begins to evolve constantly right while you are sketching. It helps you to think of more details and see the fallacies the way you might not have seen them in your imagination. Sketching, in a nutshell, is a certain type of brainstorming. It makes you more focused on your work, helps understand what you are trying to achieve in a certain project. Often several different sketches provide you with several good ideas that you can later blend together into the final draft. Hardly anyone can work out a brilliant design straight from their mind, and sketches help greatly to reconstruct your ideas later when you might have forgotten them already. By the way, letting you forget and defragment your brain is one more important function of sketching: when you have your ideas somewhere aside from your own mind, you can free your temporary memory to work on something new. Therefore, sketching is the backbone of every successful design, and it is hard to overestimate its importance.",2021-03-08T12:18:33.761Z,"What is the importance of sketching when designing or problem solving?

To do this, you will need to know a couple simple drawing tips. Without it, you can't create clear, fast freehand drawings. (Don't worry, it's not a how to draw answer, but a how to control your lines to make clear drawings answer) The main idea is to focus on the most important aspect of your concept. What is your most stand out property of your product? If it's a dispenser, draw simple blocks/shapes of the dispenser. Forget the screws, texture, patterns, etc. Just draw in the main shape of your design using simple lines. Using a ballpoint pen and a cheap memo pad/sketchbook/big sticky notes can help you sketch out ideas fast. Doing this will prevent you from lingering on a drawing. If you drew a bad line that didn't go with the initial design, start on a new one. Starting on a new drawing after a quick first one will always turn out better than the first. Doing this will also subconsciously make you think about your design and whether or not it'll work. It's like jotting down fast notes for a bigger essay you'll write later.  Here's some quick drawing tips to clear drawing: Stay focused on: Clear shapes, object contours and controlled lines.  Peter Han, the artist in the video below goes over drawing techniques for concept sketching. I know you don't need illustration advice, but watching this video through will help you get your lines in control which will result in faster, more accurate concept sketches.

With that being said, you don’t have to learn Rhino/SolidWorks in High School, but it will give you a huge advantage. If your High School only teaches AutoCAD and not Rhino/SolidWorks then I would still highly recommend taking it. I had 4 years of AutoCAD and Inventor in High School and it was well worth it. My sophomore year of studying Industrial Design we were required to take a SolidWorks class. Fortunately for me, the core functionality of CAD programs and the 3D way of thinking you develop, translate very well to other 3D programs. Needless to say, I was able to pick up SolidWorks in a few days, whereas I had classmates that could barely model simple products by the end of the semester. Figure Out if You Like 3D Modeling Figure out if you even like to do 3D modeling. Although you will likely be required to take at least one 3D modeling class for your Industrial Design degree, you don’t have to be a “CAD monkey” when you graduate. CAD programs have become so advanced, and they’re always evolving, therefore many companies and design firms hire “CAD Engineers” that use the program 8 hours a day. A lot of Industrial Designers will focus on the sketching, prototyping, etc… if 3D modeling is not their strength. Contrary, I know a few Industrial Designers that are so good with CAD that they use it as their way of mocking up ideas (instead of sketching). Focus on Mastering One or Two Things My biggest suggestion to any High Schooler heading off to a College or University to study Industrial Design would be to focus on mastering one or two skills. Focus on mastering one or two skills. Design consultancies and even most corporate companies will hire based on very specific credentials and skills. Often times teams are formed where each individual is really good at one or two things (research, sketching, prototyping, CAD, and so on). The team made up of masters will create far better designs. There simply is not enough time in College to master every skill used by Industrial Designers. You will find it very hard to get a job if you are mediocre at everything, and your portfolio will likely show it. Mastering one or two skills will also give you the benefit of going out on your own and freelancing, for small and large companies. Tip: If you really want to get ahead and learn SolidWorks then take the essential training class on Lynda.com. After you complete the essential training it really comes down to practice, practice, practice.

Some areas of design where you’d need to draw well in order to communicate ideas are industrial design, where early concepts are often drawn by hand, architecture, fashion and interior design. If you’re planning to focus on digital product design, web, print, packaging or brand design to name a few, drawing is not a crucial skill. If you can make a rough sketch to help your own creative process (even if it’s the worst chicken scratch), you’re good. Design is about problem solving, empathy and intuitiveness more than it is about visuals and artistic expression. Adequate visual skills are important off course, but not drawing or sketching. I used to be a graphic designer myself, I’ve since moved to product and I also do quite some digital illustration in my day-to-day work and I still can’t draw too good by hand. That’s not a skill that’s crucial to working in design, so don’t get too worked up about it. On a side note, drawing by hand is a mechanical skill anybody can learn with a lot of practice and I encourage you to do that if you’d like to be better at drawing.

Typically in the creative services (advertising, graphic design studio, marketing departments, involving graphic design, web design or other communications; the creative director, art director, graphic designer) sketches start as thumbnail sketches on paper sometimes formal sketch pad, but napkins have been used, sticky notes, back of envelopes, business cards. Then rough sketches, then tight sketches and next comprehensive sketches. At one time these were all created on paper medium. Artists, Visual Communicators, Designers of all disciplines, are trained and have been trained this way for hundreds of generations, because it works. This is how ideas are formed and developed using design methodology. Pencil on paper is fast efficient way to get ideas started. Once you have some promising thumbnails and good directions, via a lot of exploration and many thumbnail sketch variations. The best of these are chosen made into rough sketches. A bit more refinement, tad of detail, more directed exploration and variation. This is on paper or can be on I-pad or similar, at this point the best roughs are shared, with colleges, then the best of roughs with client in formal presentation. Sketch revisions of roughs, are made into tight sketches, more things in design process are fleshed out, direction picked. Working in computer graphic workstation at this juncture becomes beneficial to methodology and process. Through process of sketch presentation, revisions eventually you have a comprehensive sketch and then production drawings which-ever the design discipline. Before sketches start, a process of discovery happens. Creative brief is written, project goals, milestones, themes, requirement, responsibilities and more are worked on. Signed contracts and project deposits have to happen. Even a very small project these things happen at some level. It is very tough to start using CAD in maya, auto-cad, illustrator, sketck-up what-ever the application as the Precision of the computer/application tool is too much. The computer drawing application tools, that are on i-pad, surface, and similar are at point that they act as or much like pencil paper sketch pad. Ideas can be sketched quickly. These are being adapted more and more. The wacom drawing touch screens and the pressure sensitive tablets, and parallel tool brands were pretty costly, and again brought certain restriction and so much precision these were not always the efficient path to begging sketches. These tools also require a great deal of learning. Then the basic computer interface, drawing with a mouse is akin to drawing with a bar of soap. Paper and pencil, or stick in good dirt, can be more productive at sketching. If you are supposed to? No laws or requirements are enforced, the CAD police are not going to be coming after you. Thumbnail sketches are suppose to be simple sloppy quick. Paper and pencil is cost effective and perfectly acceptable. Computer pads are becoming affordable and common and also finding a place in design methodology and creating thumbnail and rough sketches. Best success to you Rach.

You can create a technical or stylized drawing of what you may want to see as a designer, but making patterns requires measurement, geometry, and usually multiple fittings and refinement. I went to school to learn pattern making along with design. I was taught the basics of flat pattern drafting using various textbooks and by using “blocks” (basic pattern shapes) to help give a framework in shaping different style lines, darts, pleats, gathers, tucks, facings, ruffles, cuffs, waist bands, collars, and other design details to create different types of garments. After flat pattern making I learned how to “drape” clothing. This method requires using a dress form to create the foundational block that you make by pinning fabric to the dress form, which then gets translated to paper so that you can recreate the garment and refine the details. Draping is the easiest way for most people to self teach pattern making. Because you can just pin the fabric the way you want to see it, trim away the excess and stitch it into place and finish it. That may sound easier than it is, but from my experience this is the way most people learn on their own with no formal training. The translation to paper and the flat pattern is the next level to the refinement process in this method though. And sometimes gets over looked in hobby or one off clothing creation, but if you want to recreate the design over and over you need a flat paper pattern to do so. Most of the time draping and flat pattern making are used hand in hand. Draping is a quicker way to “sketch” out an idea in fabric, but you need the flat pattern to refine and add details. So you may create a draped design on a dress form that you would then lay out and trace to paper, then create other flat pattern pieces to finish the design (facings or collars or waistbands, etc) sew it together, fit the garment to a live model, see how it is working, refine the way it fits through pinning (taking in seams, adding darts or pleats) and then translate those adjustments to the flat pattern. It's not an exact science all the time, each garment is different question and answer, but it's an exacting process that requires practice and patience. I hope this answer helps in finding the direction you were looking for. Enjoy!

If you're hand drawing something and you want the print to look hand drawn that is much easier than taking a hand drawing and looking to have it turned into a computer graphic. They can either scan your design and modify it from there or start from scratch going off of your sketch. Most screenprinting shops do offer in house graphic artwork, though there is the option of finding a designer outside of the print shop to do this for you. Most graphic artists, in my area anyway, charge about $60-$90 per hour to do this for you. So its definitely helpful to find an experienced designer who can complete the project in a reasonable amount of time. ‘Reasonable’ really depending on the difficulty of your intended design and quality of your sketch or ability to give exact details on what you are looking for. If you're unsure of what you want or open to suggestions, the process could take awhile of going back and forth on details and changing little things everytime you speak with the designer. All that being said, it's also a good idea to take into consideration what you intend to do with the design. Are you just looking to have one of these made? Is it going to be something you'll be using for a business or a group that will reorder a couple times in a year? Depending on what the garment will be for, should really help when deciding how basic or intricate you want the artwork to be and ultimately whether or not itd be best to let a designer pull something together quickly or to get into an involved possibly lengthy designing process with one.

Please understand, this doesn't make my Adobe programs any less valuable; if anything it makes them more useful by allowing them to excel at what they are best used for. Building the web with Photoshop and Illustrator was always a bit of a hack. Fireworks had the right idea, but was cursed with a clumsy interface. Sketch 3 combines vector graphics with an ease of use that is commendable; it's so damn easy to use that it would have fit nicely into Apple's portfolio (sort of amazed they haven't been bought for this reason). Also, it doesn't hurt that Sketch 3 costs $79, whereas Adobe CS costs $20 a month. It literally took me 3 days to go from rookie to completely solid in Sketch, based on my knowledge of other graphic design programs. I think the most complicated thing I had to figure out was how to add independent rounding to corners. For a veteran, it was really fast to learn without being really lame to use. As a professional, the first thing you realize is how damn powerful symbols are. When designing a UI, there is a lot of repetition of text and shapes styles, as well as complete elements (buttons, picture frames, etc). While the concept of symbols and styles isn't new, it's a whole lot less work than it would be in a program like Illustrator for the simple reason that Sketch focuses on the web designer's flow vs. the artist's flow. While you won't find the tightly tuned artist's tools in Sketch that you would in Illustrator, or frankly ANY of the bitmap editing capacity of Photoshop, what you will find is that the process of creating an interface is really streamlined. Once you get things laid out, it's useful to be able to right click an item and get its CSS properties, or hold down alt and see exactly how far it is from its neighboring elements. Iterations are a snap if you've built with styles and symbols and the grid/layout overlays are super clean. Sketch 3 fits really nicely between a high fidelity prototype and a wireframe. UX Apps like InVision, which encourage codeless prototyping, form an incredibly powerful synergy with Sketch as iterations become far simpler to execute and re-output. Really, what I'm trying to distill for you is that the creative flow of Sketch is a spot on match for the creative flow of the UI design process. I wouldn't want to use Sketch to create illustrative graphics, or output multiple photo variants after a shoot -- but for UI development? It's really second to nothing; and it's not even particularly close. 13",2021-03-08T13:31:43.244Z,"Why has Sketch 3 suddenly become the tool of choice for so many web designers? ",Quora

Get a basic commercial dress pattern with fitted top, straight skirt and make yourself slopers of the parts using a tough paper.From the slopers you can draw out the parts of your pattern design.  In the next step if you're going beyond the drawing you can true the fit in muslin and then make a permanent pattern of tissue paper. If you want to know how an amazing designer draws and develops a pattern, take a trip to the NY Metropolitan Museum of Art show of Charles James.

Select an element and hover over another while holding alt. You'll find that it measures the distance between the two objects. This is really helpful when it comes to coding your app. More info on the feature is available on sketchapp.com.  Symbols A tip specifically for wireframes is to make use of the Symbols feature.  Let's say you want to insert a certain sized image placeholder in many different screens, but don't want to have to copy and paste them all. By using the symbol feature, you can use the element over and over again.  If you change the size of the placeholder on one of the screens, they will all change automatically. You don't have to worry about going back to each and every screen and changing the size. Just select your object, click symbol and viola! You'll have an element you can access quickly.   There are a ton more features you could use, but that would take forever.

Though roles and responsibilities may vary across the industry, the standard set of responsibilities a developer is entrusted with are functionality and implementation - not designing interfaces. Passionate learners in the startup industry specifically believe (in most cases) that you should be aware and knowledgeable of concepts two levels below your own. As an example, UX designers are responsible for planning, backing, and designing user experiences but they should also be concerned with what happens after they handoff their work to the next level, which in most cases is development. Technologies being implemented, frameworks/libraries being considered, roadmap planning and things of the sort are some of the factors that development leads (potentially CTOs) are entrusted to resolve. A step further than development may be execution, though it could easily vary based on the company. For execution, that could involve things like product rollout and operational insurance. Across the developers I’ve personally worked with on a daily basis, I find them to be curious about user experience choices that I make which I find most welcoming. However, they themselves on the other hand, are always more concerned with how they’re implementing it based on the specifications given to them, maintaining the product during launch, and how their implementation may flaw the product. That’s a developer concerned with levels below his own, not above. The barrier between designer and developer has been communication, which may not be the easiest thing to do or properly accomplish. Tools like Zeplin, Avocode, and others that integrate directly with Sketch have made mockup, specification and asset handovers a breeze. Focusing on what effects your work is making on the levels below you is far more valuable than those above you. TL;DR: No. Developers are focused on one thing - functionality.

The most valuable asset you have in the jewelry sketching process is your mind. In this first phase, it is all about experimenting with shapes and colors. In this stage, what you sketch may turn out aesthetically pleasing, or it may not! The point is to play around with ideas in your head. Even if you do not like the result of this initial sketch, you have still made progress and you now have a clearer idea of what you want your piece to eventually look like. Don’t forget to keep copies of your sketches for later reference. Not only will you learn from your own progress, but you can go back and remind yourself of what your thought process was of a certain piece.   If you are not sure what materials to use for sketching, here is a list of suggested items you can choose to use throughout this process: Paper (mixed media paper is your best option)Pencils for light sketchingRulers for creating geometric shapes/straight linesStencils for creating perfect circles, ovals, etc.Ink/Pens for darkening initial pencil outlinesPaint, markers, colored pencils, etc. to add color to your workDon’t Just Design, Capture Inspiration   Beautiful things are born out of what the naked eye is able to capture. When you are brainstorming and sketching jewelry ideas, get out into nature to find your muse, or simply sit on a balcony and people watch. For example, one of the sketches shown features flowers and foliage that could be later used to incorporate into a new jewelry piece. Another sketch features a more fledged out idea for a necklace design, inspired by the art and architecture found in Lisbon, Portugal. Whether you are taking inspiration from others’ art such as architecture or statues or drawing from the art of nature, know that art surrounds you always. Don’t be afraid to add beauty to the world! Utilize Language and Take Notes    As you begin to draw and brainstorm, you may have a certain thought in your mind that has inspired your sketching. Take note of what is going through your mind as you draw so that you can return to your work later and remember for what purpose you sketched something. Sometimes when a concept or idea strikes you, you may not have a clear picture of what that piece of jewelry will look like. This should not stop you from writing down your thoughts. Remember, anything goes when it comes to brainstorming, as this is part of the creative process. You will also want to write down things such as desired measurements and the types of material you plan on using. You will thank yourself for taking these things into consideration when you go to buy supplies for your jewelry. It’s important to know exactly what you will need, especially if you are working with more expensive materials such as precious gems or metals. See Original Work From a Jewelry Designer From jewelry design sketch to finished product, the process for jewelry-making is intricate and unique. Here is a bullet-pointed recap of what to remember about sketching jewelry: Start with big ideas, then hone in on detailsCultivate inspiration from outside, and bring it withinRemember that the written word can also be a part of your sketchesTake note of important details such as size and materials you want to useIt can take years to master your jewelry-making technique, but the greatest artists are the ones who are constantly learning and growing. Don’t be afraid to try new things or to make mistakes. It is all a part of the learning process. You can also take inspiration from artists who have gone through the drafting process to create stunning finished work.

Nowhere near great, but a huge step up from where I started.  That being said, I do have some specific tips and advice for you. First, the following are indispensable assets for ID sketching: Copic Maker (32 set), Prisma Color Pencils (48 set), Sakura Micron Pens (8 set). These are really the bare minimum in any industrial designers toolbox. I would recommended working with color pencils at first if you are not familiar with copics — although, I did the opposite. Next, I would say that composition is just as important as the renderings themselves. ID sketches are meant to tell a story. Your sketches need to convey what the product does, how the product works, and the products specialties. Finally, practice practice practice. Unless you are descended from the Da Vinci lineage, ID sketching won’t come easy. Many hours — 10,000 some would argue — go into mastering a craft. Put the work in and the results will show. All industrial designers, myself included, have been in your position before. Best of luck!",2021-03-08T14:19:23.584Z,"How do you scope industrial design sketching? ",Quora

You have to give the first production run of your cars (I don’t know the number now, but it used to be ten or twenty) to various government agencies where they will put them through tests to see that they meet emission and safety and other required regulations before they can be sold in the US. (They will destroy at least ten of your cars in crash tests, so…) If your car passes these tests, you’re ready to go. If it doesn’t, you will have to go back and redesign it until it does. So there you have it. After at least three years and a few billion dollars, you are ready to sell your first car.

Plus, there is so much press around fashion - that everyone who is creative is drawn to it - but in the end it all comes down to math - how are you going to fund it, the garments and patterns the self are all about specifications and profit, etc. etc. To be honest, my husband is in technology, and there are absolutely fascinating things happening there just begging for creative talents who are well educated.  If you still want to do it - I'd get a computer science or business degree and learn everything you can about colors, clothing construction, pattern making, draping and sewing in your spare time, as well as Adobe creative suite programs.  You don't need to go to fashion school - that's a 10k lesson in confidence - you'll learn everything you learn in fashion school in about 3 weeks as a designer's intern if you are willing to work late into the nights, able to listen and ask good questions.  You do need to know about garment construction - all of which you could learn by buying a sewing machine and sitting down at it daily to make ever more difficult projects.  Why computer programming or business?  Because these are the two areas you will pay out big and loose big if you don't have understanding of Ecommerce and business principles.  Of all the technical skills, I find pattern making to be the most expensive and difficult thing to find.  Additionally, it's very hard to find a pattern maker who can understand your vision and get your fit - and they are often odd/difficult people to work with - so it would be the best technical skill to grasp.",2021-03-08T14:33:48.207Z,"How do I upload my fashion design sketches and earn some money?

So, we will design the system such that, even if there is no sun for 1 day, still the battery will have enough charge stored Also, we assume that Depth of Discharge is 50% ( This is the safe margin for Lead Acid Batteries ) So, 10 units * 2 Days *2 (1/DOD) = 40 kWh Lets assume, your system voltage is 24 V So, battery Ampere - Hour = 40000 Wh / 24V = 167 Ah So, you need a battery capacity of 167 Ah For the charge controller, 2000 W/24 V = 84 A Safety margin of 84 A*1.25 = 105 A is your charge controller rating Hope it helps.

You just need to be able to express your ideas to others efficiently, and Sketching is a medium, among various others, that will help you do this. For example, instead of drawing out a rough floor plan by hand, if you find making the same on a computer (Illustrator/Photoshop) easier, more efficient, more helpful, then that is your way and it is as good as other ways to do it. Or you might find 3d Modelling and rendering to be something that interests you more than sketching does. You may prefer making a 3d model to help you in visualizing your design concepts, as you might be much better at this than sketching. It might help you in explaining/showing your design ideas to other people like your employers or employees or your clients. Actual physical models can also be a great way to do the same. I am not very good at sketching so I got myself an iPad Pro, and it enhanced my capabilities as a designer. I can make sketches on it that look professional and meet my needs. Nobody cares if I made it with a paper and a pencil, or I made it on a tablet and printed it out. My employers like my sketch and they don’t care, neither do the clients. The point is, it is your ideas, your concepts, your design process,etc that matter the most. All of these aid you in expressing them. Now of course all of these skills are of huge importance to a designer and every one of them is better and worse than the others in is this or that aspect. You should figure out the one for you.

They are just a way to quickly get an idea down on paper and keep it for later if it isn’t chosen. Sketches often times contain quick brain flashes that may or may not end up in the final design. Either way they are often drawn upon in future designs when the person is looking for something and they all of a sudden remember because they sketched it. If it wasn’t for the actual sketching of the idea in the first place it is rare a person could remember because memory is fleeting but the process of sketching actually embeds the idea deeper in the memory block Isac Galvao,2021-03-08T14:53:16.036Z,"Why does one have to draw sketches first before a design?

Also, the sketch file needs to be first downloaded and then opened to view. Receiving feedbackThis can be done mostly in-person sitting face to face. An alternative for these is using a tool called Abstract.  It’s a wonderful tool for the syncing of the sketch file to be shared within a team. But, it requires an extra effort to do that.  Why do I feel Figma can take over Sketch? Both Sharing and Receiving feedback problems have been solved by Figma. It’s an online web service rather than offline. Everything that you create in the Figma file stays in the cloud. Also, giving read and edit access to other team members makes it a powerful tool. There are even comment section and all the artboards can be prototyped in Figma itself.  One can conclude that Figma is becoming a Super App for designers. Everything in one place.  Sketch has always been the first choice of every designer but collaboration has always been a problem. The very first reason why the team moves from Sketch to Figma is because of the collaboration. From the business point of view, if Sketch can come up with upgrades and tries to shift their use cases to collaboration and prototyping, it can gain it’s popularity back. Why? Because switching from one tool to others, requires a bit effort from team members to practice and get similar to the new design tool.  Thanks for reading.

You’re better off sticking to Sketch and maybe learning another tool like Framer X or Figma to show your range and ability to understand tools. I personally think the future of UI design is in React and Web Components, as native applications become less popular because of the economics of creating 2 apps for one goal, web apps, and hybrid web-based mobile apps are becoming extremely popular even in large companies. You can learn Sketch really well and take a look at React and Airbnb’s GitHub project for creating Sketch designs using React, then once you’re comfortable with that you can start learning Framer X and Framer API in order to be a more future-proof product designer.

She said “I cut the umbical chord with a sharp edge stone that was lying near by.” SHE DID IT HERSELF.Naturally, the incident deeply affected her and she thought of committing suicide.In the ended, she started begging so that she could have enough money to feed her child. She noticed that there were so many orphans and so many people who needed care and support. And then she started begging even more so that she could take care of all of them.She decided to adopt every single child. She is fondly called “Mai” meaning - Mother. She has nurtured over 1400 orphaned children. She donated her biological child only to eliminate the feeling of partiality between her daughter and the adopted ones.Still continues to fight for the next meal.

She has been invited to speak in prestigious venues and to thousands of people about the work that she has done.I am about to share the most POWERFUL thing she has done : Many years after being abandoned by her husband, he came back and apologized to her for the mistakes.

I think you're smart to focus on one thing at a time, but when you're flying solo it's hard to build the front end without a design and hard to design without knowing how the front end works. I would do this: Start teaching yourself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the same time, start reading up on design fundamentals. Don't get distracted by the tools. Sketch is a tool. Some use Illustrator, or Fireworks -- just pick one. You can transition between tools, but design principles are constant. You'll want to understand the use of type, color, and space to create layouts and visual elements to support the goals of a page. You should also spend time browsing designer blogs and portfolios, because there you'll find not just samples but explanations of the thinking behind the designs. Remember this: The thought behind a design, and how well it supports its goals, are more difficult than making it look good.

Ball pens are difficult in one way, however. The ink may tend to “ball up” on the point, depending upon which kind of line or dot or stroke you are attempting to put down upon your paper. However, don’t let that cause you to do nothing at all. Use what you can get hold of. You can make many kinds of shading and create depths by varying the marks you make as you do your sketch. For example, you can create the look of a fold in fabric by making some of the lines thicker than others and by making some lines thicker in one section than another, in other words, begin with a thicker line and slim it down to a point at the end. You can create texture by doing things like making small x marks or even small letters or shapes, squares, diamonds. You can use groups of short strokes, lighter and darker ones, and make several longer strokes next to it or below it. Above all, you must experiment over and over and over again to learn what the pen can do. If you can use pencil, you can vary the point by sharpening it, and you can vary the shade of the mark by varying the size of the lead in the pencil, for example, a No. 1 pencil will make darker and wider lines than a number 2, a 2 1/2 will be lighter and 3 even lighter. The darker the lead is, the softer it will be. Can you get some books from a library which show drawings and paintings? You need to spend time truly looking at them and analyzing what you see. Keep your sketching materials beside you, and choose little areas of the picture to try to draw something that looks similar or even identical. If you can get hold of a pen with ink in it, especially if you can get something like a Sharpie with a narrow, tube like point, you won’t have to worry about smudges. And, finally, remember that a roller ball pen may not have permanent ink, which means if your drawing gets damp or wet, the ink will run. Even ball point ink will smudge a bit if your hand is damp or your paper gets wet. The ultimate rule here is practice, look at things, study textures of tree bark, leaves, grasses, look at a pile of dirt and see what all is truly there, little pieces of different colored earth, clay, bits of glass or pottery, gravel, sand. SEEING is what makes you become an artist. The brain absorbs what you see and your hand will follow suit. Most of all, enjoy yourself!!! Art is the most beneficial quiet activity I know, and, surprisingly, even in the quietness of its creation you may find joyous feelings within yourself. JUST DO IT!!!!

Be honest with yourself when you ask this question that, Do You Need a College Degree to Be a Graphic Designer? Personally, like most 18 year olds, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my future; it was in college I discovered the path to becoming a graphic designer. My classes gave me the tools I needed to start out, my professors gave me constructive criticism that pushed me to be better and every day I went to class I improved on something. College is the main reason I am where I am today, with a job that I love. If you really believe you will continue learning and challenging yourself all on your own, maybe you can be a self-taught designer. If you don’t see yourself doing it on your own, go to college.

So let's say (imaginary figures): Personal expenses: £2,000Add 30% tax (approx): £2,900Add £200 expenses: £3,100 OK - now you know how much you need to earn each month as a freelancer. Some people say you should save up a 2-3 month 'float' before you start freelancing. I don't think it's necessary, but you do need to think about how you'll afford the first 1-2 months, as you typically won't get paid until 30 days after you submit your first invoice. 2) Research the market You can get freelance work online but I personally think it's a tricky thing to try as a new freelancer (feel free to contradict me anyone who thinks differently). The ideal situation, in my view, would be a nice stable contract with a local agency (or even your current employer), while you settle in to the freelance lifestyle and grapple with issues like invoicing, getting paid, cash flow etc. So talk to as many people as you can about the market for freelancers in your area. Good people to talk to are: - Recruitment agents- Team leads and managers who recruit freelancers- Other freelancers The two key things you need to know are: - Availability of work for your skill set- Typical hourly / daily rate If there are some good opportunities around and the hourly / daily rate can cover the amount you need each month, then you're good to go. Talking to people will also open up potential opportunities. Agents and recruiters will want to see a resume/CV and examples of your work. Your LinkedIn profile is an easy way to do the first. Screen shots or links to sites/apps you've worked on is good for the second. Ultimately a proper portfolio website would be best, but I know many freelance developers who don't have one. I hope that helps. I've only scratched the surface of a complex topic, but there are lots of good books about freelancing if you need more information.

If you don't enjoy what you are doing, if work is not a pleasure for you, however achievements you get in your career, at one point of life you will feel everything as a waste.Afterlife : It is also the most important parameter. Observe life of people you want to be life, sniff opportunities and changes you will apply and create an imaginary world for you. Put yourself in that and imagine how will you feel being there. Type of life you will get is suitable for you or not.Opportunities : It is equally important that whatever career you are choosing will give you enough amount of money, respect and satisfaction you want from life. Being rich or leader is not needed, but surviving easily is always to be checked. (Survival defination differes with Mukesh Ambani, MS Dhoni, middle class man, a factory worker and a beggar - you can understand your level).Compatibility : This is last but not least. You can change your mindset, capabilities to some extent, not fully. You can't be the person you were not been or even if you try, you can't be happy or successful. Also you should understand that upper limit exists. Even if you dream too high, and try your best, there are possibilities of not reaching there. Thinking of worst is equally important as best.To clear more, I would like to explain with my example. I was brilliant student at end of 10th standard. 99.85 PR in state, 6 years track record of 100% scores in maths and 95%+ in science. Experience of reading 3000 books and around 500 each on philosophy and gujarati literature, 5 years of all updates about general knowledge, recent trends and competitive exams. In 11th, I got scholarship from Physics Research Laboratory for being scientist in future & also support from a scientist from NASA. So I had 4 career options realistically possible for me. All 4 were of my interest. 1) Doctor 2) Computer engineer 3) Astronomist 4) IAS officer. Interest : led me to shorten list by 4.Afterlife : As an engineer, I could not work much fir society, also I had to be part of corporate culture which I didn't want and I rule it out.Opportunity : I met IAS officer. Read about them. And understood politics influence. Being a rebel and true officer, no personal or family life and others have to allow some sort of curruption if not do by themselves. So I rule it out.Compatibility : If I think of maximum success as astronomist, still I can't change life of people much. And chances of that are around 1% only. Among all great working scientists, very few has big inventions on their name. So I rule out that too.Now medical field : Interest : Learning about new diseases, understanding body mechanisms of working is always fascinating for me.Afterlife : I can work on my own or even in government hospitals without much restrictions. I can live my free life and do what I want to do.Opportunity : I am sure every doctor has enough money to live easy life, society gives respect. Satisfaction is highest. Working hours and family life is all about how I think about it!Comfortability : May I reach at highest point, I will save N thousands of life and change lives of people dramatically with my skills. Thinking of worst, I will able to save only hundreds of lives!!Everyone has their own personal thoughts and dreams. So decide according to that. I have just explained forma here.

I had to acquire mine as my father was devoid of style. I’ll give him credit though, he wore quality shoes. It was a time when well made Canadian shoes were still made. He wore Hartt and Dacks which were still accessible to the average man. Shoes comparable to better English shoes of the time. Better than AE. He’d keep them for years and have them re-soled. I was a sartorial troglodyte and I shudder at what I wore before I became aware. I've written before about my good fortune when I was was doing my specialty training in North Carolina to learn from Alexander Julian’s dad and the other SA’s at Julian’s, a renowned menswear shop in Chapel Hill. I was too poor to buy anything in the shop except socks on sale but they taught me about dressing stylishly. I would drop in and shoot the shit with them and they would explain the rules of dressing well. They opened my eyes to colour and fabrics. Buttons, shirts, blazers, trousers. Buttons and history. Quite awn education. After that I studied. Read books. Talked to tailors. The internet was a useful tool before the internet know-nothing style influencers. When I returned to Canada I found a haberdashery I quite liked and leaned more from him and his tailor. I’d drop in, buy some things and we’d talk style. They would show me fabric for made-to-measure suits, we’d talk about tailoring. That is the beauty of independent menswear shops. The are gracious with their time and never worry about a sale today because they know you will be back. I was in NYC to get measured for shoes by Cleverley and the concierge gave me the wrong room number for where Dominic Casey from Cleverley was set up. They sent me to the room where H. Huntsman and Sons, bespoke Savile Row tailors were measuring for suits. I knocked on the door and met up with Huntsman’s head cutter Pat Murphy and GM Peter Smith. I recognized them from my internet studies and remarked that I was in the wrong place. They asked if I had some time to chat, I told them about my shoe fitting appointment. They knew Dominic and said he could wait. My appointment was drop in whenever. I had the good fortune to spend an hour with these two gents and I got first hand instruction on Huntsman’s bespoke process and all the finery they could provide. I wasn’t buying. The damn shoes were going to be expensive enough but dropping $7000 or $8000 was out of the question. But they were gracious at the same time. They even rang him ups and said I was on my way and it was their fault for keeping me. They gave me a parting tip about a tailor who had apprenticed with them who was now in Canada with a bespoke shop and he eventually became my tailor. Serendipity features prominently in my sartorial journey. Continue Reading",2021-03-08T17:03:19.511Z,"Where do you get your fashion inspiration? ",Quora

You look at it from all possible viewpoints and then some more. You tear it apart to see it’s component pieces and turn it upside down and inside out. And see what happens. I have just scrapped my second idea for a dimple forming die (it’s a stamping die used in sheet metal stamping industry) because just when I was about to begin detailing the idea #2, I suddenly saw a much elegant and simpler idea within that idea. This became possible because I was tossing the idea and it’s component parts in my mind -taking them apart, turning them inside out and upside down and so on. The purpose was to “create” a chance event that might enable me to see ‘a different arrangement’. So playing around with ideas has some value. It’s my experience, that almost always my first few ideas spring from strict adherence to the ‘given’ and they’re mostly logically derived. And they suck! I know first ideas are going to be useless. I have known from experience that when I have exhausted all those logically derived boring ideas and when I am kind of stuck, I begin to create creative ideas that are born out of my thinking in an irrational way. When I say ‘thinking in irrational way’ I mean conducting thought experiments in mind. What if ……..?2. Comparing and striking a force-fit between the project at hand and some irrelevant idea. 3. Being aware of the lines along which my thinking progresses and picking up the key words from the chatter that constantly goes on in my head as I am thinking about ideas. I know, linguistic stuff like words, labels, phrases and definitions limit ideas and imprison them and make them less malleable. I then work around linguistic limiters and alter them to see what ideas are released from the linguistic “prison”. This allows me to look at the things from a “filter” that has different linguistic ingredients. The net effect: I begin to see differently. This is the origin of thinking differently. 4. being aware of assumptions I am making. We don’t realize the insidious assumptions we have made about all the things over so many years. We have to make ‘deliberate’ attempts to ferret them out. I then proceed to create scenarios in my mind about what would be possible if that assumption weren’t there. 5. I discuss ideas with people from entirely different background. They bring some fresh, newer and weird perspectives. These perspectives may not be directly usable. But I use them as “stepping stones” to other ideas. 6. I look at things as I live my life from moment to moment. And consider what ideas/principles/concepts I can borrow from other seemingly unrelated things. It’s not a process that follows a formula. It involves a lot of exploration.

Here are a few skills I think are most important to becoming a great interaction designer: Sharpies Are Your Friend Being able to sketch out interfaces and interactions on paper with a sharpie is invaluable. It lets you to experiment with many options quickly, iterate during a conversation, and helps you (and your audience) avoid focusing on small details like color or font choice too early on. Sketching can also help you get a feel for the visual hierarchy of a page, as opposed to what elements make up that hierarchy. Workflows, Not Sitemaps Sitemaps can help make sure all sections of a site are addressed, but workflows are crucial for pinning down the core interactions of a site - and why people might actually want to take them. Too often companies build features only considering the benefit to the company, not the user. Adding a ""tweet"" button does not automatically make something viral! For each workflow, identify motivations and entry points: you'll want to be clear why a user starts an interaction, and what keeps them going. Talk to People You probably already do this for visual design, but it's worth repeating for interaction design. Show coworkers or friends your sketches and see if they make sense. Do people understand them quickly? Do they get hung up at any point? It's amazing how much a 5-minute conversation can help refine an interaction. At the other end of the spectrum, user testing is a fantastic way to stress test your app: watching actual people try to use what you've built will definitely tell you if something isn't working (and keep you humble!).

Auto Layout, built by AnimaApp, takes this functionality a little further. Where Group Resizing lets you create fluid elements and pin objects to a corner (think: :fixed positioning in CSS), Auto Layout also lets you offset elements by a certain number of pixels, define minimum and maximum dimensions for elements (think: min-: and max-: in CSS) and do everything that Group Resizing allows you to do but with a much less confusing UI. 3.Sketch Style Inventory Price: FreeSummary: Manage your styles easilyDesign can be a peculiar combination of freeform exploration and carefully structured process, and Sketch Style Inventory helps you marry the two: it gives you an overview of all the styles you've used and then helps you merge the styles of similar layers into one, enabling you to nail down a final style from all of your various experiments. 4.Day Player  Price: FreeSummary: Automatically generates placeholder imagesAdding placeholder images to a design is a necessary part of prototyping, but finding the actual images can be a pain. So rather than waste any time on it, leave it all to Day Player.

This book explains the process of designing for sites, including historical precedent, evolving philosophies, and how a project moves from concept to design to realization. (€17.74)  #9 Destination Art (Amy Dempsey) “Destination Art” remains the only illustrated guide to modern and contemporary art sites outside the confines of museums and galleries. Revised and updated in paperback, the book profiles more than 200 of the most important contemporary art sites around the world, including four new sites in Tennessee, Norway, China and Scotland. From massive land and environmental works to extensive sculpture parks, some of the most crucial and popular international artists are profiled, from Henri Matisse, Anoni Gaudi and Constantin Brancusi to James Turrell, Antony Gormley and Olafur Eliasson. (€15.68)  #8 Architectural Model Making (Nick Dunn) The physical scale model is often cited as an important tool of communication for architecture students and practitioners alike. Through description of the use of different models in different contexts, this book provides a guide to how and why models are used, what they are used for, and, furthermore, how they relate to architecture education. (€18.74)  #7 Landscape Graphics (Grant W. Reid) “Landscape Graphics” is the architect’s ultimate guide to all the basic graphics techniques used in landscape design and landscape architecture. Progressing from the basics into more sophisticated techniques, this guide offers clear instruction on graphic language and the design process, the basics of drafting, lettering, freehand drawing and conceptual diagramming, perspective drawing, section elevations and more. It also features carefully sequenced exercises, a complete file of graphic symbols for sections and perspectives, and a handy appendix of conversions and equivalents. (€14.32)  #6 Theory in Landscape Architecture (Simon Swaffield) Here, for students and practitioners of landscape architecture, architecture, and planning, is a single resource for seminal theoretical texts in the field. Essential for understanding the specific connections that have been made between landscape and social, cultural, and political structures, “Theory in Landscape Architecture” reminds readers that the discipline of landscape architecture can be both practical and formally challenging. Covering the past fifty years of theory, this primer makes an important contribution to a student’s emerging professional ethics. (€23.95) #5 Drawing for Urban Design (Lorraine Farrelly) Explores a range of ways to represent the city, from freehand sketching to the sophisticated interactive computer model of the city of the future. This book provides an introduction to the techniques while explaining the processes associated with describing and designing urban environments. (€21.56) #4 Drawing for Landscape Architecture Sketch to Screen to Site (Edward Hutchison) This essential publication reintroduces the importance of learning to see by hand, to visualize large-scale design schemes and explain them through drawing, before using the digital tools that are so crucial to efficient and cost-effective building solutions. Combining traditional drawing techniques with those from CAD rendering, in nine chapters, “Drawing for Landscape Architecture” guides practitioners from their very first impression of a site, through concept and schematic design and client presentation to construction and site drawings, concluding with two case studies that show the final result. Just as hand-drawing returns to design courses around the world, this welcome publication celebrates the best aspects of traditional techniques while incorporating them into today’s digital design methods. (€25.29) #3 Form and Fabric in Landscape Architecture (Catherine Dee) Form and Fabric in Landscape Architecture provides an original, visual approach to the study of landscape architecture by creating a spatial morphology based on use and experience of landscapes. It explores aesthetic, spatial and experiential concepts by providing a structure through which landscapes can be understood and conceived in design. ‘Fabric’ is the integrated structure of whole landscapes, while ‘form’ refers to the components that make up this fabric. Together form and fabric create a morphology of landscape useful for the development of visual-spatial design thinking and awareness. This book is intended as both an introduction to the discipline for students of landscape architecture, architecture and planning, and a source of continuing interest for more experienced environmental designers. (€37.33) #2 The Architectural Drawing Course (Mo Zell) This practical foundation course in architectural design offers key advice on the principles, practice and techniques of the subject. Dealing with much more than just the technical aspects of drawing, it introduces the reader to the visual language of architecture, encouraging them to think spatially and question the built environment. All architecture students, and anyone interested in the creative side of architecture, will find this book an invaluable tool and reference. (€13.07) #1 The Planting Design Handbook (Nick Robinson) Nick Robinson’s “The Planting Design Handbook” has been widely used as a definitive text on landscape architecture courses throughout the world. It examines the horticultural, ecological and aesthetic characteristics of plants, discusses the structural and decorative roles of planting, spatial composition, species selection, planting plans and spacing, and the vital role of management. With its fresh look at aesthetic principles and its analysis of the design process, it reveals how a systematic approach can allow the greatest freedom for the creative imagination.

As for visual design skills, look at fine art and graphic design. Pick an era or genre to start of with and notice patterns in layout, color, typography, visual metaphors, content, etc. There are conventions that have been developed and utilized by successful designers in the past. You will ultimately develop your own dialect, but you have to learn the basics of the language that they already visually speak. One day you may be able to create your own style, but for now, while you are learning, appropriate, and build off of others. Learn the rules before you break them. UI design is about showcasing information and controls to modify that information. A great way to understand the discipline required to create amazing information design is to study the writings of Edward Tufte. In UI the use of design patterns is more important than in graphic design.

I’ve been hiring UX designers for my teams for years and I’ve seen a ton of variation – some inexperienced UX people naturally make the right decisions without knowing why. Some very seasoned UX folks can talk and their arguments may have solid foundation but simply cannot design very well or lack creative thinking. Drawing wireframes or putting prototypes together is very easy but that is not the point of UX design. It’s about learning and understanding a problem and coming up with the best possible solution within constrains. This involves domain knowledge, psychological and technological understanding and much more. Start with something simple: try to find problems in digital products or services and fix them. Pick your target, do usability testing to understand what is wrong, design a solution that might be better and do usability testing again to see if that part got fixed (and nothing else broke). Doing a little bit of improvement is a lot more useful than a lot of nonsense. Cooking is easy and you can get started but don’t expect to get Michelin stars if you just started out.

Nowhere near great, but a huge step up from where I started.  That being said, I do have some specific tips and advice for you. First, the following are indispensable assets for ID sketching: Copic Maker (32 set), Prisma Color Pencils (48 set), Sakura Micron Pens (8 set). These are really the bare minimum in any industrial designers toolbox. I would recommended working with color pencils at first if you are not familiar with copics — although, I did the opposite. Next, I would say that composition is just as important as the renderings themselves. ID sketches are meant to tell a story. Your sketches need to convey what the product does, how the product works, and the products specialties. Finally, practice practice practice. Unless you are descended from the Da Vinci lineage, ID sketching won’t come easy. Many hours — 10,000 some would argue — go into mastering a craft. Put the work in and the results will show.

This is a deep field in game programming that requires a technically skilled team of highly specialized programmers to create dynamic and intuitive gameplay that is functional, seamless, and exciting. Duties This person works under the direction of the lead programmer and is responsible for determining an agent’s behavior: the actions taken by the non-player characters. The AI programmer creates code and algorithms for pathfinding, group movement and cooperation, tactical strategy, and camera control. He or she sets patterns and parameters for state mechanics (rules) and establishes how an agent thinks and solves problems, creating a framework for artificial emotions and ideas. The exact scope of an AI programmer’s job varies from one studio to the next—in some cases, object collisions fall to the AI programmer; in others, this task may be assigned to a physics specialist. During development, the programmer will work closely with designers to implement the necessary processes to make combat possible, establish decision trees for opponents, and create neural networks. He or she also cooperates with game testers to identify bugs and insert the appropriate fixes. Skills & Education This role requires a person who enjoys challenging problem-solving, is both a creative and critical thinker, and has a strong education in advanced mathematics. A bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, or game development is required for a job as an AI programmer. Larger game developers may prefer a master’s degree. You will be expected to have a firm foundation in C++; STL; APIs like OpenGL and PhysX; Perl, Perforce, and profiling tools. Coursework in physics and technical writing are also helpful. An AI programmer should be comfortable on multiple game consoles and able to adapt to existing systems. Strong written and verbal communication skills are necessary, as is the ability to draft clear, concise technical documentation. Most importantly, developers look for an individual who is passionate about making and playing games. The field of AI is constantly evolving, and therefore offers great opportunity for creativity and innovation. What to Expect This is not an entry-level position. Even with an advanced degree, companies look to hire someone with at least two years of practical AI experience on one or more shipped titles. To work your way up to AI programmer, consider roles as a C++ programmer or junior software engineer. This role is also closely related to that of a physics engineer. Often it is easier to get a programming job at a small development studio, then work your way up the ladder to a larger studio or to a more senior role. Established AI programmers with proven skills and experience are highly sought after in the game industry, and have the option to pursue many areas of development.

So basically natural intelligence only talks about your survival. But its not the case with AI Artificial intelligence. Its the intelligence produced artificially which is produced by humans for their own sake. You may have played some first person shooter games like call of duty games. Then you might be knowing that whenever you step inside any enemy area they started shooting at you. So how could they do it, it's because of Ai. How to achieve it? AI can be achieved through programming. You may be seeing some machine learning courses for python this is how they programme an AI through machine learning. They choose python because python is a fast language. Its means it works better with hardware than most of the language. It doesn't matter which language you use you can achieve AI with any language you know. The AI inside gaming is limited to just watching you and shooting at you but that's not the case with real life AI BOTS they learn eventually just like that small baby. They start to learn every new thing day by day. It may be dangerous sometimes just now facebook's AI BOTS had developed their own language so it was compulsory for facebook to shut down their AI BOTS.

In my mind, there isn’t a serious physical constraint to using R for deep learning work (i.e. given enough time and resources, it would be totally fine). However, research and development is always iterative, and this area is more or less an arms race.

In order to move from observing data to taking action a being must have some form of value structure to sort that data. As the value stucture forms the being begins to decide what data to attend to and what data to act on based on levels of value assigned to the data. This is the process of orienting itself, and then focusing on an aim. The being then acts towards that aim. The consequences resulting from the action taken, either reinforce the value structure or cause it to be updated. As this process repeats itself over time, a hierarchy of values begins to solidify guiding the being's future aims and actions. Going through this process, a being is guided by a governing structure which exists independent of the being. Imagine an uncharted ocean coast line and an explorer drawing the map as he navigates into unknown territories recording the topography. The coastline exists independent of the explorer. It is up to the explorer to discover the value in exploring the coast line. The explorer must also determine the best methods for exploring the coastline. Making the right decisions in this journey is a constant learning experience from how to build a suitable boat, to how to pack for the journey to following the stars, to learning the signs of danger to avoid, it is all a complex system which generates a hierarchy of values. As multiple explorers get together to share their stories and compare their hierarchies of value they observe similarities and consistencies which become elevated in the structure. As those elevated consistencies become reinforced over time through generations and countless stories they are distilled and condensed into dramas which best capture the truth contained within those stories. That captured truth about the governing structure of the world is considered a revelation of what makes up the world, what creates reality into being, and how to act within the world. Thus, a religious structure begins to form. If artificial intelligence is going to act, it needs to adopt a value structure, be oriented toward an aim, act toward that aim, and update its value structure through experience and the revelation of universal governing structures with the goal of improvement based on its own hierarchy of values. Then, if AI attempts to share those revelations of the universal governing structures through distilled dramatic representation, we would say it developed a religion. I believe that is inevitable. That depends on what is considered to be a religion. Lets say its a hierarchical structure of values presented through dramatic storytelling. In that case I would say yes.

AI Supremacy is a comprehensive guide to AI’s impact on a societal and global level, and provides a vision for how AI and machine learning will likely influence the way business is done, societies function, and governments interact in the future.  Daniel Wagner, a thought leader in risk management and current affairs, and Keith Furst, an expert in data management and financial crimes, have crafted an insightful, entertaining, and unique book that takes readers on a wild ride through the canyons and valleys of AI to examine many of its most important sub-topics. From globalization to jobs, financial services to the role of governments, the nexus with cyber risk to spying, and from China’s quest to international relations, the authors have delved deeply into the subject matter. China and the U.S. target AI in the race for technological supremacy “I think when it comes to China and the U.S., they’re putting AI in the center of a confrontation they’ve had for a very long time,” Khareghani said. “It’s an economic race to be the leader, and technology had been kind of thrown in there.” The main difference in China, Toon added, is that the government has a much closer and more cooperative relationship with its tech companies. In addition, China’s policies and culture around privacy and data give it an edge. AI Supremacy  A security officer keeps watch in front of an AI sign at the annual Huawei Connect event in Shanghai, China.Image Credit: Reuters/Aly Song THE WORLD first took notice of Beijing’s prowess in artificial intelligence (AI) in late 2017, when BBC reporter John Sudworth, hiding in a remote southwestern city, was located by China’s CCTV system in just seven minutes. At the time, it was a shocking demonstration of power. Today, companies like YITU Technology and Megvii, leaders in facial recognition technology, have compressed those seven minutes into mere seconds. What makes those companies so advanced, and what powers not only China’s surveillance state but also its broader economic development, is not simply its AI capability, but rather the math power underlying it. The race for AI supremacy has become perhaps the most visible aspect of the great power competition between America and China. The world’s dominant AI power will have the ability to shape global finance, commerce, telecommunications, warfighting, and computing. President Donald Trump recognized this last February by signing an executive order, the “American AI Initiative,” designed to protect U.S. leadership in key AI technologies. In just a few years, American corporations, universities, think tanks, and the government have devoted hundreds of policy papers and projects to addressing this challenge.  But all these considerations happen to be secondary to a most important hidden key issue. Forget about “AI” itself. It’s all about the math, and America is failing to train enough citizens in the right kinds of mathematics to remain dominant. AI IS not simply a black box that will grow if unlimited funds are poured into it. Dozens of think tank projects and government reports won’t mean anything if Americans can’t maintain mastery over the fundamental mathematics that underpin AI. Calls for billions of dollars in related investments won’t add up without the abstract math ability needed to transform the economy or military. What we call “AI” is in fact a suite of various algorithms and distinctive developments that draw heavily from advanced mathematics and statistics. Take deep neural networks, which have understandably become a CIO/CTO buzzword, as an example. These are not artificial brains. They are stacks of information-transforming modules that “learn” by repeatedly computing a chain of what are known as gradients (something rarely taught in high school calculus), which are the backbone of a family of algorithms known as backpropagation. Similar dissections can be made for all of machine learning, which is a study of how to program computers to learn a task rather than execute a rigid pre-coded one. The ability to rapidly classify massive amounts of data, identify patterns, “predict” outcomes, and “self-learn,” all comes down to ever more sophisticated algorithms paired with increasingly powerful computational power and a commensurate amount of data. From iPhones to Summit—the world’s most powerful supercomputer, located at the Oak Ridge National Lab—and from Google to Facebook, these computing platforms and programs use incredibly complex mathematical calculations to do everything from model nuclear detonations to provide web search results. And contrary to what some prominent AI advocates—like Kai-fu Lee, author of the AI Superpowers—argue, it’s not simply all about data. Lee is famous for saying that, today, data is the oil of the early twentieth century, and that China, which has the most data, is the new Saudi Arabia. Yet without the right type of math, and those who can creatively develop it, all the data in the world will only take you so far—and certainly not far enough into the future AI advocates boldly envision. That is why cutting-edge mathematics focuses, among other things, on being able to work with partial information loss and sparse data, or to discard useless information that is collected along with the core data. No matter how you slice it, the world runs on ones and zeros—and on the white boards where the algorithms that manipulate them are thrashed out. Yet one can’t simply jump into creating more powerful and elegant algorithms; it takes years of patient training in ever more complex math. Unfortunately, American secondary school and university students are not mastering the fundamental math that prepares them to move into the type of advanced fields, such as statistical theory and differential geometry, that makes AI possible. American fifteen-year-olds scored thirty-fifth in math on the OECD’s 2018 Program for International Student Assessment tests—well below the OECD average. Even at the college level, not having mastered the basics needed for rigorous training in abstract problem solving, American students are often mostly taught to memorize algorithms and insert them when needed. This failure to train students capable of advanced mathematics means fewer and fewer U.S. citizens are moving on to advanced degrees in math and science. In 2017, over 64 percent of PhD candidates and nearly 70 percent of Master’s students in U.S. computer science programs were foreign nationals, and fully half of doctoral degrees in mathematics that year were awarded to non-U.S. citizens, according to the National Science Foundation. Chinese and Indian students account for the bulk of these, in large part because the most advanced training in American universities still outstrips that in their home countries, though the gap is closing with respect to China. Yet that also means that the majority of those being prepared by U.S. universities to open new frontiers in computer science and abstract math are not Americans. Some of these non-citizens will stay here. But many will return home to help grow their countries’ burgeoning tech industries. There are good reasons to argue that U.S. visa restrictions on skilled workers should be eased, tempting more of those foreign nationals to stay in the United States after their studies have been completed. But the bottom line is that not enough American citizens are choosing to major in advanced math, which has corresponding implications for everything—from foreign competition to Silicon Valley’s startup culture, from national security concerns to whether or not U.S. corporations consider themselves American. AMERICA’S SELF-INFLICTED math wounds matter because the Chinese Communist Party has made global AI dominance a national goal by 2030, and is leveraging its resources to make it so. Indeed, the world now sees the battle over AI as a battle between China and the United States. Under General Secretary Xi Jinping, China has invested heavily in AI-related technologies, making it a core focus for the modernization of Chinese industry. This effort underpins Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” initiative, which seeks to make the country dominant in most high-tech processes. China’s AI market is now estimated to be worth around $3.5 billion, and Beijing has set a goal by 2030 of a one trillion yuan AI market ($142 billion). The government has pledged the equivalent of $2.1 billion to build an AI industrial park outside Beijing, among other major investments. Leading the effort is Huawei, which has established AI research laboratories in London and Singapore, unveiled a new generation of “AI processor” chips, and laid out an “all scenario” AI strategy. Much of China’s spending is directed towards facial and voice recognition technologies like those of Megvii and SenseTime, along with natural language processing. The focus on these particular technologies is purpose-driven: Beijing is using its country’s facility in applied mathematics and AI, whether honed in America or at home, to create a digital surveillance state that is unrivaled in history. For example, a new law requires all individuals registering new mobile phone numbers to have a facial scan. The world’s most advanced algorithms are being used to aid in monitoring and controlling Chinese society and bolster the country’s security services. Some of this is already plainly visible. Beijing is notoriously creating a “social credit” system based on facial recognition and other technologies that rewards or penalizes certain behavior—jaywalking, credit unworthiness, insufficient patriotism, and the like—so as to shape individuals’ private and public behavior. The two far western provinces of Xinjiang and Tibet have become virtual police states within China, as their Uighur Muslim and Buddhist Tibetan populations are ceaselessly monitored and controlled through the application of facial recognition and forced DNA collection. China’s AI focus has global security implications as well, given Beijing’s “military-civil fusion” policy which mandates that all high-tech advancements be made available to the Chinese armed forces for incorporation in weapons systems. Just as insidiously, Beijing is reportedly recruiting the country’s smartest high school students to train them as AI weapons scientists. A recent National Science Foundation report noted that Chinese government policies do not share “U.S. values of science ethics,” raising concerns over U.S.-trained Chinese scientists employing advanced research that benefits the CCP ’s surveillance state and military. Even as China’s AI industry works to catch up to its American counterpart in terms of talent, the country is investing in its mathematical ability. Chinese students ranked number one in the world in math (as well as science and reading) in the latest pisa tests. While there is good reason to doubt the veracity of at least some of the Chinese scores, there is no question that China is focusing heavily on STEM education, outstripping America and European nations. The recently announced “Strong Base Plan” will recruit the country’s top students to study mathematics, as well as physics, chemistry, and biology, among other fields. Moreover, China is just as aggressively buying leading mathematicians abroad. The “Thousand Talents” program attracts both native and foreign researchers in key fields back to China. These individuals bring with them the fruits of their labors in U.S. universities, corporations, and research institutes, and transfers them to Chinese public and private research institutes. According to the Asia Times’ David Goldman, Huawei alone employs 50,000 foreigners, many of them highly-trained engineers lured away by huge salaries and bonuses. It is little surprise then that China’s mathematical capability is letting the country challenge America for AI dominance. From the U.S. chief technology officer to the Boston Consulting Group, a diversity of voices are warning that China’s aggressive public and private investment in AI is threatening America’s lead, along with the siphoning off of knowledge originated in the United States. As one leader of a small San Francisco-based AI firm recently complained, “If I don’t employ Chinese nationals, then I lose half my engineering staff. But I have no idea if those whom I employ are security risks or not.” THE SPECTER of two global technological systems emerging—one Chinese, one American, one open and one closed—is a theme of much contemporary concern. Beijing is exporting its technologies of control across the globe, primarily to repressive regimes in Asia and Africa, but also to democratic states like Great Britain. Already over a dozen countries are using Chinese surveillance technology, while nearly three dozen are being trained in CCP models of censorship, according to Freedom House. The increasing global ubiquity of surveillance cameras means that only the nature of the political regime and society employing them gives a modicum of hope for some level of protection of individual rights and for ameliorating government or corporate abuse of power. Facing America’s slipping competitiveness in this field, foreign governments and companies will likely be pushed to let advanced Chinese systems into their societies, with the commensurate shaping of a repressive or intrusive AI-driven technological environment, not to mention the possible passing of national and personal information to China. And despite the assurances of Chinese companies that they do not share the information they collect with the Chinese government, Beijing’s national security, cybersecurity, and national intelligence laws mandate that private corporations in China cooperate with authorities when ordered to, including with providing private data. While investors like Kai-fu Lee see China quickly catching up to the United States in AI, few comment on the math ability that drives such development. This, combined with China’s lead in developing 5G networks, and its government-funded attempts to become a leader in semiconductor chip production, means it is possible to envision a future where not only do U.S. companies become mere consumers of Chinese technology, surrendering their ability to shape the digital economy, but so does the U.S. government, leading to a collapse in its ability to maintain the global military balance of power. The best way to prevent this is by focusing on the basics. America needs a major all-of-society push to increase the number of U.S. students being trained in both the fundamentals of math and in the more advanced, rigorous, and creative mathematics. Leadership in implementing this effort will have to come from the U.S. government and leading technology companies, and through the funding of ambitious programs. A few ideas come to mind: talent-spotting schemes, the establishment of math centers, and a modern successor to the post-Sputnik National Defense Education Act, which would provide math scholarships to promising students along with guaranteed employment in either public or private enterprises. Assuming such an approach leads to an increase in Americans’ math abilities, there will then have to be a national reckoning about the unwillingness of private American corporations to protect their intellectual property from China, as well as a push to keep U.S.-trained mathematicians and engineers at home instead of selling their services abroad through programs like China’s “Thousand Talents” plan. Winning the AI competition begins by acknowledging how poorly we do in attracting and training Americans in math at all levels.

The first was Expert Systems in the 70s and 80s. ES didn’t come from AI, but it was reluctantly embraced by AI as evidence that AI was making progress. It was basically a data management technology that stored the knowledge of people who were “experts”. It’s key limitation is that it couldn’t sense the world or understand the data sufficiently. Gathering expert knowledge was also difficult. Expert systems justified funding to continue in AI even though it was an unrelated technology. AI projects continued to spend a lot of research dollars, with little to show. I remember the MIT AI project in the mid 90s that picked a single problem domain, finding a restaurant in Cambridge near MIT with voice input. The demos were great, always followed by the words “then we’ll expand into other problem domains and conquer them one by one.” The problem was that every attempt to expand into another problem domain made the restaurant domain stop working properly. But in the 90s and 00s, we saw the beginnings of what we call Machine Learning (ML). We had discovered a simple mapping of “artificial neurons” to layers (input, hidden, output) in a feed-forward network. The maps were supposedly copied from studies of brain, and mathematicians figured out how to calculate the parameters in an algorithm that certainly has nothing to do with how the brain works. What ML really is is a way to apply a very complex separation equation to a set of inputs. This is really a neat trick, and it has allows ML (and ostensibly AI) to conquer a large number of problem domains that can be structured as perception problems. There are a lot of perception problems, and ML is a very effective toolkit for attacking them. But ML didn’t come from AI, and it really isn’t AI. It’s just the latest non-AI trick to take the heat off AI funding. “See, AI works!” Expert systems would have been hugely effective if they had ML available. The MIT AI project I mentioned (which was basically an ES) might have been successful with ML technology. ML has serious flaws, which Geoffrey Hinton has exposed and I called out in another Quora answer John Light's answer to What do you wish to see by 2022 or 2027 in the AI field?.

Without being taught how to get past these obstacles, the AI needed to learn from scratch how to move and maneuver through its world. With this limited information, the AI taught itself how to walk in various bodies—including a humanoid, bipedal, and four-legged body. Not only did it learn to walk and run, but it also could successfully tackle obstacles in its virtual environments—such as jumping over gaps and climbing ledges. This was also incredibly entertaining to watch since it came up with some inventive uses of its limbs. AI Can Create Its Own Images  An intriguing capability AI is the ability to create its own original, realistic images from nothing. To do this, researchers used ImageNet as a database to provide real-world sample images for the AI to learn from. The neural network was then trained to not only generate images based on what it learned from the data, but it could also distinguish generated images from real-world images. The algorithm uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), a type of AI algorithm that has existed for some time. But what makes the AI’s image generation unique is how much it has improved upon and optimized the technology. In terms of the quality metrics used to assess generated images, the samples created by DeepMind’s AI outperformed other attempts by a significant margin. Bots Can Strategically Out-Think Humans Nothing makes images of SkyNet come to mind as much as realizing that AI has already learned how to strategically out-think human opponents. You may have heard about DeepMind AI beating human opponents at board games, but it now knows how to work in a team. AI has figured out how to beat humans in Quake III Arena’s Capture The Flag matches. Its teamwork capabilities aren’t even limited to other AI—the bot was even able to work with human teams to beat opponents in the game. “Through new developments in reinforcement learning, our agents have achieved human-level performance in Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, a complex multi-agent environment and one of the canonical 3D first-person multiplayer games,” The bots had to learn from scratch how to see and act in these procedurally generated (and therefore unseen) environments. They did this without even knowing the rules of the game. They then had to learn how to also cooperate and compete in order to win. Researchers appropriately named the AI “For The Win (FTW) agents”. This AI took part in a tournament with 40 human players. Researchers even reduced the bots’ accuracy and reaction to lower their performance. Despite this, they learned human-like behavior such as camping bases and following teammates in order to win. When measuring their Elo rating, a metric used to score the skill of players in zero-sum games, the FTW agents overtook the average score of regular players and players during the course of its training. AI Taught Itself How to Navigate Without a Map One of the most impressive achievements from AI is its ability to navigate through a city without a map. The AI relied on learning from experience instead. This is a relatively simple task that humans perform all the time. But the underlying mental mechanisms that enable us to do this are very complex. AI had to navigate through major cities and reach a specific location without a map. The AI moved through its virtual environment with a first-person view derived from Google Street View images. Over time, the AI memorized different routes and ways to get places as if it was a resident city-slicker itself. “The agent is rewarded when it reaches a target destination (specified, for instance, as a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates), like a courier tasked with an endless set of deliveries but without a map,” Over time, the AI learned how to navigate new cities. It was even able to apply what it learned to new cities. For example, after learning how intersections worked, it would use this knowledge for future cities. The company’s AI has also previously learned how to successfully navigate 3D mazes, something that many of us humans still fail to do.

And as we did, we wondered how things worked. Many of these could and were solved by us, but some remained to leave us wondering.I hope I don’t upset the religious people under us, but I believe religion mostly comes forward out of a lack of knowledge. Let’s give you an example.  This is Zeus (or Jupiter), he was an ancient Greek and Roman god who controlled the weather. He is most famous for his lightning in his hand. The ancient Greeks and Romans actually believed in Zeus just like we do in God today. Why did Zeus exist? Because back then people didn’t understand how lightning worked, so they came to the conclusion that it must be a godly phenomenon. Then a few centuries later, scientists figured out how lightning worked and not much later Zeus as a god did no longer exist. This is exactly the case with us today. We don’t know who or what created the universe, thus it must’ve been a godly phenomenon. Right? When a convincing scientific explaination comes along to explain the creation of the Universe the believe in our god today will seize to exist. Besides the lack of knowledge, emotions also play a very important piece in our creation of religion. Many people who believe in God say that even if He doesn’t exist, it still feels good to have faith in something. The feeling that somebody is watching and protecting you. This is essential to define whether AI can create religion.   AI doesn’t create religion. For now and probably in the next decade to come, AI is pretty much fact based. AI collects data and reasons upon it to come up with conclusions. This way of thinking causes the AI to lack the fundamentals to create religion. He’s fact based, he only believes what the facts can proof so as there is no proof of the existence of a god, an AI won’t believe in a god.Besides this, until now AI lacks the emotions to create a religion. For now an AI has no benefits to believe in a god, an AI won’t feel any better when he believes in a god compared to when he doesn’t. This however doesn’t mean an AI will never create a religion. Most likely AI will advance and it will continue to think more human-like. As AI’s become more advanced, they will start to have emotions and personalities. After that it shouldn’t take too long before an AI comes up with the concept of a god and believe it exists. I’m curious how an AI would imagine a god-like being. Thanks for the question! Does AI create religion? It’s a good question in which we have to dig somewhat deeper to get to a good conclusion. The first step we have to take is to look at ourselves. Why do we have the concept of religion? Why did we create this concept? (Whether god is real or not is not relevant to this issue)  Humans for over the past thousands of years have been fondly observing the world and the cosmos. And as we did, we wondered how things worked. Many of these could and were solved by us, but some remained to leave us wondering.I hope I don’t upset the religious people under us, but I believe religio Continue Reading",2021-03-08T17:47:42.484Z,"Does AI create religion?

While traditionally Python has been the go-to language for machine learning, nowadays neural networks can run in any language, including JavaScript! The web ecosystem has made a lot of progress in recent times and although JavaScript and Node.js are still less performant than Python and Java, they are now powerful enough to handle many machine learning problems. Web languages also have the advantage of being super accessible - all you need to run a JavaScript ML project is your web browser. Most JavaScript machine learning libraries are fairly new and still in development, but they do exist and are ready for you to try them. In this article we will look at some of these libraries, as well as a number of cool AI web app examples to get you started.  1. Brain Brain is a library that lets you easily create neural networks and then train them based on input/output data. Since training takes up a lot of resources, it is preferred to run the library in a Node.js environment, although a CDN browser version can also be loaded directly onto a web page. There is a tiny demo on their website that can be trained to recognize color contrast.  Deep playground Educational web app that lets you play around with neural networks and explore their different components. It has a nice UI that allows you to control the input data, number of neurons, which algorithm to use, and various other metrics that will be reflected on the end result. There is also a lot to learn from the app behind the scenes - the code is open-source and uses a custom machine learning library that is written in TypeScript and well documented.  FlappyLearning FlappyLearning is a JavaScript project that in roughly 800 lines of unminifed code manages to create a machine learning library and implement it in a fun demo that learns to play Flappy Bird like a virtuoso. The AI technique used in this library is called Neuroevolution and applies algorithms inspired by nervous systems found in nature, dynamically learning from each iteration's success or failure. The demo is super easy to run - just open index.html in the browser.  Synaptic Probably the most actively maintained project on this list, Synaptic is a Node.js and browser library that is architecture-agnostic, allowing developers to build any type of neural network they want. It has a few built-in architectures, making it possible to quickly test and compare different machine learning algorithms. It's also features a well written introduction to neural networks, a number of practical demos, and many other great tutorials demystifying how machine learning works.  Land Lines Land Lines is an interesting Chrome Web experiment that finds satellite images of Earth, similar to doodles made by the user. The app makes no server calls: it works entirely in the browser and thanks to clever usage of machine learning and WebGL has great performance even on mobile devices. You can check out the source code on GitHub or read the full case study here.  ConvNetJS Although it is no longer actively maintained, ConvNetJS is one of the most advanced deep learning libraries for JavaScript. Originally developed in Stanford University, ConvNetJS became quite popular on GitHub, resulting in many community driven features and tutorials. It works directly in the browser, supports multiple learning techniques, and is rather low-level, making it suitable for people with bigger experience in neural networks.  Thing Translator Thing Translator is a web experiment that allows your phone to recognize real-life objects and name them in different languages. The app is built entirely on web technologies and utilizes two machine learning APIs by Google - Cloud Vision for image recognition and Translate API for natural language translations.  Neurojs Framework for building AI systems based on reinforcement learning. Sadly the open-source project doesn't have a proper documentation but one of the demos, a self-driving car experiment, has a great description of the different parts that make up a neural network. The library is in pure JavaScript and made using modern tools like webpack and babel.  Machine_learning Another library that allows us to set up and train neural networks using only JavaScript. It is super easy to install both in Node.js and in the client side, and has a very clean API that will be comfortable for developers of all skill levels. The library provides a lot of examples that implement popular algorithms, helping you understand core machine learning principals.  DeepForge DeepForge is a user-friendly development environment for working with deep learning. It allows you to to design neural networks using а simple graphical interface, supports training models on remote machines, and has built in version control. The project runs in the browser and is based on Node.js and MongoDB, making the installation process very familiar to most web devs.  source : https://tutorialzine.com/2017/04/10-machine-learning-examples-in-javascript (https://tutorialzine.com/2017/04/10-machine-learning-examples-in-javascript)",2021-03-08T17:52:19.336Z,"Is there any role of JavaScript in machine learning or AI development?

Humans tend to learn from their experiences and they apply these experiences in future to get better results. But machines can’t do so, because they don’t learn from the external environment. Bridging this gap, leads to Artificial Intelligence. The evolution in the field of Artificial Intelligence is growing at an unprecedented rate. As artificial intelligence can be applied in all the major fields, the growth is really very fast. To some extent AI is going to dominate many industries and many business sectors. Briefly, AI includes automation, analytic, IoT (only to some extent when it consists of smart sensors technology), machine learning, computer vision and many more. Artificial Intelligence nowadays is on the boom. Many start-ups and existing companies are trying to imbibe AI in their systems. Though the output generated is more accurate and efficient, implementing and imbibing AI technologies is not so easy. It requires a huge amount of expertise and knowledge in order to make it useful in a productive and useful manner. As research is on-going on how to define common sense in machines and computer systems, the time is not far that systems will make decisions based on the common sense fed into them. This can be fed explicitly or the human brain can be mapped to the system. This is known as cognitive computing and neural networks where in the neurons from your brain are mapped onto the system or the machine. Some of the recent facts and news that will help you know on how Artificial Intelligence is on the Rise, is as follows: Microsoft's AI can now understand speech better than humans.AI improves cancer diagnosis.Google brings machine learning into G Suite apps.Elon Musk builds a new venture named NeuraLink to interface brain and computer systems.Facebook in their recent conference announced the research in the field of BCI which means Brain Computer Interface.Self-taught AI beats doctors at predicting heart diseases.Artificial Intelligence is said to be the future of Cyber Security.The list continues with each day a new development in the field of AI. Big companies and investment giants, VCs are betting high on Artificial Intelligence start-ups and companies. AI has already reached to us in many ways such as smart messaging applications like Google Allo, smart voice recognition in our smartphones, facial recognition and identification by apps such as Facebook, Twitter and more. With us using AI technologies in our day to day lives, sooner or later AI is all set to dominate human lives, be it in the personal or professional sector both.

Team: You need a strong team for that, which means you need to hire and motivate the best minds in the field to work with you, if you have the money that is. Forming a group of highly talented and motivated artificial intelligence (AI) researchers is the first step towards development of AI. If you and your colleagues can work on it without expecting a salary for a long time then that would be very cool. You can also join a team yourself if you possess the skills that particular team is looking for. You can get into the field of AI and machine learning in several ways. Learn by yourself and start contributing to open-source and competing on Kaggle for example. You need to be comfortable with: Most ML algorithms: Deep learning (DL), support vector machines (SVM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and many more such as decision trees and decision forests.Numerical optimizationProgrammingCalculusStatistics and probabilityMany more AI techniques, old and new.You can also start developing your own system without forming a team. But this might take you some time, so the best approach is to narrow down your scope if you are working alone and make sure to define the problems clearly before starting to work on them. Compute power: The second thing is computational power, you need to build a supercomputing hardware system using a cluster of GPUs and CPUs. It is also possible to use more expensive cloud computing platforms such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure or Amazon cloud computing platforms for training purposes. But having your own mini-supercomputer is very important. Compute power is important because you will need to develop a lot of alternative models and test them before settling for the final model. There are a lot of such experimentations in AI development, it is intuitive that the more powerful your hardware is the more experiments you can run and the bigger the models you build can be.  Even when you build such a strong team and get access to some serious compute power you still ultimately need all that to build some sort of advanced algorithms, there is still a chance of failure only that the chance is greatly reduced. It is also important to note that developing such AI systems can take a lot of time and team effort, that is why you also need to develop a business model around that endeavor. That way investors can stick around for a while waiting for some sort of breakthrough and with it, some revenue source. You also need to make a clearly defined goal that can be expressed in a single sentence. For example. Solve intelligence and make the world a better place. -DeepMind That way you can recruite the right people who align with the goal, they might start showing up at your door step and all you have to do is screen them and grow your team. It is also important to attract the right people by contributing to the open-source community and building some techniques that hit the front pages. And one more last advice, ride the deep learning hype train, that is, contribute something to the advancement of DL algorithms, that should get you and your team the much needed attention.

Besides this, there are several things possible, and depending on people’s taste, they might like one or the other innovation better! Here are innovations to follow, that I had written about, and most of them need some or the other artificial intelligence. We would have over ground transport such as high speed trains, and Hyperloop. All this will help transfer humans, but that would not be enough. We would have sophisticated air transport for people, and goods. And we would have automatic delivery services with drones, and ground transport. A lot of our work will happen with virtual reality, and if that is not enough, mixed and augmented reality will come into picture. In mixed reality, you would be able to see things that are real and live, and superimpose them with things that are not.

We will have robots doing a lot of tasks at home and in the offices. Robots can be trained to do precise tasks, but in future it would be possible to train them to learn and adapt from ambiguous inputs.

Pretty great; depending what you mean by AI, a practical AI application of scientific machine learning, is PumasAI (at the company’s website): Accelerated drug development The fastest end-to-end pharmaceutical modeling and simulation platform for quantitative analysis across the drug development lifecycle. Built on: SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine LearningSciML is a NumFOCUS sponsored open source software organization created to unify the packages for scientific machine learning. This includes the development of modular scientific simulation support software, such as differential equation solvers, along with the methodologies for inverse problems and automated model discovery. By providing a diverse set of tools with a common interface, we provide a modular, easily-extendable, and highly performant ecosystem for handling a wide variety of scientific simulations. High Performance and Feature-Filled Differential Equation Solving . The library DifferentialEquations.jl is a library for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), stochastic differential equations (SDEs), delay differential equations (DDEs), differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and hybrid differential equations which include multi-scale models and mixtures with agent-based simulations. The templated implementation allows arbitrary array and number types to be compatible, giving compatibility with arbitrary precision floating point numbers, GPU-based computations, unit-checked arithmetic, and other features. DifferentialEquations.jl is designed for both high performance on large-scale and small-scale problems, and routinely benchmarks at the top of the pack . Physics-Informed Model Discovery and Learning . SciML contains a litany of modules for automating the process of model discovery and fitting. Tools like DiffEqParamEstim.jl and DiffEqBayes.jl provide classical maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation for differential equation based models, while DiffEqFlux.jl enables the training of embedded neural networks inside of differential equations (neural differential equations or universal differential equations) for discovering unknown dynamical equations, DataDrivenDiffEq.jl estimates Koopman operators (DMD) and utilizes methods like SInDy to turn timeseries data into LaTeX for driving differential equations, and ReservoirComputing.jl for Echo State Networks that learn to predict the dynamics of chaotic systems. A Polyglot Userbase . While the majority of the tooling for SciML is built using the Julia programming language , SciML is committed to ensure that these methodologies can be used throughout the greater scientific community. Tools like diffeqpy and diffeqr bridge the DifferentialEquations.jl solvers to Python and R respectively, and we hope to see many more developments along these lines in the near future. Compiler-Assisted Model Analysis and Sparsity Acceleration . Scientific models generally have structures like locality which leads to sparsity in the program structures that can be exploited for major performance acceleration. The SciML builds a set of interconnected tools for generating numerical solver code directly on the models that are being simulated. SparsityDetection.jl can automatically detect the sparsity patterns of Jacobians and Hessians from arbitrary source code, while ModelingToolkit.jl can rewrite difhttps://sciml.ai/ How is AI or deep learning done with Julia? You most often use Flux.jl package/ecosystem, sometimes Avalon.jl (basically trying to be a PyTorch clone, for practical use, rather than being more research focused), I see it can be over twice as fast as PyTorch (at least in some cases), while note also PyTorch.jl wrapper and other Julia-only frameworks such as Knet.jl (and BetaML.jl, more for education; full disclosure, I only contributed some activation functions there). There’s however also: Accelerating Flux.jl with PyTorch kernelsAccelerating Flux.jl with PyTorch kernels Julia and Flux provide a flexible differentiable programming system. Flux does not trade flexibility and abstraction for performance, and in fact strives to achieve both in the same package. For example, Flux is able to target multiple hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs . As a result, it is one of the pillars of Julia’s deep learning ecosystem , with almost 40 packages leveraging it. Here, we introduce Torch.jl , a package that wraps optimised kernels from PyTorch . Even though Julia’s GPU compiler is already pretty good for general use and under heavy development , we provide Torch.jl to leverage well-debugged high performance kernels that have been built by the PyTorch community, much in the same way we use BLAS and LAPACK for Linear Algebra. For popular object detection models - ResNet50, ResNet101 and VGG19 - we compare inference times for Flux using Torch.jl with our native tooling, and find Flux+Torch to be 2-3x faster. On larger batch sizes, the difference is much higher, since Julia’s GPU stack needs further development in the area of memory management and GC. All runs are with a Tesla K40 (12 GB), julia v1.4.2, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz and 32 GB of DDR3 Memory. This project achieves two things. It brings state of the art performance to Julia users who need it today with no fuss, while simulatneously providing benchmarks to identify areas of improvement in the Julia GPU compiler stack, and track them . Usage Adding Torch.jl is easy. It assumes the presence of a CUDA enabled GPU on the device it is being added to, and assumes a linux system. Moving models over to PyTorch kernels; introducing torch Users of Flux are familiar with calling the gpu(model) API to accelerate their models with GPUs. The API for Torch.jl is just as simple - torch(model) . julia > using Metalhead julia > resnet = ResNet () julia > torch_resnet = resnet |> torch Of course this is not just limited to ResNet . Many architectures would benefit from this - such as VGG , DenseNet , Inception etc. Check out Metalhead.jl for some common computer vision models. It also helps improve performance in models such as YOLO via ObjectDetector.jl . In addition, large hard to train models like RCNNs also benefit from these kernels. Installation # Type `]` to enter Pkg mode in the Julia REPL. pkg > add Torch [ ... ] # Note that this downloads the Torch artifact, which is quite large julia > using Torch Simple, intuitive API Our APIs make the PyTorch Tensor s mimic Julia arrays closely, in order to provide a Julian experience to Flux users. Torch.jl provides the Tensor type which closely follows the semantics of a regular Julia array, albeit while being managed by PyTorch. One can create a tensor with an API similar to rand or zeros . julia > z = Tensor ( 3 , 3 ) 3 ×3 Tensor { Float32 , 2 } : 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Controlling the device the tensor is loaded on (the default being on CPU) is done via the devhttps://fluxml.ai/blog/2020/06/29/acclerating-flux-torch.html For example, Flux is able to target multiple hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs. As a result, it is one of the pillars of Julia’s deep learning ecosystem, with almost 40 packages leveraging it. Here, we introduce Torch.jl, a package that wraps optimised kernels from PyTorch. You can also use TensorFlow.jl with Julia, it was used up to TF 2.0, then people switched to Flux.jl. There’s also PyTorch.jl wrapper and Keras.jl, both wrappers (outdated? not sure).

Its colloquial meaning changes from decade to decade: IBM likes to brand their rule-based Watson system as “AI”, others think that “AI” is now synonymous with statistical machine learning and reinforcement learning, and still others reject the use of “AI” at all because its definition is so immaterial. This is a roundabout answer, but the answer to whether you need deep learning knowledge will depend on your own definition of “AI”. If you are like most academics working in the space, you can interpret “AI” as “general techniques for enabling computers to do whatever a human mind can do”. Then you will need to focus on statistical machine learning, which deep learning derives its principles from. Statistical learning has enabled new capabilities and software that were previously not possible. Deep Learning methods are particularly strong at highly structured, high-dimensional data like audio, images - so in order to develop AI applications that rely on ML technology to solve your problems, you will need to understand Deep Learning (at least the most commonly used architectures and commonly used tricks like BatchNorm, ResNet, RNNs). An alternate, less human-centric view on “AI” is “pushing the boundary of what computers are able to do”. This need not be something that humans are good at. For instance, in medium-to-long horizon trading strategies in quantitative finance, one deals with medium-to-high dimensional data (financial time series) but it contains a very low signal-to-noise ratio (at least that’s what the theory says). It’s like listening for a needle dropping over a radio with a lot of noise injected. Publicly available research has not shown that Deep Learning is useful in this domain, so DL isn’t being used heavily by finance firms. They rely on hypothesis testing over simpler statistical models and manually crafted, interpretable features. If you also consider ML models used in quantitative finance as “AI”, then no, you do not need to study deep learning. If you are building a product for users (e.g. Amazon Alexa or Google Search) who don’t care how the product works - you might interpret “AI” as “anything that gives the illusion of human-like capability”. In this case, rule-based systems and complicated flows of if-statements / hard-coded expert knowledge may get you quite far. Many AI and robot demos are examples of this - overstated smoke and mirrors to convince an audience that something is lifelike. The Sophia (robot) is an example of this. So, if you want to build AI systems founded on the principles of statistical machine learning - yes, you should probably study Deep Learning if only to be aware of what the most-capable systems are currently capable of, and what it is not capable of yet. Once you know Deep Learning, you will have a good grasp on when and when you shouldn’t use it in your applications.",2021-03-08T18:07:54.732Z,"Is deep learning knowledge necessary for a developer to become an AI developer?

The something it gets applied to just has to have certain features, I should think. One feature might be, two levels, in a hierarchical connection. Probably everything falls within that. I’ve wondered how similar Godel’s incompleteness theorem is to narcissism. The most general abstract idea of it, at least is similar, at least worded like this: You take the bit of logic of the theory, put it into the language of the system you’re dealing with, thus kind of put the logic into that system, and that fucks the system up. In a bit more reasonable language, the theorem’s logic is, a statement is made in a system’s language, and that statement is true but unprovable in the system, so that kind of rankles anyone who made or believes in that system because such logical systems weren’t supposed to have unprovable statements in it. I can’t help feel there is some similarity between Godel’s theorem and narcissism. Here’s a diagrammatic representation of Godel’s theorem I found some time ago when I had had this idea, I was wondering if narcissism, it’s logic, could be represented in the kind of flow/logic diagrams of computing, so I looked to see if I could find such a diagram of Godel’s theorem and found this:  Thinking the above about normal logic, and along with that, that I think quantum physics (its logic, what it means, what it shows, the way you think in order to slightly get your head round it, eg it includes everything is connected/one — the opposite of separation, dichotomies which is what narcissism spends its time doing — quantum physics is inherently at odds with narcissism I think, if everyone assimilated quantum physics more clearly in their heads, narcissism wouldn’t be able to exist, it’d evaporate because the necessary environment for it wouldn’t exist) is the antidote to narcissism, I wondered (I asked the question on here) if Godel’s incompleteness theorem holds for quantum four value logic. I was really hoping it wouldn’t, but a pretty seemingly knowledgeable answerer said he was pretty sure it did hold. Be amazing if it didn’t. But it probably does. Oh, could AI develop narcissism? Bearing in mind what I’ve just said above, if it’s running on normal computers, yes, quantum ones, no? Maybe. The logic of narcissism feels like it would be replicable in computer logic, AI, yup. I mean if you get some truly successful AI system, then that’s capable of imitating human intelligence and presumably its negative",2021-03-08T18:08:22.201Z,"Could AI develop narcissism? ",Quora

Mathematical intuition is the ability to solve equations. Theoretically, you can teach it equations, so along the line it will develop intuition. You can hard-code this, many have already done it with Desmos and Symbolab. So that means yes. Mathematical intuition is the ability to have a pretty close estimation of how an equation should turn out. This also can be done with machine learning assisted pattern recognition, so yes. Mathematical intuition is the deep understanding of how arithmetic works. This would be tricky, I’d doubt an AI can have a deep understanding of how arithmetic works.

This is a deep field in game programming that requires a technically skilled team of highly specialized programmers to create dynamic and intuitive gameplay that is functional, seamless, and exciting. Duties This person works under the direction of the lead programmer and is responsible for determining an agent’s behavior: the actions taken by the non-player characters. The AI programmer creates code and algorithms for pathfinding, group movement and cooperation, tactical strategy, and camera control. He or she sets patterns and parameters for state mechanics (rules) and establishes how an agent thinks and solves problems, creating a framework for artificial emotions and ideas. The exact scope of an AI programmer’s job varies from one studio to the next—in some cases, object collisions fall to the AI programmer; in others, this task may be assigned to a physics specialist. During development, the programmer will work closely with designers to implement the necessary processes to make combat possible, establish decision trees for opponents, and create neural networks. He or she also cooperates with game testers to identify bugs and insert the appropriate fixes. Skills & Education This role requires a person who enjoys challenging problem-solving, is both a creative and critical thinker, and has a strong education in advanced mathematics. A bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, or game development is required for a job as an AI programmer. Larger game developers may prefer a master’s degree. You will be expected to have a firm foundation in C++; STL; APIs like OpenGL and PhysX; Perl, Perforce, and profiling tools. Coursework in physics and technical writing are also helpful. An AI programmer should be comfortable on multiple game consoles and able to adapt to existing systems. Strong written and verbal communication skills are necessary, as is the ability to draft clear, concise technical documentation. Most importantly, developers look for an individual who is passionate about making and playing games. The field of AI is constantly evolving, and therefore offers great opportunity for creativity and innovation. What to Expect This is not an entry-level position. Even with an advanced degree, companies look to hire someone with at least two years of practical AI experience on one or more shipped titles. To work your way up to AI programmer, consider roles as a C++ programmer or junior software engineer. This role is also closely related to that of a physics engineer. Often it is easier to get a programming job at a small development studio, then work your way up the ladder to a larger studio or to a more senior role. Established AI programmers with proven skills and experience are highly sought after in the game industry, and have the option to pursue many areas of development.",2021-03-08T18:12:49.125Z,"What should I study on my own to become an AI developer?

I believe it will accelerate rapidly into other industries in the coming decades.  - AI/automation in making stuff - happening right now, and spreading to new sectors of the economy. As it takes hold, it means a fundamental transfer of power from labor to capital, as it irrecoverably alters the basics of labor demand. That inevitably would change the society that we live in. So the key question is about what kind of social arrangements we'd like when advancements in AI affect other sectors of employment. There is a default trajectory if we do nothing, but judging from the experience from the manufacturing sector, it may not lead to a good outcome to a lot of people. On the other hand, there are things that we can do to shape the social arrangements as we see fit. Therefore, it is up to civil society in general to organise itself in preparation for this change, which may shape up to be one of the defining challenges of our time.

From January 2 Continue ReadingOne can intuitively surmise artificial intelligence (AI) is today’s hot commodity, gaining traction in businesses, academia and government in recent years. Now, there is data — all in one place — that documents growth across many indicators, including startups, venture capital, job openings and academic programs. These bellwethers were captured in the AI Index produced under the auspices of was conceived within Stanford university of Human-Centered AI Institute and the one hundred year study on AI (AI100).  One key measure of AI development is startups and venture capital funding. From January 2015 to January 2018, active AI startups increased 2.1x, while all active startups increased 1.3x, the report states. “For the most part, growth in all active startups has remained relatively steady, while the number of AI startups has seen exponential growth,” the report’s authors add. The trickle of venture capital into AI startups, another bellwether, also turned into a torrent. VC funding for AI startups in the US increased 4.5x from 2013 to 2017. Meanwhile, VC funding for all active startups increased 2.08x. Another key measure, job openings, accelerated in AI. While machine learning is the largest skill cited as a requirement, deep learning is growing at the fastest rate — from 2015 to 2017 the number of job openings requiring deep learning increased 35x, the report’s authors state. The AI Index also cited McKinsey data that demonstrated the types of AI solutions being deployed in organizations. In North American organizations, the main forms of AI include the following: Robotic process automation 23%Machine learning 23%Conversational interfaces 20%Computer vision 20%Natural language text understanding 17%Natural language speech understanding 16%Natural language generation 11%Another interesting bellwether, downloads from AI-oriented open source solutions, is way up. The number of robot operating system (ROS) binary packages downloaded from ROS.org, an open source software stack for robotics. Since 2014, total downloads and unique downloads have increased by 352% and 567%, respectively. “This represents an increased interest in both robotics and the use of robot systems,” the report’s authors conclude. “Because the number of unique downloads is growing at a faster rate than the total number of downloads, we can infer that there are more ROS users, not just that ROS is more frequently used.” Finally, another telling AI bellwether is AI course enrollment. The percentage of undergraduate students enrolled in introductory AI and machine learning courses has grown. While introductory AI courses tend to have a slightly larger proportion of undergraduate students than introductory machine learning courses (an average of 5.2% in AI versus 4.4% in ML), the number of undergraduate students in introductory machine learning courses are growing at a faster rate. Introductory AI enrollment was 3.4x larger in 2017 than it was in 2012, while introductory machine learning course enrollment was 5x larger than it was in 2012. ”This depicts the growing importance of machine learning as a subfield of AI,” the report states.",2021-03-08T18:19:06.024Z,"How fast is AI developing?

Some people argue that it isn’t a danger at all - others argue that it could potentially spell the end of human civilization. We truly don’t know who’s right and who’s wrong. In the interests of fairness and balance, I should make it clear that I, personally, am definitely in the “**DANGER! DANGER!! WILL ROBINSON**” camp. FACTS: It’s essential to clarify that the kinds of AI that Google, Apple, Facebook, Tesla and others are using for all manner of interesting tasks (like playing Go, understanding human speech, recognizing faces and driving a car) - are not the kind of “general” AI that we’re talking about here…they are another thing entirely - they are emphatically not the thing we’re discussing here.As of March 2020, no AI research team has the faintest idea how to create a GAI. We’re pretty sure not just a matter of making a “better AI”. There is some fundamental difference here that nobody yet seems to understand - something relating to “consciousness” and “self-identity” perhaps.Inventing the first GAI (and presuming that it DOESN’T decide to wipe out humanity or enslave us or keep us as pets) would be the most phenomenally financially/militarily/politically valuable thing in all of human history. Whoever succeeds at this has a license to print money.OPINIONS: So - what Elon and many “big names” in the tech world (Bill Gates, Nick Bostrom, Gary Marcus, the late Stephen Hawking, Vernor Vinge) are calling for is that everyone takes a step back from this research and we think very carefully about what and how we’re doing it. Having some kind of legal restrictions on how the research goes forward would NOT be a stupid idea. That said - this is an international problem. If (say) the USA limits GAI research in some way and (perhaps) China does not - then we could be in a hell of a lot of trouble - because if they succeed, then whether GAI is safe or not - we’d be at such a phenomenal technological disadvantage that we’d never be able to recover or compete again. THE COLD WAR ANALOGY: Just as in the cold war - when nobody wanted to push the world into a civilization-ending nuclear holocaust - everyone was practically bankrupting their economies to make nuclear weapons and delivery systems as fast as they possibly could! That seems pretty stupid - but it is exactly what we did. The same exact thing could happen here. In the cold war, international pressure on both sides gradually resulted in arms limitation talks, then arms reduction talks, then limitations intended to prevent terrorists and rogue nations from building nukes - and now we have some kind of uneasy peace and stability. GAI is somewhat analogous to that - but it’s there is a subtle difference. The analogy for an actual nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile sitting in a silo is the RESEARCH into GAI. The analogy for the holocaust that ends humanity would be the END RESULT of the GAI research - if things turn bad..and maybe even if they don’t. So people like Elon Musk are asking for limitations on the research - which for academics and corporate research departments is complete anathema. Efforts to similarly limit other potentially end-of-the-world things (such as research into human genetic enhancement or biological warfare agents) have pretty much failed internationally - and the same thing may be true here. Even if we all agree that we want to limit things…maybe we cannot. ELON MUSK’S INVOLVEMENT: Like many scientists and engineers - Elon has been concerned about this for quite some time. He founded and funded an organization called “OpenAI” to try to investigate the issues and to figure out whether it would be possible to make a safe GAI. As you may guess from their name, they were intended to be an “open” organization, releasing all of their research into the public domain…which indeed they did. At some point, Elon’s involvement with AI (not GAI) research at Tesla was causing a commercial conflict with OpenAI’s work - so Elon stepped back from OpenAI, continued to fund their research - but resigned his post there and is no longer involved in day-to-day operations. Subsequently, he founded another company called “Neuralink” (who currently share office space with OpenAI but are not linked in any way to them) with the idea of solving the GAI problem in another way. Neuralink are all about implanting circuitry into the human brain. Potentially, making the superior intelligence of a GAI be a part of what it is to be human. So rather than risking GAI taking over humanity - it would become a part of who we are as humans. I rather like this approach to solving the problem - although there is still a potential arms-race between enhanced humans and computer-based GAI’s that we might still lose - or the mere fact of becoming enhanced might change us in seriously bad ways - or create a two-tiered civilization between the enhanced and the normals. I’m pretty sure Elon will work against the latter possibility…but who knows? It may not be the answer - but it’s definitely something to consider - and Neuralink’s research is quite likely to solve many other more mundane problems along the way…curing blindness and deafness, for example. Since then - once out of Elon’s control, OpenAI have retreated from their “Open” mandate and have pulled research results and software back from the public domain and are now working in secret. This has resulted in Elon becoming very seriously pissed with them…and it’s not clear what (if anything) he’ll do about that. BUT CAN’T WE CONTROL A GAI? Almost certainly not. Remember, BY DEFINITION, a GAI is smarter than us. Perhaps a hell of a lot smarter. Certainly it can be much faster than us - so even if it has an intellect is on a par with a 75 IQ human - that lightning speed might allows it to “think for a year” about a problem in the time it takes us to type in the question and read the answer! If the GAI can get onto the Internet - and has the concept of “self preservation” - then we’re in deep trouble. It would know that we could yank out the power cord - or press the reset button and kill the GAI program so that we can fix a bug or something. The GAI would logically panic about this possibility and try to hack into large servers and spread itself across every computer on the planet to make it virtually impossible to kill. It could easily do this before we could even know that it did it. The only hope of any kind of control is to “lock it into a box” - cut it off from 100% of all communications with the outside world until we’re somehow sure that it’s friendly. But there is a problem here: Firstly, how could we know it’s friendly - if it’s a lot smarter than us?Secondly, actual research into this strongly suggests that even a computer that’s no smarter than a human could persuade a human to “release it from the box”. (Yudkowsky - The AI-Box Experiment …to pick just the first experiment - there have now been hundreds of people who have successfully repeated it - and persuading a human to release the AI is very, very do-able).Thirdly, what use is a GAI if you can’t connect it to a source of knowledge or have it control something? The GAI might understand this - and bide it’s time, playing “Mr Nice Guy” until you release it from the box.CONCLUSION: An actual functioning GAI has at least the potential to be every bit as dangerous as nuclear weapons - arguably much more so. A nuke can kill you - but a GAI could enslave you. BUT unlike nukes - it has a huge potential up-side. A friendly, (or, perhaps “controlled”) GAI could solve the global warming problem, cure cancer, provide world peace. Hence, putting some kind of legal framework in place seems like a good thing to do - although without the teeth of international cooperation - we’re probably going to have to get to the brink of disaster, just as we did with the Cold War. The difference here is that we won’t know whether GAI is good or bad until it’s too late…and it’s likely that we won’t even know that we’re within six months of making a GAI until we actually succeed and either wipe out humanity or not.",2021-03-08T18:24:08.605Z,"What are the regulations Elon Musk is calling for in all advanced AI development?

Bridging this gap, leads to Artificial Intelligence. The evolution in the field of Artificial Intelligence is growing at an unprecedented rate. As artificial intelligence can be applied in all the major fields, the growth is really very fast. To some extent AI is going to dominate many industries and many business sectors. Briefly, AI includes automation, analytic, IoT (only to some extent when it consists of smart sensors technology), machine learning, computer vision and many more. Artificial Intelligence nowadays is on the boom. Many start-ups and existing companies are trying to imbibe AI in their systems. Though the output generated is more accurate and efficient, implementing and imbibing AI technologies is not so easy. It requires a huge amount of expertise and knowledge in order to make it useful in a productive and useful manner. As research is on-going on how to define common sense in machines and computer systems, the time is not far that systems will make decisions based on the common sense fed into them. This can be fed explicitly or the human brain can be mapped to the system. This is known as cognitive computing and neural networks where in the neurons from your brain are mapped onto the system or the machine. Some of the recent facts and news that will help you know on how Artificial Intelligence is on the Rise, is as follows: Microsoft's AI can now understand speech better than humans.AI improves cancer diagnosis.Google brings machine learning into G Suite apps.Elon Musk builds a new venture named NeuraLink to interface brain and computer systems.Facebook in their recent conference announced the research in the field of BCI which means Brain Computer Interface.Self-taught AI beats doctors at predicting heart diseases.Artificial Intelligence is said to be the future of Cyber Security.The list continues with each day a new development in the field of AI. Big companies and investment giants, VCs are betting high on Artificial Intelligence start-ups and companies.

60466cb754c1fe5d22a27153,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-determine-a-fake-AI-developer?-,"The difficulty of this question is that AI in its current form (if it really has one) might change at any time. That being because the field should be attracted to the best approach to modeling intelligence. The modeling is subject to evolution. However, there are those who think all the work that came before is bunk and that they know all about AI, or they are going to try to tell you they know. So, they will likely not be interested in existing algorithms, or the set of algorithms, common to AI. For instance, A* and alpha-beta are pretty often discussed. Knowledge of productions systems (collections of condition - response pairs) is pretty well understood as part of modeling, even if there is a departure from symbolic representations. It may be common to confuse clustering with learning. And, many think that satisfaction as a goal can’t be useful when people prefer optimization. But, one of the main tenets of AI is that optimal goals otherwise unreachable with available resources and time may be satisfied by a goal that is suboptimal within time limits and with available resources. Note that even A* uses heuristic metrics to overcome greedy operations. Algorithms have to adaptable and seek ways to get out of locally extreme points. In a Boltzman machine, randomness is introduced at minima in an attempt to shake the seek point out of its minima. In a simulated annealing process, the heat is raised for some number of cycles in order to randomize the local minima. The process would accept a state as satisfactory after being stuck in the state over a number of cycles, or until the clock runs out. So, a developer that prefers rigid, predictable programs, might not be an AI developer but an EDP specialist claiming to be doing AI. Or, it might be someone who just wants money for AI, i.e a con artist. In which case, the guy won’t be producing any software of any kind.",2021-03-08T18:28:07.658Z,"How do I determine a fake AI developer? ",Quora

That is a somewhat silly answer, but it is to the point that the questions seems to posit the theory that sentience is contained in biological components in our only examples at hand, so it must be something inherently biological in nature. I don’t think the clear correlation is enough to argue causation. If you have sentient biological components (a brain for example), and attach it to a computer you would not be creating sentience in the computer you would merely be grafting them together. All that said, a couple decades back there was some serious focus on the idea that perhaps real intelligence of the sort that we tend to conflate with sentience is only possible as a synthesis of broad sensory input and real-time interaction with physical actuators capable if interacting with the environment being sensed. I am not doing all of the work done by MIT and others on this subject justice, but in the end I think is suffers from the same fundamental gap between theory and hopeful thinking that is represented in the initial question. We hope for some emergent intelligent or sentient property to emerge from throwing enough of what we correlate with intelligence together and hope it crosses some kind of threshold on its own that we don’t understand. My personal opinion is that if we throw a million digital watches into a giant bag and shake it for a billion years it will not result in a general purpose computer, let alone a sentient intelligence. There is something missing, which if we can’t even define it we have no realistic hope for blindly creating the circumstances which will inspire its spontaneous emergence. I recommend reading “A Society of Mind” by Marvin Minsky as a great introduction to the idea that intelligence is not a simple property present or not, and therefore any system we hope to create that embodies it will require complexity of structure and purposes rather than be emitted from sheer volume of a simple function. The “bottom-up” hope that doing a slightly smart process enough times will result in true intelligence is something Dr. Minsky used to refer to as “physics envy”. Your question is a good one, don’t be put off by my answer as it is intended to be encouragement to keep asking and digging deeper. In the decades that I have pondered the subject of intelligence it seems to always be some elusive level below however I imagine modeling it. Evidence suggests this to be the case everywhere in AI research, despite the cool things we have learned to do with machine learning and other essentially pattern matching approaches to intelligence. None of which are anywhere close to general intelligence let alone sentience.",2021-03-08T18:33:41.809Z,"Would AI develop sentience if combined with biological components? ",Quora

From an agent based perspective. In which “AI” refers to something that could be as smart as a “regular” pet and viewed as an autonomous agent of sorts. Right now, AI development is mostly a collection of very specialized #1’s with several cases where #2 is explicitly used to model/optimize a problem, one example of that would be a multi-agent simulation where each agent consists of a neural network/decision tree model. Examples like those could be seen in ecosystem modeling, artificial life or even business simulations. The answer to #1 is always. Since agency is on the human-being side. The answer to #2 is tricky. I assume it was what you intended to know. Again, number two branches into several different paths because of a couple of important conditions: A) Does the agent pass the Turing Test? B) Is the agent a conscious being in the same way we are? C) Is the agent a conscious being in a different way than we are? The Turing Test is a great benchmark. Because it measures if an AI can look like a human. Yet the big question remains: Is it actually a conscious entity? Because a program with big enough memory could just memorize a decent amount of behavior of how to act like a conscious thing, without being a conscious thing. The theoretical answer to this conundrum lies in B or C after passing A. So should AI be given the same ethical considerations as humans? Should they have rights? If the agent passes A and it is B, the answer should be a resounding yes. If the agent passes A and it is C, the answer might most likely be a yes depending on how we process this huge discovery. If the agent does not pass A and it is B, the answer is most likely no, depending on our empathy towards them. We certainly know lots of living beings who are conscious in the same way we are, yet we don’t hold them to human ethical standards. People who have pigs as pets usually stop eating them. If the agent does not pass A and it is C, we might have created some alien AI pet. Yet what complicates this even more is: What is consciousness actually? Is it an illusion? Is it actually a physical thing? Where is the matter to mind phase of the Universe? Are we robots? Is there actually free will? Adding human nature into all of these philosophical considerations makes it so much easier to answer this. The practical answer to this lies after crossing an empathy threshold towards the autonomous AI agent. Is the autonomous agent behavior believable enough that someone could empathize with it as a living being? If the answer is yes, even artificial life [1]in silico could be held to that standard.  Heck, even soldiers empathize [2]with their hauling bots.  I’ve tried to be a little bit thorough, but I haven’t mentioned what happens with another branching of your question: When can these bots be held accountable for their decisions? Again we need to remember A, B and C. Which I’ll synthesize in one: Does the bot have something akin free will? If it does, it should be held accountable. If not, no.

This is a deep field in game programming that requires a technically skilled team of highly specialized programmers to create dynamic and intuitive gameplay that is functional, seamless, and exciting. Duties This person works under the direction of the lead programmer and is responsible for determining an agent’s behavior: the actions taken by the non-player characters. The AI programmer creates code and algorithms for pathfinding, group movement and cooperation, tactical strategy, and camera control. He or she sets patterns and parameters for state mechanics (rules) and establishes how an agent thinks and solves problems, creating a framework for artificial emotions and ideas. The exact scope of an AI programmer’s job varies from one studio to the next—in some cases, object collisions fall to the AI programmer; in others, this task may be assigned to a physics specialist. During development, the programmer will work closely with designers to implement the necessary processes to make combat possible, establish decision trees for opponents, and create neural networks. He or she also cooperates with game testers to identify bugs and insert the appropriate fixes. Skills & Education This role requires a person who enjoys challenging problem-solving, is both a creative and critical thinker, and has a strong education in advanced mathematics. A bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, or game development is required for a job as an AI programmer. Larger game developers may prefer a master’s degree. You will be expected to have a firm foundation in C++; STL; APIs like OpenGL and PhysX; Perl, Perforce, and profiling tools. Coursework in physics and technical writing are also helpful. An AI programmer should be comfortable on multiple game consoles and able to adapt to existing systems. Strong written and verbal communication skills are necessary, as is the ability to draft clear, concise technical documentation. Most importantly, developers look for an individual who is passionate about making and playing games. The field of AI is constantly evolving, and therefore offers great opportunity for creativity and innovation. What to Expect This is not an entry-level position. Even with an advanced degree, companies look to hire someone with at least two years of practical AI experience on one or more shipped titles. To work your way up to AI programmer, consider roles as a C++ programmer or junior software engineer. This role is also closely related to that of a physics engineer. Often it is easier to get a programming job at a small development studio, then work your way up the ladder to a larger studio or to a more senior role. Established AI programmers with proven skills and experience are highly sought after in the game industry, and have the option to pursue many areas of development.",2021-03-08T18:36:21.626Z,"What credentials does an AI developer have?

In the 50’s, Artificial Intelligence was being attempted, primarily with complex algorithms in machine code and later advanced programming languages. It turned out that trying to write programs to account for all the variables that the human brain has to account for in the real world was a tremendously daunting task. For aa machine to duplicate the ability of a toddler to say, walk across a room and navigate among all the obstacles an challenges that occur in real ife was doomed to failure. Some experiments with self-driving cars at say, Carnegie Mellon Robotics Labs in Pittsburgh produced a slew of vehicles that were exercised over varying terrains and obstacle courses. Eventually folks got the idea of having a machine not programmed by fixed algorithms, but to simply learn from experience, Calling this “simply” is quite an overstatement, as this learning that animals do is pretty impressive. This resulted in “Machine Learning”, whereby large amounts of data, representing the experiences and instincts that animals use in determining behavior and reactions to varying environmental and other inputs. This was the approach that became popular in the 1980s. Around 2010, the idea of “stacking” ML machines to allow for processing more complex relationships in “invisible” layers of ML inside the machines began to be studied. And that’s where we are now.

Every day, we rise with the sun for morning prayers to our robot overlords. We express our gratitude to them for 8 hours minimum while they take care of the rest of the world. After spoon feeding us dinner, they then tuck us into bed and sing us lullabies to take our mind off pondering how things ended up this way. I’m joking! But all jokes aside… The future with artificial intelligence (AI) will be radically different from today. You’ve asked a great question, one that actually touches upon a recently published paper from renowned economists Andy Sumner and Lukas Schlogl. The thesis? We’re spending too much time worrying if artificial intelligence (AI) will take our jobs and not enough time thinking about how it would do so, and how we can prepare for this. To understand how AI advancements will affect our future, we must understand how it will affect our role in society. So, let’s work on that right now by taking a journey through the next few decades. Contrary to every other headline about AI (and my joking above), the technology won’t be instantly consuming every job available to humans, leaving us only with the option to grovel at the feet of our new robot overlords. Don’t get me wrong -- AI is going to be extremely disruptive. In fact, PwC estimates AI will be responsible for 14 percent of global GDP growth by 2030. That equates to $15.7 trillion, more than the current combined GDP output of India and China. Woah, those are some astronomical figures! It makes sense that this esteemed multinational consulting firm considers AI to be “the biggest commercial opportunity in today’s fast-changing economy.” PwC also projects that AI will affect society in three distinct waves, each bringing a new level of automation never in reach before. The three waves of AI automation are ‘Algorithm’, ‘Augmentation’, and ‘Autonomy’. Right now, we’re in the Algorithm Wave, which is expected to last into the early 2020s. Automation’s still in its early stages, so AI developers for the most part are focused on using it to complete simple digital tasks. For this era, most of the emphasis is on data analysis, so communication, information, and financial sectors will feel the greatest impact. PwC estimates that about 2 to 3 percent of the UK is being affected by the Algorithm Wave. Around 2022 or so, we’ll enter the Augmentation Wave, which will last until the late 2020s. Finance will still be the main industry being disrupted, but we’ll start to see a marked transition from digital information to more concrete, physical manifestations. This includes repeatable tasks such as warehouse operations and drone deliveries. Low and medium education roles will be at a higher risk of automation than their higher education counterparts during this time. The Augmentation Wave could affect up to 20 percent of jobs according to PwC. If we go past 2027 and into the early 2030s, we’ll find ourselves in the Autonomy Wave. This era will be defined by AI’s ability to analyze data, make a decision, and take action without any need for human intervention. Basically, we’ll be the closest we’ve ever been to the AI depicted in sci-fi films. In this era, manual activities will bear the brunt of automation. Primary industries at risk of disruption include retail, manufacturing, and transportation. Autonomous cars will be more ubiquitous than ever before. Stores, factories, and warehouses will hardly resemble their current iterations. During the Autonomy Wave, AI-fueled automation will affect 30 percent of jobs, with 44 percent of low-education roles being at risk of being replaced. So, there you have it. AI integration won’t be some instantaneous change, but rather a piecemeal, iterative process. It’s worth noting that while the possibilities with AI seem endless, it can only affect jobs in a few ways. AI can only affect jobs in four ways: Destroy, Save, Augment, and Create. The transformation our roles in society will be staggered and feel random. But in reality, you can boil these changes back down to one of the above categories. For the first category, no sector will be affected more than service industries. Jobs in customer service, fast food, delivery, and similar sectors will all be prone to being replaced by AI. These roles are everywhere, so if you were sick and tired of reading headlines about AI taking your job, just wait -- the media’s going to have a field day during this time. In reality, there will also be many jobs safe and sound from AI disruption. There are the obvious ones, like the people making the AI. People such as engineers and programmers building and maintaining the AI will not only survive during this time; they’ll thrive! Because they’ll have to be highly skilled to make AI viable, they’ll also be highly rewarded as a result. Creative roles like those found in product management, R&D, and design will also be safe from AI. Military jobs and contractors will also be relatively okay due to the fact that robots won’t be able to do every part of their job. Sure, AI will take over more mundane aspects of their roles. But highly skilled guilds like handymen and electricians will still be needed to complete complex tasks out of AI’s reach. One type of job that most people don’t think about with regard to AI are those that you find in religion. It’s safe to say that preachers, spiritual leaders, and healers will remain human. It makes sense when you think about it -- people who have faith in a higher being probably won’t want to listen to AI give a sermon or carry out sacred traditions. AI will also augment many jobs. Similar to religion, we probably won’t want AI piloting our planes, even 20 to 30 years from now. Like contractors, AI autopilot will take care of the more mundane aspects of flying (the bulk of the work), but humans will still be on standby to monitor it and take over if necessary. You can expect to see this sort of streamlining across various industries. For example, AI will optimize warehouse operations to the point that only a few people will need to be there to monitor progress. But besides physical tasks, AI will also help with many mental tasks. AI will simplify decision-making in information-heavy fields such as law, medicine, and accounting. In this regard, everyone will benefit from AI’s inhuman ability to synthesize sharp insights from colossal amounts of data. Lastly, AI will also create new jobs! Of course, we can go with the obvious ones here: There will be many new roles directly related to the AI industry itself. But the disruptive technology will also make way for new avenues across all industries. It’s hard to predict exactly how and what at this moment due to the fact that AI will restructure numerous value chains. In case you were wondering, Sumner and Schlogl did propose a few solutions to stymy AI’s disruption. But to save you some time, the pair admitted that these strategies were not substantial enough; more thinking is needed. I guess you can add that to the list of jobs AI will create!",2021-03-08T18:41:31.602Z,"What will be some near-future AI developments? ",Quora

Existing algorithms: This maybe the quickest approach if you don't want to deal with the complexity of coming up with your own algorithms from scratch.

This is because there are well documented AI libraries and algorithms for things like machine learning and computer vision and one can deal with them as black boxes and easily integrate them into an already existing code base. This approach is ideal for product oriented development whereby a product is to be launched as quickly as possible.Invention. AI is not a solved problem as such there is a lot of room to maneuver around. This flexibility may introduce a lot of ambiguity but may also open doors for opportunities to create novel algorithms from scratch. It is important to understand that this requires tremendous amounts of effort and time, one needs to understand or hire a team to workout a lot of things in order to put up a working system from ground up. But in house build AI solutions can give you the edge over others especially if your systems are better than others by far. So the complexity of AI depends on what you want to do with it, treat AI components as black boxes and just plug them into existing systems then AI is simple. But if you build AI solutions from ground up then AI is complex because you need to understand a lot but this will give a huge advantage over others that are merely treating AI as black boxes.  I know this question is about what it takes to understand AI in general, I would say AI is complex compared to other software development processes. This is because AI is not a mature field yet compared to software engineering or software product development and in reality, especially for AI, there is no one solution that will solve everything. AI is narrow usually working only in narrow problems like image recognition and speech recognition. That is why there is a newer more broader field called Artificial general intelligence (AGI) but this field is way too young, again giving you a lot of ambiguity and flexibility with a lot of opportunities to build novel systems. The thing is that AI is a tool box and it is required that one understands the limitations and advantages of most AI algorithms. Knowing when to and when not to use AI means understanding it and not just treating the AI components as black boxes. Even if AI is generally more complex than social mobile applications it's not that complex generally. Deep learning for example is actually not as complex as it sounds, there is a common structure of arranging parallel processing units called neurons layer after layer. Maths is also very much needed, maths especially linear algebra, calculus and matrices are important for understanding most of AI. I would encourage you to step right in, trust me you will find it very fulfilling and interesting but challenging. AI requires people who are attracted to challenges and who are ready to develop cool jaw dropping interesting applications.

Richard Kenneth Eng's answer from two years ago mentions a list of several languages that were up-and-comers at the time with which Julia would have to compete: Crystal, Dart, Elixir, Kotlin, Rust, Swift, etc. (and even older languages like Haskell and Clojure) I think we can safely say that Julia has well outpaced the likes of Crystal, Dart and Elixir by now. Julia has passed Haskell and Clojure in some of the rankings as well. Kotlin has had a gang-buster year in 2018 and is going to continue going strong in 2019, but I don’t see it as a big competitor to Julia’s market. Kotlin’s strong points are in the same areas as Java: cross-platform application development and Android. Julia is more in the vein of Python in the sense that it’s not so much targeted at application development, but more on scientific and backend kind of jobs. Now we come to Rust and Swift, which is really where it gets interesting. Rust, Julia and Swift are all LLVM languages and therefore all benefit from improvements to LLVM (Crystal is also on LLVM, but I’m not sure that language is going anywhere—but I’d be happy to be wrong). In some sense these language are all in this thing together. Both Rust and Swift are currently more popular than Julia. I would say that, generally, Rust and Julia are more complementary languages. Rust is more in competition with C/C++, but it can’t compete with the ease of use of a language like Julia. Rust is great for mission-critical, low level systems where speed and security are the most important things. Julia is for times when you want (much) more speed than other languages with an interpreter, but you still want that the high level of abstraction for solving complex problems, or simply a pleasant way to do short simple scripts. Nobody is going to write an OS in Julia, but they might in Rust. You don’t do your automation scripting or matrix multiplications in Rust, but Julia is great for both those things. When it comes to Swift, we’ll have to see. Swift has a large market-share right now, but that’s primarily for Apple platforms. It’s also apparently good for backend, and it has had a big push towards machine learning this year (Chris Lattner is all about that stuff these days). I personally find Julia to be a more compelling and generally useful language than Swift, but, because it is the blessed language for Apple platforms, it’s not going away. It doesn’t have to become immediately successful in any other domains to stick around, which means that the ecosystem will continue to have steady growth. Julia doesn’t have that kind of position. Anyway, I’d say Julia has already “made it” in some sense. Development is starting to stabilize around the core language and pick up in the ecosystem, which is what you want. Major companies are using it and it’s getting public recognition. From my perspective, the last big hurdle for Julia is getting past the idea that it’s “just” a numeric language. It’s excellent in numerical computing, but, for me, it’s really like a super-charged (in terms of speed) version of a Python/Perl/Ruby style language with a bit more of an emphasis on functional programming, extra goodies from the Lisp world, and the ability to go down to a less abstracted level and write more efficient code when necessary. My hope is that people will find out how generally useful Julia is, and this will help it to achieve the next level of success. The reason I want that is so I can use it at work.

If you can create that first AI that understands people and writes code…it can improve itself to become more capable. It’s incredibly challenging to find the time, concentration, and capacity to build something as “simple” and successful as a 2005 version of Google (but active only within a companies firewall)… Even with available software (which makes it radically easier to approach this problem) getting to 25% of this problem is a problem that takes a few years and millions of dollars (less than .1% of what it took Google to solve the same problem but with a vastly larger dataset). With an AI, that problem becomes as simple as telling the machine what you want, answering a bunch of clarifying questions and waiting for it to complete…every machine that could do this could solve billions of (current) dollars in questions every year. When this technology is applied to improving the machine itself it becomes much better, much faster… so if you can get a machine as “smart” as one person…you can get it to digest enormous amounts of data, you can “throw” hypothesis out and have it go though mountains of evidence to support/deny those hypothesis…advancements that now take a year would take an hour…with the combination of robotics, the machine could actually deliver devices on a similar timeline … if creating atomically precise manufacturing would take a “moonshot” of 100Billion dollars over 10 years, a smarter than human machine might be able to engineer something in a week with 10 or 100 thousand.

At Wooclap, for instance, we are convinced that face-to-face courses can bring real added value to these online courses available thanks to Mooc’s. Wooclap is an online voting system that enables teachers to ask questions to their audience, during the class and students’ answer in real time on their smartphone, computer or tablet. The results are then displayed live on the teacher’s presentation, and he can then assess the level of understanding directly during the classroom. This increases participation and interactivity while at the same time integrating technology to the classroom. At Wooclap we strive to improving the classroom and learning experience experience. Recent studies show that attention decreases drastically after 10 minutes. Ideally, it would be necessary to vary the educational activities ... every 10 minutes. If in practice, it's easier said than done, Wooclap has thus also created a blog to help teachers in their approach. Whether with small groups (5-15 students) or with larger groups (500-1000 students), the Wooclap team tries to show you through concrete cases how to get the best out of the different tools available, provision to improve the learning process of students.",2021-03-08T19:02:25.238Z,"What AI developments have had the most surprising results?

There was a technology developed called “Content Addressed Memory” that may come to new life - now there may be a need for it. The number of AMs (Autonomous Machines) such as AI Based self driving cars, AI based autonomous robots, AI based autonomous devices, AI based autonomous computers will rise significantly. By then everybody will sell their products with AI-Based XYZ. AI is like Internet in 1998. Widely used but still not fully developed. But everything will include AI one way or the other.The unemployment rate will rise to very uncomfortable 100+ Million across the globe. Countries will start to TAX AMs in order to finance unemployment aid. Unemployed will most likely not be able to find a new job. It’s when the wider public understands that AI is different to any other new technology: AI is used to make machines autonomous - rather then needing new skills to use the new technology by humans. AI is not even a technology, software, microprocessors, robots, cars everything existed, but a completely new way to use technology. As a result, a significant shift in our society will begin. The makers movement will explode, social workers, nature-observers and protectors, artists, musicians, coaches and so forth will rise. We will move from “employed humans” to “autonomous humans”. We will grow more self determined across all levels of education and with a higher value to our society, environment and future evolution of humankind. A major societal inflection point may surface. Those who still need to “work” will push the AI development forward, knowing that if their jobs will be replaced, they can - like all the others - do what they really like to do and receive a UBI (Unconditional base income). 2030–2040The AMs are substantially advanced. AI development languages and AI operating systems will become a standard in the tech space. Under the development systems the graphical application design tools may dominate as they can be used by pretty much any generally educated business manager. Just pointing and selecting data set sources, algorithms that analyze those data sets, selecting processors (neural networks) to pump it through and so forth. It will be the beginning of broadly available general AI. The number of AI based applications will grow faster and bigger than all conventional software together. The old software world is fading away. The number of applications and functionalities leveraging IOT, sensor techniques, and robots will enter into all kinds of industries replacing ever more people. It will now be apparent - also for the last human on earth - that industrial work will be completely eradicated. Industrial unemployment will be raising to over a billion people in the next 10 to 15 years. Whether its office workers or manufacturing workers, AMs will take over the jobs. Everybody who is working on repetitive products or services can be replaced by an AM. Artists, will still keep creating Art any creative work that creates a unique ‘thing’ will obviously not be replaced because it would simply make no sense and cost too much. Those AMs work 3 times as long (8 versus 24 hours), no social cost, no vacation. Unemployment aid will at the very latest now become an unconditional base income for everybody, funded by the earlier implemented Value added AM tax. Autonomous Humans will now become the majority.We also reached another interesting inflection point. Product costs are no longer determined by the amount of labor cost - back to raw material cost based pricing. But the raw material may actually sooner or later come from other planets. Science Fiction? No - this is now becoming reality. Not only because we understand that renewable ENERGY is limited but also recyclable MATERIAL is not infinitely available on earth. A billion cars with Lithium Batteries would require more Lithium after the first few replacement than we have on earth. 2040 - 2050The AMs will evolve further, write complex algorithms themselves, beyond our own capabilities, create structures and construct products beyond our intellectual capacity. Humans, however, will also evolve further and deeper than we can imagine today, in 2018. Our brain will have more capacity for creativity because we will no longer need to remember when King Ramses built his empire, who his father was and so fort. We have that knowledge in our extended, collective, connected technical brain. Internet connection is omnipresent and guaranteed on every square inch on land or water on earth. Mass products in any way or shape can be constructed, prepared and produced by AMs. Only the decision, what we actually want to create, will still be coming from the human mind. And latest by then we will bring forward real self aware AMs (if not much earlier). There are many people including me working on self conscious AI concepts already. Yet even self aware AMs are far away from the human brain capabilities. The AI research will help us better understand what we are actually capable of. We will learn more about ourselves in these 10 years than in all the 300,000 years before. The human mind’s creativity is so complex that AI is still very far away from coming even close to it. We will have a far deeper understanding of the human mind than just our intelligence. We will understand that intelligence is just one power of our mind, similar to our power to move, the power of our muscles and the power of our orientation - which we have all augmented already some hundreds of years ago. We will understand artificial intelligence is no more than our artificial muscles, which we call tools. 2050 - 2075Leveraging our added skills, collective knowledge our amazing machines, scientists will be replaced by those machines as well. Testing something new and prove a repetitive behavior to make it a scientifically proven fact, is much better done by an AI system than by a Ph.D. ‘system’. Science will be done by AMs across all factions. At the same time, innovative and creative ideas will explode, AM’s will analyze and verify those ideas in no time. AM owners will compete for those crazy but verified ideas and build it. AMs will help revitalize space exploration in a new and rather meaningful way. We will need other places than earth to harvest raw material and we need other planets for recycling or wast disposal. AMs, powered by solar energy are the best “people” to send to other planets or our moon to extract, produce, recycle, deposit. We don’t even need to terraform Mars for that. But we may safe Mars for exploring Terraforming together with AMs. Autonomous Machines and Autonomous Humans will build the most powerful synergy ever built. We will be depending on AI, more than on any other technology built so far. Most technology can be replaced by something else. But an AI system that can iterate through millions of ideas for any given solution in a few hours is something not only beyond what we built but beyond ourselves. More details on how and why thousands of different jobs in 300+ industries, from around the world will be replaced in the next 30 years and how we manage the inflection point from the disaster of being “unemployed” to the luxury of becoming an autonomous human will be available on: World With No Work Technological - Business - Societal Impact DevelopmentThe era of AMs - Autonomous Machines 2020 - 2025We will see a rising number of products mainly chat bots, entering our day to day world.

I have basic understanding of brain and neurons work and how AI work. My personal understanding about this is following. First, we need differentiate brain, mind and consciousness. Usually human understanding about them is blended, mixed, fused. When we are more clear about them then we can see where AI would fit in and what is the difference. Brain. It consists of neurons. They process physical signals at lower level (sensing and moving) and higher level (reflexes, coordination, balance, etc). Brain also functions as an antenna and transmitter to mind. Mind. It consists largely of emotions (they have also chemical counterparts), wantings, beliefs (definitions, meanings, knowledge). There are also thoughts, imagination, decision-making, motivation, concept of “self”, etc. Consciousness. There resides awareness, inspiration, intuition, conscience, feelings, liveness, etc. Here I tried to define those three instances by their function. Now, comparing those to AI. AI can do and can exceed human physical signal processing, specifically higher level of data processing. It can do amazing things, like “understanding” and speaking a language or “understanding” and modifying an image. I say “understanding”, because there is really no awareness, AI functions only based on training. It can work on arbitrary data and find patterns. It can do excellent “decisions” in limited scope. We can call this AI 1.0. Contemporary science has no clue yet how mind and brain are interlinked. It is well studied how outer layers of neurons work in signal processing and that can be perfectly mimicked by AI. But going into deeper layers the track is lost how those signals are processed further on more abstract level. The best we have up to date on neuroscience is that area called Claustrum which has most neuron connections across the brain and probing that area with electrodes it is possible switch off consciousness. Brain experiments are good in reducing/disabling some parts of cognition or skills. I haven’t heard of repeatable experiments which would enhance cognition or skills and where the mechanism is fully understood, let alone replicating it. If the modus operandi is not understood, then it can not be replicated. Humans understand one part of neuron function and that part is replicated as AI. Reality glitches. There have been accidents where sudden cognition or skill enhancement have happened, called Acquired Savant Syndrome. For example Derek Amato  or Ben McMahon  So far I have not heard any sound neurological explanation. There are plethora of phenomenon which are considered as a glitch of a reality and ignored, because they do not fit “it must be all in the neurons” belief. Mind interface. It is known which parts of brain correspond to which cognition or skill. If some area of brain is damaged we observe distortion of certain cognitive or skill ability. Then it is assumed that that area performs such function. But it is just an assumption. We can only say that that particular area is somehow involved in the process. It is not understood where and how the mind comes in. When it is discovered how signal transmission works between mind and the brain, there will be AI 2.0. Belief 1. There is a belief that adding up more compute elements, data, memory, speed and connections would somehow yield sudden arise of consciousness and aliveness. It would yield only more power of signal/data processing. If its not there in first place, in most simple “AI” unit, it will not be there regardless of quantity. If one grain of sand is not intelligent, then a truckload of sand won’t be more intelligent. On the other hand there is Intelligence in the living cell and a lot of combined cells form an amazingly Intelligent biological being. Belief 2. The mistake being made is that we observe Intelligence being related to brain and we make conclusion that Intelligence is generated in brain. It would be similar to researching transistors in a radio believing to find vocalist's Intelligence there. Belief 3. AI is almighty and godlike. Well, AI is pretty limited to isolated tasks. There has been so much effort to create self-driving cars and yet we are not fully ready to accept them to everyday life, let alone more complicated exercises. Not because AI can out-perform humans, but the opposite. See below “At what AI is good at?”. Training feedback. AI requires some feedback about it’s performance. There are different ways for providing feedback. In a biological organism — what decides and gives feedback to it’s neural networks? Free will. Training feedback discussion leads to question of free will. AI does not have free will, it just performs a task it is trained to do. NI (Natural Intelligence) has free will. So it poses interesting question for AI research — what is the minimum number of atomic AI units and connections to display observable free will (not random or sophisticated deterministic output)? Of course it may lead to philosophical discussion what is free will and does NI have free will… Observation of thoughts. Human can observe own thoughts. How do you imagine AI having a “thought”? And which instance of the AI would be there to witness that thought? Projection of liveliness and fears. Our mind has tendency to project aliveness to all sorts of things like stuffed animals, toys, etc. But also it does project fears to a moving shadow, hearing squeaky sound while being alone in the house, etc. In case of AI we fail to see what it is, because we can hardly see past our projections. Just like it was with industrial revolution. In AI case we tend to project it is alive (can be conscious, self-conscious and start making decisions own) and has own agenda (and that is of course necessarily the evil agenda). How about creating different kind of image in our mind like “AI will do boring tasks while we have more creative time in our hands”? At what AI is good at? It can perform well “mind-numbing sprit-crushing” repetitive tasks, simple or complicated. Conclusion: the difference of human consciousness and AI intelligence is that AI intelligence mimics/exceeds well brain signal processing but is lacking capabilities of human mind and consciousness.

His grandmother told her two ways (a) By meditating on God.(b) Dying at the hand of God. He choosed option (b) for his salvation.He left everything in search of divine power and weapons. He got three arrows which have a capability to end war just in single hit. Before the Mahabharat war began, Lord Krishna asked all the warriors how many days they would take to finish Mahabharata war alone. Bhisma answered 20 days. Dronacharya replied 25 days. When Karna was asked, he said he would take 24 days. Arujun told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself.Krishna disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute.His grandmother had told him about Lord Krishna. With the help of his divine powers and intelligence he identified Lord Krishna.Krishna then explained to him that before a battle, the head of the bravest Kshatriya needs to be sacrificed, in order to worship/sanctify the battlefield. Krishna said that he considered Barbarik to be the bravest among Kshatriyas, and was hence asking for his head in charity. In fulfillment of his promise, and in compliance with the Krishna's command, Barbarika gave his head to him in charity.His dream of dying at the hand of God came true. Even when his head was separated from his body, he was talking.He was multi-talented. He have spritiual knowledge, warfare knowledge, divine power,knowledge of divine weapons. He attained Salvation at very young age.His reasoning capacities were totaly different from a common man. It was like a Robot.You can call him AI ROBOT of Mahabharat 😁 because he had a knowledge of almost everything. He worked with the help of his divine powers on that time.

Those features become the representation of the image our eyes just recorded. We immediately discard the large-size image, keeping only the features bundled together. If we need to recall image, we only need to be reminded of the features, and our available faculties will reconstruct the image in our head. The reconstruction image can never be 100% accurate compared to the image we got when the rays of light entered our eyes, but it's good enough for most of our purposes. This applies not only to visual data but also audio, sensual, taste, smell, even dreams and logical reasonings we do inside our head. Current cutting-edge AI does the same. Based on the configurations of its component algorithms, it chops, dices, and transform the input raw data into prominent features. Every new piece of raw data informs it on what those features should be and how to extract them. Once it's sufficiently trained, it can start attempting to reconstruct the raw data from some given features. Again, these reconstructions are approximations of the original data, but they're often useful enough for their intended purpose. This is how Deep Fakes, GPT-essay synthesis, or face recognition are done. Back to the OP question, yes and no. No, the AI does not save or keep the original raw data. But yes, that data now lives as representation features inside the logics of the AI. An AI could be very lightweight while having incorporated billions of pieces of training data.

Waiting in the wings might be a groundbreaking development: a machine that is aware of itself and its surroundings, and that could take in and process massive amounts of data in real time. It could be sent on dangerous missions, into space or combat. In addition to driving people around, it might be able to cook, clean, do laundry – and even keep humans company when other people aren’t nearby. A particularly advanced set of machines could replace humans at literally all jobs. That would save humanity from workaday drudgery, but it would also shake many societal foundations. A life of no work and only play may turn out to be a dystopia. Conscious machines would also raise troubling legal and ethical problems. Would a conscious machine be a “person” under law and be liable if its actions hurt someone, or if something goes wrong? To think of a more frightening scenario, might these machines rebel against humans and wish to eliminate us altogether? If yes, they represent the culmination of evolution. As a professor of electrical engineering and computer science who works in machine learning and quantum theory, I can say that researchers are divided on whether these sorts of hyperaware machines will ever exist. There’s also debate about whether machines could or should be called “conscious” in the way we think of humans, and even some animals, as conscious. Some of the questions have to do with technology; others have to do with what consciousness actually is. Is awareness enough? Most computer scientists think that consciousness is a characteristic that will emerge as technology develops. Some believe that consciousness involves accepting new information, storing and retrieving old information and cognitive processing of it all into perceptions and actions. If that’s right, then one day machines will indeed be the ultimate consciousness. They’ll be able to gather more information than a human, store more than many libraries, access vast databases in milliseconds and compute all of it into decisions more complex, and yet more logical, than any person ever could. On the other hand, there are physicists and philosophers who say there’s something more about human behavior that cannot be computed by a machine. Creativity, for example, and the sense of freedom people possess don’t appear to come from logic or calculations. Yet these are not the only views of what consciousness is, or whether machines could ever achieve it. Quantum views Another viewpoint on consciousness comes from quantum theory, which is the deepest theory of physics. According to the orthodox Copenhagen Interpretation, consciousness and the physical world are complementary aspects of the same reality. When a person observes, or experiments on, some aspect of the physical world, that person’s conscious interaction causes discernible change. Since it takes consciousness as a given and no attempt is made to derive it from physics, the Copenhagen Interpretation may be called the “big-C” view of consciousness, where it is a thing that exists by itself – although it requires brains to become real. This view was popular with the pioneers of quantum theory such as Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger. The interaction between consciousness and matter leads to paradoxes that remain unresolved after 80 years of debate. A well-known example of this is the paradox of Schrödinger’s cat, in which a cat is placed in a situation that results in it being equally likely to survive or die – and the act of observation itself is what makes the outcome certain. The opposing view is that consciousness emerges from biology, just as biology itself emerges from chemistry which, in turn, emerges from physics. We call this less expansive concept of consciousness “little-C.” It agrees with the neuroscientists’ view that the processes of the mind are identical to states and processes of the brain. It also agrees with a more recent interpretation of quantum theory motivated by an attempt to rid it of paradoxes, the Many Worlds Interpretation, in which observers are a part of the mathematics of physics. Philosophers of science believe that these modern quantum physics views of consciousness have parallels in ancient philosophy. Big-C is like the theory of mind in Vedanta – in which consciousness is the fundamental basis of reality, on par with the physical universe. Little-C, in contrast, is quite similar to Buddhism. Although the Buddha chose not to address the question of the nature of consciousness, his followers declared that mind and consciousness arise out of emptiness or nothingness. Big-C and scientific discovery Scientists are also exploring whether consciousness is always a computational process. Some scholars have argued that the creative moment is not at the end of a deliberate computation. For instance, dreams or visions are supposed to have inspired Elias Howe’s 1845 design of the modern sewing machine, and August Kekulé’s discovery of the structure of benzene in 1862. A dramatic piece of evidence in favor of big-C consciousness existing all on its own is the life of self-taught Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died in 1920 at the age of 32. His notebook, which was lost and forgotten for about 50 years and published only in 1988, contains several thousand formulas, without proof in different areas of mathematics, that were well ahead of their time. Furthermore, the methods by which he found the formulas remain elusive. He himself claimed that they were revealed to him by a goddess while he was asleep. The concept of big-C consciousness raises the questions of how it is related to matter, and how matter and mind mutually influence each other. Consciousness alone cannot make physical changes to the world, but perhaps it can change the probabilities in the evolution of quantum processes. The act of observation can freeze and even influence atoms’ movements, as Cornell physicists proved in 2015. This may very well be an explanation of how matter and mind interact. Mind and self-organizing systems It is possible that the phenomenon of consciousness requires a self-organizing system, like the brain’s physical structure. If so, then current machines will come up short. Scholars don’t know if adaptive self-organizing machines can be designed to be as sophisticated as the human brain; we lack a mathematical theory of computation for systems like that. Perhaps it’s true that only biological machines can be sufficiently creative and flexible. But then that suggests people should – or soon will – start working on engineering new biological structures that are, or could become, conscious Forget about today’s modest incremental advances in artificial intelligence, such as the increasing abilities of cars to drive themselves.
