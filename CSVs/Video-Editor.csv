Some Software manufacturers provide one. But remember that more importantly than the software is the final storytelling. You don’t need a degree to become a video editor. Any formal qualification does help of course, but I think experience with editing software will serve you better. To gain experience, download Adobe Premiere Pro (free trial for 30 days).

Look around at different video styles and effects to see how you can also try these in your edits. You can also start with the very basics with Windows Movie Maker or iMovie which are both free and pre-installed on your computer already (most likely). Hope this helps! Short answer, YES! Long answer: it starts with buying courses on video editing and consuming them, practicing constantly, to carve a niche for yourself. If a degree is required by any company, it's most-likely any degree, to show you have some tertiary education except in very rare cases. Your skills, as seen on your portfolio and/or showreel, is perhaps the degree you need. Yes, you can become a video editor without a degree, good luck!",2021-03-04T18:44:00.808Z,"How do I become a Video editor with no degree? ",Quora

An easy way to get started is to download a video you admire and make it shorter. Below is a 3-minute news report from Central China Television (CCTV) that was cut down to a minute and a half in (vain) hopes of reaching a wider audience. A great place for open-source soundtrack music is ccmixter. What’s very useful is that there are often several mixes based on the same germ, so you can do a theme-and-variation thing through the course of your video. You may find that you like motion graphics better than editing. Once you get the hang of it you can do a lot of interesting things. Or you may try animation. The Adobe Elements program is surprisingly powerful. Another thing you’ll have to do is learn to work with clients. I’ve had nothing but grief from mine. If they’re newbies, they’ll have no idea how much work is involved. Sometimes they’ll suddenly impose unrealistic schedules, or phone you up with 90-minute brainstorming rants (you’re supposed to take notes) and then three days later they’ll have a completely different vision. I no longer do collaborative work. Of course if you get a job in a production house, the professionals there will know what’s realistic and what’s not, and if you’re paid by the hour they won’t be constantly turning the script inside out on a whim and throwing your work away. @Matt Burwood , I totally, very vehemently disagree with you.

My strength is graphic design, but I've done enough of the other two to know what's involved.  By simple mathematics, learning one subject will be faster and easier than learning two. Web development is one subject. So is graphic design and so is video editing. Graphic design and video editing are not a single subject. But how easy these are to learn will depend on your aptitude and interest in the subjects. Personally, I love graphic design and so find it easier to learn than web development. But I'm still learning, 10 years later. From the perspective of getting enough knowledge to start charging for services, video editing is probably the least time consuming to learn. There are some great books on the subject as well as courses on Lynda. The basic skill set is cutting video clips, sequencing them, matching them to audio and adding transitions. This is an over simplification—but you could start video editing with iMovie in a few weeks. You could also learn a very small subset of graphic design rather rapidly. If you learn basic typesetting in InDesign, you could start charging for it with probably 3 months of intense learning. The same could be said for photo retouching and color correction, which is another subset of graphic design. Web Development is probably the most time consuming to get up and running with, although you could theoretically learn Squarespace or Wordpress in a three weeks and use those platforms to develop websites (Squarespace being the easier of these two to learn).   But with these limited skill sets you'll be competing with thousands of other ""designers"" and ""web developers"" and your only business strategy will be lowering price as that's all you'll have to offer. To become fully professional in any of these three fields will take quite a bit of learning—years, not months or weeks. My suggestion is do a course on each on Lynda (Online video tutorials & training.) You can find courses that are about 10 hours long on each. You'll find out from that which you have a stronger inclination toward. Then proceed to become a real professional in that one.

To simplify, here are four timescales: Micro-time (sub-second), Quick-time (seconds), Mid-time (minutes to hours), and Long-time (days to months). Micro-time (sub-second): You should choose a career here if you are great at making sub-second decisions. Athletes (soccer, tennis, etc.) are great. Think of the court awareness and the behind-the-back pass in basketball. Think of the alertness and super quick decisions a race car driver makes.

To simplify, here are four timescales: Micro-time (sub-second), Quick-time (seconds), Mid-time (minutes to hours), and Long-time (days to months). Micro-time (sub-second): You should choose a career here if you are great at making sub-second decisions. Athletes (soccer, tennis, etc.) are great. Think of the court awareness and the behind-the-back pass in basketball. Think of the alertness and super quick decisions a race car driver makes. Think of the professional videogame player that gets rated in APM -- ""actions per minute"". Quick-time (seconds): You should choose a career here if you are good at making decisions in seconds. Think of the improv comedians, people that are witty (like most people in the British Parliament), people who are good at comebacks, momentum traders, some trial lawyers. These are people who think extremely fast on their feet. Most job interviews are geared toward people mastering this level of time. Mid-time (minutes to hours): Choose a career here if you are good at making decisions in minutes to hours. Perfect for the CEOs and managers. People that need to make about a dozen decisions per day fit well here. Long-time (days to months): These are the big-thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant, and Jared Diamond. Many big thinkers talk very slowly. Some mumble and have lots of ummmms. But they write very coherently. Your career should be dependent on the timescale that you operate best in. We all have to make decisions in different timescales. But each person makes relatively better decisions at some timescales than others. Youth and aging in decision making time. Younger people certainly have an advantage in micro-time. Your synapses are firing faster. There are many studies that show actions-per-minute (APM) decrease dramatically as people age. Professional videogamers make 600 actions per minutes (10 per second)…and they skew very young. On stimulants and quick-time. Stimulants can greatly help with quick-time and they tend to dominate professions where quick-time is really important. Stimulant like coffee or Adderall can make people think faster on their feet. Think of stand-up act of Robin Williams while on cocaine. A lot of successful stock traders have a massive stimulant addiction. Trust your gut? If you are one of those people that has a great ""gut"", you likely should be in a career where quick-time decisions rule. How you should spend your time depends on what type of career timescale you are optimizing for. The longer the timescale you are optimizing for, the more you should spend reading (and gathering information). The shorter your timescale, the more you should spend doing (for muscle memory). Job interviews are overly optimized for quick-time decisions. If you are selecting candidates for a job, you need to understand what timescale the job fits into. Most job interviews are not designed to let people think about a problem for a few minutes and then respond. Awkward pauses are penalized. Most job interviews are optimized for quick-time. So if you are recruiting for a position that has a longer timescale (like for a global macro hedge fund), you almost certainly should send candidates the interview questions in advance and let them come up with the right answer).

Top tier staff editors working in film, trailers, TV, & commercials can make well into six figures a year.  As a counterpoint, my very first year in L.A. working (full-time) as an editor I made less than $20,000.  If you can handle the uncertainty, that's the nice thing about editing as a freelancer:  you can charge whatever you want (typically much more than you could in a staff position). When I work for television here in Switzerland, my pay is a standard 550$/day. When I work trough my own company for commercials, I charge 500$/day + 250 for the office and the machinery. Feature film editors earn only 500$/day but have a 3 month contract. As a employee, you normally make around 6000$/month… but you got benefits like vacation and insurance. But that’s only 2000$ more then a cashier at the supermarket. As a beginner you may have to work unpaid until you can get a reel together and make the necessary contacts.An experienced editor should be getting paid $50+ per hour, but with more and more competition coming from countries with a lower cost of living this is getting driven down.

He banned, among many other things, beards (hipsters beware), he banned dogs and dog ownership in the nation’s capital, banned right-hand drive imported automobiles (they cause more accidents, he decided), banned operas, ballets, and circuses, banned lip-syncing (Milli Vanilli and Mariah Carey, etc…), and banned the playing of any pre-recorded music at all whether on television or at live events. He banned smoking and all forms of chewing tobacco on Turkmen soil. He banned news reporters and anchors from wearing any sort of make-up at all on TV (saying that he was having a hard time distinguishing the male from the female reporters). He also abolished the Turkmen word for bread, and had it officially replaced with his mother’s name. He instituted a new alphabet based on the Latin alphabet, attempting to do away with the Cyrillic, and he renamed the months of the year (January became ‘Turkmenbashi’; after one of his own titles…another month got the same name as his book), the days of the week (Saturday became “Spirituality Day”), and he wrote his own book (every good dictatorial leader has written a manifesto or book of some sort). Which it became a requirement for you to know backwards and forwards — or at least to have read thoroughly — in order to obtain any government or civil employment whatsoever, and even to obtain a drivers’ license you had to prove you had read it. He eventually had this book sent into outer space on a rocket, with the national state-run news (there was of course no other kind of news) declaring that the book is now “conquering space”, after having conquered “the hearts of millions on Earth”. He even created a national holiday in honor of melons, as a sort of ‘harvest fest’, and had a massive ice arena built ~ decreeing the importance of Turkmenistan, a largely desert-like country, learning to ice skate. He closed all libraries and hospitals outside the nation’s capital and summarily dismissed thousands and thousands of health workers (saying simply: “If people are sick, they can come to the capital” — though it’s worth noting that under his reign Turkmenistan had the lowest life expectancy in Asia). The health care workers in the capital no longer took the Hippocratic Oath, but instead took an oath to him personally. He was also of course a kleptocrat with billions stashed in Europe, and a gross abuser of human rights.    —Also (and really, with choosing strange/eccentric/mad dictators of only the past 50 yrs it’s practically like shooting fish in a barrel), Francisco Macias Nguema, President of Equatorial Guinea from 1968- 1979 deserves a mention. He had the word ‘intellectual’ banned and, similar to Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge cadres, he had people who needed or used glasses imprisoned or killed outright. He believed Adolf Hitler to have been the would-be “savior of Africa”. He banned all fishing (people could use boats to escape Equatorial Guinea, he reasoned). He decreed that the population Africanize their names and all of the country’s place names, and be rid of the Hispanic-sounding names left over by the country’s colonial past. He banned workers from using any sorts of lubricants or oils in a factory or power plant, assuring them that the machines would run just fine without any such fluids (that they would run fine “on magic”). They actually didn’t. He banned private education entirely in 1975, although he nicknamed himself the “Grand Master of Education, Science, and Culture”. He was a habitual user of indigenous local hallucinogenic drugs or plants and mixtures (this could perhaps explain a few things). He once had hundreds of political opponents executed at once, by firing squad, by soldiers dressed as Santa Clauses while loudspeakers in the football stadium played the song “Those Were the Days” by singer Mary Hopkins, on a repeating loop. In perhaps a height of dictatorial personality-cult fervor he made the nation’s new national motto, “There is No other God than Macias Nguema”. Possibly nearly half the country’s population ultimately fled under his reign, escaping the country as refugees to neighboring nations. By the end of his rule almost the entire educated class, almost all skilled professionals and academics, had either been killed or forced into exile and he had killed approximately two-thirds of what would have (under perhaps more ‘normal’ circumstances) passed for the nation’s parliament. In ‘79 he was overthrown by forces loyal to one of his nephews, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (who is still in charge today, since ‘79, and is another repressive, dictatorial, hopelessly corrupt oil-rich kleptocrat and personality-cultist; though perhaps not quite as outwardly insane as his late uncle). Macias Nguema was executed, after a military-style tribunal, by a hired Moroccan Army firing squad.  Those were the days… punctuated by rifle fire. Would you believe this is the President of a country getting out of his car…that he drives to work everyday.  Yes, that is an ordinary VW beetle. No gimmicks. He drives (or rather drove) this everyday.  This is his house. No, not a farm that he visited once and got a photo op. This is his actual house. This is Jose Mujica, the 40th President of Uruguay who served between 2010 and 2015.

Yes, that is an ordinary VW beetle. No gimmicks. He drives (or rather drove) this everyday.  This is his house. No, not a farm that he visited once and got a photo op. This is his actual house. This is Jose Mujica, the 40th President of Uruguay who served between 2010 and 2015. Jose Mujica was often described in the media as the ‘the world’s humblest head of state’ due to his austere lifestyle. Born in 1935 in Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital city, Mujica’s life was soon turned upside down after his father died in 1940. His father was a poor farmer who had prior to his death gone bankrupt and his death left the family destitute. During his teenage years, he became active in the National party and participated in the Uruguayan guerilla movements of the 1960’s. In March 1970, he suffered several bullet-shot wounds when he was booked for resisting arrest at a Montevideo bar but he survived. After a cat and mouse game with the authorities Mujica was captured in 1972 and was imprisoned for over a decade until democracy was restored in Uruguay in 1985. Soon after, he would help create the Movement of Popular Participation party. Instead of a meteoric rise, he was steadily elected to higher offices beginning in 1994 with his election as deputy. In 2010, he was elected as the President of Uruguay. Now, most of us would be familiar with images of processions like these for world leaders.  That is Narendra Modi’s security team  Abu Dhabi’s Palace of the Nation  A cavalcade of black SUVs that escort the US president on any trip. Mujica though decided to forego all the opulence and grandeur of leadership and declined to live in the presidential palace. Instead he continued to live with his wife on their farm on the outskirts of Montevideo where they cultivate Chrysanthemums for sale (yes, he continued selling flowers, while he was President - mostly because he donated 90% of his Presidential salary to various social causes and local entrepreneurs). Mujica’s simple VW beetle became an icon in Uruguay and among world leaders to the extent that he received an offer of $1 million for the car - which he subsequently declined. So, why is Jose Mujica the strangest world leader in the last five decades? Other than his austere lifestyle, despite his office, Mujica has further the cause of minorities and pushed for the acceptance of LGBTQ in Uruguay. During his reign, the economy in Uruguay grew steadily and social programs were extended to levels rarely seen among South American nations. There were no corruption scandals, sex scandals etc. and upon completing his term as President in 2015 and although he was wildly popular in Uruguay, he did not seek re-election and in 2018 it was revealed that Mujica had even declined to take his pension. How many world leaders can you say that about? ”From Xi Jinping to Nancy Pelosi, These Leaders Shaped the World”  Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India  For decades after the British departed the Indian subcontinent, its history was one of painful cleavings. The 1947 Partition is a bland label for a division that produced two countries, 15 million refugees and at least a million deaths.

The 1947 Partition is a bland label for a division that produced two countries, 15 million refugees and at least a million deaths. When Pakistan, founded as a Muslim homeland opposite a secular India, itself split in two, the war that created Bangladesh in 1971 undid the assumption that a common faith alone could bind a nation. But in 2019, Narendra Modi began his second term in office having revived the premise in India. In May, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a months long election in a landslide that established Modi as the most powerful Prime Minister in more than a generation. But as Modi has consolidated power, India’s Muslims who make up 14% of the country’s population are questioning whether they count as Indian anymore. The BJP exalts Hindu nationalism, the identity politics of a religious majority that has been emergent for decades but for which Modi’s unprecedented majority marks a historical high watermark. When the Dalia Lama spoke with TIME in the Himalayan foothills where he lives in exile from Tibet, he repeatedly praised India’s tradition of multifaith harmony. The country’s 1.3 billion people include not only Hindus and Muslims, but also Christians, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. But Modi has abandoned that tradition, becoming instead a hero to Hindu extremists. In August, the Prime Minister revoked the constitutional autonomy of Kashmir, India’s only Muslim majority state, imposing a curfew and imprisoning political leaders. His government is pushing through new measures that could make it easier to imprison and deport Muslims who cannot prove their Indian citizenship, even if they have lived in the country for generations. Abroad, however, Modi retains the image etched early in his first term, of a populist economic reformer toting a yoga mat. In September a crowd of some 50,000 attended a “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston, with President Trump in the front row. But India’s renown as the world’s largest, most vibrant democracy is being tested by Modi’s divisive politics. Now, with an enormous mandate, he can govern almost as he pleases. - Billy Perrigo Donald Trump, President of the United States  In his third year as President, Donald J. Trump physically walked into North Korea. He declared a national emergency for the U.S. border with Mexico. He recognized the disputed Golan Heights as a sovereign part of Israel. For any previous residents of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, one of these developments unprecedented and historic might have defined their presidency. For the 45th, they amounted to bullet points. As America’s least orthodox Chief Executive rounds the corner into an election year, he is polishing his list of achievements. Trump has used the power of his office to roll back regulations, drive through a corporate tax cut and boost military spending. He takes credit for supercharging an economy that’s driven unemployment to record lows. He has also continued an uncharacteristically disciplined effort to reshape America’s federal courts, using Republican control of the Senate to appoint conservative judges who will define the laws of the land for a generation. And yet the Trump presidency may well pivot on his forays into a world that typically interests him the way a shop window does—in passing and for his reflection in it. The year began, after all, in suspense over special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s actions to help Trump’s 2016 campaign. The dense final report was, in its detail, damning: Mueller presented at least 10 times the President may have attempted to obstruct the probe, a criminal offense. But Trump claimed “complete exoneration” on the marquee allegation, that he had sought assistance from a foreign power on his effort to win election. And then, the day after Mueller testified on Capitol Hill, Trump telephoned the leader of another foreign country, Ukraine, and sought assistance on his effort to win re-election by investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son. Thus did the year draw to a close with the U.S. House of Representatives preparing articles of impeachment that, even if voted down in the Senate, will define Trump in history. The question is: Will that matter in the realms the incumbent values most? There is still no person whom taxi drivers, news anchors, hairstylists, foreign leaders and voters talk about more. And for Trump, that may be enough. - Brian Bennett Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives  The temperature in Washington changed on Jan. 3 when Nancy Pelosi picked up the gavel and became Speaker of the House for a second time. President Donald Trump has yet to recover. For two years, Trump had benefited from a subservient Republican Congress. Pelosi quickly made clear that divided government would be a different story. Taking the reins in the midst of the longest government shutdown in history, she refused to cave to Trump’s demand for a border wall, waiting him out and cancelling the State of the Union address until he surrendered. Over the ensuing months, she served as the unorthodox President’s foil, using her mastery of the powers of the Legislative Branch to hold Trump in check. For much of the year, Pelosi battled the left nearly as much as the right, frustrating progressive activists and far-left members by steering her party toward the center. Even as she’s overseen an unprecedented slate of investigations into the Executive Branch, she’s tried to find ways to work with Trump where possible. At the White House’s request, Pelosi passed a $4.6 billion border bill with funding for the immigration detention centers the left considers concentration camps, and later negotiated a two year budget agreement that increases military funding. She’s kept trying to make deals with Trump on prescription drug pricing and infrastructure, even as the President has repeatedly walked away from the table. Of the more than 300 bills the House has passed that sit on the Senate’s doorstep, more than 275 are bipartisan. On Dec. 10, Pelosi announced the House's articles of impeachment of Trump. An hour later, she unveiled an agreement on the President’s plan to update the North American Free Trade Agreement. The split screen epitomized her yearlong high wire act. Pelosi resisted Democrats’ calls for impeachment until the Ukraine scandal forced her hand. As the year ends, the results oriented leader finds herself in just the situation she’d tried to avoid: a partisan impeachment of a President unlikely to be chastened by it. The founders’ vision for checks and balances has forced her into a historic confrontation, with unforeseeable consequences. “If we had not done this,” she tells TIME, “just think of how low our democracy would have sunk.” - iMolly Ball Xi Jinping, President of China  On Oct. 1, a parade of tanks, troops and nuclear missiles rolled through Beijing to mark 70 years since the founding of the People’s Republic. Standing before the Forbidden City, abode of emperors, He vowed, “No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation forging ahead.” Quite a few have tried this year. Nearly 2 million took to the streets to demand democratic reform in semiautonomous Hong Kong, where anti-Beijing candidates won a landslide in district elections. The trade war with the U.S. squeezed China’s growth to a three-decade low. The detention of over a million Muslims in the province of Xinjiang prompted condemnation by the U.N. None have dented Xi’s resolve. Through propaganda and censorship, the Communist Party he leads has helped Xi turn external pressure into internal strength. His ”China Dream” of returning his nation to “center stage” is battered but undiminished. Still, there’s no denying that the tenor of China’s foreign relations changed in 2019. This was the year Xi went from strongman to bogeyman. In March, the E.U. branded China a “systemic rival.” In July, FBI Director Christopher Wray called the threat to society posed by China “diverse and wide and vexing.” Washington has demonized Chinese telecom firm Huawei and passed legislation in support of Hong Kong’s protesters. A bill still under consideration would sanction Chinese officials for “barbaric” human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where 1 million Muslims have been detained.",2021-03-04T18:55:29.705Z,"Who has been the strangest world leader of the last five decades?

DaVinci Resolve 12 is a fully featured, industry standard color grading application with an editing application built in. The editor is a bit weird at first, but I like it overall. If you had to use only one editor, which one would it be? Adobe Premiere without a doubt. It's a great program with a lot of plugins available to do just about anything. Now, if you meant what free program would I use, it would be Resolve. Davinci Resolve is a great program and I like it a lot. It doesn't have quite everything I need compared to Premiere, and I'm not as familiar with the interface, but overall it's by far my favorite free option.

Nevertheless, if it’s the latter — a general video editor with some skills; maybe make some youtube videos, get some views, monetize, etc…. Choose your application of choice, likely either Final Cut Pro X or Adobe Premiere.Take some courses on LinkedIn Learning or on another platform (this is what I did). You'd be surprised how much you can learn in a week or two in terms of how to navigate your application of choice with some skill, how to use it’s basic, and within a few weeks, advanced features.Get your hands on some raw video, whether it’s something you shot or something someone else shot.In my case, I worked for a company that wanted to make videos but had zero experience, so I did step 2, then we bought some equipment and filmed some video (also had good separate audio source); green screen and the sort. I was lucky enough to learn on the job with plenty of raw video to work with.If you put your mind and dedication to it, with some decent raw video, you can put together some pretty cool stuff, what the average person would consider to be professional, in just a few weeks.Side-note - there’s no shame in using templates! There are some great ones out there for cheap or free that will give your material a professional touch without you needing to put in tons of effort. And, you can reverse-engineer it to figure out how to make that cool stuff moving forward..Really it’s as easy as that. I have a ton of stuff I’ve done over the years now; a lot of it technically is the property of companies that I’ve worked for — full on videos, informational, promotional videos, animations, etc. I’m hesitant to post here. But I will post two example videos I made from some images and videos I took while on two different vacations. They’re both based off templates and it took me way longer to take the pics and videos than it did to make the final compositions… Really quick GoPro Video of my Dog, a little bonus…  A Trip to Croatia…  Estes National Park..  Ya, these aren’t “real” videos… fine, here’s a real one I did about a year ago.. I think this one came out pretty good (even though I was a little rusty).  Long story short — you can become a pretty competent editor, writer, videographer, director, etc. in a short period of time with a little bit of information from the internet and some trial and error.

Find a director or a writer and volunteer for their projects. Tell them you want to be an editor and ask them to give you a chance.   The entire goal of editing is to help footage accumulate meaning (in accordance with a script, if there is one). Work on that. Be honest about your progress. Get excited when a cut comes together.  Get really good and volunteer for bigger projects. Independent short films are a great way to hone your technique on a larger scale. Do your best to know when you are good enough to work professionally. Look for commercial work. Start getting paid.  I know a handful of professional video editors. Only one of them went to film school (for directing). Film school is outdated. You have the Internet, inexpensive technology, and as much time as you need. If you want it, make it happen. It depends on what you’re trying to do, although I think I can safely say that it is a very competitive industry.

Since we live in an age where video is practically everywhere and there are hundreds of TV shows and movies going all the time, there are obviously more opportunities to find work. But yes, it’s competitive.

Just to say that I totally agree with the previous answers mentioning most of these as the highest-paid freelancing jobs: Web DevelopersCopywriters or Content Writersvarious types of Online Marketers (social media, email, influencer, content marketing, SEO experts etc.)Graphic DesignersOnline Store AdministratorsThere are numerous options, but the final decision is entirely up to you, of course. :)  However, there’s a catch here! To earn more than an average online worker on these positions, you need to take a wise preliminary step and choose a thriving industry to enter and apply the skills you’ve honed. This determines the direction you’ll take in your future career and can significantly influence your pay rate.  It greatly matters where, i.e. for which company/industry you work as a Web Dev, a Copywriter or any other job role mentioned above. My friendly advice is to get engaged in the eCommerce industry (in case you haven’t already, or you’re hesitating). Why? Because it is constantly growing at an impressive speed and the demands for trained staff to join established eCommerce companies are substantial. Take a peek at some stats... According to Global Ecommerce: Statistics and International Growth Trends [Infographic], global retail ecommerce sales will reach $4.5 Trillion by 2021.  Cumulative data from Statista anticipates a 246.15% increase in worldwide ecommerce sales, from $1.3 trillion in 2014 to $4.5 trillion in 2021. That’s a nearly threefold lift in online revenue. Numbers of that scale are often hard to wrap our heads around. They’re at once both invigorating … and mind-boggling, as noticed in the previous Shopify Plus insights. Obviously, it is a fantastic opportunity for aspiring online workers right now. So, why wouldn’t you consider turning your hand to it?  Wondering how much you can earn working in eCommerce? Your pay rate will depend on various factors such as: your experience,skill set,proactiveness,willingness to learn and grow with the industry, as well asyour location.You may find all the criteria except the last one reasonable. Why does your salary depend on where you live when the work is remote? Well, it is NOT a matter of people being worth different amounts worldwide, but it’s rather a matter of the local economy, i.e. influenced by differences in the cost of living in different countries. Broadly speaking, if you perfect some highly sought-after eCommerce skills, you can earn $93,600 - $145,600 per year depending on your position and expertise. As part of our ongoing research programme at eCommerce University, we've collated an extensive range of data to give people an in-depth guide to understanding the job roles and salaries within the eCommerce industry and options for working from home. Perhaps this can help you get a bit better overall picture and discover more about the eCommerce industry. (Disclaimer: I’m the founder of eCommerce University, but I’ve included this salary guide in the answer to help you find out more details about alternative work from home job opportunities and the highest paid skills to learn closely related to them.) Now, if this is within your scope of interest and you’d like to give it a try, at least you know where you can start. Whatever you choose, I wish you best of luck!

Do they do YouTube video editing? Gaming? Vlogs? Wedding videos? Corporate? Animation? Find a company that specialises in what you need. For YouTube, that’d be a company like Now Creatives, but for other areas, you’ll want to find a specialist. To avoid wasting money, I’d highly suggest outsourcing overseas that has a remote team.

If you want to do 2D animation, you’ll have some different choices, with a surprising overlap. 3D animation breaks down into four categories. Feature animation - if you want to do feature animation, or work on 3d animated TV shows, you’re probably going to want to learn Maya.TV Commercials - a surprising number of TV commercials are produced with Lightwave 3D, due to its broad capability to handle most tasks out of the box without extra plugins. Extensibility is harder, though, because its scripting language support was an afterthought, rather than being a core feature the way it was with Maya. That’s why Maya dominates the motion picture industry, and Lightwave tends to dominate TV effects.Game animation - if you want to animate for computer games, you’ll likely be working in 3DMax. Its workflow is very different from Maya’s, though, and it doesn’t make geometry files so much as recipes to recreate the geometry.Architectural and industrial - architectural previsualization tends to use 3DMax, again due to the recipe approach to building objects.2D animation is far more rare, and it all tends to be done on a handful of software specialized for the purpose, such as ToonBoom Harmoney, Moho Studio, or OpenToonz. Oh, and no, you can’t learn animation using Krita or Photoshop. While they can do animation, they’re the absolute dead last choice for learning the craft, and I’m astonished that anybody would suggest it. And now for that surprising overlap: Blender is a completely free package that can do both 2d and 3d animation, and is surging in popularity. They’ve just released version 2.8, which gets around a lot of the weird workflow issues that have made it so hard to learn in the past compared to other packages like Maya or Lightwave - and compared to the staggering costs for annual licenses for the commercial animation packages, it’s a pretty attractive choice. The Art of Animation Question (The One You Didn’t Ask) If you are just starting out with animation, what you should be studying is animation, not software. If you have an idea of what branch of animation you want to study, the above is a basic guideline as to what software you might want to look at as a first effort. I will say that most of the biggest animation houses use Maya, but there is one more option I haven't talked about, and once again, it's Blender. A few major animation studios are now making the switch because of the prohibitive license fees for Maya. Now let’s talk about animation itself. If you’re learning the art of animation, looking at which software to learn is probably not your best starting point. Learning to draw, however, is. I strongly strongly urge you not only to take some life drawing classes and get really good at it, you should probably check out the following books: The Animator’s Survival Kit, by Richard Williams - this is written by the guy who designed the characters Roger and Jessica Rabbit for Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and was the animation director for the film. It’s considered to be the bible for working animators, and if you can afford only one book, get this one. Timing for Animation, by Harold Whittaker & John Halas - this book focuses on timing, as the title suggests. Getting things to move with weight, balance and rhythm are the focus of this book, and it too is considered one of the “must have” books on any animator’s bookshelf. Drawn to Life, Volume 1 / Drawn to Life, Volume 2, by Walt Stanchfield - these are compilations of 20 years of master class notes as taught to Disney animators by Walt Stanchfield. You can’t get closer to the source of all true knowledge of animation than these two volumes, and every single problem you’ll ever face as an animator can be found in the pages of these books. You might notice that I’m not including The Illusion of Life, by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in my recommendations. The reason for this is that while the book does contain some useful information, a lot of it is actually historical information about various Disney animated productions. It’s expensive, and hard to get (it’s been out of print for years), and frankly, while every animator who burns with a passion for the art is likely to have a copy of it, it’s far less useful in practical terms than the other four books above. Learning the Craft If you really want to learn animation, you’ll need the support of a bunch of people all trying to learn along with you. You’ll learn more from them than any expensive courses at first. Supplement what you can learn from the forums at The 11 Second Club: The Monthly Character Animation Competition with what you get from the books, and draw, draw, draw. Take life drawing classes, take design classes, buy yourself a sketchbook and draw everything you see, all the time. If you’re persistant and you dive into it, you’ll get there. Good luck, and may sunshine light your way. If video isn’t already an important part of your content marketing strategy, odds are it’s about to be.

Web content is taking a turn toward video whether SEOs and content marketers like it or not. Nearly 50% of marketers are adding YouTube and Facebook channels for video distribution in the next year; one third of online activity is spent watching video; and video itself is projected to account for more than 80% of all internet traffic by 2019. 80%! For those looking to continue to grow their organic traffic, that means one thing: Not an expert? Don’t have a video studio, or a bona fide video specialist to shoot and cut your features? That’s alright! The goal of today’s blog is to show you that with the right video editing software, you too can churn out sleek, professional video content—regardless of experience—and keep your content strategy ahead of the curve. Let’s dive in! Here are our top 10 best pieces of video editing software for beginners—from cheapest (i.e. free!) to most expensive. 1. Apple iMovie Ok—so to those of you working with PCs, this one won’t really apply; but we’d remiss to leave it off the list. If you’re looking for simplicity and elegance, it doesn’t get much better than Apple iMovie. iMovie’s ten high-fidelity filters are some of the classiest in the video editing game; and if you’re shooting on your iPhone, or have been editing a project on your iPad, you can use AirDrop to wirelessly and seamlessly transfer your project over to your Mac. One of iMovie’s most coveted features is its green-screen, or “chroma-key” tool, which allows you to place your characters in exotic locations—Hawaii, say—at a moment’s notice. Want to overlay the scene with “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”? iMovie ties directly in with iTunes and GarageBand, so you can easily implement custom tracks and sounds. When your movie’s finally ready to ship, release it into the wild using iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any other of iMovie’s succinctly connected platforms. Standout Features: Seamless Apple product integration; green-screen; audio and social platform integration Pricing: Free with the purchase of a Mac 2. Lumen5 We’ll put this more in the category of a video editing “tool” than video editing software, but for social media marketers who want to create fun, flashy social promos in the blink of an eye, Lumen5 is a no brainer. Here’s a short little feature we made for a recent blog post, 14 Fun & Festive Holiday Marketing Ideas for 2017: Lumen5 markets itself as a tool that turns blog posts into social promos. While the process isn’t perfect, and you’ll likely have to do some tinkering to get your blog content looking just the way you want it, the rest of the video creation process is a cinch. Merely refine some copy that teases your blog post; drag and drop some gifs, screengrabs, or video clips; add some music; and your engaging social video will be ripe for Facebook and Twitter. Standout Features: Blog-to-social-promo creation; drag-and-drop interface Pricing: Create as many 480p videos as you want with the free version; or, for $50 per month, upgrade to 1080p HD. 3. Nero Video One of the cheaper options around ($49.99), Nero Video holds its own on this list—it comes well-stocked with a lot of the tricks and effects you’ll find among other products vying for video editing supremacy, and as far as software for beginners, you can certainly do worse. If you’re going to spend money on video editing software, however, you might want to steer clear. Nero just doesn’t have the speed and functionality of some of the other products listed here, and if it’s value proposition is its price, $50 is still not all that cheap. Standout Features: Low pricing Pricing: One-time payment of $49.99 4. Corel VideoStudio Corel VideoStudio has all the characteristics of the other top-of-the-line products on this list, including 360-degree VR and 4k support, but it also has the distinction of being the first piece of consumer video editing software to offer motion tracking—which, if you’re not already familiar, is a feature that allows you to track specific objects throughout your cut (if you wanted, say, to point an arrow at one of your characters, blur out his face, or bestow him with a funny hat). Most of the products on this list come equipped with motion tracking, but VideoStudio still boasts one of the best motion tracking systems around. One of the knocks on VideoStudio is its speed, which lags notably behind some of the faster systems on this list, like CyberLink PowerDirector and Pinnacle Studio. Still: for a one-time payment of $51.99? You can do much worse. Standout Features: Motion tracking Pricing: One-time payment of $51.99 5. Filmora from Wondershare When it comes to free video editing software, Filmora is about as multi-faceted as they come. Filmora is Wondershare’s standard, simple, high-quality video editing offering; but Wondershare also offers FilmoraGo (for mobile editing) and Filmora Scrn (for screen recording and editing). The design is intuitive and easy to use, and comes replete with filters, overlays, motion elements, transitions, and a small selection of royalty-free music. Here are a few more of the “basics” Filmora offers: 4k and gif support are boilerplate features for most video editing products today, but one thing Filmora does particularly well is titles. Title tools are trending in video software, and while Filmora’s doesn’t have the functionality of say, an Apple Final Cut Pro X, which can superimpose 3D titles over your videos and rotate them on three axes, it nonetheless has some snazzy titling features for the money you’re spending: Another Filmora feature beginners to video editing will find attractive is “Easy Mode,” which allows you to create fun, polished edits by merely dragging and dropping clips, choosing a theme, and selecting music. Standout features: Title tool; mobile and screen editing; “Easy Mode” Pricing: Starts at $59.99 for a lifetime license; or, $39.99 for a year. 6. CyberLink PowerDirector So—we stretched the meaning of “software” a bit earlier; now, we’re going to stretch the meaning of “beginner.” We included CyberLink PowerDirector on this list because its interface is, at the end of the day, pretty straightforward. Head to the product page, run through the tutorials, and you’ll be alright. There is within the interface, however, an embarrassment of options and effects. If you’re not willing to invest the time in learning all of them, it can get a bit overwhelming. Don’t be scared of CyberLink’s extra features; just be wary of your commitment level! In terms of rendering, PowerDirector is regarded as one of the fastest video editing systems around. It also operates consistently in the sphere of the innovative and cutting edge. PowerDirector led the charge in the switch to 4k, and today, it’s one of the first systems to support 360-degree virtual reality footage. Price: you get what you pay for! $79.99 gets you unlimited access to one of the most capable pieces of video editing software around. Standout Features: Lightning-fast rendering; comprehensive suite of effects Pricing: One-time payment of $79.99 7. Adobe Premiere Elements We include Premiere Elements on the list mostly because it’s been an industry leader in the video editing game for some time. And $79.99 is not egregious, but we’re here to say that at that price, you’re mostly paying for the name. In the time since Premiere Elements’ inception, too many other products have surpassed it in speed and capability for us to place it among the cream of the crop. That’s to take nothing away from Premiere Elements’ usability, though—specifically for beginners. The Guided Edits feature makes Adobe Premiere a particularly attractive option for beginners, as it allows them to take on both quick edits and advanced projects with substantial assistance from the software. If you’re not entirely sure what you’re doing, don’t sleep on Guided Edits! So while Premiere Elements lags behind the competition in terms of speed, 3D editing, multi-cam, and some other advanced features, it’s still a great choice for the beginner looking for a comprehensive suite of effects, and some guidance on how to implement them. Standout Features: Guided Edits; simple interface Pricing: One-time payment of $79.99 8. Pinnacle Studio At the higher end of the Corel product line is Pinnacle Studio—which, at $129.95 (the amount you’ll need to pay to edit 360-degree and 4k content with the “Ultimate” version), costs more than twice as much as VideoStudio. What do you get for the extra money? Well, not only does Pinnacle come readily equipped with all the features you’d expect from an upper-echelon product—motion tracking, 360-degree VR support, 4k support, multi-cam, etc.—but you’d be hard-pressed to find a faster product on the market in terms of rendering. For all of its features, Pinnacle’s interface is still as user-friendly and intuitive as anything on this list. Thus, is you have the need for speed, and you don’t mind shelling out a few extra bucks for it, Pinnacle might be the product for you. Standout Features: Top-of-the-line rendering speeds; full range of features and support Pricing: One-time payment of $129.95 9. Adobe Premiere Pro With a virtually unmatched suite of features, 360 VR and 4k support, and a newly implemented ability to store, organize, and share assets online with a team, Adobe Premiere Pro is perhaps the most complete piece of video editing software around. Here’s a recent video promo for our free AdWords account structure guide we cut using Premiere Pro: One of the more dazzling of Premiere Pro’s tools is the Lumetri Color tool, which offers color adjustment and manipulation on par with that of a Photoshop. The multi-cam feature is also a winner—whereas most systems allow you to work with a limited number of camera angles, Premiere Pro’s latest iteration allows for an unlimited amount. Throw in a wealth of titling options, readily connected ancillary apps (like Photoshop and After Effects), and a flexible, easy-to-use interface, and Premiere Pro is a no brainer. Standout Features: Multi-cam and coloring options; title tool; easy integration with Adobe Products; straightforward interface Pricing: $19.99/month 10. Apple Final Cut Pro X For the most advanced, least fiscally prudent of beginners, there’s Apple Final Cut Pro X. $299.99 might be a little steep for a product you may well have a difficult time understanding; but for those among you who enjoy a challenge, and who aspire to some level of professionalism in video editing, why not go for it? Apple has made the transition from iMovie to Final Cut Pro more painless than ever—so if you’re the kind of guy or gal who enjoys him/herself an Apple product, and has worked with iMovie to the point of mastery, it might be time to splurge on Final Cut Pro. The power is still daunting; the interface, significantly less so. Standout Features: Magnetic Timeline; Touch Bar support Pricing: One-time payment of $299.99 Some Final Thoughts Are you a content or social media marketer looking to get in the video editing game for the sake of keeping up with the growing video trend? Don’t stress! Any of the above products would make a fine choice for a beginner.

My ultimate goal is to give back and help others achieve their goals. To do so, I would need to experience things myself, so I could be in a better place to offer advice and guidance. Coming into this post, I honestly don’t know how many job responsibilities (hustles) I performed over the past year. Let’s count them up: Statistician/ProgrammerBloggerStatistical ConsultantLandlordSmall Business OwnerCertified Food ManagerSocial Media MarketerAccountantCustomer Service RepresentativeWeb DesignerWarehouse WorkerJob #1: Statistician/Programmer (Day Job)  Each week, I head to the office for 40 hours a week of my day job. It’s not glamorous, but it’s a great job at a great company. I love building things and always have. I used to play with Legos all day when I was a kid. Now, it’s building programs and statistical models at work on a daily basis. I really enjoy my job, and have no plans of leaving in the near future. My boss is great, and I’m learning a lot about the financial industry, but also exploring many new technologies in the programming world. Automation and programming is incredibly powerful – I’m excited to continue to learn about this in the future. Job #2: Blogger The Mastermind Within was created at the very end of 2016 on a cold winter day. I love blogging – I love writing, connecting with other bloggers, sharing my thoughts, and helping others. I spend 10-20 hours each week writing, marketing, tweaking things on my site, and answering emails from readers. My main motivation is to share with you what I’m learning in my life, so you can go out and become more successful. If you ever have any questions for me, feel free to reach out via my contact form. Job #3: Statistical Consultant Last February, I was approached by a friend to help him and his bio-statistical consulting business out. For the most part, it is relatively straightforward statistics: comparing the distributions of different populations and drawing conclusions through standard parametric and non-parametric tests. I enjoy it because it pays well, I can grow my statistical skills, but also, I’m now a published author in the field of bio-statistics. Pretty cool, right? Job #4: Landlord For the first 10 months of 2017, I had 2 roommates who were paying me rent. I needed to ensure that the sidewalks were shoveled, the utilities paid on time, and any things needing to be fixed were fixed in an appropriate time frame. Before 2015, I’d never owned a house or been a landlord. It was a great learning experience for the past 2.5 years, as I got an experience as a landlord through my house hacking. I’m looking forward to buying a rental property in the coming years to become a landlord once again. Job #5: Small Business Owner In May, I started a business with a business partner which would focus on making money two different ways. The first, a kombucha tea subscription kit where our company sends out flavoring and starter kits to our customers each month. The second income stream is dropshipping t-shirts through Shopify and print on demand. I’ve learned a ton about business through creating this. There is so much that goes into starting a business. It’s not enough just to have an idea. Then there’s the paperwork, opening various accounts, coming up with more ideas, implementing a plan, executing, staying consistent. I’m going to write a post on my recommended path for starting a business in the future, but just know, there’s so much to do and a lot to consider. Job #6: Certified Food Safety Manager To package dried fruits, sugar, and tea, I needed to get in to a commercial kitchen. To get in to a commercial kitchen, I needed to become a Certified Food Safety Manager. For $85 and 20 hours of my time, I was able to get certified and now can create safety plans for food handling. After never working in a kitchen before, this was quite an interesting learning experience. The test wasn’t too difficult, and it was cheap – if you are interested in the food industry, this is probably a solid resume booster. Here’s my full post on it from last summer: Becoming a Food Safety Manager. Job #7: Social Media Marketer Over the past 12 months, I’ve learned a ton about marketing. As a math major, I have no background in marketing. Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, Quora, oh my! I don’t really like doing social media, but it’s an essential task in today’s business environment. I’m really excited to keep getting in to Pinterest and Quora in 2018 – both of these platforms are fantastic and have a huge reach. Job #8: Accountant  In college, I was a bookkeeper and spent 3 years doing cash flow analysis, accounts receivable, bank reconciliations, and your standard bookkeeping. All of this has paid off since I’m the chief accountant for my self, but also my business. It’s not too complicated, but there’s definitely a lot to learn. I’m still learning more about taxes and financial statements. These skills will pay off no matter what I do in the future. Job #9: Customer Service Representative Over the holiday season, I got a lot of emails and messages from customers. Where’s my shirt?!!? Why does my package only have this and not that? Your site is misleading, I want my money back! While frustrating, it’s a necessary part of business and very valuable feedback for what to change and edit on the sites. Job #10: Web Designer Before 2017, I didn’t know too much about web design. I had a website back in 2015, but it looked unprofessional. No images, poor color scheme, etc. Now, I’ve learned a lot about web design, to the point where my boss is trusting me to build out web applications for the team and department! Over the past 12 months, I’ve taken most of the Code Academy courses (which I’d highly recommend), learned about user experience, as well as the consequences of picking an appropriate color scheme for your business. This site has been tweaked and re-tweaked many times, and I still have ideas to improve the user experience. I re-did the business website 3-5 times in October/November in an effort to prepare for Christmas, and that pushed me to a higher level. There’s so much to learn for design – I’m at the very tip of the iceberg – and I love it! Job #11: Warehouse Worker At the end of each month, it’s time to pack up the subscription kits and send them off to our customers. Spending a 10 hours at the end of the month is a tough task, and managing what does in which kit is always fun. Eventually, this could be outsourced, but for now, it’s all on me! The Power of Focus I think I put too much on my plate in 2017, but it was a great learning experience. My recommendation for you is to look to expand your knowledge, but do it in a way which complements your passion and your daily job. For example, my side hustle of statistical consulting complements my day job in a very direct way. Flipping the switch from day job to side hustle doesn’t require too much on my part. My business does not, so I struggled for at least 2-3 months getting in to that mindset where my brain was comfortable thinking in that way. Learning, Applying, and Providing Value to Increase Your Income  I love writing because I love how I’m able to inspire others to do more with their lives through my actions. I could be the most successful person in the world, but unless I share my experiences with you, none of my successes will matter. For you, focusing on learning something new, applying it, and providing value to others will help you increase your value to others, which in the future, will allow you to increase your income. I want to learn all of these different things so I can have a more complete world view, and have experience in many different areas. For me, my main strengths are programming, mathematics and statistics, and basic finance and accounting. Some of the areas I’m improving in are writing, business, marketing, and project management. I definitely have some weaknesses, but if I keep learning, applying, and providing value to others, I know I’ll be able to fill in those gaps. Take some time out of your day and spend it on yourself.

Robotics workshop - I learnt about robotics and started to build a few robots using Arduino board from a training startup. With some modifications, I was able to make it cheaper and easier to build robots and we sold those workshops for students in Bangalore. Conducting this workshop along with business development work for ~Rs. 5,000 per month ($75). Digital Marketing - started as a side hustle when I was working with startups during my college days. Helped me land my first internship with YourStory Media back in 2010 during my 2nd year of engineering. Now, it's my bread and butter! :D Learning - Side hustle can help you discover your passion, brings new opportunities and opens up new doors in your career. So those of you who are still trying to discover your passion - start with a side hustle. If you're truly passionate about it, it'll take off very well! One of my side hustles is Merch by Amazon. Merch by Amazon is a platform that allows you to upload designs that get listed as t-shirts for sale on Amazon (via print-on-demand). When one of your shirts sells, you get a portion of the sale.  See more Quora Merch by Amazon questions and answers here. Merch by Amazon involves a simple 2-step process: design and upload. Well, there is actually an optional, but not really optional, step before the actual design: Research. 1.

Merch by Amazon is a platform that allows you to upload designs that get listed as t-shirts for sale on Amazon (via print-on-demand). When one of your shirts sells, you get a portion of the sale.  See more Quora Merch by Amazon questions and answers here. Merch by Amazon involves a simple 2-step process: design and upload. Well, there is actually an optional, but not really optional, step before the actual design: Research. 1. Research: The key to producing designs that sell as shirts on Amazon is researching t-shirt ideas before creating the designs. For this, I use a combination of my own observations and market research on the web. My own observations are somewhat sporadic. When I’m out and about, I look at shirts, signs, etc. for ideas. I also pay attention to Twitter and trendy stuff that’s happening. When something catches my eye or I think of a funny phrase that might be popular on a shirt, I’ll jot it down in my iPhone notes. For web research, I use a tool called Merch Informer, which is a paid subscription service. Merch Informer allows you to type in phrases that return the most popular t-shirts listed on Amazon that match those keywords. When you find a popular t-shirt design that’s doing well, if you create something similar, but better, chances are your design will also do well. One of the most important items to research is trademarks. You are not allowed to use designs that are trademarked or copyright, otherwise your account may get banned. Merch Informer can check trademarks for your phrase, but you can also use a free site like Trademarkia.  2. Design: Once I have the t-shirt ideas, creating the designs is not that difficult. I don’t have any graphic design experience, but you don’t need any design experience to do well on Merch because many top-selling shirts are very simple, text-based designs. Personally, I don’t use advanced software like Photoshop. Instead, I use easier web-based tools like Canva. Merch Informer has their own web-based t-shirt designer as well. There is even an iOS app called WordRabbit, which is designed specifically for creating Merch designs. Using these tools, I can create simple designs that look great in minutes. To save time and make sure I always have plenty of designs to fill my maximum daily uploads, I also outsource some of my design work. 3. Upload: The upload process involves submitting your png file to Amazon, selecting your t-shirt colors, price, and adding a title and bullet descriptions for your Amazon listing.  Once again, researching keywords for your descriptions is optional, but recommended because relevant keywords and bullet points will increase the visibility of your listing. You’ll also want to make sure the colors you select look good with your design (e.g., select dark colors with a light colored text design and vice versa). That’s about it! It’s a simple side hustle, but a good one if you can conduct solid research, create decent designs, and upload consistently. The most successful Merchers are making six figures a year. But just like success in any endeavor, it requires hard work, consistency, and continuous learning and improvement. If you are interested in applying for a Merch by Amazon account, you can get on the waiting list here. It’s free so you have nothing to lose!

Depends if you're using a PC or a Mac (or cross-platform).PC: For beginners, I'd recommend using Windows Movie Maker for starting and how to edit basic videos.

Some people say that it's similar to iMovie with the addons (although I think that the experience is quite different). If you would like to use powerdirector, make sure to include the addons you can get at their online store.One of the most powerful video editing tools for Windows is Sony Vegas Pro. You'll be exposed to masking and correction techniques on a more flexible scale. There are other plugins/addons (i.e. borisfx and newbluefx), but I rarely use them, mainly because I use the effects from Powerdirector in conjunction with vegas pro. You could use HitFilm Ultimate in conjunction with Vegas Pro for effects, but it really isn't the industry standard (yet), as many people still use Adobe After Effects for motion graphics.Mac: Jump straight into iMovie. It is actually a pretty powerful video editing program with much more appealing effects than Windows Movie Maker has. You can create good videos without the hard learning curve in iMovie.Final Cut Pro is the next step up. Apple's creative suite allows users to create motion graphics, edit audio, and integrate them on its video editing program. Final Cut Pro is sort of like Sony Vegas Pro's creative suite i mentioned earlier. I do not have much experience with this.Cross-Platform: Adobe's creative suite is a good option if you would like to work on Macs and PCs. Adobe Premiere Pro (editing software) combined with After Effects (motion graphics) is currently the industry standard, which is a good idea to learn it if you are going to be serious about video editing. However, Premiere has a steep learning curve and uses up more RAM than Vegas does (by quite an amount). The Adobe creative suite is still pretty integrated though. Switching between Vegas and After Effects all the time can be quite a pain, due to all the rendering you have to do for segments of your video before rendering the final video itself.At the end of the day, the key to becoming better at video editing is experience. Paying attention to the creation of the videos you watch and having hands-on practice at producing a video will make you better quickly.

For example, if you can open 12 browser tabs in a system with 8G memory, you can double the number of tabs with 16G memory. I’m just giving examples as the memory consumption of a browser tab entirely depends on the content running in it. You can run more things with more memory if your CPU allows. A pentium3 with 8G RAM wouldn’t do any good. The combination should be of good memory and Good CPU to make up a good performing system. That’s happened to me before. Most likely it’s no cause for worry, although it COULD be corrupt memory (bad stick essentially). Try removing the RAM again and making sure there is no dust in the RAM slot. Then, when you place the RAM back in, make sure it really clicks in so there’s good contact. I’ve used a duster can to help clear out any debris, and it seemed to work ok. I hope this helps.

Blender is more than enough for indie production. It has less “beginner tools” and you have to learn the harder techniques earlier, which teaches you right things from the get go. This might help you pick up more about the technical side which can help in the long run. This has been beneficial in my career with the trade of that I lagged little behind my peers who were able to “swim earlier” although now it seems I’m able to surpass them as they haven’t grasped the more advanced techniques but wasted their time driving with the “training wheels”. It is not impossible to follow this route with Maya as well if you have a good teacher or tutorials. Just something that I see happening organically as Blender lacks those “training wheels”. AAA games, animation and movies requires that you learn Maya and many other tools as well, because the studio tools are usually build on top of them and almost never top of Blender. The situation can change in 20 years or so as Blender develops quite rapidly and more and more people start with Blender. Even if you aim for the triple A, learning Blender doesn’t harm though as the tools are almost identical. Blender being more simple and compact compared to Maya. You can easily transfer to Maya later once you master Blender, just keep in mind that the transfer can take 6–24 months. So be sure you begin to transfer early rather than late. I have used Blender probably 10–12 years and tried Maya briefly and watched Maya tutorials and talked with Maya animators. I may be biased but I would say Blender is superior in many ways in the animation realm but very poor mocap support, lack of third party tools and the fact that all major companies were founded at the time on Maya was only option make Maya number one choise for big studios and for animators wanting to work there instead of indie productions. Despite the fact that Maya is horrible tool in many ways compared to Blender. Don’t even consider using 3Ds for serious animation work, if Blender is 8+ and Maya is 10, 3Ds would be 4-.

Blender 2.80 is a huge game changer in the 3D industry. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Recently, Ubisoft announced that they will join the Blender Foundation’s Development Fund as a corporate Gold member. Not only will Ubisoft help funding online support for Blender developers, Ubisoft Animation Studio – a department of Ubisoft Film and Television – will also use Blender for their productions and assign developers to contribute to Blender’s open source projects. Pierrot Jacquet, Head of Production at Ubisoft Animation Studio says “Blender was for us an obvious choice: Its strong and engaged community paired up with the vision carried by the Blender Foundation makes it one of the most creative DCC of the market.”Also Epic Games, as part of the company’s $100 million Epic MegaGrants program, is awarding the Blender Foundation $1.2 million in cash to further the success of Blender, the free and open source 3D creation suite that supports the full range of tools empowering artists to create 3D graphics, animation, special effects or games. The latest best project completely done on Blender is a Sci-Fi Short From Pixar's Colin Levy: SKYWATCH  Just over ten minutes, Levy shows he has a deft handle on executing Amblin-y or Bad Robot-style stories with compelling emotional beats among some impressive, studio-level VFX. (The latter will be what catches the attention of studio execs, but Levy's work with the young cast here and execution of the sci-fi story with an appreciation for giving it an emotional core should not be overlooked.)

None of the answers provided seem to originate from a perspective that will actually need to use blender for professional or contractual work, work that you will need to collaborate with the outside world. I was trained on Softimage 17 years ago on SGI workstations using Unix, and even that wasn’t as hectic as Blender is today 2 decades later. After learning Softimage, I basically developed the ability to learn anything after that, and I worked with tons of applications from 3d, 2d editing, after effects, premiere, to web developing apps, cms systems, rendering apps, you name it. I worked as a freelancer for many companies using 3dsmax, Maya, Vray, Joomla, Shopify, Dreamweaver, Flash, Photoshop, Illustrator and even sketchup among a few I can vividly remember. I learned all of them by following basic tutorials available online and on youtube and understood the basics by playing with them. Blender is another story and it all comes down to one thing : It is the most counter intuitive interface I have ever seen. Nothing you learn prepares you for learning blender, I mean even selecting object is obscure, don’t tell me it is as powerful as Maya or any other paid 3d software, even if it was more powerful in terms of what you can do with it, simply put it : to learn blender it feels like you need to un-learn everything you know about 3d. Don’t waste your time on this, it’s not a learning curve, it’s alien and you really don’t need to waste time on this, since you probably will have to use other plugins and extensions made by humans so you better learn to use something that will benefit your ability to jump between apps and interfaces easily. Whatever you learn in Blender is useless in other apps, and since 3D is a way of expressing art, Blender is not for artists.",2021-03-05T08:29:34.399Z,"Is Blender worth learning if I want to become a professional animator?

Blogs are one of the easiest ways to increase SEO and bring more organic traffic from the search engines to your blog. This will benefit you, as a marketer, by supplementing your ads with inbound marketing activities to make the most of your small marketing budget. (ii) Videos It's important that you find a way to catch the interest of your target audience and engage them quickly if you want to stay competitive in the busy digital marketplace. More video content than ever before is being watched by users today. One-third of all internet interaction is currently spent viewing video material. This reality makes video one of the best ways of digital marketing, no matter what field you are in to attract and engage your target audience. (iii) Infographics Infographics help content marketers educate their viewers and provide valuable insights for leads and consumers who can add value. This format of visual content marketing encourages users to properly interpret facts such as statistics in order to get a better grasp of whether something is important or how something functions. (iv) Case Studies A case study is another of the most valuable kinds of content marketing.

In order to illustrate special purposes or uses for their programs and goods, businesses may use case studies. (vi) Whitepapers In a lot of respects, White Papers are similar to eBooks. Another kind of long-form material that can be effective as a lead magnet is whitepaper. The key difference between eBooks and white papers, however, is that white papers appear to be a little denser, data-driven, and detail-focused content. This makes whitepapers one of the strongest ways of B2B and other small business content marketing that want to create opinion leadership and gain more respect in their industry. (vii) Interviews Another of the highest-performing kinds of content marketing is interviews with business professionals or even your own clients.

TOP Search Engine Promotion Trends for 2018 Among the main optimization criteria, according to Google, there are: Domain age and authority, proxy indicators: IP, WhoIs data publicity, keyword occurrence, regionality, etc.Website security ensured by HTTPS. Google emphasized the importance of and paid special attention to this factor at the beginning of the year. So, if you are still using the SSL protocol, there is a chance to correct that.Content quality: its length, comprehensiveness; images, videos, infographics and tables usage. The correctness of the H1-H6 mark-up, keywords density in the text and compliance of the Title and Description with the text itself should also be added to the list.Mobile-friendliness. This factor is of critical importance not only for search engines, but for users as well. The recipe for success is quite simple: the more accurately your website is rendered on smartphones and tablets, the closer you are to reaching conversion goals: purchases, blog subscriptions, adding to favourites, services ordering.Web page load speed. Just as the previous item, this factor is more relevant for visitors. One should “speed up” the page to 1-2 seconds since longer load will impact the bounce rate, session time and, needless to say, conversion as well. Minimize the number of scripts being downloaded from third-party sources, use gzip image compression, caching, and forget about the frames appliance as they negatively influence your website.Traffic from social media.Link profile: the number of domains referring to your website, link anchors, domain quality, nesting, etc.What SEO trends will remain important in 2018? Apparently, these factors will remain at the top of optimization merits: Traffic from social mediaResponsiveness and load speedDomain age, authority, and security.Speaking about the factors which were popular in 2017, not all of them will stay so relevant. The thing is that search engines actively apply neural networks to provide users with the most consistent results.  It will mostly affect commercial websites. If your website, for example, is in the Top of cleaning services by the Czech Republic, Google will still use regional search results. When a user from Prague will want to order cleaning services, search engines will primarily show website and offices of the companies that are closer to the user’s location on the map. As for the link profile or the number of domains that refer to your website, they will also undergo certain changes: search engines will play closer attention at affiliation with the domain region. You should also try to increase referral traffic as it has a great impact on the website representation and credibility in the eyes of search engines. Prime search engine optimization factors for 2018 Link profile Focus on building the link profile within your region or country.External links should be identical or related to the website topic.Select backlinks by the following domain criteria: age, PR, link profile.Use Ahrefs and Semrush applications for the quality backlinks analysis.Load speed Try to reach the green zone of the Google PageSpeed Insight tool with your website. Use caching plug-ins, like WordPress Fastest Cache for WordPress and Jot Cache for Joomla websites.Optimize the server response speed.Responsiveness It is useful to apply Google AMP. Test rending correctness of the whole website and each image on Android, iOS and in different browsers. According to the recent research from Statista, traffic growth from mobile devices was 43,05% in the third quarter of 2017 and it makes a 3% increase each quarter. Technical search engine optimization factors in 2018 Turn your attention to the content and presentation fullness. Strike the right balance between the content length and information accuracy. This aspect is very important not only for topical blogs, but for commercial websites as well, when we speak about products and services descriptions with prices, characteristics and comparisons. Extend the website semantic core with low-frequency queries. Based on the Google report, 1 from 5 search queries is received from voice search.Do not forget about the mark-up: Schema, H1-H6, ALT. Alt will help to get additional impressions and clicks in search results, especially if your website falls into the visuals category: interior design, automotive design, etc.Make a rule of using the JSON-LD or Microdata mark-up when publishing articles or products on the website. It shows search engines exactly what kind of information is on your website. First of all, markup contacts, information about your business and already available products to increase the number of impressions and for the extended snippets in the Top of search results.

It is very much important for improving the online visibility of the business to get more leads for the business. It is important to note that you have to keep the three different categories of SEO such as technical, on-page, and off-page SEO in your mind to improve the overall work. When we are going to talk about search engine optimization, then you have to keep the following things in your mind: Website Security: Security is very much essential. In the online world, security is one of the important concerns that should not be ignored at any cost. The businesses need to spend on their security to avoid hacking problems. You should buy tools and software that can help you protect your website information and can give you better protection against spyware, malware, or the attack of hackers. Google has put emphasis on the significance of a website’s security. Note that, if any of your business’s website is using the SSL protocol, then it’s time to make the changes for better security. Mobile Friendliness: Mobile is being frequently used by every person on this planet. People are more attached to them than before. So, it is very much essential for the business to make their website mobile-friendly. They have to optimize their website design as per the mobile users for attracting more people to their website. This factor is very much important because most people are going to use their mobile for browsing and checking products or services offered by the company. Google also introduced an update earlier that ranks the website on top that has to create its mobile version for better navigation and usability. Domain Authority And Age: Yes, this is also important for the proper functioning of your website. It will be including things like whole data publicity, the occurrence of keywords, publicity, proxy indicators, and much more. Link Profile: This will be the number of domains that will be referring to your website. It will further include things like quality of the domain, nesting, and link anchors. Loading Speed: Do you like to wait when opening a website? Well, the answer is “NO”. No one wants to wait when they click on the website. The purpose to visit a website is to quickly view the information they want without any delay. People instantly want to see a product, information about service, or other information as per their need. Due to this, it is important to enhance the loading speed of your web pages. It should load fast to avoid the delays and problems faced by users in terms of accessibility. Hopefully, now you are aware of all the important points that need to be focused on when you are going to do modern SEO or getting a service.

6041ed31ed76476feda196a6,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-go-to-college-for-video-editing?-,"To those of us who have actually edited videos that have been nominated for or won awards at a festival, it is anything but silly. As my friend, writer, producer, director, and actress is continually fond of saying, “If it were easy, there wouldn’t be an academy award for it.” The fact that you find it easy indicates 2 things to me: 1. It is something you enjoy. 2. You’re just getting started. I can’t tell from your question exactly how or why you began editing. I also can’t really discern what your software or experience is. But I would ask you to look at the world of media as it exists today in all its glory: music, movies, commercials, documentaries, tutorials, television shows. All of them use video editing to some extent. Yes, even music. (think of your favorite piece, now think of the music video that goes with it) These are the outlets that use/need video editors. Now to your question: Filmmaking is the standard course structure you’ll be taking at whatever institution you choose. Why not just editing? Glad you asked. Editing is the final process in the complicated post-production world. Editing can include cutting the film together, speed grading the film (aka colorizing), designing and inserting the audio, designing and inserting titles, designing and inserting the credit roll. The larger the budget, the more people can be contracted to which any or all of these tasks can be delegated. Sometimes the production schedule is such that an episode has to be completed in an absurdly small amount of time and a number of editors are used and given parameters for the style of the editing. Each editor gets put in charge of a scene and they stitch them together in the end. And remember that editing is only the POST-production part. The pre-production and actual production (when it is shot) must be done with editing in mind and a clear vision (usually the director’s) of how the end piece should look. That means the Producer, Writer, Director, DP, and Composer, must work together with the editor to produce that vision. So, cooperation and collaboration is imperative with each step of the process, with each person doing his/her job to the best of their ability so that everyone else gets what they need to produce that vision. I’m only guessing here, but are you using Final Cut Pro 10? Editing with FCX can make editing seem easy because it comes with a lot of presets and 3rd party plug-ins abound (bells and whistles). It has become the AOL of editing programs. That’s the good news. The bad news is that almost nobody in the pro-industry is using it anymore. They lost a lot devotees when they upgraded from v7 to v10 and launched themselves into the prosumer category. When the interface started to look like iMovie a lot of us jumped ship. If you’re serious about being an editor (a very crowded field), you’ll want to explore other softwares. I am partial to Adobe Premiere and the supporting apps found in their Creative Cloud subscription suite. But Autodesk’s Smoke and Sony’s Smoke are 2 others that bear consideration. This is not the time or place for an editing tutorial, but try approaching your next project with this parameter in mind: use only fade-ups, cuts, dissolves, and fade-outs as transitions between scenes and shots. Remember that storytelling involves different usage from documentaries or commercials. While study this, include the use of J-cuts and L-cuts in your work and see what that does to your progress of story. Editor IS the job. Chances are really good that if you have seen video on any screen anywhere, there was an editor involved. Think about the number of screens, channels, movies, videos, tv shows, music videos working in the world around you and you can get a rough idea about how much editors are needed and how many are working. It is a highly competitive field with lots of positions. Easy? There is a mighty good chance that you simply aren’t paying attention to the details involved. Before you sign up for a $30K education, take a look at all the resources available online. Simply Googling “video editing how to” produces about 6,650,000 results. And yes, I copied that number straight from the search. Next, watch a major film (Game of Thrones comes to mind) and don’t consume the story; watch the editing and remember the hours and hours of footage that goes into getting one episode exactly right. Ask yourself some hard questions: do you know the basics of composition? Do you know how to edit to story? Do you know about formats, CODECS, resolution? How much time should you schedule for a 30 sec spot to be edited? A 30 minute TV show? Anyone who has been staring down the barrel of the final steps of editing with a deadline looming on the other side of dawn would never say that editing is easy. As an editor, you are one of the major forces of a group of people that come together to create a visual and aural world. This could explain why film people have that slightly stunned look all the time, since during production they are always working when not sleeping. It is a consuming art form. Many of us do little else besides work, eat, and sleep (with that last item being the one that is usually in short supply). Welcome to editing. I sincerely hope your research doesn’t scare you off from taking up a skill that is obviously to your liking. Good Luck.

My Personal preference is Avid Media Composer, but for a novice, choosing and editing system is only secondary to understanding what editing is all about. I can get into depth on the various aspects of it but there are lots of good sources available on the web and elsewhere.It might be a good idea to watch the excellent documentary: ""The Cutting Edge"" by Wendy Apple which is available on YouTube.

So he started over, and got a job and using that, overtime and the pittance left of his military retirement began a new life. I guess women in their 40’s in our area, when dating are more interested in what a man has, according to him, so he decided he’d marry some woman from overseas. A HUGE news event revealed that Women from Asia were very familiar with our state and they knew “Half” which was what they’d get once they married and divorced an American. They had an industry set up, lawyers, a s support group, everything set to get the woman a divorce, and set her up to live here, with scripts and everything, divorce attorney and immigration attorney. They’d slap the guy with divorce paperwork and get HALF, and then bring over their boyfriends. So the man decided upon a Russian. He met several and found one who seemed to like him and he liked her, she wasn’t some young kid, she was a middle aged woman as frustrated as he was, and put in her packet without high hopes and she actually surprised he was interested in her, and what interested her as well, and they got hitched. Once she came here, they were driving back from Sea Tac and she asked to go to a grocery store. He thought that she needed something so he pulled into a Safeway, she got out and looked around and got inexplicably angry and sad as she looked at him as if she’d been betrayed. She asked him to drive in a long route to his home, so he did. They passed several grocery stores and they found a run down Big Apple. “There.” She insisted. They went in and she walked through there wide eyed and shocked. Then she turned, crying and hugged him and apologized. She explained as a child in the Soviet Union, they had little in their grocery stores although the party officials had more, they were still limited. Even later, the cold war over, it was limited. She’d heard that ours were incredible. So she asked to see one and when he took her to Safeway she thought he was being deceptive, it was too well stocked so she assumed he took her to a sham, deliberately deceiving her. When she picked a run down one and still saw a wide range of produce and other items, she felt bad for feeling he’d tried to deceive her, she also was struck by how much her life had changed. Yes, she did marry him mostly for a change, for better conditions. BTW, they are still married. I was a kid when the Soviet Union dissolved.

My father served as a Lt. Commander in the Navy at the time, and I remember going on base at one point and being shocked to see a Russian cruiser at port. This was before all their ships started to rust apart; the behemoth gleamed in the sun, and the base seemed overrun by sailors in unfamiliar uniforms, although in truth I could tell they weren’t being given a free run of the place. But they could roam around the base commissary. I can still remember the stupefied and incredulous expressions on so many young Russian faces, as they picked up fresh fruit to inspect, or rattled cans of nuts. I asked my father what was wrong with them. He said, “They think we’re lying to them, pretending to have a lot of food all the time. Even with so many of them here, the lines at the checkout go fast. They think it’s propaganda.” In truth, I wasn’t surprised to hear it, since I was the kid you ignored at recess because I spent too much time with my nose buried in Discover Magazine and National Geographic. I’d heard about the Soviet queues, but it hadn’t hit me until that moment what it must be like as a citizen of a glorious super power but unable to secure fresh food for your family; to wait hours in line to get what meager food there was. Their ship seemed so magnificent, a threat with it’s giant missile tubes; the crew had no reason to feel ashamed amidst the high technology surrounding them. Their uniforms were so clean too, I thought. All of them looked fresh-faced and sturdy. The best of them, perhaps. But their expressions told me which of our nations really put on a show.

For past 17 years I have used Asus, HP, Apple, Lenovo, Dell both desktop and laptops. My recommendation is go for Apple if you have a budget (I’m not paid for this answer :)). It really worth it. In terms of work experience, reliability, availability of software and accuracy of work is there with Mac. In average comparison Apple can be used for longer period than PC. So count the per year expense likewise. Some may think if Adobe runs well every machine is the same. It’s not. When you grow with your professional or University work, you’ll have to work across many applications and tools in different stages in your design process. At that time you will need a trouble free, versatile and compatible computer with a solid OS. So if you work in a prepared place, go for iMac. (Preffered )and if you are a mobile designer go for MacBook Pro. If you have a limited budget, buy an entry level HP with a dedicated VGA. Don’t go for premium level PCs. Save your money for another investment. Earn some dollars and invest for a mac later. You don't need much power for web design, so just buy any laptop you're comfortable with. Just make sure it has a good display with high resolution (in Apple terms: ""Retina"") and a wide color range. And you really should buy one with a SSD. It's 2016. You don't wanna work with one of those ancient HDDs anymore. They're slow as ****. Keep in mind though that many apps are OSX exclusive, so I'd recommend buying a Macbook. But it's not mandatory. And you certainly won't need the most powerful one, as some suggested. I’ve personally only used Macs. I haven’t had too much trouble with them. They tend to work well for me and last a long time. I haven’t had too much experience with PC’s to know if a Mac is better or not. But definitely is a good computer for graphic and web design. That is what I use mine for. I have a Macbook Pro 2015, 13 inch. I like the 2015 model better because the new Macbook Pros have no ports on them and I don’t want to have to deal with dongles.

But there was a certain quirkiness in the stop motion animation which was unique to it compared to CGI. 2) Some methods could also allow more flexibility than others. For example, why do photographers shoot in RAW mode rather than allow the camera do all the post-processing.  3) Purely a personal preference. Animation, and any art for that matter, is not just the end product. It is also about how much we enjoy doing it: The process. For an animator, it is the day job. It takes up their entire time. So, you will as well do it in a way you enjoy it.  Another extreme example is oil on paint animation. It was used in a short animated movie adaptation of Old Man and the Sea. It took 4 years to complete a movie. This is how the movie is made:   ""The film's technique, pastel oil paintings on glass, is mastered by only a handful of animators in the world. Petrov used his fingertips in addition to various paintbrushes to paint on different glass sheets positioned on multiple levels, each covered with slow-drying oil paints. After photographing each frame painted on the glass sheets, which was four times larger than the usual A4-sized canvas, he had to slightly modify the painting for the next frame and so on. For the shooting of the frames a special adapted motion-control camera system was built, probably the most precise computerized animation stand ever made. On this an IMAX camera was mounted, and a video-assist camera was then attached to the IMAX camera."" With all the horsepower, artificial intelligence, and pristine output, brought by 3D and CGI software, a sketchy hand-drawn image can trump it all.

The respect for the whimsical phantasy of the artist, and the sheer awe for the tremendous amount of work, these feats tickle our senses. It's the quick and irregular rendition of thinner and thicker drawn lines, which is both related to the technique of the tool (pressure on pencil, orientation of hand, as well as the immediate and almost unconscious 'drive' of the artist. Furthermore, it might be relatively easy for such an artist to pick up a pencil and get it done, compared to digging into all the techniques of drawing with software. The drawing becomes so technical, learning all about textures, materials, shading, lights, shadows, rigging, blobs, particles, inverse kinematics, timelines, etcetera. And most of all, most hand-drawn animations present something that actually isn't there: the perceived line that indicates a sharp contrast in a mass of shaded material (like skin). Look at the baby's elbow or wrinkles - these are probably not to be seen as strong or at all in reality. It's a characterization, an artist's impression, in the same we can whistle a tune and capture a melody, without knowing or using a score for the complete orchestration of a big band. But beware, the vast amount of work to draw all frames in an animation should not be underestimated ! Maybe it's fun to see an intentionally coarse animation once or twice. But to render a more vivid animation, you need at least 10 frames per second. That's why the most talented animators only draw keyframes, to let others draw the frames between those keyframes, interpolating all differences between the original keyframes. (That's why it's called ""tweening"".) In the early days, Disney Studios employed hundreds of tweeners, cheap staff to produce thousands of celluloid frames (called gels), based on the whimsically drawn keyframes by their main artists. Yeah, what they said. Not much to add to the earlier, excellent answers except that Mr. Keane works that way because he feels hand-drawn is simply better than computer-generated.

I will throw in a little anecdote if I may: Some years ago I attended a seminar on architectural rendering at an annual conference in Boston. There were two speakers, a traditional architectural illustrator who did beautiful pencil drawings, and a much younger gentleman who used 3D Studio. First the traditional illustrrator spoke, showed examples of his work, discussed his approach and aesthetic, and so on. Then the computer artist spoke. He said things like, ""Look at the reflections on that wall! You'd never be able to with traditional illustration techniques.""  Afterwards there was a question and answer and some interesting facts came out. First of all, the traditional illustrator no longer set up his initial drawings the old-fashioned way (i.e., scale off plans and elevations using traditional perspective techniques). No, clients were expected to provide a 3D model wireframe for the artist to trace over. Then it came out that the reason they gave the seminar together was because they were business partners. The computer artist's clients had told him that his renderings were very accurate but lacked warmth and empathy; so he now handed over his finished renderings to the traditional artist to work on and bring some life into them. So nobody is pure anymore; the traditionalist depends on new technology to facilitate his work, the avante gardist has to return his work to its roots by taking it away from the computer and handing control back to an actual human being. I do computer animations myself, of the architectural walkthrough/flyby variety, and I do not hesitate for a second to depend utterly on the computer, but then, I am not emotionally invested in animation as an art form; frankly, to me, it's just a way to make money (it's fun to do, though!). As for my painting, however... that's completely hand-done. I don't use photographs, I don't work from memory or imagination or even from sketches. I work exclusively from life. It doesn't matter how much ""better"" the final image might be if I'd use some of the tools available to me as a technological person. I don't care. I'm a purist and you'll never convince me otherwise.",2021-03-05T09:37:03.661Z,"Why do some artists prefer to follow hand-drawn animation even if there are lot of tools available for doing animation easily?

Invest Time Upfront in Organizing Yourself If you are a video editor working under an intense time constraint, you make think that taking a an hour to organize your files would be counter-productive. This couldn’t be more wrong. Creating a good filing structure for all of your media is imperative to both successful and quick editing. Without a well thought-out organizational system, your files can easily get misplaced or accidentally delated. Both of these will cost you time, and money, in the long-run. For every new project it is advised to create a new main folder, with a consistent sub-folder structure beneath it for all of your workflows: photography, video editing, graphics, music, footage, documents, etc. You can even install a media project management tool like Post Haste to automate the process for you.Post Haste helps you setup file and folder templates for your projects. Whatever folder structure you choose, create one, be consistent in naming and use it for every new project. It will help keep your assets organized and save you tons of time in the long run. 2. Get Rid of All Distractions In today’s multi-tasking, content bombardment world it is becoming increasingly challenging to stay focused on one task for any considerable amount of time. However, for every interruption in your workflow, it is proven to take up to 25 minutes to get back on course. So how do we avoid distractions? First, block all social media notifications. Incessant pinging of new messages are a distraction you can do without. You can install an app to help you with this. However, I prefer the old-fashioned method of just quitting the programs when you are focused on editing. Then set times to check your email just 3 times a day. Most things can wait. Second, opt to edit early in the morning while most people are asleep and your mind is fresh. It’s been argued that the most successful people in the world start their day at 4am. If shifting your hours to the early morning proves too challenging, then at least try working in isolation. If you are usually office based, ask to have a ‘work from home’ day. If that isn’t feasible, find the times when your workspace isn’t teeming with people. 3. Learn Your Shortcuts For each editing action you need to make, from cutting to playback, there is a simple keyboard shortcut you can probably perform instead. Using a keyboard shortcut may only save you a few seconds for each editing function; however, if you are doing extensive editing full-time these few seconds saved here and there add up to saving hours (if not days). To this end, learning your keyboard shortcuts is an essential productivity hack. You can start learning the shortcuts by printing a cheat sheet and using it as a reference during editing. Here are a few cheat sheets for some of the most popular video editing programs: Apple Final Cut Pro X Keyboard Shortcut Cheat Sheet Adobe Premiere Pro Keyboard Shortcuts Cheat Sheet Avid Keyboard Shortcut Cheat Sheet DaVinci Resolve 14 In conjunction with a cheat sheet, investing in either an editing keyboard or a keyboard cover is also recommended. Both will display the editing shortcuts as icons on each appropriate key of your keyboard. However, the benefit of a silicon keyboard cover is that you can keep your current keyboard and if you change software in the future, it is a lot cheaper to get a new cover than a new keyboard. LogicKeyboard sells covers for most editing software and keyboard types: Whatever method you choose, the keyboard shortcuts will save you a ton of time and might even speed up your editing by as much as 50%. 4. Use a Note-Taking App During the editing process, you will undoubtedly think of things you want to change or revisit. However, stopping what you are currently doing to tackle that thought is a definite productivity killer. Instead, capture that thought - or even image - with a note taking app and come back to it at the right stage of your editing process. The best note-taking apps include search ability functions allowing you to find your idea in a matter of seconds. Also, quality note-taking apps offer an option for you to dictate your notes. Lastly, most note taking apps store your moments of inspiration into the cloud so that you always have your comments as long as you have the Internet. Note taking apps come with a wide variety of functionalities. Popular fully loaded apps include OneNote or Evernote. However, in our aim to be devoid of distractions during the editing process, consider ones with fewer features like Simplenote. 5. Outsource Work That is Time-Consuming Various parts of the video-editing process are extremely consuming. Take for example the process of transcribing interviews or adding subtitles to your videos. Both of these tasks are not only dull, but take hours. Outsourcing this work to a specialist company is an important way to save you time and money. For example, at Happy Scribe, we can transcribe your audio or video file using voice recognition technology within a matter of a few minutes. You can then export that text into Word, TXT and PDF or in SRT & STL for subtitles. Giving you a few more minutes to make an even tighter edit. Focusing on your core competencies is key to remaining productive. The Bottom Line Incorporating these 5 productivity hacks into your video editing process will help you stay on track, complete your project on time, and make your post-production process stress free.

There are two reasons it bugs me: It’s true and I’m the perfect example of it.In today’s world, it’s irrelevant.In the Middle Ages, if you only sorta knew how to repair a horse shoe, weren’t funny enough to be the king’s jester and just half-decent at farming, you were screwed. Sometimes literally.  Today, if you know how to work a video camera, are kinda funny and can edit a little bit, you win.  We still need specialists, but more and more, specialized work becomes commoditized, because at one point, a robot will do better heart surgery than a heart surgeon. Luckily, some people work hard to spread the message that being a generalist is not a bad thing. People like Emilie Wapnick, who coined the term multipotentialite. Her TED talk about the topic has been viewed 4,000,000+ times. And yet, look at the top comment:  If you’re a generalist, a polymath, a renaissance person, a multipotentialite, or whatever you call yourself: we need you. The world needs jacks of all trades. And it also needs an updated version of the phrase. How about jack of all trades, master of all?

A very large number of the answers appear to be based upon answers previously given by Quorans. It does appear to me that very, very few of the answers actually take into account the grammar of the OP. Though I am not a linguist of strong measure, it does occur to me that the “""operative verb” of the question is “does”. It is for such reason why I cannot perceive the question as coming from one who is making reference to academics. Had the question been phrased as …”someone who knows…”, i might respond with a very short answer of “Smart”. If you have just read a multitude of answers before reading mine, one might be inclined to declare, “….who is THIS pompous a**?” Please feel free to go all the way back to the OP and read it. You may then have some understanding of my tangent of approach to the question. By definition of my local Painter’s Union of some forty or more years ago, I AM a Master Painter. I am fourth generation Painter having been trained by family members who were actually Union Instructors when they were within the prime of their skill. As such, not only am I knowledgeable and physically capable of nearly all methods of paint coatings applications, I am also an accomplished Plaster Finisher, Wallcovering Installer, Drywall Hanger & Finisher, Caulking and Glazing Specialist, and by nature of the different formulations of coatings and substrates which I use, also a Specialized Chemist. Most who have knowledge of the Painting industry dating back for the last fifty years would refer to me as an Expert or even Master of my field. However, it is notable that almost all of the various facets of a “Painter” are today broken down into very specific tasks of a repetitive nature. Persons of youth or who otherwise have never had any experience being around others of the construction industry, might be tempted to call me “""a jack of all trades”. That would be true in general, if referencing my many skillful attributes. I have never hired a mechanic to fix my car and I've never hired a plumber. i would also mention that I've never worked on someone else's car or changed a toilet for them. I recommend you hire an expert if you can't do it yourself. Yet, those who know my skill sets never call me “a jack of all trades” without it being an affirmation of admiration. I am “""growing long in the tooth” (a euphemism for another discussion upon another day) and am subsequently become physically “""broken down”. I am not able to physically do what I used to. Yet, my knowledge of my trade is exemplary (today), though typical of my trade fifty years ago. You, the reader, would be correct to note that I have not yet answered the question of the OP ! Instead, I have given a short dissertation (perhaps resume) which stands as a pre-qualification of my answer. Please, indulge me a little while longer and I shall offer my answer to the question. In my “""neck of the woods”, in the world of Drywall Hangers, there is a device often fashioned out of scrap 2X4’s found lying around the job site. A “T” shaped device known as a “""dead man” or a “""jack leg” is used to allow one man (or woman) to hang a board of drywall on the ceiling rafters by the self. In my world of “boiling testosterone” and “machismo” one would never call another a “""dead man” as that would most certainly be seen as a threat. However, to reference someone as a “""jack leg” is to infer that they “""will do” for lack of the money(s) to hire someone who is actually qualified. Alas, you now have your answer to the OP’s question ! (Or) You have at least, a regional title of what we experts would refer to as a person having physical talent without any specific knowledge of the complexities of a given construction trade. However, there are many within my trade who actually do have a working knowledge and skill, and yet for the sake of cutting corners in that they may put more money in either the bosses pocket or their own, are referred to (by me) as Capitalists. Their modus operandus (perhaps spelled wrong) is, “….if you are ignorant enough to buy it, I'm smart enough to sell it to you”. These persons also qualify as “""Jack Leg”. if I were inclined to be absolutely clear in my insult, I might interchange “""Jack Leg” with “""Half-Ass”. It should be obvious by now, that my answer does come with some bias. It troubles me deeply that so many people who have written answers to this question (of the OP) seem to elevate the attribute of being weak in expertise. Granted, there are some jobs which require an absolute focus upon a given topic. Please do not get me wrong, there are those who “""study the tree” and those who “""study the forest”. Vocations which require Engineering most definitely require some amount of multidisciplinary studies. By no means am I referring to those persons as “""Jack Legs”. Keep in mind that my answer is predicated around the word “does”, not “knows”. The distinction may or may not have been intentional as written by the OP. My attention to detail as is a learned trait from my vocation has inspired me upon my path of conclusion. Those of you who bought the “McMansion’s “ built over the last thirty plus years, which are now falling down around you, have surely an understanding of what a “""jack leg” is, now. Not only is it the reinforcement post which had to be installed under your floor because there is a sagging in your roof, it is a descriptor of those who built your not so fancy house to start with. However, let us not be too angry at the “""jack leg” labor that's went into the building of your home. For, ultimately, it is the Capitalist Builder who charged you a lifetime of dreams and hired the many crews of “""jack legs” for so little pay, that is responsible for the money pit that you now live in. You also owe yourself some culpabilty as well. Your thirst for instant gratification fuels an industry in which “Expertise” is too expensive. The Experts are often heard to say, “""pay me now, or pay me latter” or “….it's called job security.!” Experts are a dying breed ! The result….we live in a disposable economy in which the “""Jack of all trades” (as many have so admirably praised) is the common and accepted standard. That, along with hamburgers which are made from fifty different cows with parts that used to put into dog food ! MPBWY This is actually an interesting topic. It’s said that in the 14th century which was when the phrase originated according to some, the phrase was just ‘Jack of all trades’ and wasn’t a derogatory term as at that time, knowing a lot was actually a big deal. Such people were called ‘polymaths’. For example, Leonardo Vinci (Read List of Polymaths for more)Later it started getting used as a derogatory term with the addition ‘Jack of all trades, but master of none’ but according to others, the saying was actually ‘A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one Continue ReadingThis is actually an interesting topic.

But my personal belief is that this term has been swaying with the society’s perception of what’s good and what’s not. In the 14th century, someone who knew a lot of things, (Polymaths) were revered. And during the industrial revolution, until now, the same people have been frowned upon and people who specialize in something are taken into high regard. And now, I can see that times are changing where most companies prefer someone who’s good or even average at quite a lot of things rather than specializing in just one because they get more work done and they need to pay them lesser. I think the flux is going to change towards this. For more reading, you can also look into the term multipotentialite‘ a new term coined to describe similar people.

To give you a sense of how big YoTube is, sample this – 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute! And that is exactly why brands & content creators are adopting YouTube as one of their main marketing mediums to engage with their customers and users. Interesting facts: About 52% of viewers arrive at a YouTube video by searching within the platform and by clicking on the ‘Related Videos’ section. And hene; channels and videos can be made more discoverable by using proper titles, tags, descriptions and thumbnail images. Another important metric which helps videos climb up in rankings is ‘Watch Time’ which is the time duration of a video’s viewing session. Higher the Watch Time, better is the search result ranking. Hence, it is imperative that the content of the video is interesting AND relevant for the target audience, resulting in higher Watch Time. Here are some useful tips to get more organic views for your YouTube video: Optimize your metadata Metadata in YouTube refers to information about your video that includes the title, description, tags, category, thumbnail, subtitles and annotations. This metadata can help the audience to discover your videos on YouTube effectively. The chances of your video getting clicked in the search results increases exponentially if the thumbnail image preview of the video is relevant to the title. Also, you should ensure that the metadata contains keywords which correlate with the content of the video. Many a time, channel owners use the wrong/irrelevant thumbnail image or use unrelated keywords in the metadata resulting in lesser views. Pointers regarding metadata that can increase the searchability of a video: Always use short and concise titles for the video. Also ensure that only relevant keywords are used in it.Use an accurate description of the video in one to three concise sentences. Try to use at least one keyword of the title in the description.Videos with relevant high quality thumbnail image previews always drive better click rates.Observe how titles and descriptions appear in search results, suggested videos, What to Watch, etc. Shorter titles often work better because long titles are cut off on most devices. Also, clear and concise descriptions add context to the video when it appears in search results.Upload subtitles and closed captions for your videos. These files are indexed and thus broaden your audience to non-native language speakers and viewers who are deaf and hard of hearing.Optimize ‘Watch Time’ Watch Time is an important metric used in YouTube’s search ranking algorithm. The algorithm gives higher priority to videos that have a longer overall viewing session than the ones that receive more clicks. Pointers that can help increase the watch time of a video: Use annotations in the video and link them to popular or relevant videos in the channel to make it easier for viewers to continue watching.Encourage the audience to like, comment & share the videos so that they stay within the YouTube environment.Use playlists to club similar videos in a single place.Use Audience Analytics View report to understand the performance of a video.The report shows the number of videos which have lower views and view-through rates, and indicates which videos are successful at keeping viewers consumed. This helps you get an overall idea about the type of content that drives more watch time and you can plan for similar type of videos in the future. There are some other factors that also matters a lot: 1. Study the analytics. 2. Thumbnails stand out from the crowd. 3. Announcements & Freebies. 4. Use your Playlist to your advantage. 5. Keep the beginnings short and sweet. #1: Your Titles Are Worth Their Weight in Gold  What is your video about?  If you have ANY video titled “About Us” or “My First Video” or WORSE:  “Mov00001.mp4″  You’re NOT doing yourself any favors.  Take the time to choose the correct KEYWORD PHRASE and add it to your title.  Make sure it is a RELEVANT keyword that you know your audience is ACTUALLY searching for when they go to YouTube & Google. #2: Add a “James Wedmore-Approved” Description? YouTube didn’t give you a video description box so you could leave it empty.  Here are the three most-essential elements you need in your description for  Continue Reading#1: Your Titles Are Worth Their Weight in Gold  What is your video about?  If you have ANY video titled “About Us” or “My First Video” or WORSE:  “Mov00001.mp4″  You’re NOT doing yourself any favors.  Take the time to choose the correct KEYWORD PHRASE and add it to your title.  Make sure it is a RELEVANT keyword that you know your audience is ACTUALLY searching for when they go to YouTube & Google. #2: Add a “James Wedmore-Approved” Description? YouTube didn’t give you a video description box so you could leave it empty.  Here are the three most-essential elements you need in your description for every video (past and present!) a. Your Keyword Phrase (at the beginning of the description) b. Your URL (where do you want to send your viewers) c. A “Mini-Blog Post” describing the contents of your video #3: Upload/Sync Your Transcript Here’s something to think about: Google “listens” to your video before a single person ever sees it! What? Google has become very good at indexing your video, figuring out what your video is about, by listening to what you are saying in your video. You may have seen my example before where I actually said, “I’m passionate about kettlebells” in one of my videos and ended up getting ranked for that phrase – even though I never used those words anywhere else in my Video SEO efforts. You can capitalize on this by creating and uploading a full transcript of your video. #4: Add Your Custom Thumbnail Grab the attention of folks as they scan through the YouTube search results with a great thumbnail! Choosing the right picture and adding some text can create a response just like a great magazine cover. You can literally stop viewers in their tracks and encourage them to choose your video over your competitors, boost YouTube views, and increase your customer engagement, just by choosing the right picture for your thumbnail.  Here’s how to do this quickly and easily… Tip #5: Add The Subscribe Annotation YouTube likes channels that post regularly and have more subscribers…plain and simple.  I get more views because I have more subscribers.  Here is one super simple way to get more subscribers: ask!  On every video, take 30 seconds and add a Subscribe Annotation that asks your viewers to become subscribers.  To learn how to do this EXACTLY how I do it, watch the tutorial below… Tip #6: Add Your External Link Annotation    YouTube is a Traffic Source.  If done properly, you can see +30% of your viewers transfer into REAL targeted traffic to your website or blog!  One of the BEST ways to boost this conversion number is to add an external link annotation to each of your videos.  When you give your Call to Action, simply add an annotation that people can click on so they can hop on over to YOUR website and get the heck off of YouTube!   Tip #7: Add Your Subscribe Watermark I love this one.  Using a super-cool function called InVideo Programming, you can add a branded watermark to all of your videos with a click of a button.  Now when users click on this watermark, they can subscribe to your channel or watch your latest video with ease!  This is a great future…use it!  Seriously…it takes 15 seconds to set up!  Don’t believe me?  Tip #8: Using Your Blog to Boost YouTube Views Your blog is the central hub of your online business. While there are many platforms to build your business (YouTube being one of the more popular ones for building your social media authority), you don’t own many of those platforms. This isn’t a problem because you want to LEVERAGE their reach and authority. However, you also want to OWN your main hub because you have more control over it. Sites like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter can (and do) change their rules all of the time. Mostly for better because they want to keep people come back to their site. However, building up your own property, your blog, and embedding your videos on that site, allows you to have more tools to serve your customers, build your list, and build your business. They are not working against each other…they work together. That’s why you should include a backlink in each of your blogposts pointing back to the URL of your YouTube video.",2021-03-05T09:44:52.615Z,"How can I get more views on my YouTube videos? ",Quora

Which also should have minimum 6C/12T and lithography of maximum of 14nm (Lower is better). Currently Intel has 10nm and AMD has 7nm technology. There are a couple of answers answers to this question depending on what you are using the CPU for, whether you are talking in GHz or in total CPU performance. So I give 4 processors, two from AMD and two from Intel.  The Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX wins in total performance for AMD. This processor has an amazing 32 cores all running at 3GHz.

However when I'm working on a film (or tv show), I will first correct the footage if it needs it, and then I will grade the footage according to the vision of the DP and director. Grading the footage may indeed go outside of the bounds of the broadcast range of luminance signals, and will often involve adjusting the color cast of a scene to heighten the drama or enhance a particular mood. And you can add subtle vignettes, make certain individual colors pop, play with the contrast - the list is truly endless.  So while the two phrases may often be conflated in the industry, I think there is a big difference between the two (and usually in how much you pay the person doing it). I believe you use the same tools for both; however, color grading typically refers to changing the colors to meet the director's intend; that is, the original colors are not necessarily ""wrong,"" but you change the colors to change the ""mood"" of the film. Color correction typically refers to ""fixing"" colors (due to film aging, bad lighting, etc.).",2021-03-05T09:47:34.013Z,"What is the difference between Color Correction and Color Grading? ",Quora

The doctor who was doing his duty and she started asking him foolish and illogical questions. She began asking the statistics like death toll of children on that day that too in front of the relatives of the children. These remarks by a journalist of a famous news channel does not makes sense. Along with treating the ailing, a doctor needs to boost up the morale of the patients and relatives. The stress level of staff inside a hospital needs to be controlled otherwise the staff and doctors may also face mental breakdown. Anjana Om Kashyap was being highly insensitive here and the irony is that she was the one accusing the doctor for not being sensitive towards the lives of children. The tone and the arrogance with which she talked was highly unprofessional. The job of a news reporter is to report the news, not to start giving out orders or start creating ruckus inside an ICU. The video thumbnail is also misleading the viewers.  The doctor should file a defamation case aginst her if he can. These kind of senseless thumbnails is not expected from a news channel. I have attached the link for the whole “interview” below. Give it a watch too. अस्पताल के अंदर बच्चों का डॉक्टर कितना रख रहे हैं ख्याल EXCLUSIVE । NEWSTAK Another video of her debating with a JDU spokes person came out (link attached below). Even in that, she was quite unprofessional. You don’t debate with a person by putting him on mute and continuing your rant. This shows that the Indian media is now crippled and just a rat race is going on between news channels. The channels are just ignoring their duty of providing news to the citizens. बच्चों की मौत पर जेडीयू प्रवक्ता की बेतुकी बातों पर एंकर अंजना ओम कश्यप दिखाया आईना Also, when IAF’s Wing Commander Abhinandan was captured in the Pakistani territory, it was Indian media which kept telecasting silly reports and gave out many details in public which even Wing Commander chose not to disclose. And gradually, this lack of professionalism by the media is increasing. Below is the link for the video released by a doctor in reply to the TRP stunt by AajTak. Worth giving a watch. A YOUNG Doctor's Reply to Anjuna Ji | Young Doctor | #aajtok #doctors There is another video in which the reporter was reporting that due to the shortage of beds in ICU of SKMCH, the ward in which prisoners and those under trial are kept for treatment was to be used for the ailing children. This also raises the issue of privacy of the under trials as the footage was telecasted on their channels. This hinders their right for privacy. अंजना ओम कश्यप ने दिखाई अस्पताल की सच्चाई, तब खुली अस्पताल प्रशासन की नींद Dear Indian media, please see all the pros and cons of your actions before jumping into the rat race for TRP.

And some people are inquisitive about ""How many""? And when they are told that more than a hundred children have perished to this illness, they go ""OH FU*K SHITTTTT....."", followed by uncountable expletives dedicated to the authorities, mainstream media and the social media heroes. Had it been just 30-40 deaths, no one would have cared. It has sort of becoming normal for us to react sharply only after death toll grows too big to digest.  I saw that clip. Anjana was inside the ICU obstructing the treatment by heckling the nurses and harassing that poor doctor. Honestly, I cringed at the scene. Unfortunately, I had been to the ICU (and lost him), I am aware and afraid of that eerie silence that place contains. But this ICU was so chaotic, I fumbled at the mere imagination of this scene. And there she was asking ""How many died?"" I wonder, how could one be so insensitive? I want to reserve by words on Anjana's because this site doesn't permit that kind of language or the tone. Couple of thoughts that I want to accumulate here. Was she permitted to the ICU? If not, she should be booked, made an example of.Aaj-Tak should get rid of her.Strict guidelines for the reporting should be applied at such a scene, those acting ""holier than thou"" should be held accountable.This is what I wrote to her on twitter. “You should be ashamed that you chose to yell at the Doctor, who was not personally responsible for the lack of facilities at the centre. He is overburdened can't you see? You should be asking this question to the right people, but to them you go soft understandably. Stop insulting honest people for your TRP.”[1] Footnotes[1] Saket Kumar on Twitter It is her inherent behaviour….if you see her previous videos she talks as if she owns the person.

The combination of temperature and humidity is proving lethal here for children. Toxin in litchi is second. Treatment does not require some costly medicine…instead of 5% dextrose, doctors need 10% Dextrose which administration failed to supply.

If there is no bed in hospital blame the god damn DM. Mostly these kids are malnourished one, why is that ? who is responsible for this state of children? DOCTORS? Mortality rate is very high in such cases…which left us the best option PREVENTION : preparedness : lackingAwareness programme : Not conducted this year ( because of election)Time lapse in reaching Hospitals.Healthcare Infrastructure : clearly visible not sufficient. Number of doctors and all essential medicine should be available at this season when it is already known about fatality of condition.Journalist of her stature fails to recognise root of cause. they just google the disease condition and start questioning the doctors. TRP HUNGRY she was and that’s what she gets now. ABOUT THE CONDITION: ( QUOTING A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN ARTICLE FORM THE HINDU: “Averting deaths in Muzaffarpur” by T. Jacob John THOERY 1 First of all you need to understand how our body maintain constant blood glucose level even when it is not supplied from diet ( fasting period) We all have some glycogen storage in liver which converted into glucose during fasting state: Malnourished children have less or no storage because of obvious reasons ( that is why 2–10 years of age malnourished children are affected only and not the children from well-to-do family) when all the glycogen utilised body start the process of making glucose from other sources like fat and proteins ( Gluconeogenesis) There is this chemical ( Methylene cyclopropyl alanine: MCA) present inside litchi pulp which block this process and other intermediate product of this process start accumulating. So firstly there is NO GLUCOSE produced and secondly some other product which are toxic to brain starts accumulating. This leads to Hypoglycemia (Glucose level below normal limits) Glucose is the primary fuel for brain lacking which and accumulating amino acid in blood, produces symptoms of the disease: vomiting, abnormal movements, semi-conscious, and convulsion which usually starts between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. TREATMENT: Provide glucose ASAPBlock the production of accumulation of amino acid ASAP10 or 20% dextrose is recommended as it quickly increases blood glucose level and increases INSULIN level which block the process of new glucose formation from fats and thus those toxic intermediate amino acids. THEORY 2 HEAT STROKE: Temp above 38 degree celsius and humidity >50% were directly related to severity of the endemic. In other northern areas when night temperature usually fall but here because of humidity condition get worse during night, makes it difficult for children to acclimatise.

So I usually pull files down, use my favorite editor, and FTP the files back up. Since that’s not an option on the Chromebook, I usually just use the online editor in CPanel. That works surprisingly well for most edits and content writing. CPanel is also good for using PHPMyAdmin to talk to the database. If I need to SSH into another machine, I can’t really do that directly from the Chromebook (The local file system is hidden making it impossible to get into AWS). But I can SSH into another machine on my network, and use that as a bridge to SSH into other machines. And with that I can work 100% The bottom line is that with a few extra steps, you can work 100% on a Chromebook.

Perhaps he or she has a video monitor in the kitchen where real images are shown.  At Gisteo (www.gisteo.com), we recently developed a series fire safety series of six videos with an animated spokesperson for a smoke detector company- one of which was centered around the kitchen:     Some advantages to this approach, beside costing a fraction of what live action videos would cost: -The ability to mold a fun, dynamic character with plenty of humor and quirks if necessary-No need to create a physical set or hire a producer, etc.  -Doing something that nobody else in your category is probably doing-Once the look and ""set"" for the character is established, economies of scale are established and subsequent videos are produced in less time. -Zero travel. Ever. For more on Gisteo and the power of talking characters, here's our own character to tell you more about what we do: I have no experience in shooting videos of cooking, but I can say to you what I see in good YouTube channels and TV programs here in Brazil: First of all: get a good set of equipments:- 2+ cameras: you can use only one, if you know how to make a good editing, but its always nice to show another angle of the proccess at the same time.

Try using a main camera to get you and the table you're working, and a GoPro fixed in the table or near the stove to show the proccess in a closer perspective.- A good set of lights: its not an obligation to buy professional equipment, but you should find something that makes you and your friends look good and professional. It can be natural light or the standard set of lamp that you have in your house. Choose a good specific moment of the day to do the shooting.- Microphones: dont trust the microphone that your camera has, because it's never as good as a pro mike, you guys will sound much better.- Tripod: don't need to say anything, it makes all the difference. If you have no space for a tripod, try getting a support that has suckers to fasten it in a wall, as long as your camera gets stable. Then try making a professional script, with everything you want to say or do during the video, remember that when you're dealing with food there's no room for mistakes, or you might have done everything in vain. Cleaning and organizing the kitchen before you do the shooting is essential, don't even think of making a video in a dirty kitchen, or with objects that can take the focus of the audience. However, you should have some decoration that will work as a signature of your blog, like a mascot or something, to make your videos look familiar to them in case you record in different places. But it also looks good if you never change places. After all of that, try cooking the same recipe for at least 3 or 4 times before recording, because you might have problems at the first try. Also make some samples before shooting, of how the recipe should look like at the end of every part of it, and use them to guide the audience. Make shure everyone knows what you're doing, and start to advertise! ps: sorry for my bad english, it's not my mother language. :) Creating a food/cooking video is a great idea!

But how does your company know what roles you need? How do you choose specialists to create the content that complements your company’s overall mission, business plan and revenue goals? Here’s a shortlist of the key roles integral for a company content marketing team. Content writers/Journalists Content creators are essential to your team. These pros will write blog posts, landing pages copy, video descriptions, branded articles, product summaries and more. Some of today’s writers are better suited for blogging; others excel at long-form branded articles. Still others with a sales/marketing side can write white papers and case studies for your industry. Content writers come from a variety of backgrounds, some from traditional editorial/publishing roles, and others from PR/marketing/sales roles. Video Producers Over 80% of marketers polled in a recent survey noted that their team had produced a marketing video in the last 12 months. And as increasing video growth is expected in 2016, more dollars will be put forth by SMBs and enterprise companies to create compelling video projects. Your team needs a video producer. This specialist will be comfortable behind the camera, and know how to frame, shoot and capture good video experiences. Your video producers should know what works well on various platforms, like Facebook, YouTube, Vine, Snapchat and others. Ideally, this pro will also be a top-notch video editor, having worked with multiple video-editing software packages as well. Social Media Promoters The best kind of social media promoter for your content team is the person who has a deep understanding of social media, and can manage work into hashtag searches and influencers in your business area. The social media promoter needs to work hand in hand with the content creators, sharing the same marketing speak for your brand. This person should also have a strong handle on social media measurement, understand analytics across networks and be able to stay on message. Visual Creators If you choose to create visual and designed content, a visual creator is a must-have. Creating amazing infographics, graphic ads, company designs, logos and web landing pages takes time and skill. Having a talented graphic design specialist who can work collaboratively with the editorial/research team and the video content producers will bring a strong balance to your content creation team. Content Director/Chief Editor Overseeing the content team activities is a large task, and is best filled by someone with experience in some or all of the areas noted above. The content (or in some cases, editorial) director needs good communication and organizational skills. It’s a big plus if the person is a great writer and editor, too! The Content Director should have the ability to laser in on all the content being created and ensure it’s in line with a company’s mission, business plan and revenue goals. Understanding the content creation goals that the company wants to achieve is a good first step. Bringing in great freelance writers, video producers, social media pros and others to complement the team skills and execute the content strategy can then follow smoothly. At their core, a marketing team must have passion and be willing to get innovative with their marketing efforts. Because the market is always evolving either because of new technology or a pandemic like the one we’re facing- marketers have to be people who are willing to try out new things, write the right kind of marketing messages, test and analyse consistently, find out what works, and be in line with the business’ overall vision. There are two golden rules that marketing teams must follow for guaranteed success:  Continuous collaboration with sales and IT departments.See rule #1.",2021-03-05T09:56:18.796Z,"What are factors that contribute to a highly successful marketing team?

Most classified ads include many different jobs. An example of a classified ad site is Craigslist. This website publishes all types of online classified ads. Note: Be cautious when answering a classified ad. If the employer or the client wants to meet, always choose a public location. 3. Online job market Simply not just a list of jobs, the online job market is a list of jobs that are done professionally. An example of this type of site is EnvatoStudio.

Also, if you are looking for freelancing positions then I would recommend UpWork and if you are looking for remote working options then check out WeWorkRemotely. There is however a huge issue with online job portals in general - there is just too much noise. As a job seeker, it is nearly impossible to determine whether a job is a good fit for you. A lot of time is wasted reading through job descriptions (that don’t say much), customizing your resumes/cover letters to match keywords in job descriptions and submitting as many applications as you have time to customize. As a result of this system, employers receive way too many applications and therefore do not have the time to carefully look through each applicant. Currently, employers spend on average 6 seconds reading through an application. In this system, good candidates obviously fall through the cracks and some who are good fits don’t even apply (they miss the job posting all together). Our current hiring system makes it virtually impossible for candidates and employers who are best fits for one another to find each other. This is a problem that DreamHire.io is solving. DreamHire matches job seekers to employer’s hiring needs based on skills, experiences, personality fit, career goals and more. Rather than having to apply to hundreds of jobs blindly, a job seeker on DreamHire only has to apply to their top recommended jobs to get interview requests (because they are good fits!). There is also no need to manually customize each application. The platform will rearrange your profile according to the employer’s needs and you will only ever have to answer questions that employers have specified - no more need for cover letters. Currently, there is no easy way to find jobs online but at DreamHire, we’re working on changing that! You have to qualify to do online jobs just like offline jobs. No one just gives you a job.

A high quality video will be close to around $6,000 upwards.  All-in time spent, including scripting, production, sound, motion graphics can be around 150 hours plus filming.

How complex the planning/shooting/editing will be, how many out of pocket expenses you will incur, how long the project will take, what calibre of equipment required and how much time fiddling around with client meetings you may need to deal with. It also depends on your relationship with the company. I tend to split videos into four broad categories with budgets raising geometrically between each category. Disposable: a quick thing, short term product demo, event or placeholder video. The video will be seen only a few times in a limited time window. Long term: product video, small company introduction or training video to be accessible through the companies website. Marketing: a higher tier quality level, video may be on line and played at conferences, sales events Commercial: top level and highest polish designed for broad distribution. A disposable three minute event video for a small company by an outside freelancer with limited experience could be anywhere from $500-$2000 But really it depends on so many variables that each quote has to be estimated on a per video basis. .You never know what a company is expecting to pay unless they do videos all the time. When coming up with a quote I generate two numbers: The highest number I can create for the project. A number so high they would feel ripped off and never bring me back.A number so low that I would feel used , ripped off and would never want to work with them again.Average those two numbers. You are likely (hopefully) now in the ballpark. Now finesse that number further by adding and subtracting factors: Is it an exciting project that you really really want to do but know they don’t have a lot of money = reduce your priceIt is going to be a horrible rushed project with lots of pain = increaseThe project could lead to other interesting work = reduceYou are worried that the company won’t pay or you will end up in a time sucking vortex = increaseAdd in every contributing factor that you can think of to shift your base number up and down. Pitch that number and see what happens. They will likely tell you if you are too high. If they choose somebody else for lower that’s OK. If you are much lower than they expect somebody else might get the gig based on a higher caliber video. In any case come up with a number that you feel is fair for what services you can bring to the table, send it in and stand back and see if it flies, catches fire or crashes.",2021-03-05T09:59:47.222Z,"How much should one charge for a high quality 2 min video for a restaurant?

Even with 64 GB sometimes my system gets sluggish with several dozen browser tabs open, especially if they are media intensive or have a lot of scripts. Extra memory will be used by the operating system to cache frequently used files. Have you ever noticed that when you first do a file search, it takes forever, but subsequent searches are very fast? That’s because the computer indexes all the files and holds them in memory for a while. And when a program reads files from the hard drive they are cached in memory, so if you need to re-read them it is much faster. Memory these days is “virtual” so you never really run out. If you have a browser tab open and you haven’t looked at it for two days, when the computer runs short on memory it saves that tab to a temp file on disk. Five days later when you wonder what that tab was and click on it, the computer loads it back from disk and it pops right up. But it wasn’t using memory the whole time. This method is called “swapping” and is done automatically by your OS. Virtual Memory swapping is how you can use 8 GB of RAM to run 40 GB of applications and data. Normally it’s so fast you barely notice, and you feel like 8 GB is all anyone would ever need, because your experience is that you never run out. But sometimes the computer memory gets so tight that it starts swapping constantly. For example if you have 8 GB and a program wants 10 GB, it has to constantly swap parts of itself in and out of virtual memory. It won’t crash but it will slow to an absolute crawl… you might even think it’s frozen. It’s not, it’s just running very slowly. It might take 5 minutes to register a mouse click, but it eventually will. If you get into this state and have a large memory-hog program running (like Chrome) you can usually close it (it will take a long time to get it closed) but at soon as it quits the computer instantly returns to it’s usual snappy self. That is a classic sign of too little memory. (On older mechanical drives, you could hear them furiously working, leading to the term “disk thrashing.”) Most people experience this occasionally and a reboot fixes it. If it happens frequently you’ll want more memory so that the computer needs to swap less often. I work in software development. When building a large software project you can easily run out of memory. At a previous employer I used to regularly run my 16 GB dev machine out of memory so that it became unresponsive. Our build required both Linux (and Windows in a VM) running at the same time, with several docker containers, databases, compilers and other things. One docker image wanted 10 GB all by itself. I eventually figured out what process was eating it up by watching a memory monitor, and added enough virtual memory to prevent the lockup, but it still swapped and ran pretty slowly. Presently my office dev machine has 16 GB. It is adequate for my current workload. I run Windows with Linux in a VM and am able to get my tasks done. Our software stack and build is fairly lightweight. I don’t watch movies or play games on that machine, and I am careful not to get too crazy with Chrome tabs., but I still occasionally push it to its limit. But back to gaming: there was no way around the Cities: Skylines problem. I had added a bunch of new mods, a few too many as it turned out. I watched a memory monitor as I started the game on a 32GB machine, and the process grew to about 31 GB and then froze, unable to continue. That meant that every other process on the computer had been swapped out to make room for a single program to have ALL the memory and it still wasn’t enough. Upgrading to 64 GB solved the problem. It is massive overkill, since I doubt I use more than about 40 GB at any time, but I love never having to worry about swapping or running out. (Amazingly, even after the upgrade I’ve run short once or twice. I tend to keep a LOT of browser tabs open.) Most people who are not developers, gamers, or working with large media will never come near that much memory usage. When asked for recommendations these days my stock recommendation is 16 GB. If you can’t afford that and will only use it for basic tasks like email and word processing, then 8 GB is acceptable — but only if it is user-expandable to at least 12 or 16. You never know when you’re going to want to run a new program that takes a bit more. Depends on the sort of work you do, the amount of data and how much of it needs to be available for processing at any one time. Most games don’t really require more than 8. For stuff like web browsing, email, online messaging, social media, video watching, music playing, word processing, spreadsheets, even minor image editing, 4 is probably more than enough (on some operating systems even just 1GB or less is sufficient for these). It’s usually when you start creating stuff instead of consuming it when RAM gets used a lot more. That’s because viewing something tends to mean you don’t need all th Continue ReadingDepends on the sort of work you do, the amount of data and how much of it needs to be available for processing at any one time. Most games don’t really require more than 8. For stuff like web browsing, email, online messaging, social media, video watching, music playing, word processing, spreadsheets, even minor image editing, 4 is probably more than enough (on some operating systems even just 1GB or less is sufficient for these). It’s usually when you start creating stuff instead of consuming it when RAM gets used a lot more. That’s because viewing something tends to mean you don’t need all the data at once, but editing it very often does. E.g. making high resolution pictures in something like PhotoShop / Gimp. Creating animated movies, stitching together video recordings and special effects. Modelling 3d shapes. Technical drawing. Etc. In these cases it’s nothing strange to see 16, 24, 32, 64, 128, 256 GB, etc. being consumed. It depends on the size of the content. As sample, I’ve been working in building architecture for nearly 3 decades now. My very first CAD workstation had 4MB of RAM when other computers barely scraped the 640 kB barrier - this was only for 2D technical drawing work. My current workstation has 64GB and I run out of RAM at least once a month on this, here I’m modelling a complete building in 3d and extracting 2d technical views from that model. For something like a house it’s pretty rare to use more than 8GB, but something like a hotel can easily surpass 30GB used, add some extra details like cornices / skirtings / door frames / etc. and it quickly escalates to 100s of GB used. Another place I tend to use a lot of RAM is when running virtual machines while testing some programs I write. Open two or three VMs on the same machine and you can easily be using 16GB at once. And then of course, if you don’t just mean a personal computing device, but also servers, many permanently running processes on one server could use a huge amount of RAM. E.g. if you just have a NAS box with ZFS file system, it’s recommended to have at least 1GB of RAM per 1TB of storage - I’ve seen some NAS boxes with 20 to 30 TB of storage before. And that’s on the low end of server scales, when you start looking at database / web servers, SaaS / Virtual, etc. such memory requirements can very easily go up to the TB range instead of just GBs, especially if they’re serving 1000’s to millions of concurrent users.

So, if Circuit Shantitiwn sells desktops with 16GB of RAM, my machine will have 32GB. Last month, I built a new machine recycling some parts from my old one (Case, DVD, Fans and Video Card) and I was very careful to choose a Motherboard that would let me easily add RAM. So I started with 64GB on board, and I have 2 empty slots for an extra 64GB.  Why RAM? Well, Processor speed and multi-threading are important, but if you work, like I do, with multiple clients, it’s not unusual for me to have 3 or 4 instances of Vivaldi (a chrome clone) with multiple tabs each.Chrome itself3 or 4 Adobe programs for Video or photographyA Hyper-V Windows 10 Virtual Machine, itself sporting several browsers and dedicated software and consuming around 6 to 8GB (I have a client that I have to run in a VM and through a VPN)Another VM with UbuntuMS Word or Excel or bothThis or that.That takes RAM. Lots of RAM, and I don’t even do that much video or 3D rendering. There are some tasks that are RAM hungry, but even more run of the mill programs, like Chrome, really tax your RAM consumption.

This would be a great laptop if it was positioned at the $1,300 starting price of the old MacBook Pros, though the 12-inch MacBook might need to move downmarket a bit to make room for it. At its current price, the $1,499 Pro feels like a laptop with a new design that just happens to be missing a bunch of the features that make the new design worthwhile.  The good Rock-solid design that looks and feels great. Thunderbolt 3 is a tremendously versatile port, and Apple will benefit from increased adoption in the wider PC industry. Low-travel keyboard still isn't for everyone, but it's a marked improvement over the first-generation version in the MacBook. Much-improved integrated GPU performance, which will help if you're trying to drive a 4K or 5K display. Stellar battery life under light-to-medium use, battery life comparable to the 2015 MBPs under heavy use. Impressive speakers for a 13-inch laptop.  The bad Limited number of ports, limited port selection, and need for dongles will be inconvenient, especially at first. Extremely limited repairability and upgradeability. Intel's CPU speed increases in the last few years have been discouraging. Occasional problems with palm rejection in the new, larger trackpad.

Don’t get me started on the track pad. No windows offering comes close to the massive and precise force touch track pad. Although Windows laptops (or ultrabooks) have caught up in terms of battery life, Macbook’s are still highly strong footed in the reliability department. I have been using my Macbook Pro 13″ Touchbar edition since 2017, and would trade it for nothing else, except maybe another Macbook Pro. It’s not that the Macbook experience is completely bug-free and mine still has that quirky butterfly mechanism. But, I have opted to live with it. The Siri button too on the touch bar isn’t very helpful and mis-presses are common. But, when it comes to the overall experience package, nothing beats a trendy aluminium unibody Macbook.

What’s that lump doing in the side of my abdominal wall??? First thing I thought of was a hernia through the diaphragm — rare, but possible. The lump WAS strange — it was moving around as I changed position, it wasn’t always painful, and sometimes it disappeared entirely. So, I went to my MD, who of course called for the magic MRI . The results came back: two 2.5 cm masses below the diaphragm, “suggestive of lymphoma”. What, I asked myself, is lymphoma??? Google gets a workout, I find out: it’s one of the 3 major blood cancers — 80% curable with chemotherapy. Fast forward: biopsy, positive diagnosis, bone marrow biopsy to figure out what Stage it’s at, and - most importantly — a request for a second opinion from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in Manhattan. The local oncologist grew impatient, and finally insistent, that I start the treatment immediately, and stop waiting for the second opinion. He scheduled me for insertion of the “port” (a piece of plastic under the skin into which they pipe the chemo drugs) the next Monday, with chemo to start immediately thereafter. I was looking at 6–9 months of chemo hell, with a mean life expectancy thereafter of 7 years, IF the chemo worked. {Actually, most people were eventually succumbing to a weakened existence because of the side effects of the chemo…Oh joy.} Two days before the port insertion, I got the call from MSKCC. Could I come in for a workup the next day? Foolish question: I flew in on a magic carpet and avoided all the traffic on the GW Bridge! The doctors at MSKCC were top-notch. They did another physical exam, reviewed all my records, then we had a consultation. The result? YES, the diagnosis of Stage I non-Hodgkins lymphoma was correct. YES, it was historically treated with intensive chemo to knock it out early. HOWEVER: New models (developed, coincidentally, at MSKCC), now showed that lymphoma lingers at Stage I for awhile, then transitions to Stage II, going through a rapid growth phase. During this rapid growth, the cancerous cells get “hungry”, and absorb the medicine more thoroughly. Instead of carpet-bombing the cells, they are more specifically targeted, with much higher success rates and lower side effects. The result: MSKCC, while confirming the diagnosis, recommended that I WAIT until the disease had begun transitioning to Stage II, which we could determine through semi-annual monitoring by an oncologist. Chemo could be deferred until that time. I once again mounted my magic carpet, flew back to my previous oncologist, and shared the good news. He was disappointed, but mumbled some cursory good wishes — I had just cost him some $300,000 in revenue! I then changed my personal managing oncologist to one of the MSKCC staffers, whom I still see. TEN years later — not seven — there has still been no transition (knock wood). I have almost no symptoms of lymphoma, and the doctors have reduced my visits to once a year. In fact, they have begun to use the word “remission” in my presence. I’m a bleedin’ medical miracle, I am!!!! The real miracle though, is that one year later my wife suffered a major stroke, and lost much of her gross motor coordination on her left side. She went through a difficult rehabilitation, lasting close to a year, and then a re-adaptation to home, requiring me to help her, plus lead my family, as we went through all the stages of caretaking adjustments. I often think: was I spared for just this reason? As my wife and I grow old together, we are still dependent on each other, physically and emotionally, and our futures are inextricably entwined…as it was intended 46 years ago. The vows said “for better or for worse”. We got both in spades. EDIT I scribbled this tale two nights ago in the middle of a Quora session where I wrote about five answers.

I still recall his tech savviness by the way he comfortably used to face time his mom during office hours even when he was about 5. Life was lovely for the family and god willing the kid was doing very well 😊😊 Now one fine day she tells me something that leaves me flabbergasted🙄🙄🙄 The kid coincidentally accompanied his ageing grandfather to an ophthalmologist (Obviously for grandpa’s routine checkup). The kid was getting restless while the doc examined his grandpa. Just to keep him engaged one of the optometrist there made him sit for a visual acuity test(The one where we read letters from a distance). THE BOY HAD ABSOLUTELY NEGLIGIBLE VISION IN HIS LEFT EYE😮😮 The parents rushed to the same doc asking that the kid had wonderful gross and fine motor skills and he can catch a ball with absolute precision, can read minutest of texts, can do WhatsApp, can handle an I Phone, is excellent at academics. HOW THE F**K ON THIS EARTH IS THIS POSSIBLE ????? The Doc explained, the kid was born with this condition and he has seen this world with a single eye only. His brain doesn’t know the concept of vision through both the eyes. His right eye has become so dominant and efficient that he doesn’t require the left one. I still cant imagine how this fact could be hidden for 7 long years and that too from parents who are extremely well educated and concerned about every small nuance which concerns their KID. I mean human body is really really strange. On a good note, the doc has prescribed exercises and glasses till the age of 18 after which the boy can possibly have a Laser surgery.

But in the 4th month (the most peak time of our studies as main subjects were being taught). I suffered from fever for days (on and off) . Many of my friends were diagnosed with dengue. On the 5th day I was felt so weak and afraid due to the pending studies that I literally had tears while taking to my father on phone though I didn't let him recognize my pain. He somehow knew that I needed motivation so he said “you are going to get up tomorrow without any fever, you are going to feel normal tomorrow and go to the coaching, MARK MY WORDS! “ NEXT MORNING I FELT REALLY BETTER AND WENT TO THE CLASS. It was a miracle for me. Now the fear of dengue was reduced. After one week my left lung used to pain a bit when I inhaled or exhaled deep. This pain was similar to the mild discomfort that we experience when we do exercise after many months and our lungs feel heavy/tired of expanding and contracting due to heavy breathing after such a long time. I patiently waited for the the pain to reduce but it increased day by day and was restricting my breathing capacity. AFTER 4 DAYS MY CHEST PAIN WAS SO SEVERE THAT I BOOKED A FLIGHT FOR NEXT MORNING TO MUMBAI (doctors in hyderabad had given a false report to one of my friend so I couldn't trust them) But as soon as I got up next morning my Chest pain was reduced by 90%.I still went to Mumbai and after the test reports every thing was normal. I wasn't happy nor sad as it was like someone was playing games with me. 1 month had been passed because of these things which created a lot of stress afterwards and there after it was different story. I am an active person who plays sports regularly right from childhood but these things still happened to me and hence can happen to anybody.

When I was pulled over, the cop saw I wasn’t doing great (and I TOTALLY shouldn’t have been driving, btw. beside the point.), and took me to the police station, had me hang out with the officers and fed me. Super cool guy. Explained all the awesome sh!t in the car, let me explore the back seat (no way I was sitting in there - how often is it cleaned vs bled on/thrown up on? not great odds.), drove me back to my car and offered to drive me home or follow me. I was pulled over one time and bet the officer he couldn’t guess my profession for the ticket. He couldn’t, no ticket - and I sent in a letter to his captain telling him how kind and helpful the officer was (no mention of bet). Ok, I’ve been pulled over a few times, and I generally get out of tickets. I’m not a great rule follower by nature, but I work hard not to harm others (probably be less work to just follow the rules, but I never said I was an intelligent creature). I’m a white-looking female (not white, but it does matter that I’m so fair), I’m clearly not without funds, I’m never aggressive or scared, and these invariably male (never had a female officer) officers are generally very kind and accommodating, and usually pretty funny. I respect the fact that they put themselves in harms way - even how they park their cars when pulling over in order to get hit themselves rather than anyone hitting your car. But. The US has a SERIOUS problem when it comes to economic and ethnicity divides and law enforcement. Laws are enforced more harshly against you the lower down the economic pole you are, and if you are not white or don’t look white. I’m not entirely certain that gender plays an issue (it probably does), but these other two issues are definitely a factor. Officers are not well integrated into communities, and their training focuses far more on intervention than prevention. It’s a major systemic problem, one that is shared in interesting ways with teachers: it’s a shitty system, and it’s tough to navigate what is constantly being asked of them with the lack of training, generally poor resources, and overarching combination of bravado, distrust and fear. A system developed during the industrial revolution is not aging well in modern society, and officers and communities are stuck in roles that don’t allow for error and negotiation. So, in the UK, the overarching fear and distrust seem not to be present. I stole a ride (ok, didn’t renew my train card for my ridiculous daily zone 4 to zone 1 trek), and got caught. I found the UK police to be much more aggressive, actually, but there wasn’t the suspicion/relief of US police. Very factual, completely not charming (and I’ve gotten the palace guards to hang out and laugh - I’m not without my appeal), and very business like. I had zero fear of being unfairly prosecuted or persecuted, and when we were done, they left me with tips to avoid being pickpocketed and general Londoner advice. So, much more transactional and much less potentially intimidating. There is a huge amount of systemic discrimination in the UK, as well. Your accent marks you forever, and we’re talking about a region that requires you to put your GRAMMAR SCHOOL on your CV. Forever. Even post PhD. So they always know where you’re from - and you always know your place. I have lots of stories about this from living there. Many people just don’t even think about it any longer. However, without the rampant gun ownership, the pervasive sense of threat and fear is not present with police interaction. TL; DR - from an outsider perspective (rare interactions, no family in law enforcement), engagements in US seem much more personal than UK, so much more potential for variation. Now, if you want to know about the polizia vs the carabinieri in Italy (particularly Northern Italy), that’s a whole different story… Kind regards, Alexandra Sent from my iPhone - please pardon errors.

In short, there seems to be a growing fissure between the people and the cops. Why? Several years ago, I was in England, on business. After work, my customer and I went to dinner. My customer drove, and chose a pay lot close to our chosen restaurant. When we returned, his car had a boot affixed to the right front wheel. A note telling him who to call was placed under the wiper blade. He was really steamed. The signs the lot’s owner erected at the entrance had deliberately misrepresented its overtime policy in such a way as to encourage people to park overtime and, hence, get booted. Of course the fee to remove the boot was hideous. My customer, in justifiable ire, called the Bobbies. I would like to compare the police response I saw there in England with what a typical police response is here in the USA. —————————————— USA: The cops come roaring up in garish black-and-white cars emblazoned with gold decals and festooned with clearance lights on the roof, in the grill, in the back windows and antenna bristling everywhere. Oh, and don’t forget the enormous black push-bar affixed to the front bumper. ENGLAND: Two cops arrive in a small and almost-nondescript sedan painted a shit brindle with the word “police” on the front fender. It had one small revolving blue light on the roof. If it had antenna, I couldn’t see them. There was no push bar. The cop driving the car moved in slowly like someone looking for an unfamiliar address. —————————————– USA: The cop or cops will be dressed in jet-black uniforms, a la the SS back in Germany or ISIL in Syria. The shirts will be in skin-tight short sleeved jobs, the better to display their hypertrophied, steroid-boosted arms. The uniforms will be covered with badges and insignia galore. The cops’ loins will be girded by an enormous belt from which hang all manner of apparatus — such as handcuffs, pepper spray, blackjacks, possibly a Taser, and for sure, an automatic in a holster that juts from the officer’s hip, the better to display the gun. The cops will affect ugly military buzz cuts, wear ugly, bug-eyed sunglasses with metal rims (even after dark) and wear thin leather shooter’s gloves that snap at the wrist. ENGLAND: The two cops that showed up at the parking lot wore plain white long-sleeved shirts with badges, name tags, and one shoulder patch identifying the force on which they served and the pants were earth-tone slacks. The cops wore belts, to be sure, but the only hardware visible were long wooden truncheons dangling from loops. If they had anything else, they kept it out of sight. ——————————————– USA: After alighting from their squad cars, the American cops will bellow, “Alright, who called 9-1-1?” followed closely by “What’s going on here?” The cops then pepper their interlocutors with a staccato series of demanding questions, seldom allowing one question to be answered before another is asked. Meaningful communications are all but nonexistent. Within a minute, the American cop will be threatening jail and insisting the other party put his hands behind his back to be cuffed-up “for everyone’s safety.” When the incident is concluded, people will be muttering things like “fuckin cops!” ENGLAND: After alighting from their squad car, the English cop asked, “Gentlemen, what seems to be the problem?” My customer, still incensed at the booting of his car, heatedly explained the problem and declared the lot’s operator to be a goddamned crook and insisted the boot be removed forthwith. The two cops stood politely, listening to my customer vent and interjecting soothing comments that indicated they were paying attention to his grievances — sympathetic comments like “I see,” and “Oh, dear.” After my customer’s bile was spent, the cops explained the ins and outs of parking law and offered to call a cab for us. And that was that. On the ride back to the hotel, my customer volunteered that the cops were decent guys. We all got a good nights’ sleep. ——————————————- So what can be concluded from these two contrasting examples of police work? That American cops are overly militaristic. They are overly concerned with simply establishing their authority by intimidation, threats and force as opposed to striking the posture of an honest broker between disputants. Consequently, in America, there is a growing sense of Us vs. Them. Ultimately, this will result in the taxpayers viewing their police as alien occupiers. There will be bad results all around. My recommendations (there are four) are not extreme, but they will be effective. First, ditch the all-black uniforms. If you want to see what a good police uniform looks like, look at the one used by the Washington State Patrol. You’ll immediately recognize the wearer as a cop, but he won’t look like an executioner. Second, forbid wearing sunglasses if the sun’s not out. Third, male cops should wear their hair in what’s known as a “businessman’s cut.” Examples would be Jeff Bezos, Barack Obama or Cary Grant. Fourth, and most important, send all cops to a school on Salesmanship 101. And if they flunk, they don’t get a badge. A good salesman can get someone he loaths to part with money. This kind of skill will go a long way in dealing with surly drunks and obstreperous live-ins. True, despite these four measures, cops will still have to occasionally plug someone but their standing in the community will improve and their jobs will become safer and easier. And we’ll like them better. -Thomas- Question: How do UK police compare to US police?

USA: I once, in the mid 1980’s, when I was 21 years old, made the huge mistake of trying to ask a New York cop for directions. Calling out from a good 10 feet away i said “Excuse me, officer?” What happened next was to me as a kid who had grown up in the UK, quite frightening and bewildering. He shouted at me “Keep back!” put his hand on his gun and threatened to shoot me if I came any nearer. Shocked, I stopped, apologised and asked if it was ok to ask him for directions. He told me to “Fuck off, that aint my job.”Ever since then, when in America, I have always avoided the police wherever possible and given them a wide berth if they are walking on patrol. UK: The reason I went to ask the New York cop directions is because in the UK, if you are lost or not sure where something is, you are perfectly entitled to approach a Police Officer (A Bobby) and ask for help or directions. Parents teach their children to do this from an early age. Unless the police are already busy in pursuit of their duty they are expected to offer any reasonable assistance as is required, and they do, usually cheerfully. I was even stopped by the police once because I looked suspicious: It was late at night and I had gone to get some medicine. I was deliriously ill and my nose and eyes were streaming. When it turned out that I had the flu, was burning up with fever and was really struggling to stand up, they gave me a lift home. I’d have probably been shot in the US. Simply put UK police are there to help, protect, and serve the public by upholding the law. US police are there to Enforce the Law, usually with lethal violence as the first step. I think the levels and quantity of training and relatively uncontrolled public access to guns are the reason the two are so different. Edit: Addendum: It appears many American readers don’t appear to understand that this is an answer to a question asking what the differences are between US and U.K. police. I have never said that *all* US police were foul mouthed and unhelpful but that the behaviour of US police by comparison to those in the U.K. leaves something to be desired. As a result I feel far more inclined to avoid than engage with US police than for example with any police found anywhere else in Europe, Australia or Canada. The answer I gave is real. There is no fiction. That some of you as Americans think that this behaviour is either justified or understandable says a lot about America in the modern day. That some of you try and deny that there is a possibility of poor behaviour from police is an issue in itself. For those that doubt it, this personal experience is backed up by an ongoing and yearly history of hostile and sometimes lethally violent behaviour from Police in the USA. The Justice Department data is freely available although exact numbers are sketchy due to a lack of coordinated documentation in a number of US law enforcement areas. The notorious incidents of poor policing in the USA are sufficiently widely reported that any google search should provide sufficient evidence. As final point to clarify the difference, more than 1,000 people were shot dead by police in the USA in 2015. There were 3 people shot dead by police in the U.K. in 2015. In any given year in the last 20 years you’re likely to see the same ratios. The point is that our police don’t spend their daily lives worrying about being shot or having to shoot someone. They are better trained than many and they are encouraged to police by consent. As a result they are polite, approachable and far less likely to be defensive, ready for violence, rude or obnoxious as a first response.

As long as you have the will. And also money. But believe it or not, producing money to start a business is the easy part. Having the will and confidence to start and handle a company is the more challenging aspect. Not everyone has the will needed to bring a business to life. Experience matters, definitely. But almost all entrepreneurs and businessperson start from nothing. Nobody is born with the right experience. If you're afraid that you don't have enough experience, then hear me out: The experience you need does not necessarily mean you need to try it first-hand.Experience can be shared.Let me explain my two points further. If you want to experience leading a business, you don't have to be a leader immediately. No, it doesn't have to be that way. You can gain experience being a leader by being a follower first. And you can also see and learn how a leader works by observing the people that lead a business. Simply put, you can gain experience not only by starting a business but also by joining a business first and being an employee. I guarantee you that you'll learn valuable lessons when you start from the bottom. The insights you’ll gain can help you become a better entrepreneur or business owner in the future. And experience can be shared. If you don't know how to open a business, but you are confident in your idea, then you can find co-founders that have prior experience. For a lot of companies, having a single co-founder is enough. Co-founders can share their knowledge and skills in starting a business. That co-founder can handle the business aspect while you focus on the product and the technology. In time, the experience your co-founder have can be passed on to you, and your skills can also be shared with that person. So don't be afraid. There are a lot of ways to learn and gain experience. But as I said, make sure that you have the will. Be mentally prepared to overcome the obstacles of having a business.

I’m going to give you 3 steps you need to take to go from being a wantrepreneur without experience to owning your first company. I also did a video on this. If you like watching instead of reading here it is:  Here we go. #1 How do you start a business with no experience? Well, you get experience. And you can do that by working for free. What you should do and what I did when I was starting out was make a list of the type of companies I wanted to work for. At the time I was watching a lot of Mad Men so I liked that sort of business. And I figured I wanted to be an account manager at an advertising firm in New York City. You can do similar. So I decided I wanted to move to NYC and work at a startup. And for the first startup I worked free for a month doing business development. So figure out what industry you want to be in. Get experience in that industry. Work for three to six months. You only really have to work for one month for free and then they'll hire you if your work's good. So save up for one month. Literally, one month before you switch your job. Otherwise, there's very low risk to doing it. While you're working pay attention to everything that's going on in the business. How is the founder connected to what you're doing? Which I hope is something revolving sales because that's where the money comes from. What's the founder doing? Is there an operations guy? What's he doing? Is there a finance guy? What's he doing? Is there a coder? What is he doing? Is there a team under the coder? Study the hierarchy of the company. Try to figure out as much of what's going on as you can. Because the next step is to: #2 Clone their business. Services are the easiest type of business to start because basically you just have to say you do web development or just say you do X and you can start selling it to people. It's a very easy business to get into. If you're in one of those companies. You clone their business and now you're a web developer. Right? You just take their business as your own and then you go and do number three. #3 Cold email to find clients. Here’s a video I did - the actual email script I used to build my first company. It outlines the actual cold email I used to get my first clients for Experiment 27. You're gonna be sending as many cold emails as you possibly can. If your salary is high enough you can hire people in the Philippines or people in Romania or people in India to build the lists for you. Otherwise you're working on weekends and building this list up. Ideally, you want to send about 200 cold emails a week when you're first starting. Maybe even more. Customize those emails! Meet with clients. Close a deal or two and now you have a business. That's how you start a business with no experience. Get the experience. Clone whatever business you jump into. And then cold email to find clients. Now do you have any other excuses for not starting a business? I'm serious! Let me know in the comments. .........................................

You don’t really need experience to start a business — what you do need are research skills, the humility to ask the right questions and the willingness to follow advice. Here are 10 questions to ask yourself in order to get started: 1. How do I start a business with no experience? I’m not sure if you’ve ever held down a 9–5 before, but if you have, then that work experience will be instrumental in guiding you through the do’s and don’ts. Don’t immediately assume that you know absolutely nothing, especially if you’ve been in a work environment and maybe overheard certain conversations. If you’ve  Continue ReadingYou don’t really need experience to start a business — what you do need are research skills, the humility to ask the right questions and the willingness to follow advice. Here are 10 questions to ask yourself in order to get started: 1. How do I start a business with no experience? I’m not sure if you’ve ever held down a 9–5 before, but if you have, then that work experience will be instrumental in guiding you through the do’s and don’ts. Don’t immediately assume that you know absolutely nothing, especially if you’ve been in a work environment and maybe overheard certain conversations. If you’ve never worked a day in your life, start there. See what it’s like to work for a small company and then you’ll know what sort of mistakes to avoid, and how to treat your team. 2. What do I need in order to get started? Research. A lot of people don’t like this (essential) step, because they’re afraid that it’s akin to procrastinating. Not true. There’s a difference between burying yourself in information to avoid making a decision, and preferring to make an informed decision when you do proceed to the next step. Proper research causes you to have more questions than answers. That’s to be expected. Don’t automatically quit when the answers to your questions only cause you to be even more confused. Ask, ask, and ask even more. The most important of these being asking legal questions. When it comes to legal stuff, never ever assume. Get professional advice. 3. What are the legal matters I have to know in order to get started? It is impossible to know everything about the law. Speak to a lawyer if they give free consultations and ask them what you should know. Ethics play a role here too. There are many gray areas which are prevalent in ethics. For instance, what do you tell a customer if you promised them a shipment by a certain date even though you already knew there is a possibility it cannot be fulfilled? You already promised it, but you know it may not happen. If you say you are going to do something, you need to do it. That is the bottom line. Give your customers quality products in a timely manner. Do not always rush to get the job done. Sometimes there are moments when you have to rush, but don’t let it happen if it is not necessary. For the most part, the only time you will need to rush is when the customer requests it. 4. Is there anything that I need to know about my market? If you don’t already know anything about your market demographics, it’s not easier than ever to do some research and see if there are any typical or general interests the target audience has — using Facebook as a resource for starters. If you already know them or know their interests, then you are ahead of the game. 5. How do I know that my idea is really viable? There are plenty of problems that need to be resolved. Even the competition cannot resolve every issue out there. Many entrepreneurs begin with a lot of “strong domain” experience but little to no business experience. Being in business is about finding solutions. That is what sets the strong businesses apart from the others. You do not want to sell just anything because you observe that it makes someone else nice profits. You have to have a passion about it for one thing, and you want to give them something that will resolve an issue they may have. This issue can be from something they bought somewhere else, or it can be an issue they have had for a period of time and need a solution for it. There may not even be a problem, so it may just come down to differentiating your product from the rest. 6. Did I choose the right industry? Choose something that does not just interest your target market. You should have an interest in it too. More than just a little interest, you need to like the products or services that are out there in the market. If you do not like the products or services the market has to offer, how will you feel when you are doing business with the people who are interested in them? I would say you would not seem too enthusiastic to your customers and potential customers. People will pick up on that and it can break the business relationships you worked so hard to make. So please do yourself a favor and do not get wrapped up in an industry that you do not have an utmost passion about. 7. How can I get myself some street cred? You can’t be certified in the streets unless the streets are talking about you. The streets can’t talk about you, unless they know who you are. So when we’re talking about street cred, we’re essentially referring to CRM (customer relations management). You can always try selling other people’s products first — as an affiliate marketer and learn something new about the products you sell them. When you have enough knowledge and you are talking about the product online (such as on your blog), this will help build street credibility as the people who read it will feel you know what you are talking about. 8. Are there any resources that I can use — for free? Talking to industry insiders is the first free resource. You can ask them for advice, without fear that they’ll just steal your idea and try to make money. Trust me, if those people wanted to steal your idea, they would have already done so, before you were even aware that the market existed. If that’s a bit too intimidating for you, visit your local University and see if they have any low cost courses that you can invest in. If that’s a little bit financially challenging, consider MOOCs from sites like Udemy and Coursera. A lot of these course providers are more than willing to answer student queries. Use this opportunity to ask as many questions as possible. 9. How will I know that it’s time to get help? From day one you’re going to need help. A business needs a business plan (or business theme) and a lot of first time entrepreneurs typically don’t know how to properly format one. That’s the first thing that you’re going to need help with. Get help from a professional consultant from day one and save yourself time and tears — not to mention stress. You’ll also need help in managing the financial aspect of running a business. This isn’t something that you should take lightly. In the future when you raise additional funding, you’re going to have to present financial documentation, and if it’s your first rodeo, you won’t know which KPIs to focus on. 10. What am I good at? Think about what your strengths really are. Is it planning the business, giving creative ideas, or being the solutions finder? Maybe your strength is marketing, but whatever your strengths are, put them to work for you. Work on the strengths first and when you have mastered one, then you can move on to another. Otherwise, it will take you much longer to get things running smoothly. Putting a business together takes time and patience. Do not try to put it together too quickly. You want to be focused and organized, as this will help you to be “well planned.” A business with a strong plan is more likely to succeed than something you just threw together in an hour.  At the end of the day, you’ll never know what you don’t know until you start. I’ve learned lessons on my own journey and I have to say that a lot of them weren’t due to ignorance, but simply not knowing which questions to ask and how to ask them, so I know how daunting it can be to start a business with zero experience. Don’t let it stop you anyway. Good luck!",2021-03-05T10:07:06.813Z,"How do I start a new business with no experience? ",Quora

Depending on the budget - $5k, $50k, $500k, $5-mil, $50-mil? - the higher the budget equals the more tools they had access to. The light meter is your DP’s best friend, and they SHOULD know how to get what they are looking for by using this little instrument. While the lighting packages were typically either tungsten (usually quartz halogen) or daylight based (HMIs - and in the 90’s a growing collection of Fluorescent banks), you can add gels to make it virtually any color in the spectrum. Films are generally in 2 categories, Daylight and Tungsten, and there are plenty of people who shot opposing colors - shooting in broad daylight with tungsten film - in order to USE the effect it would have on the exposed film. I can’t remember if ALL of the island footage was shot this way but Cast Away (Tom Hanks - the ON the island part) was shot with tungsten film, and color corrected to “correct color” which gave it an odd harsh blueish quality, that you can’t put your finger on why it doesn’t look exactly right. Now, once you’ve gone to extreme lengths to get it to look the way you want it to look in-camera, in POST, when printing the film, there is a choice of print stocks that each have their own little known properties - higher contrast / lower contrast, creamy colors / vibrant colors, etc. Determining your print stock was step 1. Step 2, printer lights. You’ve picked out your print stock, then comes the process of testing HOW it is to be PRINTED. This is every version of “exposure, and color correction” - do you want it darker or lighter? Do you want it more magenta? The whole thing - not just “this set of hues” like you can in color grading. Because it was the whole thing, there were no power windows, etc., which is WHY it was SO important that your DP knows what they are doing. Knows lighting ratios, color temperatures and how to manipulate them, and how the gels will affect not only the color of light, but how it will affect costumes and set dressing (which can change PROPERTIES depending on the spectrum you hit it with, and the film being used). Are actors’ faces lighted the way you want to see them in the end product? No power windows, so they need to know how this is going to come out, and make adjustments. This is NOT to say modern DPs don’t know any of this. MANY still use light meters, while more and more just look at the monitor with a LUT applied. In the most GENERAL sense, the answer you are looking for is the “printer lights” where they contact print, and decide how light or dark (all or nothing) the image is, and a generalized color selection / correction for the WHOLE movie - which is why consistent photography is needed - there was no “color-matching” feature. The final print - the decision of how long to expose the film, and the color of light applied to do so - all or nothing - to produce what is called the “Release Print”. That’s the master print, which all other copies will be printed from, and shipped out to theaters. I hope this helps. This is a question that is tough to answer and doesn't really have a clear answer. To begin with you have to understand that you are comparing an optical (analogue image) with a digital one. This makes any true comparison futile since there is no scientific way to compare the two. They are irreconcilable, as the means by which they are quantified differ. So any answer you end up with on the subject is a subjective assessment, otherwise known as an opinion.  Now that we understand that the term 'higher quality' is a subjective assessment I will try to explain to you why some people state that ""mo Continue ReadingThis is a question that is tough to answer and doesn't really have a clear answer. To begin with you have to understand that you are comparing an optical (analogue image) with a digital one. This makes any true comparison futile since there is no scientific way to compare the two. They are irreconcilable, as the means by which they are quantified differ. So any answer you end up with on the subject is a subjective assessment, otherwise known as an opinion.  Now that we understand that the term 'higher quality' is a subjective assessment I will try to explain to you why some people state that ""motion-picture is higher quality than digital"", this requires a bit of history. Hollywood (along with the Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers)  developed the standards by which we use digital images. Long before the public was interested in digital images, Hollywood was developing workflows around more efficient digital technologies. At a certain point a 'tape-edit' was replaced with a Digital Intermediate, which for over a decade was 2k. A 2k DI first became possible in 1996 when the the Spirit DataCine 2000 was released. This machine turns an optical print into a digital video and it soon became the defacto telecine machine. Since the SDC 2000's maximum input was 35mm film and the maximum output was 2k digital video it was long assumed that 35mm = 2k. This went unchallenged for a long time, until both computing and digital imaging evolved. Now-a-days most people seem to feel that 35mm = 4k and 16mm =2k. There are even telecine machines that scan 35mm frames up to 8k. I wouldn't be surprised if the 35mm = ?K is revised again in the near future. This is important to know moving forward because as technologies progress our perception of their qualities also change. It is important to know because you can quite literally pull any resolution digital image out of an optical negative (provided the technology exists). I just finished a project where I was working with a 12k representation of a 35mm negative. That doesn't mean that a S35mm negative 'is' 12k, nor does it mean that 12k is an appropriate digital format for S35mm. It is simply a means by which we quantify an image space in the digital world. To further complicate your question about 'quality' you limited your question to the scope of resolution otherwise known as Luminance. There is this whole other world called Chrominance (color) which many people ignore when trying to assess the quality of a digital image. Chrominance is, again, a subjective digital interpretation of color and it's history follows much of the history of Luminance.  To summarize there is no direct relationship between analogue and digital images. That which is understood to be 'Digital Equivalents' is subjective and has a history of moving around dependent of the technology available at the time. A digital image of any resolution can be derived from an optical negative. Your assessment of 'quality' is a personal one and can depend on a number of factors you find important. In the “good ole days”, people actually cut film (workprint, a copy of your original) into scenes, spliced them together with a hot splicer or a tape splicer, sent them off to a film laboratory to be set up as printing rolls. Usually there were two or three separate printing rolls, A, B, and C rolls. To make a 16 frame dissolve one had to offset the A roll to overlap the B roll by 8 frames, the B roll started 8 frames into the A roll.

Most likely someone on here can do it much better. Just let me say that editing film was a pain in the ass, and the vast majority of editors loved the advent of digitization and computer based non-linear editing. Technology gave us the gift of being able to change scene length quickly, rearrange scenes, mix audio, add titles, and color grade in one program. This opened up the film world to so many people who would have never had the money to make a film. I have to confess though, I sometimes think fondly of looking at a film bin (basically a big cotton bag) full of scenes of every length, and knowing that in a few days or weeks those separate pieces would tell a story.

The problem is that you need to understand the building blocks of the Python language to make something interesting. If you do not know how to write code to create a view, you can not build a dynamic website. Most tutorials assume that you have to learn the full Python syntax before you can do anything interesting. This results in months of syntax overhead as you analyze data, build a website, or create an autonomous drone. That's why your motivation dwindles and you just annul everything. So here are 5 important steps that you should follow to learn Python, 1. Determine what motivates you to learn Python When you find out what motivates you, you can choose an end goal and a path that will take you there easily. You do not need to define a specific project, just a general area that interests you as you prepare to learn Python. Choose an area that interests you, such as: Data Science / Machine Learning Mobile AppwebsitesgamesHardware / sensors / robotsScripts to automate your workIdentify one or two areas that interest you and you want to stay with. They will guide your learning to them and eventually build projects. 2. Learn the basic syntax Unfortunately, this step cannot be ignored. You need to learn the basics of Python syntax before delving deeper into the area of ​​your choice. They want to spend as little time as possible, as this is not very motivating. The faster you can work on projects, the faster you will learn. You can always refer to the syntax if you get stuck later. Ideally, you should only spend a few weeks in this phase, certainly not more than a month. 3. Create structured projects Once you know the basic syntax, you can create projects yourself. Projects are a great way to learn as you can apply your knowledge. If you do not apply your knowledge, it will be difficult for you to keep it. The projects will strengthen your skills, help you learn new things and build a portfolio that you can showcase to potential employers. However, very free projects will be painful at this stage - you will often have to get stuck and refer to the documentation. That's why it's usually best to do more structured projects until you feel comfortable enough to do them all yourself. Many educational resources offer structured projects. With these projects, you can build interesting things in the areas that interest you and prevent them from getting stuck. 4. Work on projects alone Once you've completed some structured projects, it's time to work on your own projects to continue learning the Python language. You will continue to consult learning resources and concepts, but you will work on what you want to work on. Before you start your own projects, you need to be familiar with debugging errors and problems with your programs. Once you're familiar with debugging issues, you can start working on your own projects. You should work on things that interest you. For example, I've been working on tools that let you quickly negotiate actions after learning programming. Here are some tips to find interesting projects: Expand the projects you previously worked on and add more features.Visit Python Meetings near you and find people who are working on interesting projects.Find open source packages to contribute.See if local non-profit organizations are looking for volunteer developers.Look for projects that others have created and see if you can develop or customize them. Github is a good place to find them.Browse other people's blog posts for interesting project ideas.Think of tools that make your life easier and build them.Do not forget to start very small. It is often helpful to start with very simple things in order to gain confidence. It's better to start a small project than a big project that never happens. 5. Continue to work on more difficult projects Continue to increase the difficulty and scope of your projects. When you are fully familiar with what you are building, it is time to try something stronger. Here are some ideas for this moment: Try teaching a novice how to create a project that you have achieved.Can you expand your tool? Can it work with more data or can it handle more traffic?Can you make your program faster?Can you make your tool useful to more people?How would you market what you did?Go Forward In the end, Python continues to evolve. Few people can rightly claim to have perfectly understood and created the language. You have to constantly learn and work on projects. If you do this correctly, you will find that you reviewed your code 6 months ago and thought about the seriousness of the situation. When you reach that point, you are on the right track. If you only work on topics that interest you, you will never be exhausted or bored. Python is a really fun and rewarding language for learning.

It’s common to see web developers with 20 years of experience who have never had any exposure to marketing (except for working with marketers within an organization). Marketers traditionally don’t write code since it’s usually a different field. And customers usually pay for marketers and developers separately as the required skill set is different. People profiling in both probably lack skills in each. Very few people choose to commit themselves to both - usually tech entrepreneurs or freelancers who picked marketing as a necessity to sell their products. It takes a long time to become an expert in each - so expect those individuals to have at least a decade of experience (often more). If you aim for a professional career in either, probably focusing on a specific field would make more sense. It would take you twice the team to become well-versed in each area. Employers want to maximize your efficiency and skills and see commitment to your job (instead of switching between roles at all times). Small businesses may be looking for a generalist who can pick up a few bits and pieces from here and there. That said, this isn’t quite professional - and you’ll likely learn a little bit of everything with nothing in-depth. Then again, if your life goal is starting a business on your own (or even running a lifestyle business after hours), this may be a good option. I’d still propose spending several years with web development until you decide whether studying and practicing marketing makes sense. Why not? But it's easier for a web developer to learn the skills of a digital marketer than the other way around. Once you've got the technical skills of a web developer, then you can pick up the nuances of digital marketing, because this is a skill that is not easily learnt, but comes via practice. If you are a digital marketer, hoping to be a web developer, it's a lot more difficult to learn the skills of mastering the technical aspects of web development such as programming languages, but I've seen people doing it, and becoming very successful! We live in an era where anyone can aspire to be whomever he/she chooses to.

Next morning,when he reached the airport, he was the last few passengers to take the boarding pass.He got a middle seat in the last row.His colleague who had reached earlier got an isle seat in the middle.(They would have preferred to sit together). As he finds air conditions in flight discomforting,he generally asks for a blanket and dozes off.This was no exception. When he next woke up, he was in a hospital with chaos all over. The flight had crashed near the wings and all passengers in the front and middle of the flight had succumbed to death.His colleague was one of them. There were only 7 people in the flight who had reportedly survived, out of which 6 were in a very critical state.My cousin was the 7th one who had only faced mild injuries. Later on we learnt that he had fallen on a heap of straw, due to which he did not face many injuries.Moreover,since he was asleep when the entire incident occurred,he did not even realize anything. Due to severe injuries,none of the 6 others could survive, and gradually passed away.Hence, he was the only one who survived the air crash.

The normal karate stuff : exercises, jogging, new techniques, duels etc. That day was different. Dad told me to either walk or ask sensei to drop me back home. It was 0830 hrs and sensei dismissed everyone. I had started to walk, when halfway through, he offered to drop me off. H had dropped me off near my street. My Grove Street. It was a calm Sunday morning. Mostly everyone was counting sheeps in their sleep. I entered my block and noticed that grandpa (thatha in my native tounge) had cleaned our Maruti Omni , shiny white. For a seventy year old man, that's amazing.  Halfway through the first floor, I saw a family playing near the shore walls. We basically lived a couple of meters away from the sea. The shore walls had so much vegetation that only cows used to graze there. So I knew these guys are guests of people around. At the same time, I had noticed a huge wave near the wall of the shore. The next wave confirmed my doubts. The sea was coming in and coming in fast. I started shouting ""Thanni varudhu! Odunga!"", which roughly translates to ""Water incoming! Everybody run!"". Our close family friend in ground floor, had heard my call and decided to run immediately. Two or three seconds later, a thunderous force broke down the wall in all directions and the sea invaded the land. The family, whom I saw a couple of minutes earlier, was missing and was later found out to be alright, except for the unlucky dad.  The churches near my house were the worst affected. Hundreds killed. The interesting part is that the water didn't enter any temple, even though located near or facing the sea.  The sad part was that my friend and his family, in the neighboring block had heard about this news report from Sun News that that was an earthquake reported in and near Chennai. So they had decided to go down from second floor, fearing the earthquake, just moments before the tsunami. Their bodies were found scattered throughout the neighborhood.

I let him go and i again started to read through the pages. The train was travelling close to 100 Km/hr and suddenly everything came to a stand still. There were stones in the boggie and i was covered in my own blood. I could see some light from the cracked roof but there was no sound. The person next to me seemed unconscious. I tried waking him up but to no good. Everything was red in front of my eyes.  I somehow got the courage to come out of the train through the cracked roof, my face covered in blood. what i saw outside is something i can never forget. The train has derailed and boggies are over each other. My boggie was crushed in between. People from the rear boggies started accumulating and someone helped me to get down from the roof. I sat there unconscious for an hour or so when i saw some doctors bandaging my head. I tried to find out about my fellow passengers but all i could see was blood and people crying. What I felt and after-effectsThat was the first time i saw myself so close to death. It was terrifying to say the least. I don't know how i survived may be God's grace or destiny. But it had changed many things for me.  I realized for the first time how much my family loved me and why living for them is better than dying for anyone else. There really are true friends who will do anything to comfort you and help you out. That day on-wards i never left their side nor i will ever. I am scared of travelling not only in trains but also metros even if they shake a little. And i know i can never overcome this fear in my life.  I realized that death can come to us any day. So i have stopped leaving things for the future and started living my life in the present. I have joined a NGO and started contributing to it both monetarily and voluntarily. I made a vow to myself that i will never hurt anyone intentionally even if they betray me or use me for their benefits. I am trying to follow it even till day. Finally, The thought of that accident makes me cold even today but in terms of positives, i realized the importance of life and now i don't miss even a single chance to be happy or make others happy.

Click on an image to unblur it.I have also heard people saying it is not real, but their videos and photos are as real as it gets. The thing, which makes people believing the videos are fake, are the videos of the westerners executed by Jihadi John. Because the videos “only” show the corpses of them after being beheaded rather than showing the process of the beheading. Some have said the reason is not to scare people away, but that does not really make any sense when they proudly show the whole execution of Syrian soldiers. Their videos are more “professionally” made, they have members who know how to work with film and pictures on a skilled level. The picture below is from one of their most graphic and detailed videos. Where Jihadi John and his fellow psychopaths executes soldiers from the Syrian regime in FULL HD, and I can tell, it is absolutely gory and disgusting to watch. You can quickly tell it is a snuff video and very much real, which makes it even more disturbing. Please do yourself a favor and never watch any of their videos or photos, it will only strengthen them. They want us to see it so we fear them even more; do not do them this favor. I consulted the main policies and guidelines for questions on Quora, and the tone of responses to the primary question on whether it is acceptable on Quora to ask for advice on how to do things that are illegal, and I don't believe the nature of the question intends to promote recruitment to ISIS. I believe it's a general question.  Moreover, I considered my own answer to ""Why aren't ISIS recruiting videos banned on the World Wide Web?"" and if Quora wants to take this down, it can.  All that said, you can find it on Dailymotion.com, among other places if you don't mind your search history being stored on Google and picked up by God knows how many intelligence and law enforcement agencies. I won't link directly to it for personal and other should-be-obvious reasons. It contains extraordinarily graphic content, and excessively high levels of bullshit. If it's legal within your jurisdiction to watch it, go nuts. Most of the journalist in the ISIS held territories have pledged their allegiances to ISIS and therefore the propoganda of these media persons is centered around ISIS. Whenever, they have to release an official statement,this is relayed by these rogue journalist to their counterparts in Arab media world like Al-Jazeera etc and then it is released out.

So just about anyone can shoot scads of images, pick out the few good ones, set up a website and proclaim their vision. No training or experience required. And the sheer number of ‘photographers’ out there doing just that means it is very, very easy to get lost in the crowd. And it’s a big crowd. There are a few ‘real’ photographers out there using ‘old school’ techniques to make images and I respect their drive to keep the craft going. Still though, it’s just too tough to stand out from the crowd, and very few ever do enjoy the level of success that enables making a living from the craft. It’s a tough art world out there. This is a difficult question to answer as I don’t know everyone who thinks that. I can however answer for myself, Looking at full frame DSLRs with large numbers of Megapixels and high ISO abilities I think that digital has probably overtaken traditional film.

A fairly basic zoom lens for a “serious” wildlife photographer would run about $1500.00. The price would increase with the quality and expected performance of the lens. Ditto for the camera. Professional photographers must always have at least one “back up” camera and the same for their most used lenses as well. Some photographers travel internationally to get the subject matter they’re looking for and would cover stories for publications (such as National Geographic) These individuals would have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in their gear. For both of the examples you mention, they may use special gear. I have a camera called a borescope or an endoscope. The camera itself is 1/4″ (6.5mm) in diameter including the tiny LED lights surrounding the lens. It is on a 9.5′ (3 meter) bendable cable. I can snake this into very tight places like bee hives. I can also fasten it to a pole, and combined with my height and arm reach I can look in bird boxes, woodpecker holes, or nests as much as 17′ (5.3 meters) above the ground, or more if I use a step ladder.

In my two decades of destruction, I have received over 300 death threats. I am sure you are wondering how I manage to achieve this level of hatred. It is simple I am nightmarishly brutal when it comes to PvP. It does not matter the game I will kill everyone I see unless you are explicitly allied with me and my guild. I play exclusively on PvP servers, I have no honor, it doesn’t matter to me if you are level 1 or max level I will kill you, and I will wait there till you rez to kill you again and again and again and again. I keep exclusive items that most never have the time nor the energy to obtain that always gives me an ace in the hole to escape world PvP. You think you got me in a 1v4 situation? I'll use a 12-hour cooldown that you didn't even know existed in the game to drop combat and teleport at 1% health. My entire inventory is set up to deny kills at any cost. I have pulled random bypassers into the line of fire to deny a kill on me. If for any reason you escape I will write your name down in my out of game hit-list.txt and I will search for you every day until I land a kill on you. I have been known to track people down as much as 10 months later, no one ever gets away. I have sat on the dead corpse of people for hours with targeting macros so that the instant they rez they are dead again. Two guys decided it was a good idea to kill my the real-life fiance’s character, I camped them for 6-months till they decided it wasn't worth it to play the game anymore. I keep multiple accounts open on different factions so I know where people are. I have an ungodly amount of money on any game because I extort gold from players if they do not want to be camped all day every day I require a daily amount of gold to be sent to my alt's inbox. My crime in-game is that I have the freedom to be the person that entire servers band together to kill. The really messed up part is that I have done this on several MMOs. It has been years though since I have played a game because I do not have that kind of time to be spending all day on a video game, work and personal relationships take up most of my time.

Dwarf Fortress is a game that allows you to create a fortress of dwarfs (who could of seen that coming), and due to the way it’s been created, the game is very unfriendly to new players, however the complexity it offers is incredible. The stories that occur as a result are amazing, so while I’m not sharing my own messed up thing I’ve ever done, this should suffice: “I was visiting a friend of mine earlier today. So it happens neckbeards flock around neckbeards, and he was currently deep into a game of Dwarf Fortress. As I stepped into his room he motions me to quickly check out his monitor. On it was the largest demon invasion I’ve ever seen. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Before you hear the end of the story, you will have to hear the beginning as relayed to me by my friend. Having started as your standard fortress, the Hamlet of Tyranny was uneventful by /tg/ standards. Sure there would be caravans and immigrants and occasional (though unusually rare) sieges, but there was a dark and DEADLY secret buried beneath the hills. And his name was Ashmalice. Ashmalice was a fire demon of legendary status. Not only had he existed in the prehistory of the fort, but he had over 550 kills – which included 2 entire tribes of goblins, a handful of elves, and a terrifying amount of dwarves… one of whom was the king of the mountain-homes. Fast forwarding to the present time, major construction was underway of the fort. Many many immigrants had arrived over the years and times were good for the dwarves. Having many legendary carvers and warriors my friend grew lax in his defenses. And his dwarves paid the price when a miner unearthed a glowing pit deep below the dungeons carved into the mountain. Within an hour my friend’s fortress was besieged by a nearly unending horde of demonic horrors. Ill equipped to deal with the threat immediately, the population of the Hamlet began dropping exponentially. Not even a panicked redirection of the river into the lower levels was enough to staunch the influx of demons, only enough to slow them long enough for the major walkways to be collapsed to buy some precious time. Luckily (and cleverly) my friend had built his fortress in such a way that if any large section had collapsed, then all escape routes would lead out into the wilderness and on a path far from the fortress and defensible by collapsing the ceiling via lever to flood seawater into the tunnel. Though no dwarf was alive on that side of the map, or able to reach it to pull the lever, my friend had bought the dwarves much needed time, though when Ashmalice made himself known all seemed futile. Even more so when Stuvok lost his mind with rage. Stuvok was one of the founding 7. He was an ex-miner turned blacksmith of legendary status. He was a monster of a dwarf that all dwarves aspired to be. And he had just lost his wife Doken (another of the starting 7) to the demon Ashmalice. His sorrow was felt by the surviving clan as he tore through them one by one unopposed. Only when he ran into his workshop and was locked in did his rage abate. Morale was rock bottom. Several dwarves commit suicide in this dark hour. And of the handful who remained of this once great fortress, few were willing to do anything at all, except the only other remaining dwarf of the founders: the engraver Sil. In the months that followed, the floors were carved with graven images of his follow brethren. All hope seemed lost. But this was not the end for the Hamlet. Not just yet… In his grief and mourning, Stuvok opened his heart to the spirits of the dead. And one day they came to him in spirit. In his possessed mood he plotted and planned and (ironically) with the materials available to him, crafted an artifact clearly in homage to his wife: Endless Death of Tears – a sword with an image of a dwarf holding a piece of glass – glass that his wife used daily in her trade. My friend had been content to just flood the map with lava and end the game after such losses. But upon seeing this artifact his neckbeard overtook him and he knew that Doken, the dwarves, the king, must all be avenged! And thankfully for me, he decided to continue. Fast forwarding again to the present (the time at which I had come in to see him play) my friend had safely excavated what he could of the fortress and moved all activity to a small corner of the interior. When all levers were erected, dwarves armed, and preparations complete, he un-paused the game for me. A few dwarves made suicide runs to the bottom of the dungeons and collapsed them – which in turn lowered the debris above into a sinkhole that breached a large hole for the demons to pour from back into the fort. A few more dwarves valiantly fired into the oncoming tide of hate, but they were nothing but fodder that bought precious moments for the true plan to kick in. A masterfully placed lever that had yet been un-pulled brought down the entire mountain through the legendary dining hall ceiling; crushing almost half of the intruding horde. As planned, the demons made a bee-line through the side hallways through rows of blade traps. Demons were chewed up by the blades, but still they came. And so did “He.” Ashmalice not only avoided the fatal cave-in, passed the slicing blades, and bypassed the numerous flooding-trap chambers, but he and a squad of equally lucky frog demons carved and scorched their way into the final defensive line. Among their victims was Stuvok; unable to avenge his beloved. And the last handful of dwarves were quickly reduced to 2 – Sil the engraver and the legendary captain of the guard, Daneken. As respected and powerful as Stuvok had been, Daneken was that and more. He was a god among his clan, and had once in his long career single-handedly repelled a goblin siege led by a cyclops, and had helped wrestle a dragon to death. And now armed with his dead friend’s artifact sword, he was seeing red. Daneken had been stationed at the edge of a chasm (my friend’s map had a pit AND chasm that had been unearthed, but it was amazingly only filled with tiny spiders that were easily dispatched in the early years of the fort). A single bridge had been built to span the chasm, and would have been later expanded as housing. But that plan was no longer. And this was it. This was the end of the dwarves of the Hamlet of Tyranny. But they would not go quietly. As the demons approached Daneken threw himself at them in a rage. Ashmalice blasted him with demonic flames, but Daneken was imbued with the collective rage of his people and carved through the frog retainers with little signs of stopping. Ashmalice, however, had seen the death of a king and was not impressed with the antics of a lowly dwarf and sent him hurtling back onto the bridge – coincidentally knocking Sil over the edge. With his flesh scorching and his blood boiling, Denekan crawled to his feet just in time to see Ashmalice hover over him. With but a single push the fortress would be claimed by demons. But to my friend’s and my own utter jaw-dropping amazement, it was the dwarves who claimed him. Daneken, in a testament to his dwarfdom, slashed off one of Ashmalice’s arm/wings and plunged Endless Death of Tears into his evil heart. Such was the force of the blow that the demon was hurled backwards off of the bridge and sent spiraling down into the unending darkness; spouting curses the entire way.  With his clan and his king avenged, Daneken himself tumbled from the bridge. But… one dwarf remained? Awestruck by what had just happened, I urged my friend to quickly find the survivor! The menus opened, the tabs clicked, and we see that name. Sil. Sil? But he fell into the chasm! What was going on? With the battle essentially over and the remaining demons blocked from further intrusion by an unchecked flood of river water, we peer into the chasm. Several Z-levels down, on a tiny 2-square ledge, lay Sil – broken and bleeding, but alive. With no way to save him, and with his entire clan residing in the afterlife, we debated how this should end. Should we just abandon the fort outright? Should we try and kill him somehow? What? In the end, however, we decided to let him create one more carving – one last testament to dwarfkind. This decision did not come lightly, as after such an epic climax, anything less would seem an insult. After all, maybe he would draw a picture of a plump helmet or something equally random. But still, we left him to his work. What did he draw? Moments before he bled to death? Alone on a cliff? The last gesture of the dwarves of The Hamlet of Tyranny? A picture of a demon and some dwarves. The demon was in a fetal position. The dwarves were laughing.” This incredible story is from a videogame called Dwarf Fortress, and hopefully gave you a good chuckle.

Brass Tacks (Analytics productized service)  I asked Jonathan Stark, business coach, how to create a successful productized service in my book, Productize Yourself: The Consultant’s Guide To Attracting Clients Through Your Website: What are the benefits of creating a productized service? The primary benefit of productized services is that they’re easier to sell than custom engagements. They are great for service providers who are not particularly good at scoping custom work, or don’t like creating custom project proposals. Since productized services are delivered over and over again, the seller gets better and better at delivering high-value outcomes more quickly. The buyer benefits from this because they receive the desired business outcome more quickly and without sacrificing quality. How do you go about creating your first productized service? Think back to your past engagements and look for a chunk of work that you had to do on many of them. This might be a discovery phase, a security audit, a system architecture, a brand guide, a backup and recovery plan, a marketing calendar, etc. They usually take anywhere from 3 to 30 hours of work, spread out across a week or two.

Sometimes I wonder if she had been just another of his women on the go, if things would have worked out differently. Anyway, she was the only one that dubious honour was bestowed upon, and she was also the first (and I suspect, only) one who kicked him out when she learned of his womanising. My mom came from a family of well spoken, educated, God fearing people. Her marriage to my father I think was very much a rebellion against the strict expectations of her family. Add the fact that my father was a looker with a bad boy vibe about him, my mom fell hook, line and sinker. They married and had one child together, me. I was about 2/3 when my mom put him out. My earliest memories are of my dad coming by and trying to talk to my mom. It was years later that I would realise he was trying to worm his way back in. My mom stood strong but she always cried after he left. After a while he stopped bothering. But his resentment lasted for a long, long time. As one would expect, with multiple women…comes multiple children. In total my dad acknowledged 6 children, only 2 of whom share the same mother. I believe there are more out there, but that’s just speculation on my part. Of the 6 my father only supported as much as he was forced to. If the woman was lucky and caught him before he hopped on a barstool on payday, or before he went off with whichever unfortunate lady was his current fancy. And he always had one or two of those on the go. Always. He also never had money. There was always something he had to do that was urgently important. Or he had to repay someone, so, of course, no money for silly things like….money for food, school books, back to school stuff, going to the Drs, bus fares etc. Yet weirdly enough like clock work he could always be found at the bar with his friends, on a Friday. Or going to parties with said friends and the women of course. My mother in the meantime internalised her pain and worked, worked, worked to keep our heads above water. I got used to her cleaning, ironing and cooking at nights in preparation for the next day. That way I had food and clean clothes for the next day while she was at work. Neighbours would watch me until she came home, and I grew pretty self sufficient at a young age. Yet I never heard a bad word said against my father. I can’t imagine how hurt and bitter she must have been, but she never in my presence vocalised any of those feelings. And when I grew old enough to understand just how awful he was, I could never say it aloud. She wouldn’t allow it. Once I had mumps and needed to see the Dr, she went to meet him to get help with the fee and he simply didn’t turn up. I heard she waited for over an hour, and went searching bars, before admitting defeat. She ended up borrowing money from the neighbour to get me to the Dr. When I was 12 my mom took ill and I had to go live with my dad and the woman he was living with. I didn’t know it then, but the years of hard toil had taken a hard toll on my mother, and the clock was ticking. I didn’t know, and didn’t understand why I had to go live with a woman who hated me, and a father who resented my presence. Every single cent he was forced to spend on me he complained about. Complained how much of a burden I was. How his bills weren’t being paid as they used to be, because of an added expense. That expense was me. He had to buy extra food because of me. Light bills were higher, because of me. Well…. the list was endless. Forget the fact that he had a good job at a Bauxite Company, forget the fact that the woman he lived with had 3 boys that weren’t his, yet he was sending the youngest to school quite happily. I was the problem. I was the problem, because I was a daily reminder of the woman who had dared to tell him no. Who had dared to stick to her guns, and rejected his many ploys. To say my life was unhappy would be a bit of an understatement. My dad is a mean spirited, abusive, miserly, narcissistic man. He holds a grudge as if it’s an Olympic sport and he is going for gold. To this day he has never forgiven my mother for giving him the boot. And she’s been gone over 30 years now. He manipulates and lies. He never has any money, and God help you if you have the misfortune of owing him anything. He’s spiteful and vindictive. And the irony of it all, of all his children, the two of us that he treated worse than strays off the streets, are the ones trying our hardest to help him now that he’s ageing and his health isn’t great. And his reaction? To be as demanding and entitled as much as possible. Caring nothing for the demands of our own lives, or responsibilities we have. He’s our father and apparently that means we owe him the very blood that runs through our veins. I don’t hate him. Maybe I should, but I don’t. I don’t love him either. I have this sense of detachment where he is concerned. I help him financially whenever I can. I also limit my contact with him. My heart aches for my little brother though. Even as he realises how awful our father is, I think there’s still a part of him that’s hoping he’ll finally get some small smidgen of affection. An apology for not being the father he should have been. And every time it doesn't materialise, my brother hurts. He says he’s over it, but I know different. And that hurts to my very core. When I was 8 1/2 months pregnant with my first child, my daughter Eva, I was in and out of the hospital. It started when I was 27 weeks pregnant. My daughter was sitting on my right kidney a lot and it caused it to swell, it wasn’t something alarming, but the pain it caused was insane. I remember crying and holding my lower back for hours and hours.The last time it became unbearable was about a month before she was born, I was admitted into the hospital and they monitored my daughter and myself for 2 days.

It started when I was 27 weeks pregnant. My daughter was sitting on my right kidney a lot and it caused it to swell, it wasn’t something alarming, but the pain it caused was insane. I remember crying and holding my lower back for hours and hours.The last time it became unbearable was about a month before she was born, I was admitted into the hospital and they monitored my daughter and myself for 2 days. When the doctors were about to release me from the hospital they asked if I had anyone that could be with me for the next couple of weeks since I was so close to my delivery date and I was having slight complications. Eva’s father, my fiance at the time, had started working a new job and the shift they put him on was midnight to 8 a.m. so he was at work or he was sleeping because that shift takes a while to get use to. My aunt, who helped raise me, said that I would stay with her. I worded it “would” instead of “could” because I didn’t ask, she just stated that I would be staying with her, her boyfriend, and my cousin who was 10 at the time. The hospital prescribed me 30 Tylenol 3’s that I was to take when the pain became unbearable. I went to bed and woke up to the sound of my aunt throwing up relentlessly. In the course of 6 hours my aunt and her boyfriend took 25 of my Tylenol 3’s trying to get high. Even knowing my family the way that I do, I didn’t think, for a second, that at almost 9 months pregnant, that I had to hide my Tylenol 3’s. I never thought my aunt, who claimed that she loved me “like the daughter I wished I had”, would take the ONLY thing I could take to dull the pain I was in. I started crying because I can’t call my doctor and say “Hey my aunt and her boyfriend stole my pills, I need more.” I grabbed all of my belongings and told my aunt I never wanted to talk to her again. I spent the next 3 weeks crying, in a crazy amount of pain. I knew I could file a police report but I couldn’t do that to my 10 year old cousin. Even with his mom, it was a better life than he would’ve had with his dad, which is what would’ve happened if the police got involved. I ended up giving my aunt one more chance, and she broke the only rule that I have, but that’s a story for a different question. I had an aunt, who married my uncle ( way beftore I was born) and growing up I knew something was off with her, but didn't know what it was. My mother loved her, was a bridesmaid at her wedding, thought she was fine. My father preferred my uncle, so he didn't interact with her much. They had a son and daughter, the son was older. We visited their house often, even stayed there a few weeks. My sister, as we grew older, acknowledged we didn't like our aunt but we couldn't put our finger on it. My uncle got Alzheimer's, started talking, and we found out why we don't like her. My aunt had one son a Continue ReadingI had an aunt, who married my uncle ( way beftore I was born) and growing up I knew something was off with her, but didn't know what it was. My mother loved her, was a bridesmaid at her wedding, thought she was fine. My father preferred my uncle, so he didn't interact with her much. They had a son and daughter, the son was older. We visited their house often, even stayed there a few weeks. My sister, as we grew older, acknowledged we didn't like our aunt but we couldn't put our finger on it. My uncle got Alzheimer's, started talking, and we found out why we don't like her. My aunt had one son and I guess couldn't couldn't have more kids, so they adopted. The girl is my uncle's brother's daughter ( he had a lot of kids and he lives in third world country) so they took her when she was young. My uncle divulged in his less lucid states, that he looked the other way as his adopted daughter was verbally, mentally, and physically abused in the home by his wife. She was basically used as a slave in the home. And when guest or family came, she was to shut up, say nothing, act like a part of the family, but do her household duties (Cleaning, laundry, attend to guest, etc) while my older cousin sat around with his feet kicked up, ordering her around. She had a feisty temperament, so occasionally it would come out to my sister and I, but we didn't know why. One day she and I had a physical fight in my home, ( We were 15, and looking back now I know why) I had scratches on my face, I tried to hide it with make up, but it was found out and she was blamed, by my mother and her parents, a day before a 10 HR drive back to Vancouver. I know she was yelled at and most likely beaten the whole drive up. I heard later that when she got home she ran away, but was forced to come back. At the age of 38, we found out this and many other horrible stories. My mother and father are only focused on the aunt putting my uncle in a home instead taking care of him, and not on the years of abuse, like the abuse never happened. When I saw her a year later, she has a son, a good job, and she doesn't talk or visit her “family”, I don't blame her. Not her blood father or mother didn't confront their daughter's “parents” about it, when they come to America, and the rest of her blood siblings say nothing to her as they are still in their country, tho they chat on Facebook. We cousins talk about it, and agree she would have been better off in the third world country!! The older brother who participated in the abuse he was taught, says nothing, acts like nothing is wrong, when we all look at him as guilty also. His behavior as a grown man with two kids, whose married, who must know all of it is out there for family and some friends of the family who now knows what happened, doesn't confront his mother for her behavior. I don't know if his wife knows the truth, but I know their still married. As far as I know, none of us cousins (and there is a lot of us) don't speak to that aunt or her son, and my sister and I have labeled them dead to us.",2021-03-05T10:28:54.978Z,"When did you realize that one of your family members was a horrible person?

I have searched and found a number of additional opportunities that make for quite a nice selection Below are 33 legitimate online jobs where you can earn over $40,000 a year: .TOP ONLINE JOBS FOR 2019 These top online jobs have the ideal mix of high demand, a low supply of talented individuals, and the ability to start earning fast. #1) — PROOFREADING Quick summary: Earn money by proofreading books, academic papers, website content, audio transcripts and moreAverage pay: $17.50 per hourIf you’re the type of person that spots every typo and grammar mistake in the articles you read, consider a career in proofreading. Proofreading is a great example of a job that needs no certification, and you can use your set of eagle eyes to make solid money. With the explosion of web content that has occurred in recent years, it’s a job that’s in super-high demand. That means you can land your first client today if you’re ready to start.  Interested? Caitlin Pyle, who earns over $40k per year proofreading part-time, has a free introductory workshop: Learn the Skills You Need to Start Your Freelance Proofreading Hustle #2) — START A BLOG Quick summary: Create a website that provides valuable information about a topic you care aboutAverage pay: $0 to $10k+ per monthThe Ways To Wealth is my second blog. I started my first blog in 2009 and sold it two years later. I launched this blog in August 2016. Just over a year later, it was generating enough revenue that I felt comfortable leaving my well-paying job as a CPA — a job I’d had for over 10 years. What’s great about a blog is that you’re building a sellable asset. A quality website sells for around 30X its monthly revenue. Therefore, if you’re able to make $1,333 per month, you have a $40,000 asset. As for how to make money blogging, there are a number of ways. These include: Advertising — earn money by placing ads on your websiteAffiliate marketing — make money promoting other businessesProducts and services – sell your own products and services to othersSponsored content – get paid for partnering with brandsThe downside to blogging is that it can take time to get up and running. As such, if you need money today, you might want to consider a different online job instead. If you’re interested in blogging, here are three must-read articles to check out: The Best Blog Niche Ideas for Making Money in 2019How to Choose the Perfect Domain Name for Your Personal or Lifestyle BlogThe Insanely Simple Guide to Starting a Successful Money Making Blog in 2019 #3) — BOOKKEEPINGQuick summary: Record and continuously update financial transactions for small businessesAverage pay: $17.50 to $40+ per hourAt the top of most business owners’ list of “Least Favorite Work Activities” is bookkeeping. Of course, it’s a critical task for ensuring a business runs smoothly and survives into the future. If you’re someone who loves to work with numbers, you can earn very good money in the field. There are also a lot of opportunities to charge higher hourly wages the more you specialize. And just like proofreading, bookkeeping doesn’t require a certification. A great resource for getting started is Ben Robinson’s free video training: How to Start Your Own Bookkeeping Business & Earn $80+/hr in 10 Weeks Without Going Into Debt. #4) — PHOTOGRAPHER Quick summary: Supply stock photos that will be purchased and used by businessesAverage pay: 20 to 50 cents per image soldOne of the fasting-growing online marketplaces is stock photography. According to Technavio, the business of selling stock photos will exceed $4 billion by 2020. Businesses need quality stock photos for their websites, client presentations, and more. If you love being behind a camera — even the one your smartphone — you can get paid for uploading quality photos to stock photo sites. You’ll earn anywhere between 20 and 50 cents per image sold. So, the goal is to have dozens of photos for sale, each generating commissions for you daily. This makes selling stock photography a great source of passive income because you can get paid over and over again for work you only did once.  The best way to learn the business of stock photography and enhance your skills as a photographer is through creative Live. Founded by world-renowned photographer Chase Jarvis, Creative Live offers free daily classes on photography, art, design, and more. Their live classes are 100 percent free to attend. If you want to re-watch the video recordings later, unlimited access is available for a very reasonable fee. (For example, their stock photography course is only $29.) Click here to sign up for Creative Live’s Newsletter to get access to the free classes. #5) — FIND A WORK-FROM-HOME JOB Quick summary: A job search site that lists only legitimate work-from-home opportunities for both entry-level and experienced workersAverage pay: Depends on experienceThe best path to a legitimate online job may be working for a remote company. This is especially true for those who enjoy what they do now but want the flexibility and freedom an online job provides. Finding a decent employer is no easy task, though. A quick search on Craigslist pulls up dozens of spammy-looking “opportunities.” Fortunately, the number of companies who hire remote workers is growing. And yes, many of them offer things like stable salaries, benefits, and opportunities for promotion and advancement. The smartest way to find a legit online job is through FlexJobs. FlexJobs screens each job listing — more than 30,000 of them — to ensure that each company is legitimate. Here’s the catch: FlexJobs is a paid membership site. To see the full details of a particular job listing, you have to sign up for their $14.95 monthly membership. But the quality of the listings is absolutely worth the small fee. Also, you can see what jobs are available without paying, so feel free to browse the listing titles first to see if they have anything that strikes your fancy.  #6) — ONLINE TUTOR Quick summary: Tutor children worldwide in English or other subjectsAverage pay: $18 per hourOne high-growth business industry right now is online education. And one of the fastest-growing niches within online education is online tutoring. There are now multiple websites that connect you with students all over the world who are looking to be tutored in a range of subjects. When we ranked the best online tutoring sites, the top site was VIPKid. Why was VIPKid rated #1, even ahead of popular and well-known sites like Chegg and Club Z? The average wage, according to Glassdoor, is $18 per hourThe lesson plans and course materials are providedYou can work when you want, where you want, with no need to worry about marketing your servicesAll that’s required is a bachelor’s degree and some teaching experience (which could be prior tutoring experience, teaching at your church, etc. — it doesn’t have to be formal classroom experience).Sign up here for VIPKid. #7) — VIRTUAL ASSISTANT Quick summary: Work as a remote executive assistant doing a range of tasksAverage pay: $18 to $35 per hour, according to UpworkI first heard the term virtual assistant (VA) in Tim Ferriss’ popular book The Four Hour Work Week. In the book, Tim discusses how to hire overseas virtual assistants for $5 to $15 per hour. But now the trend isn’t to hire a VA for $5 an hour — it’s to find the highest-quality VA possible… someone who will really add value to your business. And because of that, people are willing to pay significantly higher wages to the right person. So, instead of just doing boring, repetitive tasks, you’ll be working for a successful business owner as a remote executive assistant. Common tasks carried out by VAs include:  Answering email Booking travelManaging social mediaScheduling appointmentsAnd more, depending on the fieldSome VAs take on multiple clients, allowing them to earn over six-figures a year from home. The secret to earning a high income as a VA is offering the right services. That’s why I recommend downloading Gina Horkey’s list of 150 Services You Can Offer. Gina’s a six-figure VA herself, with loads of knowledge about the best services to offer for beginning VAs. Click here to download the list.

That’s why so many businesses today are looking to hire social media managers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a 10 percent job growth rate is expected for social media marketing managers between 2016 and 2026. As long as you have the ability to post, curate, and manage content on social media channels, you can start taking on clients today. But the big money is in learning how to effectively deploy paid advertising, such as Facebook ads. Businesses need new customer leads, and you can earn premium wages if you know how to use things like microtargeting to deliver ads to just the right audience. If you’re interested in making money as a social media manager, check out social media expert Phyllis Khare’s Free Social Media Consultant Starter Kit. #9) — FREELANCE WRITING Quick summary: Write blog posts, articles, advertisements, and more for clientsAverage pay: $15 to $40 per hour for beginnersFreelance writing is one of the more lucrative side hustles I’ve tried. I started small, but in a year I was earning over $100 an hour. Freelance writing is a skill that’s becoming more in-demand than ever. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the demand for writers is expected to grow by 6 percent from 2010 to 2020. Finding legit online jobs for writers can be difficult. That’s especially true if you’re competing for jobs the way most people do — against dozens of other writers who are all vying for low-paying gigs on job boards.  The key to launching a successful career as a freelance writer is choosing the right niche. You want to find a niche you’re passionate about… and one that makes good money. Need ideas of high-paying niches? Check out this list of 200+ high-paying freelance writing niches. #10) — SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION Quick summary: Help small business owners get found onlineAverage pay: $25 to $40 per hour for beginnersSearch engine optimization is the process of helping businesses get found online. In my experience, having managed local SEO campaigns in the past, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit. That means you can drive a lot of revenue to a business just by implementing a basic set of SEO “best practices.” Therefore, you can charge a high hourly or project rate, knowing you’ll deliver results. When it comes to SEO, I’ve invested a lot into my own education. One resource I found valuable and very affordable is Mike Pearson’s Stupid Simple SEO Course. The course only opens a few times each year, but adding your name to the waitlist scores you access to Mike’s excellent 5-day SEO Bootcamp. #11) — GRAPHIC DESIGNER Quick summary: Design visually-stimulating graphicsAverage pay: $25 to $40 per hour for beginnersFor the artists out there, becoming a graphic designer is a great way to monetize your hobby. The web is becoming more and more visual — especially as mobile devices become the primary method of browsing. The highest-paid graphic designers combine multiple skills into their designs. Knowledge in branding, sales, and direct response marketing allow many graphic designers to charge over $100 per hour. Check out Creative Live’s upcoming calendar for a list of free graphic design classes to attend.  #12) — VIDEO EDITING Quick summary: Create engaging videos for social media, YouTube, and websitesAverage pay: $25 to $35 per hour for beginnersAnother online trend that’s picking up more steam year-by-year is video editing. Video editors with experience are in high demand in 2019. And there’s potential to earn over $50 per hour the more you specialize. Check out Creative Live’s upcoming calendar for a list of free video editing classes to attend. #13) — MARKETING AUTOMATION SPECIALIST Quick summary: Design and implement automated marketing systemsAverage pay: $40+ per hour for beginnersI’m in a mastermind group that’s been meeting since 2009. We all do some type of marketing work as independent contractors for a range of businesses. We’ve each had our ups and downs. Yet, as I write this, things are going well for everyone. Connecting the dots, we realized that once we committed to specializing in a growing marketing platform, we had to actually start turning clients away. One of the fastest-growing segments is marketing automation, on platforms such as Ontraport and HubSpot. These platforms are experiencing explosive growth, and more are emerging all the time. Some other examples are Aweber, Convert Kit, and MailChimp. Taking a certification course to become a specialist can often land you in the $60 to $100 per hour range fast. See: Best Online Jobs for College Students#14) — SCOPING Quick summary: Edit transcripts for court reportersAverage pay: $20 to $30 per hour There’s a little-known work-from-home job that’s been around for 30+ years. It’s called scoping. A court reporter’s job is transcribing what’s said in the courtroom into written form, using a special system of shorthand so that they can keep up with the proceedings. Court reporters then hire scopists to edit their transcripts. Court reporters make money per page, not per hour. That’s why outsourcing the editing allows them to increase their earning potential. Similar to proofreading and bookkeeping, no certification is required, there are very minimal start-up costs, and the earning potential is high. If you’re interested, Linda Evenson — who has been a work-at-home scopist for 35-years — has a free course called Scoping: College Level-Income Without College-Level Costs. #15) — MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTION Quick summary: Edit medical transcriptions for local healthcare providersAverage pay: $10 to $25 per hourThere are dozens of data entry jobs online. Sites like Clickworker or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk provide typists with a lot of work opportunities. However, in order to make over $40,000 per year in data entry, you’ll need to specialize. And beyond scoping, one of the best ways to specialize in data entry is by focusing on medical transcription. The first thing to know about medical transcription is that it requires a certification, which you can get through a company like CareerStep. CareerStep offers a range of certifications in multiple work-at-home opportunities within the medical field. With their medical transcription certification, which is approved by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity, you’ll prepare yourself to land an online job in an industry that’s hungry for qualified talent. CareerStep courses are not cheap (they start at $2,999), but they do offer both payment plans and discounts for military spouses. Click here to learn more about CareerStep. If you’re not looking for a career and just want to make some extra money, there are a number of websites where you can get started with transcription on a more casual basis. The most popular sites are: Rev — make 36 to 65 cents per minute of audio transcribedGo Transcript — earn up to 60 cents per minute of audio transcribedScribe — pay starts at $5 to $25 per hour of audio transcribedDionData Solutions – hires only U.S.-based workers  #16) — VOICEOVER ARTISTQuick summary: Provide vocal recordings to be used in audiobooks, videos, films and moreAverage pay: $20 per hourVoice acting is the art of reading a script and using your voice to bring that script to life.

If so, you can make money online by flipping items for profit. Think of this side hustle as buying an asset and selling it for a higher price. Your inventory can be anything you find at a garage sale or on a clearance rack. The goal — and the key to making retail arbitrage work — is having an information advantage. This means understanding the market for what you’re buying better than the person who is selling that item. Remember, the concept of arbitrage is based on the principle that a particular good has a higher price in one place than it does in another. That might mean it sells for more in California than it does in New York. But it might also mean that it sells for more online than it does in a brick-and-mortar store. Winning at arbitrage means knowing how to figure out which items to buy and which ones to walk away from. Robert and Melissa Stephenson of Flea Market Flipper have a Free 5-Day Email Course on making money by flipping items. They made over $130,000 last year, so their course is definitely worth checking out to see if flipping is right for you. #19) — ETSY STORE OWNER Quick summary: Create and sell homemade crafts and digital products on the world’s largest creative marketplaceWhen it comes to legit work-from-home jobs for moms, Etsy is near the top.

It’s actually something me and a friend have dabbled in (although without much success so far). The idea is to buy products directly from a manufacturer or wholesaler, then sell them online on Amazon. The most popular option is to use Amazon FBA, which handles all the warehousing and shipping (the “fulfillment”) for you. In fact, you can even have the manufacturer or distributorship the products directly to Amazon, so that you never have to physically touch the items. But you don’t have to limit your selling to Amazon. You can also use FBA to ship products you sell on eBay or your own website. It’s much easier than packing and shipping everything yourself, and the shipping rates Amazon charges you are much lower than you’d pay to UPS or FedEx.

It just depends on finding the right niche. This is an especially good business for you if you have personal or professional travel experience because you can provide your clients with insights they can’t get from a website.  # 27) MEDICAL BILLING AND CODING Quick summary: Ensure patients and insurance companies are properly billed for medical servicesMany of us have had to deal with the hassle of calling our health insurance company because we were overcharged for a medical procedure — or were charged for a treatment we never even received. As a medical coder, you’ll help patients avoid this unpleasant experience by ensuring that providers correctly bill for their services based on a standardized, industry-wide set of codes. You’ll also play a vital role in ensuring patients’ health and safety. In addition to recording the specific treatments provided at a visit, you’ll be responsible for reading doctor’s notes, identifying their diagnosis, and translating that diagnoses into a simple code that can be populated across the patient’s health records — a process that makes it easy for future providers to quickly scan a patient’s health history. And you can make solid money. According to CareerStep, which offers industry-approved training and certification courses, average salaries for medical coders start at $50k+ per year, with projected job growth of more than 10% over the next 10 years. As a medical coder, you can work in a doctor’s office, at a hospital, or on-site for insurance companies. But there’s also strong demand for remote, part-time professionals who have the right knowledge and training.

Some Common and handy keyboard shortcuts Play/Pause the video- K Go back 5 seconds - left arrow Go back 10 seconds - J Go forward 5 seconds - right arrow Go forward 10 seconds - L Jump to 0%-90% of the video - Numbers 0–9 Increase play speed - Shift+> Decrease play speed - Shift+< Turn on/off captions - C Make caption font bigger - + Make caption font smaller - - 4. Keep your activity private On YouTube, you can make your subscriptions and more things private. While signed in, goto youtube.com/account_privacy and check the boxes you want.  5. Change the content you see (On YouTube app) On YouTube app you can change the content that you see. Go to Settings>General>Content location and choose the region.  6.

With My Speed, you can check your average speed (in Mbps) and compare it to neighboring cities, your state, the US and the entire world. While it may not be a mind blowing feature, it is very interesting and provides some incredible statistics. You can also scroll down and watch their Test Video, which shows you all of the connection and speed information in real-time. 2 Link to a Specific Playback Point Sometimes, when clicking on a link to a YouTube vid Continue Reading1 Compare Your Load Speeds to the Rest of the World Ever wondered how fast your YouTube video playback is compared to the rest of the the world? With My Speed, you can check your average speed (in Mbps) and compare it to neighboring cities, your state, the US and the entire world. While it may not be a mind blowing feature, it is very interesting and provides some incredible statistics. You can also scroll down and watch their Test Video, which shows you all of the connection and speed information in real-time. 2 Link to a Specific Playback Point Sometimes, when clicking on a link to a YouTube video, you're fast-forwarded to a specific point in the video. This is usually the case when the person who linked to the video intended for the viewer to watch that clip, without having to watch the rest of the video. If you want to do the same, here's how: Add #t= to the end of the video URL, followed by the minute you want (with an m) and then the second (with an s). An example would be #t=01m18s or #t=78s for 1:18 in the video. You can also just pause the video at the desired point, right-click on the video, and choose copy video URL at current time. This also works for embedding videos, so if you're posting it on your own blog or website, you can also cut out an extra step by embedding the video rather than linking to it. 3 Make Automatic Playlists with Disco Want to make an automatic YouTube video playlist of your favorite artist? Well, look no further than YouTube Disco. This feature allows you to type in your favorite artist's name and YouTube will create a playlist of all their hits. I did one for my favorite rapper, Chingy, and it created an awesome playlist for all my friends and family to enjoy. Chingy was da best. 4 Use Only Your Keyboard With Lean Back, you can turn YouTube into a keyboard-only interactive website. The site is overhauled with a unique and beautifully designed user interface that allows you to search for videos, while only using the arrow and enter keys. You can also just browse the site, if you don't want to search for anything specific. The sidebar is filled with icons corresponding to the most popular categories: sports, gaming, music and much more. 5 Load Videos Faster with Feather Do your videos not load as fast as you'd like them to? Feather (currently in beta) might be the answer you're looking for. This feature trims the fat off of each page by taking away things like expandable share boxes, collapsible comments, and other settings. Before Feather: After Feather: Give Feather a try and see if it makes a difference in your video load speeds. Not only that, but it may be a favorable layout for those who enjoy a more simplistic feel. 6 Watch What You're Feeling If you're feeling emotional, try out YouTube's hidden feature called Moodwall. Through the use of keywords and specific phrases in the comments of each video, YouTube specialists have devised an equation that separates all videos into specific moods. Whether you're feeling creative, gross, funny, amazing, sad, deep or intense, the experimental page has a category to appeal to your current state of mind. You can go through all the different categories on the left side of the screen, and if you want a fresh take, click twice on any one category and they will all change. 7 Play the Snake Game Probably one of the best known secrets of YouTube is the Snake_game. It's even in the Wikipedia entry. I remember playing that game on my old Nokia for hours on end. To play it on YouTube, all you need to do is hold down the left or right arrow key for a few seconds while the video is paused, then press the up arrow to start the game. This is especially useful if the video you're watching takes a long time to load, whether it's because it's in 1080p or your internet is acting up again. 8 Edit Your Videos Right in YouTube If you edit your videos before uploading them to YouTube, you might want to try out YouTube's Video Editor. With this free tool, you can: Combine multiple videos you've uploaded to create a new, longer video.Trim your uploads to custom lengths.Add a soundtrack from YouTube's library of approved tracks.Customize clips with special tools and filter effects.If you just need the basics, this is a great way to cut out an extra step rather than using another program. You might even be able to make it into a decent video editor. 10 Customize the Ads You See The peskiest part of YouTube are the ads. They pop up everywhere and always make you wait up to 30 seconds, just to watch a 5 second video of someone falling down on their ass. While you can't get rid of the ads, you can surely customize them. All you need to do is head over to Ad Preferences and remove whichever ads you don't want to appear. Not sure what advantages this has, but at least I don't have to watch those damn ads about how to treat erectile dysfunction anymore. 1 Play Videos in Slow Motion Did you know you can make any YouTube video play in slow motion? All you need to do is hold down the space bar and the video will start to play at a much slower speed. Never mess with grapes. If that doesn't satisfy your needs, you can also sign up for YouTube's HTML 5 Video Player, which allows you to slow down or speed up the video from the settings gear on the page. Unfortunately, the settings under the gear icon won't help you get through those annoying ads any faster. It only works on videos that aren't monetized because the ones with ads still use Flash.

Description: “Content is the Reason search began in the first place”. The most informative places of the video are Description which should be in-depth and keyword rich, as only first few lines or 160 characters will appear in search results and above the fold on a watch page- so make them count 125 characters for YouTub and 150 characters for Google.  Tags: Get to know the intricacies of tags and cleverly optimizing it with an SEO perspective. It helps is ranking up the video and show up in the related video section. So put right tags, use them wisely make sure to use relevant keywords related to the video.  2.

Similarly, you need to know your audience foremost, in order to capitalize the drive you want to create for your content. Looking into the tastes and preferences by organizing certain live Q&A through Hangout session or hold certain group discussions to talk, acknowledging comments, handling trolls with tacts throws you in the spotlight. This engagement and involvement with audience goes a long way in fostering not only cordial relations with present subscribers but also helps build up a far-reaching goodwill.  6.

This will strengthen your bond with the present followers of your work by introducing a new facet of your ‘body of work’ and give a boost to your subscribers.  8.Thumbnails, Thumbnails & Thumbnails: These miniature visual windows are the first point of contact for your videos. Remember how that adorable cat gif caught your fancy.

It is advisable that thumbnails should emphasize videos Titles, as together they build a cohesive story.  9. Optimize the Watch Time: Watch Time is an important metric for YouTube’s search ranking. YouTube suggests those videos to users that have longer watch time, not to those who have higher views. If you’re making videos that people are watching & spending more time on, then YouTube will suggest those videos to new users often. Watch Time is an important metric for YouTube’s search ranking. YouTube suggests those videos to users that have longer watch time, not to those who have higher views.

I got along well with my bosses, I did around 5x the work of the next productive employee in my group. Then I moved to another department, believing it would be a step up. This sadistic boss did crazy things to me. First he wanted me to pull a contract, change the terms of it, basically cheating the person whose it was. I was then to take it to a notary public, our floor secretary, have her stamp, sign, and backdate it. I told him this was wrong and asked him what he would do if I didn’t do it. He said he would fire me. Extortion. I could have hauled him off to court for this. But he continued his garbage. I went on a business trip to Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba.

He then went straight to his boss and told him I had got a car against his orders and had used it during work time to go to a festival! I went in to the big boss to talk about these things, and he obviously was part of the collusion. He brought up something totally different before I could even open my mouth, started attacking me because I wrote “crap” in an e-mail and because I suggested there might be problems with our software that needed fixing! He almost had me fired. This supervisor continued to do me dirt 4 more times before I finally left him. But it didn’t end there. He told my next boss I was lazy and didn’t do my work. He got into my medical business, suggesting in my year final reports I should reduce my medicines or switch to something else. Medical discrimination. He also accused me of working slowly. He harassed me every single day I was with him. Once he went purple in the face and screamed at me so the whole floor could hear calling me an incompetent over and over. He said I made data disappear from an Excel spreadsheet. I told him to calm down and I would look at it. Finally, after a couple hours, I realized there was a filter put on the data, which HE had personally done. I called him. No apology. He thought I was lazy even though I had high stats. He put me on a project with his star employee. We were supposed to work on the same thing for one month to see who was better. I beat her. But he continued to harass me every day, very illogical. But then evil works this way. There is much more about this guy, but I will forbear. Could he possibly have gone to court for the constant harassment (in the legal sense of the word)? I then had a third supervisor, who had also been “warned” about me. He also thought I was lazy. To get my goals, I would catalog 2200 parish records into our computer system per month. I worked Saturdays, Sundays, and late on weekends. It wasn’t fair to my family. I continually asked the sup what he wanted, that I felt like we should meet often about my goals. He just laughed and said, “nobody likes to meet with their supervisor that often”. I looked at the stats. I was always mid-way even though I had been given projects which were old, and necessitated an older stat calculation. I asked him to show the equivalency to the higher ups so they would know I was working hard. He just laughed and said, “they wouldn’t understand”. When I showed him I was doing 2200 parishes per month he simply said, “maybe you are just slow so you have to work the extra hours”. I said, “what does it matter? even if that’s true, I’m getting my work done. And you’ve been working in cataloging 30 years. Don’t you know good work when you see it?” Again, just another laugh. What really got my goat though was when he started opening my mail and reading it, my personal US mail! He put comments about what I had written in my year final reports and say that what I was doing (in my spare time btw) was not in line with his goals. I said, “that’s personal and has nothing to do with what I do on work time. Those are assignments given to me to work with on Sundays as part of my church calling! I even had the OK to go ahead from the Medieval Unit at work!” Then there is HR. They were worried about some photos I had. They were all of my relatives 100 years ago. Not like it was porn or something. Then the same day they were showing such interest and called me in for a meeting, they disappeared. Wow, I wonder who that could have been, who stole them? In the instance above with the extortion fun of the first supervisor, he was in bed with HR, too. They were pulling his strings to pull mine. Finally, I was let go, lied to, offered lots of money and insurance if I didn’t tell people the names of these people and the injustices they were involved in. I was lied to about why I was let go. I am actually grateful to have been let go from that job. I never did anything but my best. My crimes were probably in opening my mouth too much to offer suggestions about improvement. That implies somebody did something wrong. A lot of you will put no stock in this, as I do, because I believe in a personal God and in revelation. But my ecclesiastical leader, who was always very spiritually sensitive, always seemed to know what was going on before it happened. He suggested during my early time of things going south, that I get another job. He said it so often, I asked him why he was telling me that. He answered, “I just have the feeling that because of all the good you are doing, evil people at work will try to crush you soon.” I said, “but this has always been my dream job”. I had secured the rights to microfilm records in the Czech Republic with the Minister of the Interior, something everyone thought impossible. I was also in charge of cataloging them for patron usage. So there you have it. Yes, evil gathers around good and tries to destroy it. I try not to be bitter and just continue on with my life now, which is considerably pain-free. It sure beats going to work for 7 years with knots in your stomach all day. There have been several times in my life at which I have witnessed true evil. Here are just a few examples. My wife almost lost her career because someone took a personal dislike to her. My wife started a job at a veteran’s home when she was a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). Since it was a state job, it was a closed shop with a mandatory union, my wife was required to pay into the union for six months before receiving any union benefits. There was a particular Certified Nurse’s Assistant (CAN) there who took a dislike to my wife. This CNA then filed an incident report, that the CNA alleged she h Continue ReadingThere have been several times in my life at which I have witnessed true evil. Here are just a few examples. My wife almost lost her career because someone took a personal dislike to her. My wife started a job at a veteran’s home when she was a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). Since it was a state job, it was a closed shop with a mandatory union, my wife was required to pay into the union for six months before receiving any union benefits. There was a particular Certified Nurse’s Assistant (CAN) there who took a dislike to my wife. This CNA then filed an incident report, that the CNA alleged she heard my wife swear at a resident behind a closed door. My wife was put on administrative leave, an investigation was performed, and then my wife was called into a disciplinary hearing for the judgment. Just prior to the meeting the CNA indicated that she might have been mistaken, because if she is mistaken, there is no action against her, whereas a false accusation would be punishable. The union representative got up at the meeting indicated that they had exculpatory evidence, but chose not to present it. Because the union representative chose not to speak, as per union rules, my wife was not allowed to defend herself. She was fired, and the matter was referred to the professional regulations board governing LPNs as to whether action would be taken. Fortunately, the professional regulation board did their own investigation and did not find her guilty. My wife was able to collect unemployment (yes, one state agency decided the other state agency did not have sufficient grounds to fire her). My wife was able to find some work as a nurse that we could get by with. A year later, she tried to get a job with a more reputable nursing home, but was not able to because my wife’s CNA license was suspended. A “concerned citizen” had reached out to CNA regulation board after her professional license had been cleared. Fortunately, the decision on the CNA license was recent enough that they would hear an appeal. Once they received the documentation from the professional board for LPNs, they cleared her as well. Unfortunately, my wife still has a D rating and cannot be employed with any state run health business as a result. Here is the kicker: · The incident was alleged to have occurred on a night that my wife was not working · At 5 AM in the morning, when residents just woken up are yelling in the hall the CNA was standing in · Through a five inch thick closed steel door that was originally intended as a bomb shelter. So my wife almost lost her career because the union and a CNA that knew how to use the rules of that union to get rid of a nurse she did not like. The second would be my eldest son’s principal, and the viciousness and petty hate she directed towards my son and our family. This is not to say my son is entirely innocent, he can be a handful and I have received several concussions from him. But her behavior was inexcusable, she determined early on that my wife and I were nothing but trouble makers and bad parents. As my son got older we could tell there was something different about him and not in a good way. There were discipline problems at both home and school. By the end of first grade, we requested that he be tested for Special Education. A meeting was held and it was denied. We requested again in the fall of second grade, and spring, both denied (the school would not entertain a request more than once a semester). The educators in the meeting would play sick mind games like stating, “Why would you want your son to be tested? Why are you wishing a problem onto him?” We would respond that is not the case, we can tell something is wrong, but we do not know what. The principal always spearheaded the denial of problems, “ . . . does not have any learning disabilities, he just has behavior problems.” The pattern repeated for third and half of fourth grade. There were numerous discipline incidents (the school was very open about the fact with us that other students would usually start the incidents, but my son would inevitably receive a much harsher punishment. When my wife and I pointed this out this made my son an easy target, the principal would brush this aside that my son is just such a troublemaker that he had to be punished more severely), but I will limit myself to a few here. One of the most ridiculous incidents happened in third grade, when my son got into a fight in the lunchroom. The other kid started the incident, by saying to my son that my son wanted to sleep with one of the Special Education students who was physically handicapped. My son then had to have the other student explain what he meant. My son responded, “No, I don’t.” The other student replied, “Yes, you do.” My son replied, “No, you do.” They continued to argue back and forth until they were both sent to the office. My son without his lunch, the other student with his. The other student was sent back to class after missing lunch and recess. My son spent the rest of the afternoon in the office, was in more trouble for refusing to eat his lunch that had been sitting out for two hours before being brought to the office. Before we arrived there, he was also required to write a letter of apology, and was in more trouble for not completing that. He was also suspended. Why was he suspended and had to write a letter of apology? Because, the principal determined that my son had to be maliciously mocking the sexual desirability of the Special Education student because my son indicated that he did not want to have sex with her. My wife and I tried to point out that he was still a bit young, and underdeveloped on top of it to be expressing sexual interest. The principal responded, that could not be it, he had to just be hateful. You may have noticed above that we only made a request in the fall of my son’s fourth grade year. After my wife walked in on the principal towering over my son yelling at him and berating him for not completing another writing assignment. We wound up pulling my son out of that school and sending him a private school for a year and half. After that we were not able to continue with the private school because they indicated that they did what they could, but he needed Special Education services. We homeschooled him for a year while finding out more and more about Special Education. We finally were able to find a provider who would test independently (too many in the field work with school districts and will not test outside of sanctioning by a school district except as a second opinion). We testing my son and then went back to the school district about testing. We had a meeting, and suddenly they agreed that he needed to be tested. They based their assessment that he needed to be tested off of the same standardized test scores that they said two years ago indicated that he did not need to be tested. Our problems did not end there. They knew my son’s strengths and weaknesses, and tested to make him look as good as possible. Such as one of the things we were pushing for was language remediation. He is now in sixth grade, they tested for language and insisted he did not need language remediation, because his average score was only a year behind. His critical thinking with language tested in second grade, and sentence formation in third grade, and reading level third grade. They argued this was normal and balanced by his vocabulary which they scored at college level. They couldn’t explain the disparity, but just insisted it was “normal.” The school chose to ignore things related to this, such as that we were still reading to both him and his sister together every night, or the study that found a family owning books contributes to vocabulary levels. The study is in Freakonomics, pretty good book, the study compared book levels at levels between 0 and 100. I have not read the original study, but I have been tempted to look it up, by the way at the time, we had over 1700 books, with over 100 books appropriate to broad age category ranges. After establishing the base-line with the independent evaluation, our son’s autism was eventually diagnosed. His schizophrenia was also eventually diagnosed, his early descriptions of his hallucinations were blown off by professionals as an overactive imagination. During Discovery, because we were preparing for due process to sue the school, it was revealed that his first grade teacher had also recommended that he be tested at the same time we were requesting that in first grade. We wound up walking away from our house and filing bankruptcy. All because a bigoted tenured bleeding heart liberal assumed we were bad parents that had raised a problem child. You know, the one thing I do have to admit, the principal was right, autism is a developmental disability and schizophrenia is a mental illness, so my son did not have any learning disabilities. Edit: In thinking about this, I did also realize an omission I made which is relevant to the closing paragraph. The principal would engage in frequent ad hominem attacks that since I was not a liberal nor educated as a teacher, I was too stupid to make any meaningful contribution to the discussion about discipline of my child. Such as the above incident where I pointed out that he was not interested in any girls that way at this point. Exactly 2 years ago, a parasite came into my big family and almost ruined everything.

My uncle’s wife had inherited a land worth approximately $ 800,000 and later she sold the land. Money was never the root of evil, people was. His children who are obviously my cousins, were the closest cousins to me and my siblings, more than others. His wife is a very beautiful woman and a really good mother. My uncle is a lecturer for PhD in biology, his wage is above average but not that big, however in my Country it’s more than enough to get you a 300m2 2-story house with 2 cars. So I thought, with that amount of fortune, they should be happy for the rest of their lives. Sometime when life gives you lemons, you aren’t ready yet to make lemonade. Instead of living a happy life, everything was going down since my uncle’s wife inherited the money. She suddenly became a magnet to a bunch of gold diggers who claimed to be twice or thrice richer than my uncle. Apparently, she couldn’t handle and resist the temptations that came from that amount of money. A man who claimed he had a lot of money, properties, and land approached her, she fell for him, and divorced my uncle. Everyone reacted quickly to prevent the marriage from breaking down, but no luck, and she won the rights to take the children with her. Later she kicked my uncle from his own house making excuses that she needed the house because she brought the children with her. Meanwhile my uncle lived without anybody (luckily my uncle had another house next to my grandma’s home). She promised to give his house back after her new husband moved into town and bought her a new house. That was the strangest thing I ever heard, and I knew from that point something really wrong was going on. Her new husband moved into town, he didn’t buy a new house as promised. He prevented us from meeting our cousins, he said our family was a disgrace and brought bad influence. It’s been 2 years since the last time I met my cousins even though I tried to reach them through social media, they only read it and never replied my message. I knew they could have been indoctrinated by their new father to stop keeping in touch with us. As my patience was running thin, I decided to go to my cousins’ house. Beside that I also wanted to know the face of the new husband. As I arrived at my cousins’ house, I saw them playing on the frontyard, maybe the new husband knew who recently arrived was somebody from the ex-family, he shouted and barked to my cousins to get inside the house because I was using my uncle’s car. I knocked the door, no one opened the door, I started to knocking the door harder and louder, the new husband finally came out. He’s not like what I was thinking of. Honestly, I don’t and never like to judge people by its look, but for this one as my emotion was involved, I judged him as a fraud. Why? He’s almost bald, his teeth which full of tartar looked like he had been punched by McGregor, smoking unfiltered cigarette, his nail full of black things, and I couldn’t forget the alcohol smell was like I’m in Jack Daniel’s factory. I spoke to him I want to meet my cousins, I said I don’t care what’s happening between you and my family, I just wanted to meet my cousins. He didn’t allowed me because he didn’t want my cousins had any contact with their former family, we shouted at each other until He losing his patience and he tried to threaten me. He grab my T-Shirt and he yelled in front of my face telling me not to disturb his family again. The fight was inevitable, I punched him right on his nose and he started to bleed. I said to him he’s not a good father, growing fear and hatred to my cousins instead of giving explanation what’s going on and make them understand. That day explained to me a lot, he’s a fraud. Our family tried to investigate who he is, he claimed he’s a big boss of a holding company and have a lot of properties. He didn’t look like a boss or CEO, at least the way he think, speak, and look. He promised to buy new house for my aunt, but he never did (until today). We never found him on the Internet nor the company, we asked to a friend whose job is on the same field, he never heard the company either. After months, a relative of my aunt told us that the new husband didn’t had the fortune that he claimed before. He married my aunt because he broke and needed the money. Finally we found out that the new husband was only a driver who works for an illegal intercity travel company with lots of debt due to his addiction to gamble. Now I know the reason he tried to alienated us is because he doesn’t want anybody to find out the real person behind that false-claimed person. He done the work of evil by trying to steal someone’s money, deceiving my aunt, and ruining 24 years of marriage. Things now not so different, I still can’t reach my cousins (4 years and counting). A hefty amount of money made my aunt become a greedy woman. My uncle slowly but sure could get over it, all he wants is to meet his children but his ex-wife and the new husband wouldn’t approve that. It’s just sad my uncle has to paid the price for things he didn’t deserved. The only thing I can be sure of is my aunt and her new husband will never be a happy family. I want to know what will happen to them when they are running out of money. Unless they’re smart enough to save and spend the money. But I guess they’re not.",2021-03-05T10:36:40.103Z,"At what moment in your life did you witness true evil? ",Quora

Some people got iPads (yuck, what are you going to do without a mouse), others got Chromebooks (eh) and some schools got ancient Surfaces (in the world of school tech, these are top-of-the-line tech).

I’m going to tell you what this tech is actually used for in school. Basically, it prevents people from having to carry around textbooks…for the textbooks that do have online versions. Usually the thickest textbooks don’t have online versions, but the French one (which is thinner than a small novel) has an online version. We also use it to do essay drafting or answer questions on a document. Basically, stuff that would be done at home, we do it on the school device. Some slackers use them to type up their essays on the bus (Google Docs offline mode) and turn them in right on the deadline. And…we use Kahoot! on the laptops instead of our phones. That’s about all the educational usage of these devices in my school. Do any of these look like they’ll magically raise the grades of underfunded inner-city schools? I guess the textbook one could work…except not every textbook has an online version. Okay, so how is this a vaccines cause autism scenario? According to Justin Franco, a “vaccines cause autism” scenario is: wrongbased on false and cherry-picked databelieved by a small number of uneducated people who don’t understand the industrydebunked by professionals who work in the industryOkay, so “wrong” is pretty broad. Let’s save that for the end, and you can draw your own conclusions. Based on false and cherry-picked data. Well…you can’t cherry pick much data when there’s not much to begin with: “The data is pretty weak. It’s very difficult when we’re pressed to come up with convincing data” — Tom Vander Ark, the former executive director for education at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Source[1] Believed by people who don’t know about education: i.e., not teachers or students. The [school] district’s pitch was based not on the idea that test scores would rise, but that technology represented the future. School districts generally don’t know about education: I’ve heard this complaint from many of my teachers and this is no different. And the reason is also weak: “technology represents the future?” What kind of a reason is that? That’s common sense, how does it apply to education? And debunked by professionals: Overall, however, most large-scale evaluations have found mixed or no results for one-to-one initiatives. Source[2] And from these 3 points, it’s pretty obvious that “technology will solve educational problems” is a “vaccines cause autism” scenario. The argument from the proponents of huge tech spending in schools say: …look at all the other things students are doing: learning to use the Internet to research, learning to organize their work, learning to use professional writing tools, learning to collaborate with others. Karen Cator, director of the office of educational technology, USDOE. Learning to use the Internet to research: actually, most people haven’t learned this skill through school tech. Their research skills are basically limited to “ignore .com sites, look for .edu, use Google Scholar.” This is not something that’s particularly difficult to grasp. Professional writing tools: and what exactly does this do? Typing vs writing on paper. Schools no longer seem to teach typing, so I see a lot of my classmates finger-pecking essays (and they don’t finger-peck as fast as Matthew Bates does). I think they should use the tech to teach some actual typing skills that will help in an ever-expanding IT industry. Collaborate with others: This happened with group projects way before tech. Justin Franco[3] wrote in his answer why standardized testing is a “vaccine cause autism” scenario. And how is the success of tech in schools evaluated? By the faulty standardized testing method. Just from my personal experience, tech in schools is nice, but certainly not the silver bullet that politicians make it out to be. For that reason, I call it a “vaccines cause autism” scenario, even if it is nowhere as dangerous as people not vaccinating their children.

By far the most common response, and every time I hear it, I lean over and check the RAID status on their machine if it’s within arm’s reach (on Linux, for example, it’s a simple cat /proc/mdstat). Quite often, there’s already one failed disk that no one noticed. In most setups (usually RAID 1 or 5), that means the next drive failure would be catastrophic. If the system’s owner is watching over my shoulder, I expect to hear an “oh sh*t!” at this point. If I don’t hear it, I’ll make sure to explain the precariousness of the situation, in excruciating detail, till the owner goes “oh sh*t!” And, of course, RAID does nothing to help you recover from ransomware or other data corruption.  Trash can. File “resurrection” for desktop users, until they can’t find what they just trashed, because they actually deleted those files permanently to recover urgently-needed space…or they’d just cleared the trash. And, of course, the trash can does nothing to help you recover from ransomware or other data corruption.  Dropbox. This has at least some merit. Last I checked, Dropbox (and some other online storage providers like Google Drive) do preserve some number of file versions, so it’s theoretically possible to “go back in time” and recover a ransomed or accidentally-deleted file. But you’re putting your crown jewels in someone else’s hands, without any guarantees that they’ll safekeep them for you in the manner that meets your eventual needs. If online storage is your only backup…it’s better than nothing, but not by much.  And then there’s the one that takes the cake, eats it, and farts vanilla-scented gas: If I do backups, my drives will surely die. My colleague just did his backup, and now his PC’s dead!  Why won’t you listen, sheeple?!?! BACKUPS CAUSE DRIVE FAILURES! Vaccines cause autism! Gravity kills! (OK, that last one has at least some correlation with reality.)  Sidenote: If you’re wondering what I consider to be “proper backups”, I start with the popular and easy-to-remember 3-2-1 Backup Strategy, then add some enhancements: The original file is not counted—I always have at least 3 backup copies.My backup media is always offline outside of backup times. Both physical and cloud drives are left unmounted until needed, to protect against marauding ransomware or out-of-control rm -fr jobs.I rotate my physical backup media. For instance, I have three flash drives for my Git repo backups, one for each month in a calendar quarter. The two not currently in use are kept by my business partners, as an added precaution. (This drive set counts as only one of my 3 backup copies, in case it wasn’t clear.)I test-read all my backups as soon as I make them. One of my earliest Quora answers documents my backup testing one-liner that’s run automatically at the end of every backup, to trigger errors in defective media. This has already caught a few dodgy backup drives before I needed to use their contents for recovery purposes. “Vaccines cause autism”, what I would define as a misguided belief, based on poor research or anecdotal evidence that causes people to avoid life saving actions.

In my industry, EMS, I would pick a few: “I can drive him/her to the hospital faster than the ambulance can get here.” A person is experiencing symptoms of a life threatening illness, or has a serious injury. The person with the victim knows that it will take the ambulance 10 minutes to get to the scene, so they elect to drive the patient to the hospital rather than calling 911. Where I work, that is a 40 minute drive. Yes, he is correct, he can drive the patient to the hospital and get there 10 minutes faster than the ambulance would have. During that 40 minutes, there will be no treatment other than motion towards the emergency room. If the person goes into cardiac arrest or bleeding can’t be controlled, there is little or nothing he can do about it. In the case of trauma, you might actually paralyze or kill the person trying to move him to your car. While the ambulance will take slightly longer, the entire trip will not consist merely of motion toward a higher level of care. The patient will be assessed to find the nature of the illness, and will be treated for that illness in cooperation with a medical control doctor. The EMS crew will treat heart attack symptoms with aspirin, nitroglycerin, IV fluids, and oxygen. 12 lead EKGs will be performed so the receiving doctor will be able to see exactly what was occurring at the time. Injuries can be bandaged, splinted, pain can be managed, burns treated, blood pressure raised with IV fluid, collapsed lungs decompressed, etc. Potentially fatal allergic reactions can be stopped quickly with epinephrine. So the real choice is, “Do I call the ambulance and have treatment start in 10 minutes, or do I drive to the hospital and have treatment start in 40 minutes?” “Seat belts trap you in the car, I know (or have heard a story about) someone who was thrown clear of the car and it saved his life.” I have heard this from many people. This is a line of such pure BS, that it could fertilize the Sahara. The idea is that of you were involved in a crash that crushed your car, or sent a large piece of debris through your windshield, the seat belt would indirectly cause your death by holding you in place to be crushed, impaled, or burned. One day, after being told this piece of life saving information, I asked the person to try something.

This person knows that walking into a hard object at 3–4 mph (about 5 kph) will be painful and might cause injury. But that same person believes that hitting a solid object at highway speeds will somehow save his life. The logic at work here is in the realm of fantasy. The fact is that seat belts save lives.

Everyone in linux community knows that Windows rules the desktop market, although that is changing rapidly. Ubuntu is not even the most popular distro, Mint takes that spot by providing a Windows-like (which unfortunately many think as user-friendly) appearance over ubuntu base.. Now, people consider Linux to be better in general for freedom. You can’t disable cortana in Windows, which is outright spyware. you can’t disable updates in Win 10 anymore, stuck with that metro looking desktop, forces its products down my throat like office as a shortcut in start menu, cannot remove a lot of apps like groove music, pictures app, and other system apps which i don’t want, etc.. Now, windows has been a standard and so has better drivers(especially the graphic drivers like nvidia which are closed source), it has made huge contributions to PC tech by being a standard allowing people to develop a wide range of software.. that’s the only positive features i can think of. Linux doesn’t usually restrict you like that. you can update only if you want, you can remove any app that is not necessary(actually the ones even necessary), there are more than one desktop environments which allow us to choose the one we like, uses less resources, supports even older hardware(which by the way, win doesn’t), gives you terminal which is powerful in its own right, has a lot of tools installed by default like compiler, essential apps(you can select the ones you want too), has a playstore like system to install apps making even newbies not install virus from internet, and the best of all is free as in free beer and freedom. Linux provides you with freedom to choose how you want your own damn computer to work. You have little resources, install puppy, you want no desktop at all, sure install arch as a barebones, you want an idiot-proof desktop, install gnome which is the simplest a desktop can become, you want more customization, sure install arch, you can’t bother to learn all this stuff and want everything pre-decided like windows, get KaOS or Solus which have very sane defaults.. The attractive feature of Linux is that it got almost every single one of your needs covered. From servers and routers to your android and raspberry pi, you can use it everywhere.. The Opensource community will make sure that the apps or OS you use will not spy on you or restrict your freedom in any way. As the hardware driver support is increasing day by day due to many games coming to linux and things like vulkan and opengl gaining momentum, Windows will get competition from Linux as a mainstream OS. That’s the reason Windows got the linux subsystem feature to keep developers from leaving win for linux. Once linux has graphics support comparable to windows, Then, we can actually see which one’s a better OS. Well I won't say Ubuntu is better than Windows or vice versa, but there are things Ubuntu does better. Some of them are : Lighter and Faster : Ubuntu 20.04 is very optimised and take less resources which result faster performance in lower end hardware and size of Ubuntu is lesser than Windows 10 which we are comparing.Secure : There is no doubt that Linux is more secure than Windows, there are more virus made for Windows so there is great chance of getting virus in Window than Linux also there have been controversy about Windows selling user information.

There is also Windows OS for server called Windows Server whose existence is a joke.Tools for development or hacking : Kali Linux is considered the best for hacking. Well Ubuntu and Kali are Debian based so you can install it's tools in Ubuntu. Talking about Windows I don't think tools are mostly available for it and you don't want to do it in Windows.Freedom : Without some exception, you can do anything with Ubuntu system, you can change how your desktop environment and free to do anything with your OS.Free : I don't think I need to explain this but Ubuntu and you can save penny than buying Windows.Hope it helped you.

You don't actually say what you want* from your next role/career move, which makes a little hard to advise you but based on what information you do provide: You seem to be occupying a half-way house (almost) between tactical and strategy. That is to say in simple terms 65% of your time is spent as a 'do-er' and 30% in helping define the tasks to be done, with the remaining 5% as misc. or whatever is in there (ignore this 5% is my advice, everyone does 'misc', unless it includes fighting zombies or rescuing princesses, no one is interested). So I'm going to take a wild assed guess and hazard that you want to move more towards deciding strategy then executing the tasks that support that strategy.  On the basis of that assumption and given that - as above - I have no idea of actual job titles within your industry, I would go for something like:  ""Campaign Management Aide: Analytics and Strategy"". Where a sub bullet or other indicator would make clear that your main role (as I interpret it from the information given) was to act as a layer between the 'do-ers' on the ground and the Campaign Management Stakeholders/leaders.  I feel this indicates that while a large amount of your work was tactical execution, you were nonetheless trusted to take on a significant amount of strategic input - you don't get to sit at the top table (if only to listen at first) without good reason. With enough concrete examples of total competence at doing and [some] success at the strategic part, this may help parlay your current role into more of a leadership one.  Then again, the word 'aide' may be pure poison in your milieu, I just have no idea. I'd stay well away from the word 'lead' however unless you truly were at the top of your particular pyramid (or pyramidette).  Hope this helps, happy to refine further if you want to share more information as to what it is you want etc. .

There has been many cases of patient abuse, wrong therapy and misdiagnosis which lead to patient suffering from over dosage of psychiatric medicines or wrong medicines being prescribed for several years before the patient realises that it has worsened their condition. Lastly, in India there is no accredition system for Mental Health Professionals, anybody with a Mphil., MA Psychology or Phd., starts practicing without a license. One cannot complain to an external Ethics Committee. Mental Health Professionals at NIMHANS do not fear the law. The Ethics Committee is useless. This sort of behaviour in terms of not fearing the law and misbehaving with Patients is actually embedded in the Psyche of the Students graduating from there.

I think not. Now, I am not saying that a corporation shouldn’t cater to the customer’s needs and strive to create a pleasant shopping experience. In fact, if a business does not do this, it will surely fail. The customer pays the salary of every single employee from the CEO right down to the poor bastard collecting carts in the sweltering heat of a blacktop parking lot and every person in every company in the supply chain that leads to the store in which the customer is making a purchase. So. The customer is important but NOT always right. Selfridge’s statement caught on like a wildfire. Customer’s far and wide felt empowered and important. His assertion also created an environment in which employees are “wrong” in just about every interaction where there is a conflict … the customer wants to return an item outside of the company’s return policy and the employee denies the return? The customer is always right. … the customer wants a discount because (insert reason here)? The customer is always right. … the customer wants to berate an employee for not knowing where to find item X in the store? The customer is always right. … the customer wants … well, you get my drift. What about the employee that is just trying to do their job to the best of their ability and is stepped on by the customer? Who is right in that instance? Again, I will state categorically that the customer is the most important person to any corporation regardless of the company’s line of business. Importance, however, does not confer “rightness,” and if a customer behaves in a manner that harms the business, then THAT customer is dead wrong. So … to answer your question … yes, I have snapped at a customer and gotten away with it … on more than one occasion. I know that a customer treating an employee with disrespect is just being a bully in the worst sense of the word and I don’t suffer bullies lightly. The paint company we were a distributor for made paint samples in a 2 oz. size. Unfortunately, they didn’t have a sample for all of the 3000+ colors in their pallette. In fact, they had only chosen 144 of those colors and the colors were not changed regardless of demographic or regional preferences. Every distributor from the East Coast to the West Coast of the U.S.A. had the same samples. A customer walked into my store and wanted a sample of a color not included in the 144. When I notified him that it was not available but that I could make it for him in an 8 oz. size, he went ballistic. “You mean to tell me that you are going to charge me $4.95 for something I should be able to get for $1.99!?! That’s f**king stupid!” I waited for him to stop talking to my employee and then, in as stern a tone as I’m capable (VERY capable when I set my mind to it), I said, “I’ll be happy to sell you that sample for $3.99, but you won’t get a DAMN thing in this store unless you change your tone of voice and your insolent manner!” I absolutely hate confrontation and have to force myself to engage in that type of behavior. I took the customer’s order, made his sample, and completed the transaction. All the while shaking in my boots from the emotion I felt. A few days later, he came back into the store and I happened to be the person to take his order. Despite the acrimonious tone of our previous encounter, I didn’t recognize him and when he mentioned it, I was apologetic. “No, no,” he said, “you were right to act the way you did. I was wrong for getting angry. I am sorry for treating your employee so badly. It is I who should apologize.” The customer is NOT always right. I’m almost always aware of what is going on around me regardless of the task I’m currently involved with … something women seem to do better than men. Women 'better multitaskers' than men Proof that women ARE better multi-taskers I was completing a transaction with a customer when I heard another customer begin to shout at one of my colleagues because she had told him she couldn’t process a return. I hadn’t listened to the actual conversation until the volume started to rise and as soon as I finished with my customer, I turned toward the altercation, shouted “Hey!” and strode across the floor to where the man was in the process of using profanity and an obnoxiously loud tone to intimidate my co-worker. As I moved, I maintained a steady but no-nonsense tone to inform the customer that his language was completely uncalled for and told him that bullying an employee was not going to be tolerated. He almost immediately changed his physical stance and began to apologize to me. By that time I was standing directly in front of him and said, “I’m not the person you should be apologizing to.” The customer is not always right. Oh, the stories I could tell of the people I’ve completely lost my cool at and gotten away with it. Story #1. Context: My first job was at this place called the pretzel factory. We had two counters.

We had no door to keep anyone out and would constantly have to keep telling them to get out Continue ReadingOh, the stories I could tell of the people I’ve completely lost my cool at and gotten away with it. Story #1. Context: My first job was at this place called the pretzel factory. We had two counters. The first countertop was where the glass case was (it held the mini and cinnamon pretzels, hot dogs, sausages, and later the cheesteak and pizza pretzels, etc).  There was a gap between that counter and the 2nd counter, where we would keep all the regular sized pretzels. The cash register was on the first counter. We had no door to keep anyone out and would constantly have to keep telling them to get out from behind the counter. I can’t even tell you how many times I was baking pretzels only to turn around and see a customer just calmly making their way through the store unannounced until someone finally told them “you can’t be back here”. It looked something like this (this is not the location I worked at; I couldn’t find any interior pictures of that place):  The Story: One day, my 2nd manager was on the register. I was baking pretzels as usual. This woman and her husband walked into the store. Since the store was located firmly in “ghetto” territory, the woman looked something like this:  She asked for some pretzels, but she was real specific about which ones she wanted. She kept pointing across the counter and saying “that one, that one!”. I went over to put the pretzels in the bag, but first I needed to figure out which pretzels she actually wanted. The manager came over to help as well. Now, generally we’d keep about 60 pretzels up front at a time (20 pretzels to a board).  (That’s not me^, that’s the company founder and CEO) Both me and my manager LITERALLY pointed at every pretzel on that board, but she apparently didn’t want ANY of them. She just kept going “No, THAT one!” Me and my manager were like “we pointed at ALL of them and you said no to ALL of them!” We both kept our cool but she was seriously irritating us. Her husband said nothing. So she snaps and comes behind the counter all like “I told y’all I wanted THIS ONE, now ya’ll motha fuckas gimme THIS ONE!” My manager was freaked out, and I was trying to stay calm. Still, her husband said nothing to stop her behavior or attempt to calm her down in any way. “Ma’am, you can’t be back here” “FUCK YOU, GIMME MAH GODDAMN PRETZELS!” “Ma’am, I will get you your pretzels, but you have to get out from behind the counter-” “I AIN’T DOIN’ SHIT! YOU JUST BETTER GIMME MAH FUCKIN’ PRETZELS!” (she’s jabbing her finger in my face now) “Please get out from behind the counter.” (she’s still shouting and carrying on. My manager tries next, but it doesn’t work) “Get out from behind the counter. (a little louder now)” (still carrying on. my manager is basically up against the wall at this point, hoping she won’t have to defend herself) I broke. “BITCH, GET YOUR ASS OUT FROM BEHIND THE FUCKIN’ COUNTER!” “HEY, BOY!” (NOW the husband speaks up) “FUCK YOU, YOU DIDN’T SAY SHIT WHILE SHE WAS BEHIND THE COUNTER CURSING MY ASS OUT, YOU DICKLESS FUCK! GET THE FUCK OUT FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER!” (It was the sort of rage where you start spitting your “Fs” like “Get the PPHPBPHPPBHPFFFUCK OUT”) (unintelligible shouting from multiple people all cursing each other out at once, with lots of “fucks” and “mother fuckers” thrown in there) “Omg, Alex, just calm down!” (my manager) At some point the husband FINALLY started trying to pull her away because I was visibly shaking from the rage and adrenaline coursing through my veins. I don’t remember if they ever got their pretzels or not. I only remember that they finally left. My manager was like “Alex, you can’t be snapping at people like that”. “No, your back was up against the wall. I don’t care who it is, man or woman, I’ll knock em’ right on their ass if they think they’re gonna come into MY store and threaten MY coworkers!” (lessons learned from my FIRST manager) So that’s one of many, Many, MANY, MANY stories I have from the pretzel factory. If you want more, let me know in the comments. ————————————————————————————————————- Story #2. As my “career” moved forwards at the pretzel factory, the veteran employees began to move on to other jobs, and all the new people who showed up would never stay for very long (I myself worked that job for 5 years). Where my job used to be simply Baker/Cashier, it quickly became Baker/Cashier/Key Holder/Employee Trainer/”Be on call at all possible hours”. And of course, the GENIUSES that were “Corporate” decided to have us keep the store open even on Sundays, definitively making us open every day. At least before, no matter how bad things got, I always knew I had a day where literally no one would be calling my phone. But no longer. I like to think I took it pretty well.  As the new employees were unreliable, most responsibilities that were once shared by everyone were placed on my shoulders. The (now 3rd) manager would often promise that someone would be there at the store and no one would call me, but always, my phone would ring at 4 in the morning and I’d have to go and set up shop by myself because the guy who was SUPPOSED to be there was high on weed again, or getting jumped in an alley because he was trying to buy something illegal, or was homeless, or some other crazy thing. We were supposed to open at 6, though one day I was forced to handle everything in the store until well after 11 (mixing the dough, twisting the pretzels, baking the pretzels, handling the register, handling the phone, baking the orders (upwards of one hundred pretzels on average), and making sure everything didn’t go completely to shit). So of course, I was just feeling SO. HAPPY. Now, I’m sure that any of you who have worked fast food, or in restaurants, know that when a customer orders something, you repeat the order out loud so that anything you get wrong can be corrected, and once you get it right, you repeat it once more just to be safe, and the customer confirms. So one day, this woman walks into the store. It was summertime, and we were selling large, medium and small cups of water ice.  She walks up to the counter and asks for a small cherry water ice. “Alright, ma’am, one small cherry water ice?” “THAT’S WHAT I JUST SAID, IS YOU HARD OF HEARIN’?!” (what the hell, lady? Well, whatever, if I give her the wrong thing, it’s on her, and then I’ll just correct it that way. No need to snap today. I’m already having periodic chest pains as it is.) So I turn around and begin scooping the water ice (even our small cups were rather large). As I’m scooping, a particular sound begins to find its way into my ears. “……don’t know what’s wrong wit’chall, dumbass motha fuckin’ kids don’t even listen, man…..” (IS THIS BITCH STILL GOING ON?!) I dumped all the water ice back into the container and I just sat there. “Where’s mah water ice?!” (silence) “What, you don’t wanna serve me now?” “No, I don’t.” (she says some smartass comment I can’t remember) “Fuck you.” “WHAT?!” “You heard me. Fuck you.” “Fuck you!” No, FUCK YOU!” The only other veteran coworker at the time was working with me. He rushes to the counter and has to physically drag me to the back of the store, while I’m giving her the hardest double bird I can possibly manage. I figured “if I can only flip her off HARD enough, maybe she’ll spontaneously combust!”  My coworker gave her the water ice, and she gave me this evil look as she walked out. I was all like  ———————————————————————————————————- Story #3. All the crazies came out at night. Generally junkies and homeless people with mental problems (or both). If you were really unlucky it was some roving gang of thugs messing with everyone they came across (I was once mistaken for some other guy who got one of them put in prison; they realized their mistake only as they were coming all the way into the store to get to me. Not even an apology, like maybe “hey, sorry we almost tried to kill you over a case of mistaken identity”. Bastards). Anyway, one night we were all in the store. I was somewhere in the back, when all of a sudden our cashier girl goes running past me to the back screaming. Apparently, some crazy homeless guy kept coming into the store and saying he was going to kill her. Everyone else thought it was pretty funny, but I engaged my “Oh, FUCK NO” mode and grabbed my spade (the thing we used to get pretzels out of the oven).  When he saw me grab the spade he walked across the street but kept shouting at us from a distance. I emptied my pockets (to keep from breaking anything or hurting myself if I fell down) and began to walk to the curb. I was pretty much determined to kick his ass and then shear the dude’s head off like Johnny Cage did to Scorpion in the Mortal Kombat movie. (2:26 is what you’re looking for)  Luckily for both of us, my other coworkers stopped me from severely injuring a crazy homeless guy. Story #4. We had this one lady who used to come into the store almost every day. I was once close enough to her to see her eyes, and I tell you, the woman had no pupils. It was freaky.  So I of course gave her the nickname of “The Soul-less One”. The Soul-less One was an odd person. She was the sort of woman who was in her mid-50’s but was still trying to look and act as if she was still young. She was always coming into the store with multi-colored yoga pants, some sort of gaudy jacket, and hair that reminded you of a rooster.   And nothing was ever good enough for her. Her daily order was always for 50–100 pretzels, “cooked light”. Generally, when you make a pretzel, it’s supposed to look like this:  A nice, deep golden brown, cooked for 7–8 minutes at 550 degrees Fahrenheit. This sort of “glow” to the pretzel indicates that it is fully cooked. Any darker, and you’ve gone into “over-cooked” or “burnt” territory. Anything less is UNDER-cooked. As bakers, it was drilled into our heads that the above image was the ideal way to make a pretzel, both for customer satisfaction and for legal reasons (we used a caustic solution on the pretzels (Sodium Hydroxide mixed with water), and if it was not fully cooked, the acidic nature of the solution would not be fully evaporated in the oven, leading to a burning sensation in the mouth). So every time this woman came into the store, I would bake “light” pretzels for her. And every time she would complain that, last time she got them, they weren’t “light” enough. I was trying my hardest to create a paradox: A pretzel that wasn’t fully cooked but was somehow still cooked enough for customer satisfaction. It would be understandable if it were a steak or a burger, but it wasn’t. This ritual continued for several years. I’d make the pretzels, and she would complain about them. But one day she came in a bit more angry than usual. “Why can’t y’all make pretzels cooked light?!” she exclaimed (all things considered, she was much more polite in her anger than most customers). She saw me putting pretzels in the oven (completely raw at that point) and said “Yeah, I want em’ like THAT! Make em’ light like THAT!” By that point I had already dealt with most of my shift and the crazyness that came with it. I didn’t snap like I normally did, but I was still pretty upset. “Are you SERIOUS?!” “What do you mean?” “When you ask for pretzels “baked light”, you’re ACTUALLY asking for pretzels that aren’t fully cooked! I can’t GIVE you THOSE pretzels because they’re literally RAW at this point, and nobody has time for a lawsuit because we sold you RAW DOUGH.” “Wow, really? I didn’t even realize.” “Yeah, when you get pretzels that aren’t that “light”, it’s because I can’t, in good conscience, give you a pretzel that is baked below a certain point.” She paid for her pretzels and left on good terms. And then of course she came right back the next day complaining as usual. Story #5. This is the last of my personal stories (if you want general stories of the things that have happened at the pretzel factory, then you’ll have to ask something along the lines of “what are your crazy stories from your jobs”). Anyway: During the last days of my employment at the Pretzel Factory, my 3rd manager brought his dad into the store to help him run things. I can say with the utmost certainty that this was the time when I was the most consistently angry with my job and my manager. The “dad” wasn’t even officially working with the Pretzel Factory Franchise, nor was he officially hired as an assistant. None of us worked for him, none of us was legally obligated to do anything he said, and yet he had this sort of pushy, “I’m older and wiser, so I don’t have to hear anything you say” personality. Even if we actively tried to stop his terrible ideas, he would physically push us out of the way and do it anyway. And none of us could really do anything back to the guy since he was the manager’s dad. When we would store our pretzels in the case, there was a metal grate separating the product from the actual bottom of the containers. This was to prevent the product from “sweating” onto the steel and creating problems later on.  (You can see the grate in the upper right corner^). One of the things the “dad” would do would be to fill the bottom of the container with water, as the product would become more and more dry the longer you left it in there, and at the end of the day, you couldn’t replace it because there wasn’t enough customer flow to justify doing so. You might think that this would work, and that the pretzels would be kept moist and appetizing. But they actually became soggy, and began looking as if they were diseased, resulting in a larger amount of customer complaints. And of course, since no one knew about the inner workings of the store, those complaints would be leveled at me, specifically. “Man, you need to learn how to cook, man!” and other crap like that. I tried to protest the situation. “I’ve been working this job for 5 years! I know what works and what doesn’t!” Or at least, that’s what I TRIED to say. I only got as far as “I’ve been working here for 5 years” before he cut me off and said “That don’t mean nothin’ to me” (he himself apparently had 20 years of experience working in the food business). I understood that he had experience in OTHER places, but none of those places were HERE. He had no real stake in the store or the franchise, and not a single bit of any consequences from HIS actions would actually reach HIM. Instead, all the anger and blame would be directed at us, the employees. He also had a bad habit of making himself everyone’s father figure (without asking). He once cornered me in the back of the store and wouldn’t let me leave until I “looked him in the eyes” (I have a habit of NOT doing that, but the reasons for such things are far more complex than simple “shyness” or “weakness”). He also would talk about my masturbatory habits as if they were any of his business. One day I finally lost it. He’d been touching my shoulder in an attempt to get me to calm down and “see reason”, and all I wanted was for him to STOP. TOUCHING. ME.  “GODDAMMIT, JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!” “Alex, calm down, man!” “NO! HE’S NOT EVEN MY GODDAMN MANAGER BUT EVERY DAY HE’S IN HERE ACTING LIKE HE’S TOP SHELF SHIT! I DON’T WORK FOR HIM! HE’S NOT MY BOSS!” “But he’s my dad!” “I DON’T CARE WHO HE IS! JUST KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME!” Eventually I just stopped caring about anything. Veteran employees would come to visit, see the state of things and ask ME, “why don’t you teach them the right way to do things? How could you let it get this bad?” I’d just shrug. No one would listen to me anyway. They even bumped down the temperature of the oven from 550 degrees to 500, and even screwed up the caustic solution on multiple occasions, resulting in chalky, sub-par pretzels. And then of course they’d ask me to train the new employees, but everything I taught them would immediately be superseded. I’d teach them that the oven should always be at 550, and they’d turn it down to 500. I’d teach them about the proper caustic solution ratio, only to have the other employees teach them to screw it up. Kind of hard to “teach” people anything when no one gives a shit about what the teacher has to say. Our more regular customers would start specifically waiting until my shift started before ordering pretzels, because they knew mine were good. At that point, I didn’t even really feel anything. I should have felt good to get such a compliment, but I didn’t. I just felt a sort of numb, hopeless rage. Eventually I got fired from the place (best day of my life, frankly), and life immediately started looking up. Even now, no matter how bad things get, I can always say “at least I’m not working at the pretzel factory”. For nearly two decades I’ve traveled to small and large retail events in the quilt show circuit to market a product line of glass bead mixes for sewn embellishment. As this particular small show didn’t have a land line in the fairground building to run our cards (this was before wireless machines were used), I and a friend sharing the booth were using those older portable slides, aka knuckle-busters, to transfer the number of a credit card to the paper slips, finish the total with handwritten pen and have the customer add their signature.

As this particular small show didn’t have a land line in the fairground building to run our cards (this was before wireless machines were used), I and a friend sharing the booth were using those older portable slides, aka knuckle-busters, to transfer the number of a credit card to the paper slips, finish the total with handwritten pen and have the customer add their signature. It was old school but every customer was being quite reasonable. Since we were basically taking our chances running the cards later in the hotel, we requested their address and phone number in case “we needed to contact them” plus the assurance that the use of the address went no further without permission. Again, no one resisted this simple request until this markedly well-dressed slender woman laughed in my face as she signed the credit slip. “You can’t ask this information of me. I don’t have to give you an address or phone number. I sued a dress shop in ____ for demanding that information and I see no reason to give it to you”. For a long moment, we stared at each other. I recovered and said, “I don’t use the information beyond a possible phone call if something goes amiss with the credit transaction later today. We don’t sell contact information.” She fluttered her hand at the bag of goods still in my hand while stating impatiently, “It’s against the law to request that information. You can’t do that. And I don’t have much time left to see the rest of show”. Again she gestured to the bag I held. I swung the bag away and beneath the table and handed back her credit card. I kept my voice low so that a scene wouldn’t escalate and replied, “I will no longer accept your card. If you want your purchase it will be cash. If you don’t have cash, I might accept a check which had better have an address and contact number on it.” She looked angry and snapped rather loudly, “You can’t refuse my credit card. Is your manager present?” My friend later told me I chuckled as I started to tear the credit slip into small strips; I don’t remember because I was angry enough to need to choose my words carefully. While completing a pile of paper confetti, I spelled out, “The booth you are in is MY business. I AM the owner. I can refuse to sell my products to anyone if I feel that the terms of the transaction put me at risk. I sense you are now a RISK. I think we are now looking at a cash sale.” She sputtered. She declared she didn’t have any cash. I lifted my eyebrows and shrugged. She sputtered again. She looked both ways and handed back her credit card as she finally muttered she’d provide her phone and address. I marshaled my angry face back to serene and repeated writing up a new credit slip, requested her driver’s license to verify the signature on the back of the credit card (this startled her but she didn’t object), copied down the address from the license and had her sign and add a phone number. My parting shot as I handed her the bag of goods she purchased was that every booth in the room likely had the owner present and, caution, we were all having to work around unusual conditions in dealing with credit sales. It would be unwise to repeat the first half of this transaction with anyone else. She murmured something akin to “I understand”, and melted into the crowd. The customer that had been waiting behind her, smiled sweetly as she handed me her goods to be rung through the register, adding emphatically, “I don’t have any problem with giving you the information you need.” Nearly all the customers we’ve met at these events have been the proverbial salt of the earth and usually quite charming. Save this one full of the strangest hubris. In my wildest stretch of imagination, I would not have thought of someone describing how they had sued a shop and then be surprised when an alarmed owner, listening to this information, pushed back.",2021-03-05T10:41:19.200Z,"Have you ever snapped at a rude customer and gotten away with it?

Maze of brands:But, what is dirty is how they structure a store in every possible way to make you unconsciously choose to spend more money, and milk every cent possible before you exit a store. This is by leveraging on our human biases (loopholes in our brains) to get us to be as irrational as possible. You will find only one entrance and one exit (excluding the emergency exits) in most supermarkets. Also, the aisles will be arranged in a way to place essentials such as rice or toilet paper at the very end. So, one will have to walk through a plethora of products and brands — persuading to purchase something or the other along the way that you might not even have planned to get.  Eye-level shelves: Stores and brands consistently try to upsell — i.e. get consumers to buy premium or bigger value products for better profits. One of the ways is the planogram (assortment of the store shelves). Next time, if you pay attention, you’ll find bigger value/premium products at the eye-level shelves, as opposed to smaller/cheaper packs at the very bottom in most categories. How often would one consciously look at the bottom shelves? And how often would you bend and go all the way down to pick those instead of just taking a ‘better brand’ at eye-level which is just “a few cents more”? Note the descending order of pack sizes/price below:  POSM (Point of Sale Materials): Advertising is not only what you see on YouTube or TV. Even in stores, brands try to grab your attention through POSMs:  Well,;grabbing your attention may not be a dirty trick. How about using loopholes in one’s brain such as ‘anchoring bias’:  Notice how “up to” is small? It is to anchor the “50% discount”. Even if you think “well it’s only up to 50%”, you still would want to check the products out. Now, did you know how long you have been in a supermarket? Have you ever noticed a window in a large supermarket? Or a clock at least? Supermarkets are always well-lit without any hints to the light outside, to keep you distracted from time. And once you are at the queue to pay your bill: Impulse purchase: When you wait in the queue near the cashier counter, you might find small value and/or small size items such as mint, candies, OTC tablets, condoms, as below.  “Hey, I totally forgot to get paracetamol!” “Well, it’s just a dollar, let me get some candy for a quick bite” That way, the stores can squeeze even a dollar from you at the last mile in your shopper journey. Of course there are so many more tricks, but above are some of the more constant ones employed. And that’s the end of our supermarket journey!

Get fares as low as 799/-Goibibo lowest price week.Yatra domestic flight offers.Above are just few examples, but every site/company has their own offers running. These are just a way to get people come on their site/portal and search for the tickets for their route of interest. This will increase traffic on their websites and when lots of people will start searching for tickets it will result in the spike of the Ticket Prices as the virtual demand increases. It’s virtual demand because people will just search for the route prices out of their curiosity but will have no intention of buying tickets. Thus these airlines will smartly generate this virtual demand and will increase the prices claiming that these routes are in a lot of demand. (you know right how airline ticket prices get calculated ? More the demand, more the prices). So if you notice, most of the airlines will have their tickets on sale for the dates 3–4 months from the current date. Thus by these marketing tricks, they will be able to increase the rates of the flights for several months ahead. So next time when you see a promotion, don’t be tempted to check the airfares straight away. By doing this you might be actually increasing the fares. Note: The above points mentioned is solely my observation and i do not claim i have done any extensive research over flight tickets fare.

China's health care may not be the most cost-effective in the world, but considering China's economic and demographic conditions, China's health care is currently the most suitable for China.  Before discussing, let’s first understand the types of health care in China: resident health care (the full name is resident basic health care, which is a combination of the old new rural cooperative health care and urban residents’ basic health care, and no longer distinguishes urban and rural residents), employee health care.

China's health care may not be the most cost-effective in the world, but considering China's economic and demographic conditions, China's health care is currently the most suitable for China.  Before discussing, let’s first understand the types of health care in China: resident health care (the full name is resident basic health care, which is a combination of the old new rural cooperative health care and urban residents’ basic health care, and no longer distinguishes urban and rural residents), employee health care. The former only pay about 250 a year, and the latter deducts about 10% of the salary every month. The payment standard Resident health care payment is low, and the treatment is also low. The payment standard varies from city to city. For example, young adults in Beijing pay 520 yuan, Wuhan pays 250 yuan, and some small cities used to be less than 200 yuan, but they will not be less than 250 yuan per person from 2020. The employee health care payment is much higher, and he and the company each pay part of it. Taking Wuhan as an example, the individual pays 2% of the salary and the company pays 8% of the total salary, so the insurance premium is about 10% of the salary (roughly stated, please refer to the regulations for details). Many people ignore the part that the company pays but don’t forget that the company pays social security, which is also part of its employment costs. If you don’t need to pay the money, the company will have higher profits to pay you wages and bonuses, so the company pays To some extent, this part should also be regarded as an expenditure from your income-in this case, the rate is not lower than that of Taiwan Health Insurance (Taiwan Health Insurance’s current premiums for corporate employees are 4.96%, and this 4.96% is paid by individuals and units, The government each pays 3:6:1). Insurance benefits Regarding resident health care, ""80% of the total cost of reimbursement"" is far from fact. Take Wuhan resident health care as an example. The medical expenses are 12,000 yuan when hospitalized in a tertiary hospital for surgery. First, the minimum payment line is 800 yuan (that is, the part above 800 will be reimbursed), and the remaining 11,200 yuan will be reimbursed 60% of the total. The proportion is 56%, and the reimbursement amount has an annual cap (150,000 yuan in Wuhan). (If you are hospitalized in a first-level hospital, the reimbursement rate will be higher, such as 80%, but I want to know who, apart from poor rural families, dare to perform operations in community hospitals or township hospitals?) Then come to the outpatient clinic. The following are the insurance benefits of some urban residents' health care for outpatient visits (take the second and third-level hospitals as examples): Beijing: If the accumulative expenditure on outpatient treatment in one year is less than 550 yuan, it will not be reimbursed. For the excess, 50% will be reimbursed Wuhan: 50% of the health care reimbursement for outpatient visits for more than 200 yuan per year, but no more than 400 yuan per year Jinan: 30% to 45% of health care reimbursements for patients in tertiary hospitals Jining: The personal account system for outpatient medical treatment is modeled on employee health care. The health care fund is allocated to the individual account of the insured person at 70 yuan per year (that is to say, for outpatient medical treatment, the health care will reimburse up to 70 yuan throughout the year, and the rest are all on your own) This is still the level stipulated in the text, and the actual implementation is another matter. For example, in a prefecture-level city in Shandong, you can get stomach medicine at the only municipal hospital in this city that can make do with it. Although the new rural cooperative health care system has been merged into the resident health care on the document, the hospital window says ""the new rural cooperative health care cannot be used."" No matter how good the document stipulates, the hospital does not recognize it. What can you do? Let's take a look at the effect of the above health care policy in actual medical treatment through an example: Take the wisdom tooth extraction in Wuhan as an example, suppose it costs 800 yuan, the minimum payment line is 200 yuan → self-pay the remaining 600 yuan → health care reimbursement 50% (300 Yuan), a total of 300 Yuan for self-payment: health care reimbursement 300/800=37.5% In addition, the reimbursement ratio mentioned above is limited to Class A drugs. Health care items and drugs are divided into two categories: A and B. Only category A is directly multiplied by the above-mentioned ratio. Category B needs to pay a certain percentage first, and the remaining part will be reimbursed according to the above-mentioned policy. It is stipulated that the reimbursement is 70%, but in fact, only 60% or 50% can be reimbursed. The picture below is the 2019 National Health care Drug List. Among these common (maybe inaccurate) drugs for the treatment of hyperacidity, only omeprazole is Class A, and all others are Class B. In addition to the reimbursement ratio, we must also pay attention to the existence of payment limits. Taking Wuhan as an example, because the payment limit is 400 yuan, that is to say, the health care will pay up to 400 yuan for your outpatient medical expenses throughout the year. Considering that you pay the premium, you also spend 250. That is, for outpatient medical treatment, residents Health care can only save you up to 150 yuan per year. You must know that Wuhan is already among the top ten cities in the country's GDP. It can be seen that resident health care can help hospitalization to a certain extent, and for outpatient medical expenses, except for very few first-tier cities, resident health care has little help. So the outpatient treatment is important? For young adults between the ages of 20 and 60, I am afraid that 90% of them will not be hospitalized once in two or three years (for example, in the last five years, my dad was hospitalized once, and no one else in my family has been hospitalized in five years), and most of the medical expenses throughout the year They all happen in outpatient clinics, such as catching a cold and fever, taking some medicine to suppress gastric acid, taking X-ray/CT/MRI and so on. In other words, people who enjoy resident health care (such as farmers, small business people, migrant workers, and freelancers) will not receive health care for most of their medical expenses throughout the year, and all have to pay for themselves. Since it is the best in the world, let's compare it with foreign countries. For example, in Japan, the individual pays 30%, and the health care reimbursements 70%, so the more expensive you see the doctor, the more you save. If you spend 20,000 yuan to see a doctor, health care will help you pay 14,000 yuan (this is the standard for young adults. If you are over 70 years old, health care will pay up to 90% for you). Yes, we do have. In shanghai I payed about 2–5% of my basic salary for health care, the company also need to pay for this, like 8% of my basic salary. This money will be in your personal health account. You can pay with this money. If the money in your account has run out, the health agency may cover 30% to 70% costs, depending on your age and the length of your health care. My baby has heath care too. ¥110/yr($17) and for some basic treatment and medicine, we only need to pay half money. But the health care has some restrictions.

As his his care was not in shanghai, his health care only covered about 30%. Health insurance or health care? One of the great fallacies of this whole subject is that people equate “insurance” with “access”. You do not need insurance to get health care. Money helps, but even if you are unable to pay there are multiple ways to access health care. Many of them free of charge, provided by numerous charitable organizations.

If they go so far as to ‘nationalize’ it via a true socialist model, then they are providing State-run health care, not “insurance”. insurance is something that was invented by people as a way to defer and defray costs of large-ticket healthcare items. Anyone in the USA can get it, if they have the money. Not everyone, however, has the money for equal insurance. Just like they don’t have the money for equal housing or equal cars or equal access to five-star restaurants. Then there are some who simply have enough money to not NEED insurance, and therefore do not have it. But just as there are different “levels” of access for things like housing, cars, restaurants, there are also different “levels” of access to health care. But true life-saving access? Everyone in the USA has that level of access, and the underlying system is far better than virtually anywhere else in the world.

These videos seem to show improper circus animal training practices. It is very clear that almost all of these have been selectively edited or altered. The footage is often made up of shopped, out-of-context clips paired with emotional music. If these animal rights groups were actually trying to expose abuse, their evidence would need to be unedited, uncut, and full of information (who did it, when, where). The amount of heavy editing and the lack of basic information included with these videos suggest that the videos were taken not to help the animals, but for promotional and self-serving purposes. Actual evidence of abuse would be as uncut as possible, not souped up for our viewing pleasure. Please don't fall for that trick. I can't speak for all circuses, but Ringling Bros. takes cases of improper training and handling very seriously and disciplinary action has been taken when the circus discovers such cases. In addition, circus animals are regularly inspected by in-house veterinarians, local veterinarians in each city, and the USDA. All agree that Ringling's circus animals are well cared-for and properly trained. Now some quick background. I have worked with Ringling Bros. for four years. During that time, I've paid a great deal of attention to the animals: what they looked like, whether they seemed healthy and happy, where they were housed, what they ate. I also got to know the veterinarians, handlers, trainers, and other animal specialists who worked with these animals. I watched the interactions between the animals and the humans, saw what tools and words were used, and saw animals being trained and responding to training firsthand. Although I am not an animal expert, I have a good set of eyes, a decent set of ears, and I consider myself to be an empathetic and sympathetic human being. I would not be working for the circus if there were any torture going on. Here are some of the things that I've learned from circus animal specialists, and from my own observations. The animals are trained using rewards and repetition. This goes for all of the animals (elephants, tigers, lions, camels, horses, dogs, etc.). I have never seen any other type of training used here. Basically the trainer gives the animal(s) a verbal cue sometimes combined with a physical prompt to teach the animal what he'd like it to do. When the animal complies, it is rewarded. If the animal does not comply, no reward is given, and the trainer patiently repeats the verbal and physical cues until the animal understands and the desired response is achieved, at which point the animal will be rewarded (and there is also another verbal cue to indicate that the desired action has been done). In essence, training is communication and understanding between the animal and the trainer. If you're interested in seeing this process, check out this series of lion training videos by the Chipperfield family. I believe there are four videos in the series.  And here's a short Instagram video that I took earlier this year of Dan, one of our camels, walking in a circle and receiving his treat for doing so. Go Dan! Training is not harmful; it is beneficial. In addition to allowing circus animals to display their prowess in front of audiences, training can also keep Animals In General safe and healthy. Keeping animals safe. To use an example of a more common animal: a circus dog (or any dog really). We teach a dog to ""stay"", not because it makes us feel good or ""in charge"" or any of that, but because we want to protect our dog from being a harm to himself or others. An untrained or poorly trained dog will not respond to ""stay"". Yelling ""stay"" will not protect this dog from running into traffic, chasing a frightened child, or jumping up on your visitors. Without the training, there is no communication or understanding. The dog needs to learn the appropriate behavior that corresponds with ""stay"" so that when you communicate using that verbal cue, the understanding between yourself and the dog can protect your animal. This concept can be applied to elephants, horses, camels, tigers, or any intelligent animal.Keeping animals healthy. Training also allows veterinarians and other animal specialists to care for animals without having to use restraints or cages. The elephants are an excellent example of this. One of the first verbal cues an elephant may learn is ""foot"", combined with the physical cue of the elephant guide touching or tugging gently on their inner knee. As with horses, the condition of an elephant's feet is paramount to the animal's overall health and so the feet need to be inspected carefully during veterinary exams. If an elephant is trained to respond to ""foot"", he/she will willingly lift their foot without having to be restrained, forced, or overly stressed. Other verbal cues like ""lie down"", ""easy"", or ""move up"" can help put the animal in a position where it can best be treated. Trained animals can be much more efficiently treated than untrained ones.(Slightly off subject for those who are wondering, the elephant guide is a USDA-approved veterinary tool. Here is a video from Have Trunk Will Travel detailing the proper use of the elephant guide as a tool for training and communicating with elephants: The Elephant Guide, Have Trunk Will Travel) Good training should go hand in hand with caring for any intelligent animal. In my experience, circus animals receive exceptional training, care, and love. Again, I do not work directly with circus animals, but I do see them every day. If you want to hear it from the horse's mouth, visit Ringling's facebook or twitter and feel free to ask about their animal care or read what they've already written on the subject. If you are specifically interested in the elephants, reach out to the Center for Elephant Conservation on facebook or instagram or their website. When you go to any circus show, be sure to ask the trainers, handlers, or other animal specialists about their animals. Generally speaking it depends on the circus. The ethical ones use various methods for training such as food rewards for the behaviours much like you see for sea lions shows at zoos, after each trick they get a fish as a reward. This also applies to falconry displays and is usually a male chick, in fact it's not unknown with this method for the animal to figure out it's going to get fed anyway so it stops bothering to perform.

For more dangerous animals such as lions the most dominant lions are not used for the show they are the ones that the ones who sit about, the lion that does the tricks is the weakest in the pride and it's actually using the natural behaviour of lions to get the performance. In the wild male lions often team up in pairs, usually if their siblings or surprisingly often they are just unrelated males that are battle buddies. The short answer is there are many ways to reasonably safely train animals. I would recommend visiting a reputable zoo and observing the way keepers interact with the animals. I have seen at london zoo a keeper using a dead rat held in a litter picker type device to train a Komodo dragon, they were able to enter the enclosure without having to lock it up. It also makes it easier to do vetinary checks and suchlike. They also had the crate for transport of said Komodo dragon in the enclosure to make it easier to transport the animal as it would be familiar with the transport crate. Bearing in mind that the Komodo dragon is in the group of animals that will kill and eat people, like lions and tigers. Animals are forced to perform tricks that go against their natural instincts. During their training, the animals are subjected to cruelties like whipping, denial of food and even electric shocks. They are also chained in confined spaces.",2021-03-05T10:46:04.087Z,"Are animals tortured as part of circus training? ",Quora

They have more graphics, specialist programming unique to the game, Creative crews, writers, and so on.But they are not necessarily good games. Consider the following: A blockbuster movie costs $100M+ to make. They have lots of salaries to pay, plus they have heaps of equipment. A high end game is similar. Likewise a movie can be made by a few people in a college dorm for peanuts, but it will not look as stunning. basically: bang is related to buck. For a bigger buck yo get a bigger bang… and sometimes people do not want big bangs, so they buy small ones. A few cheap, popular, modern games (Post 2005): Minecraft, FTL:Faster than Light, Plague Inc., etc. A few expensive, old games (Pre 2000): ET: The extraterrestrial, Pokemon Red/blue, Final Fantasy VII Al Nelson’s answer offers a succinct and insightful metric.

It may sound silly to you, but there is a correlation between target resolution and required budget to make the most of it. I’ll add a few insights of my own. But the word you’re really looking for is Production Values, which only increase as new technologies emerge to enhance the showmanship and “sharpness” of the experience. The original Secret of Monkey Island got by on one-frame sprite animations to display Guybrush pushing, pulling, picking up, or otherwise using an object. Most of his animation needs could be covered very quickly and used throughout production. One guy makes that sprite and it’s done.  Here’s a frame you get used to seeing for a while. This is the entire animation. Right here. All there is. Low-res and low-tech assets can take advantage of a lot of shortcuts, using impressionistic techniques that permit the user’s imagination to fill in a lot of blanks. This effectively condenses a lot of labor. By contrast the Tales of Monkey Island series by Telltale demands full-time animation in order to have Guybrush specifically animate using objects in his inventory and the environment. There are frequent needs in Telltale’s modern games for on-the-spot, special case, unique animations in each scene.  Telltale uses comparatively a lot more special case animation, about on par with a small television production. Users will generally tell you that they favor those production values over the old sprite-based game. It’s superficially more “real” and in some ways easier to understand, if not outright more impressive and therefore more fun. But obviously one of these is quite the Hell of a lot pricier and more labor-intensive than the other. Off the top of my head, 3D Guybrush requires a modeler who has to UV map his mesh, a rigger who makes him animation-ready, any number of animators who handle any number of his special case animations, and a texturer who paints the model. Newer games may or may not involve a digital sculpting phase, retopology, normal map transfer onto a low-poly model, specialized materials, et cetera. The higher-resolution the asset is, the more detail there is, the more detailed the process that’s required to both make it look good and make it run effectively at a decent framerate. While it’s possible to condense several of these roles into one person it is unlikely that you’ll find someone especially good at doing all of them, especially as each one becomes more detailed. It is often more practical to utilize specialists in order to get the highest-quality results in the fastest time. This arrangement tends to suit artists fine, because each specialty is now so detailed that it takes constant, comprehensive practice all its own in order to keep your skills professionally sharp. For instance, a realistic character requires many, many more hours of rigging than a low-poly PS1 game before it’s animation-ready; if the modeler spends half their time practicing rigs, they’re necessarily not practicing topology and texturing. However, it does mean you need a lot more people to build that game’s assets effectively, and that inevitably runs into a much higher cost on the production.",2021-03-05T10:48:17.105Z,"Why have video game budgets skyrocketed in recent years?

Here is another performance hack with many more things.    Many years ago YouTube switched to a streaming protocol called Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). DASH enables the video to buffer in blocks. Every time you seek in the video it will have to rebuffer that block and it will not buffer the next block if you're not at the very end of the current block. It works and buffers faster for people with fast internet connection but with slow internet connection, it is quite irritating.   If you are having slow internet connection, you can easily turn DASH playback off by adding YouTube center to the browser.  It comes with other useful utilities as well. If Dash Playback is turned off YouTube will load normally where you can pause the video and it will buffer to the end of the video.   You can add YouTube center either as an extension or a user script. After adding YouTube center you'll notice a gear icon in the upper right corner of YouTube (next to the google account thumbnail). Clicking on the gear icon will lead you to the YouTube center. There are too many options and settings to play with. To disable DASH playback,just uncheck the DASH playback.   As I stated earlier, YouTube center comes with others utilities too. Such as: Download video or audio track.Set aspect ratio.Resize player.Turn light ON/OFF.

After all, who needs the hassle of coordinating deliveries from courier companies and firms such as Redbox? We can do it ourselves by either using a taxi service or using Uber or other car-sharing services. In contrast, delivery services provide individuals with an additional income stream. Such businesses can be successful, even if they are only small operations that cater to local needs. After all, the value of the delivery person as a person to the client is more significant than the value of the deliveries they carry out.In my research on individual entrepreneurship, I have found that participants in incubators who provide delivery services are more likely to engage in entrepreneurship. In one study of 10 incubators in Yiwu, a city in China with a strong e-commerce sector, I found that participants providing home delivery services were 40% more likely to be entrepreneurship-minded. This meant they were more likely to participate in startup events, register startups, or stay in touch with other entrepreneurs.Resell homemade cosmetics and personal care items.

Off course MBBS and BDS do have a lot of common basic subjects. But you cannot compare BDS with MBBS because if there wasn't BDS then there would be need of a separate MS DENTISTRY after MBBS. Keeping in mind the importance of the required depth in the subjects in BDS, it cannot be kept as an alternative PG after MBBS. It is better off as an different course totally. Even dentistry is a day to day changing subject and the word doctor is actually given to those scholar's who keep on learning new things and keep teaching their colleagues and juniors for the rest of their life. There is no doubt that it's the same for Dental students, they too need to be updated about the latest advances. In short, they are also supposed to be called doctors. Are you a doctor or a dentist? “Tell me yourself the day you have a toothache.” This story was narrated to me by my friend who is a general surgeon. As a medicine doctor, and as having the privilege of the societal perception, you always consider yourself a real doctor. I have many dentist friends and this topic does come in discussion at times. A really nice friend of mine is a dentist, but he is also an intellectually sound person, a person i always look for an advice.

As a medicine doctor, and as having the privilege of the societal perception, you always consider yourself a real doctor. I have many dentist friends and this topic does come in discussion at times. A really nice friend of mine is a dentist, but he is also an intellectually sound person, a person i always look for an advice. While joking one day on some medical topic, I again asked him – “Are you a doctor or a dentist?” In reply he said – ‘Tell me yourself the day you have a toothache.’ That day I took it lightly but his curse was there on me. Few days later it all started with a cold sensation converting into a severe pain, I took a pain medicine to relieve it but it didn’t. I had to call him at 10 pm in night telling him that I am coming to see him. I immediately went to his clinic and seeing him, the first sentence that came out – ‘ doc saab jaldi dekho yar, too much pain’ (Doctor look at it fast, paining too much). He smiled at me and said- “ What did you just say? Am I a doctor or a dentist?” And he is right, you realize the importance of a pain healer only when you get that pain. Your skill of treating the diseased is what makes you a doctor, not your degree, but still you fail to apply this concept to others. Being Dentist just signifies their association with that part of the body, a Dentist is a doctor specialised in Oral Health. Plus calling them a doctor or a dentist is directly proportional to one’s interest in dental hygiene. Admire the skills, admire the interest. Absolutely. Dentists receive professional degrees like physicians (who receive Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degrees), veterinarians (who receive Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degrees), optometrists (who receive Doctor of Optometry degrees), podiatrists (who receive Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degrees) and pharmacists (who receive Doctor of Pharmacy degrees).

Lawyers can choose to go on to earn a LL.M or a Masters of Law degree and then go on further to earn a terminal degree called a Scientiae Juridicae Doctor, or a Doctor of Juridicial Science.

Its easy to get sucked into the thoughts of those around us and it even happens despite the fact you might hire an expert who comes equipped with all the right tools. Its hard to not trust someone you know over someone you only kind of know. It’s like suddenly all of the brain cells you had when you hired your marketing person vanished the moment said “friend” says something against the campaign. So here’s the work around. Always listen …there’s no harm but also ask for data that proves their statements, observations or feelings. If they can support a theory or feeling then adjust, if not do nothing and move forward. That brings me to the A/B Testing component. It’s always good to have more than one option on a campaign because you have more than one type of buyer and they receive information differently thereby are influenced to a call to action differently. In A/B Testing there is always a clear winner even if both have a positive result. Having the data to support one version of a campaign over another can also provide two different ways to communicate to your audience or to different segments of your demographics. If you can implement both of these actions in your strategy you will avoid being led down a possible incorrect path by an undocumented feeling and come out of your initial test campaign with solid ammunition to further your reach within your demographic base. As always I do free consultations on Branding, Marketing and Brand Strategy. I’d say the lack of strategy is the most common thing. Don’t get me wrong, people these days do have marketing strategies, but the problem is that these strategies often fail to guide each promotional campaign.

Without a high-quality strategy, marketers are doomed to guess or make things up. And it’s not just the content of the campaign that is under fire. In many cases, a lack of precise and well-established strategy leads to campaigns failing to get to their goals and properly analyze their efficiency. Without a clear efficiency measurement system (which should be indicated in the strategy), many of the steps are just leaps of faith, as the marketers jump into the darkness of digital communications. Of course, there are other significant mistakes that many marketers make during promotional campaigns, but I believe that bad strategy is the root of all evil.

The best way to find which career is best for you is to explore yourself, explore your personality, your interest, your strengths and weaknesses. You are going to choose a career for yourself not for anyone else, so the career should be fit for you not for others. After exploring yourself, you can explore careers that matches your personality and abilities. Write down those careers and find the one that matches your personality and requirements to the maximum. If you find difficulty in exploring your interest, ability and personality, then you can consult a career counselor.

It’s very common for agencies and large marketing teams to use this because it means that they expect this person to perform at a higher level, to learn fast and will move up the organization, as well as not disabling them in terms of decision making when in meetings with clients (internal and external). An SEO Analyst [Agency and internal] is somebody mostly focused at the empirical data to do with Search or SEO - for example, visitors, conversions, A/B testing outcomes and general data analysis. An SEO analyst is quite often a key component in reporting and creating data backed, evidence based decisions, helping to crunch numbers that take up time for strategists and specialists. Personality: A real SEO analyst will have an analytical mind with a mathematical background, is generally a research type personality and may not be good at sales or customer facing roles. SEO Strategists [agency and internal] are typically very high end, capable SEO experts with at least a few years experience in delivering results (versus just time spent in SEO). The number of years experience and qualification are somewhat important but many SEO strategists can grow quickly, especially through visible delivery on results. Strategists often come from agencies or have spent time there - working across industries, vertical’s and different sized companies gives them a more holistic experience vs many years in a single vertical (which makes them a specialist, and in regulated or highly complex niches, even more valuable). Strategists could be higher or lower than managers and consultants - it depends on the experience they have. They more also be internal consultants. Usually the SEO strategist will present a plan to an executive team or board and then that will be handed to wider marketing to execute. SEO Specialist [mostly agency] An SEO specialist may have more niche/vertical experience or just be better at SEO than a different inboud/digital/search skillset. They can typically be able an executive and below a strategist and sit beside an analyst. Typically an agency role - they may also be an account-facing person who reports to the strategist or consultant. It’s also used where agencies and especially internal teams where SEO doesn’t have a full seat at the revenue table or is a distrusted or low-value input. SEO Manager [mostly internal] - this varies from experience, time served, knowledge, hierarchy and size of role. If there is a big focus on SEO and a bit team, then is a very high position for someone in an SEO career. Quite often, an SEO manager who owns SEO but sits outside the management team - and quite often isn’t a manager (of people or budget). The SEO manager could manage a web project - mostly if it’s outsourced and the SEO manager may in some cases own Social Media and other inbound. It really depends on the size and budget of the company an teams. SEO consultant [external or agency or internal] - SEO consultants are quite often self-employed / independent and is used as a sounding board as well as to inform strategy and audit the execution. Whether internal or external, the position does not own execution and the role can be highly challenging, with the risk of not implementing a total strategy having impact on it’s results. Typically their role might be to train, educate and advance an existing SEO function or web team to gain independence or as a sounding board for more complex questions. Typically, the SEO consultant’s strategy is implement verbatim. Internally, the SEO might be someone’s right hand man, be an auditor (where multiple vendors are used) or as an arbitrator between different SE(m) groups.

From my work in the field of mental health, it really depends on how resilient a person is. Resiliency is essentially a person's ability to cope and weather what ever comes their way. Folks who have more resources typically do better when it comes to Resiliency. For example: A person who is able to meet challenges and creatively overcome them, verses the person who knows only one way to do any task and is stymied by a challenge that does not fit within that problem solving strategy that they have. Folks who have a flexible understanding of the world around them and are able to adjust to new information and recognize changes as they arise verses the person who clings rigidly to the single world view and thwarts all threats to that world view.  A person who has a support network of friends, family, community and who are willing to ask for help when they need it are less likely to develop PTSD, because they will seek out others in the immediate aftermath, and that support will naturally help them cope with the trauma. Folks who isolate, drink or use other substances to cope are at higher risk, because they are not being supported, and rather than coping with the trauma, they are trying to suppress.  After a traumatic event it especially helps to do something. Not so much de-brief or tell the story--though you can if that feels right. I am talking about doing something hands on: helping--making sandwiches for first responders of the fire. Handing out blankets. Cleaning up or doing dishes. The doing of a normal helping task allows a person to do something ""normal"" rather than keeping themselves in a state of helpless and traumatizing thought patterns. You will often see people go back to work because ""they need to have something normal in their life"". It should go with out saying, but I will say it any way: ""Thoughts and Prayers"" don't help all that much. Raking Leaves and Washing Windows--Protesting--Helps a lot. I'm not in the medical field at all.  I just research on my own.

Can't find an exact link for you today.  Brain State Technoloogies is the organization I originally found the video under.  Also discussion of a mouse's brain and the physical roadblocks created inside the brain from unhealthy responses to fight/flight/freeze response.  The roadblocks, I feel, are the key.  PTSD sufferers have so many roadblocks to detour and work around in day by day thinking that it hinders and even shuts them down.  And the brain research shows that the roadblock was really necessary and useful at one moment in time (when the brain recorded it - ""don't ever go this way again!"" - but becomes useless and a hindrance as life goes on and a person doesn't live in that sort of trauma environment anymore.  Just my two cents. You could potentially live through lots of traumatic events and not have PTSD in any form at all actually. The mind is complex and each person’s experience from trauma is different, especially the mental conditions that might result from that trauma.

You need to constantly participate in taking surveys every day.Affiliate MarketingAlternatively, you can become an affiliate marketer. I graduated as an engineer and after years of working 9-to-5, I got fed up with the routine work and decided to do something else that could earn me an opportunity to spend quality time with my family and make extra cash. I started as a blogger and expected to make some extra cash like anyone else. To my surprise, it turned out well where I made more money than what I could as an engineer. My preferred way is to become an affiliate marketer because it allows me to make a lucrative and sustainable income through blogging. You can easily make $300 - $500 per day by becoming an affiliate marketer. To make money from blogging (affiliate marketing), First, you need to find your niche. A niche means a target or a subject that you are going to write about. A niche can be your interest, a hobby or a skill. Any subject can be your niche, for example, people blog about collecting match boxes, bug photography, work-out program, or even daily political scandals and etc. Remember one thing is when you are finding your niche, avoid being too broad with your selection. For example, do not blog about Work Out Tips and Motorbike at the same time. Both of them fall on different categories and they just can't simply be put together. You could do a post about your niche (e.g. camera, guitar, trekking) and include affiliate links to any paid ones (e.g. Amazon or ShareASale). Create great content is not enough to make a lucrative income online today. You will have to make use of social media platform to promote your content and drive traffic to purchase items via your product reviews. My site earned my $7,000 within six months. Of course, I worked extremely hard at the beginning and success did not happen overnight. I spent almost 5 hours per day after work to make it worked. As my site matures, I spend 1 to 2 hours every day writing, optimizing my site, connect to social media and reply readers' emails. The best thing is the earning potential doesn't stop there and the revenue growth is still climbing up every single day (provided I publish articles regularly). At the time of writing, my site is making 5-figure revenue every month. Anyway, my answer is if you're passionate about a subject and you have decent writing skills, blogging definitely could be an alternative career path for you to make a living. All you need is to become an affiliate marketer. You will also find the pros and cons working as an affiliate marketer. Pros:The earning potential is enormous due to the exponential growth of the internet usersIt allows you to make sustainable income onlineIt allows you to quit your nine-to-five job and allow you to spend quality time with your familiesIt is a legitimate online businessThere are many affiliate programs on the internet you can participate (e.g. Amazon, ShareASale, Apple, FreeflyVR)Cons:It requires a lot of effort and timeYou need to blog from time to time (constantly publish content)You need to learn how to do affiliate marketingYou can’t do it alone. It requires mentor-ship. You can do it alone with trial and error method but it takes a while to figure out the methodologyEasy to get scammed as a newbie as there are many so called internet Guru out there to steals your money and only deliver empty promises.I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche. For example, everyone is talking about virtual reality now. If you are interested in VR and you blog about, I believe there will be a huge potential in making good money from it. Note: Freefly VR offers affiliate program to earn commission. So, my answer to your question - become a blogger/ affiliate marketer. Hope the answer helps.

I'm a Youtuber 10 years until now, I will try my best to blend my experience with those suggestions. here are some successful ways you should know to get more YouTube views and subs. 1. Choose carefully your thumbnail The thumbnails you select for each video are more important than you think. It’s the first thing people will see when they search for your videos, so it needs to have the “click-worthy” value. In other words, make it appealing. YouTube automatically gives you three thumbnail options to choose from when you upload a video, but if you feel you need something catchier, customize and upload your own. 2. Think over your title and video description Your title is clearly important for intriguing viewers, but it can also improve your search results and should definitively drive more traffic to your channel. The very first term should be relevant, such as a keyword and you should follow that with what is featured in the video, building a keyword phrase. While your title should be clear and concise, the video description is where you can go a little more in depth. The description can include a keyword phrase, your URL, and a mini-post that briefly describes the content of your video. 3. Make Your Best Video “Featured” YouTube automatically shows your most recent video in the main “Featured” window on your channel page. For users that post regularly, this is ideal, but for those that post less, sometimes a better option is selecting another video to occupy that slot. Here’s how: Go to your “Creator Studio” settings and select “Featured Content” from the left menu under “Channel”. Then click the “Feature Content” button and choose if you want to use the most recent uploaded video or choose a new video or playlist. If you already have a featured video, you need to click “remove” first to actually being able to change it. 5. Add Channel Tags Tag away! This is as fundamental as tagging your videos with keywords. You’ll bring the viewers to you and can find this on your settings option on the My Channel menu. 6. Pay Attention to Comments Engage with your audience. Take the time to read your channel comments as well as those posted on your videos and be sure to respond. Remember; clean up if you have to. Delete or report spam comments, if not, it comes off as if you may be ignoring your channel. 7. Users like playlists Create playlists of your videos instead of having a series of separate videos. Start with your most popular or recent videos to get your fans interested, and then let them sift through new and old material. here are some tips : 1: Clean Up Your YouTube Channel Before we get into the good stuff, it is important to do some housekeeping.

I know, I know, it’s hard to swallow, but it’s important to step away from your self and into the shoes of an outsider from time to time. Taking a hard look at your YouTube channel and re-evaluating what is on there will likely lead to the realization that a chunk of old content should be deleted—whether it is outdated, poorly produced, or just a flop of a video that should have never made it up there in the first place. If you have something of this nature tied to your brand, it’s going to immediately turn that lead off, and cause them to lose trust in your brand. Delete it and never look back! This brings me to my next tip… #2: Only Create and Post Highly Watchable Content Yes, I know this tip might seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it’s easy to feel like you can get away with posting sub-par content. Well, you can’t! The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. Make Sure Your Videos Are Under 5 Minutes So, your videos are all 30-60 minutes because your digital engineering software is complicated to explain?

Legends such as PewDiePie, HolaSoyGerman, Smosh, elrubiusOMG and VanossGaming would probably not exist. Thanks to YouTube, anyone can become a producer or director today. However, this does not guarantee success since you are only as good as your number of followers. Posting great content doesn’t always cut it, especially in our competitive online world today. Most brands aren’t creating any major movies or series, but when it comes to marketing, many of the same tactics are employed. The ultimate goal on YouTube is to build an audience or, in this case, subscribers. And to do that, you need to know what people are going to be attracted to and entertained by. If you accomplish this, then you are bound to become an industry expert, tech guru, or an educational resource to your target audience when they make their purchase decision. YouTubers aim to find ways to get viewers subscribe to their page. This means that whenever they upload a new video, the subscribers will be automatically updated, thereby increasing the chances of seeing your videos. Every YouTuber wants to keep their target audience and returning subscribers engaged. So, put on your director’s hat and pay attention to these 20 tips to increase YouTube Followers from 0 to 100k: 1. Add videos frequently while maintaining consistency It doesn’t matter if you’re new to YouTube, the easiest thing you can do to kick start your life as a YouTuber is to post videos consistently. This is the first step in building a reliable and hopefully long-term relationship with your audience. To post videos consistently, you need to first pick out days which you can dedicate to it completely. This allows people to treat it like weekly episodes of their favorite shows and form a regular habit. The more videos you have, the more diverse your channel becomes, and this helps in building a robust library which shows you have a wide range of expertise. 2. Create an attractive trailer for your channel  Introduce your YouTube channel with a short but attractive trailer. Visitors are like fishes, so you need to reel them in once they arrive on your channel. A memorable and attractive trailer can be attractive, visually stunning, funny and unique, which shows a brief highlight reel of who you are, why your videos are worth the watch, and why they should be interested in watching more. Think of all the movie trailers you have watched. Their main goal is to build excitement and curiosity. You can also look up your competitor’s trailers for some ideas or inspiration. 3. Promote other videos in your end screen The more of your videos a visitor watches, the higher their chances of subscribing to your channel. So, the question is; how do you get visitors to watch multiple videos on your channel? The answer is simple. Promote other videos at the end of the current video. This is very common in DIYs and tutorial videos. Chances are if a user watches a video to its full length or even half way through, you can promote other videos related to the topic or even something entirely different. 4. Focus on quality, not quantity Remember when we talked about posting videos consistently? You should definitely do that but it will only work if you post quality content. Posting consistently does not imply you post regularly, but rather balanced between quality and quantity. Follow the 80-20 rule, with 80 percent being the focus on quality and the rest on quantity. Moreover, don’t try to say the same thing over and over again for the sake of prolonging the video. This will be considered not only annoying but boring, if for some reason, someone decides to stay. 5. Reply to comments actively Replying to comments is probably among the easiest ways to get more subscribers. Why? Because most YouTubers don’t even bother doing so which gives you an opportunity to stand out. In fact, YouTube itself had a say on this. When creators take the time to interact with their audience, it can encourage audience participation and result into a larger fan base. 6. Ask your audience about their interests Again, this highlights the importance of interacting with your audience. Think about it. What better way to get more subscribers than interacting with visitors to post content that they find valuable. There is a much higher chance people will be willing to subscribe to your channel if you take their feedback into consideration. After all, it is them you are catering to with your content. 7. Optimize your video descriptions with keywords That’s right. SEO isn’t just for your website. Google owns YouTube, so you need to incorporate its search engine into your YouTube video titles and descriptions. In fact, if you pay attention, you will see that YouTube videos are given priority over other search results. SocialBook YouTube Builder Tool allows you to get the best keywords for your video. Keywords are an essential part of digital marketing, so you need to put in some research. You can also reverse engineer your content and make videos based on the highest ranking videos in terms of traffic. For example, you can follow Google trends right now which are mostly all about Covid-19, so why not produce content on it? 8. Brand your thumbnails  Use SocialBook Builder Tool to create your video thumbnail. A thumbnail is simply a 1280 x 720px still image that serves as a cover for your video. They are your first and best chance to persuade visitors to click on your video, apart from video titles. Viewers hope to see sleek, professional and consistent videos rather than random uploads looking to get viral. If you are aiming for consistent branding for all your thumbnails, you can try out SocialBook Builder Tool which has its own thumbnail maker, or you can use the online version of SocialBook thumbnail maker first. You can get started for free and enjoy other features as well such as suggested video tags. 9. Run recurring contests Running recurring contests is a smart way to bump up engagement. You can also check out YouTube’s official guide for running a contest. The logic is simple. You need to choose prizes that matter to your audience, and ask viewers to subscribe and turn on notifications in order to participate. For example, gamers offer consoles or gadgets for winners and runner ups. The same way, movies and comic book channels offer merchandise related to the contest. 10. Announce your subscriber milestones Everyone loves a round number. Announce them, celebrate them and do not forget to thank your audience for getting you there. Milestones build your reputation which helps visitors perceive your channel as the one to go to do when they make a search on a specific topic. This announcement can be either at the beginning of the video or at the end. 11. End videos with call to action When a visitor on your video finishes watching, they think, “what next?” If you do not give them something to do, they will simply click on video from another channel never to be seen again. Many newbie creators are afraid to ask their audience to subscribe. Don’t be! Literally guide your audience to the subscribe button without any special effects or puzzles. Sometimes, the obvious call to action is the simplest one. 12. Connect with your audience on other social media channels (Cross-Promotion) Cross-promoting on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest keeps your audiences not only engaged but connected across different platforms. You can simply do this by encouraging people to check out your channel in your Facebook or Instagram bio. You can also invest in cross-posting your content on different platforms for more reach and access. In the last few years, we have seen YouTubers post the same video across all platforms and this is because it works wonders for them. If you have a shot at getting viral, you need to take it without missing out on the opportunity. 13. Optimize your channel page There are three things that can happen when a visitor lands on your channel page. They can leave right away, watch videos or/and subscribe. You can add some channel art and organize your best videos to appear at the top. This way, visitors have the chance to see your best work right at their fingertips and just a single click away, without any further searching. 14. Try to post long videos Although this may contradict conventional wisdom, studies indicate that longer videos rank better on YouTube’s search results. Plus, longer videos are perceived as containing more relevant information as compared to short videos. This depends on the title as well. For instance, you can find pizza recipes under 2 minutes as well as over 10 minutes, but the content can be completely different. Visitors also have an expectation of how long certain videos should be. For example, a movie trailer is in between 1 and 2 minutes. Any video less than that might not get the desired clicks nor subscriptions. 15. Write an attractive channel description Unlike video descriptions, channel descriptions do not change and remain on the channel for a long long time. Sadly, most channel descriptions are poor and usually one liners that hardly provide any relevant information regarding the creator, or the videos they intend to post. Imagine landing on a page which reads, “I vlog about life, food and other things”. Would you click on the subscribe button after reading this? Probably not! So, your channel description should clearly state what the channel is all about, provide important information such as upload schedule, and include an attractive call to action to subscribe. 16. Create a catchy tagline In the early days, when there was hardly any competition, YouTubers often ignored the positioning of the channel. If running a successful YouTube channel required an MBA, you won’t have heard about all the success stories and digital influencers taking the digital media by storm. So, to brand your channel, all you need is a simple tagline; something different from others in your niche. 17. Partner with other channels This goes all the way back to interacting with your audience. Your audience is much more than random visitors. Other channels can view your page and subscribe as well. Making friends on YouTube is a smart way to collaborate with the mutual goal of building each other’s audiences. Your audience will trust your recommendations. The same goes for their audience, so take advantage. 18. Upload your content on your blog or website Uploading videos on your blog or website is a win-win tactic that can help your website’s search ranking on Google search engine. As long as subscribers and prospects go, you are already placing your content exactly where the people actually want it to be or where they are looking for it. Plus, this is a smart way to boost the visuals of your blog as well with quality content that is much more than plain images that do not necessarily capture the visitors’ attention or answer their queries. 19. Use click-able tools in your videos Thank god YouTube killed annotations a few years ago. Pop-ups are old and something that we’re all definitely doing better without. Modern clickable tools include end screens and branding watermarks. End screens are still-images at the end of a video where viewers can be reminded to subscribe or add in another call to action. So, you have a few seconds until YouTube’s algorithm redirects them to other videos. Secondly, a branding watermark is an extra subscribe button that will hover over your video until it is finished, even while in full screen 20. Pre-announce your next video content If you have placed a quality content on your channel, viewers who have just seen what your brand is about probably want to see more. After all, subscribing to a YouTube channel is an act of anticipation. Pre-announcing or hyping your next week, and making it clear that you shouldn’t miss it, is the most organic way to encourage people to click on subscribe. Obviously, other factors need to fit in such as your content schedule, and knowing what is coming next.

I was with friends, visiting the city of Kolhapur and the places around. It was that time of 2012 when the MNS (Maharashtrian political party) was in full form, opposing the illegal toll booths. I was the only driver in that trip. The day we were supposed to return, my mother was constantly calling me and expressing her concern about our safety amid the toll booths’ vandalizing that was taking place. One peculiarly odd, unusual anti-characteristic was being noticed in her calls. She usually gets the point of a conversation and moves on. But she was calling after irregular intervals, talking about the same thing. My gut was telling me, something’s wrong and she is trying to conceal, just so that I drive safely. My gut feeling was right. I entered Pune, called her and headed straight to Joshi Hospital, instead of home. My father had suffered a major paralysis attack just the day before. Our doctor, who had been with the family for decades already, came in to see. He checked the reports and took me, my sister, and my mother aside from the others and said, “We are fighting a lost battle.”  This brutal honest sentence, spoken originally in the Marathi language, broke us for those moments. We tried everything we could, nevertheless, after 45 days of hospitalization, father left us. Had he not been brutally honest, we would not have had time to absorb the impact. Losing a person whose influence, presence, aura, character is so massively intertwined in your lives, can be catastrophic beyond predictions and your calculations for well-being are bound to go wrong. The explosion has to be controlled; and for that, you need to be emotionally healthy. Recovery, here, is at least two-fold, I discovered in these years - emotional (psychological, mental), and practical (financial and akin stuff). Mental comes first, practical follows. Both are excruciatingly long and sulking processes that never seem to end, honestly. Some phrases suddenly start making more sense to you. You live them. Phrases like — Life Goes On, The Show Must Go On, Time & Tide Await None… I am thankful to our doctor for that blunt sentence. It helped me and my family stabilize ourselves, and subconsciously, prepare for what was to come. 2–3 weeks after I had an emergency c-section, I had an extreme pain radiating from my abdomen. There was blood in my urine and in my stool. I was showing signs of sepsis. My mum rushed me to the hospital at 1am after I began vomiting blood.

My mum rushed me to the hospital at 1am after I began vomiting blood. They started with antibiotics, but by 3am hooked me up to machines that took my blood out, filtered it, and returned it to my body due to the continued deterioration. My OBGYN who did the surgery came in (in her pajamas) and immediately went into work mode. Asked me what questions I could answer, and if she didn’t get one clear enough she asked my mum. More antibiotics. More deterioration. Blood panels showing I’m quickly swimming down the drain and there’s 0 improvement. She came in around 6/7am and sat down beside me on the bed with a very sad look on her typically composed face. With tears in her eyes she said “You need to prepare to not make it through this. You need to make sure your little one is taken care of.” I remember that moment the clearest, for hours beforehand I was in a sort of daze and don’t remember much. I have posted the results of this story in other questions, but I’ll rewrite it here so everyone knows how I got my happy ending. A nurse was helping me to the bathroom (my mum had gone to collect my little one from home because taking care of babies isn’t my stepfather’s strong suit) and I slipped onto the toilet, felt a tear, and her hand came to rest on a lump within my abdomen. Her eyes shone with an absolutely amazing determination, she told me not to move, and ran from the room. She ran from my room, down the stairs to the first floor, out to the parking garage across the street, and in front of my OBGYN’s car (as she was leaving to her office). She then proceeded to run all the way back, and excitedly feel for the lump and get my OBGYN to feel it. Before she even said anything, my nurse was out of the room, and running back wheeling a mobile ultra-sound unit to my room. They didn’t even make me lay down, she started it up with me still on the toilet and began looking around. They could see the blood flow from a tear in the lump and my OBGYN diagnosed: a hematoma. They re-opened part of my c-section incision, removed as much of the hematoma as possible (it was believed that the parts attached to my muscles would deteriorate and be reabsorbed into my body) and after they made sure my incision was sewn and stapled back up, back on the blood filtering machines I went. Within 24 hours I was almost discharge-ready with basic flu-like symptoms. The antibiotics were working. My blood panels were phenomenally improved. That hematoma was pouring infected blood cells back into my body through a tiny tear in the bottom before the big tear at the top. For a size reference, think a long john donut with about and extra inch in every direction. Both my OBGYN’s brazen and heart-felt statement, along with the dedication of my nurse, mean I am here today.  EDIT: I am not driving in this picture, we’re stopped in front of our house and she was being her sassy self. It’s a still from an entire video of her telling me why purple and blue are twins…I have to chalk her odd ideas up to being 2 1/2. I was induced and went through 12 hours of labor before I accepted my OBGYN’s decision of a c-section, as labor wasn’t progressing, I was having extreme back labor, a migraine, and previously injured vertebrae were at risk. The surgery was completely successful and went smoothly. I had been going through the flu, my symptoms only came to a grateful end the day before I went in to be induced. At first, my OBGYN thought it might be that the fracture in my hip (from a car accident years before) had deepened and was causing the sepsis infection. X-rays revealed it was stressed from pregnancy and labor, but not deeper. I am extremely grateful to my nurse and her dedication. I myself couldn't feel the lump until it detached and became front and centre. It had attached to my muscle wall at a crooked angle, but when it detached at the top and floated over to be vertical, it was apparent. I will completely accept the fact that my OBGYN should've expected something to happen due to my history of complications after my car accident. I had unexpected bleeds, infections, abscesses, and bones that re-fractured during surgery to repair them. Aside from my vertebrae and hip, I have healed extremely well despite all complications, but it was in my file and she should’ve taken more precautions. I have a very complicated medical history, and I'm often taken for something I'm not by doctors, nurses... Many just don't understand, or even care to read my history to see that there's actually a reason behind it all. I didn't make it up. The pain isn't fake. I actually did go through seven surgeries on my stomach in one year. One of my worst episodes was right before my stomach problems and surgeries started for real. I was having a c-section, feeling the epidural disappear, because they didn't administer it exactly right, seeing the doctors continue to operate without numbing the pain I was Continue ReadingI have a very complicated medical history, and I'm often taken for something I'm not by doctors, nurses... Many just don't understand, or even care to read my history to see that there's actually a reason behind it all. I didn't make it up. The pain isn't fake. I actually did go through seven surgeries on my stomach in one year. One of my worst episodes was right before my stomach problems and surgeries started for real. I was having a c-section, feeling the epidural disappear, because they didn't administer it exactly right, seeing the doctors continue to operate without numbing the pain I was in, screaming my lungs out until I just cried silently until it was over, because I felt everything. And no one put me to sleep. (The baby was out, and the pain started right after. If you’re a doctor or a nurse, you know that most of the surgery is done AFTER the baby is out. And boy… those 30-45 minutes felt like years.) Anyway, I was admitted to the hospital with pain in my stomach - again. I was sure they wouldn't take me seriously - again, as I've been pushed back and forth through the system. (It's complicated. I can explain if it's interesting to anyone.) But anyway, I had always felt like a burden to the system. Always trying to hold the pain just a little bit longer, and it always ended the same way. Me going under, my stomach cut open to fix something that wasn't right on the inside. So I was at the hospital one afternoon. Again. Waiting to fight my way through the system. Again. Expecting to not be taken seriously, that they'd say I was only seeking drugs, and send me home, or that it was all in my head (which was never the case. I always ended up needing surgery.) So I waited. Prepared my defence when a surgeon came into my room. He looked sad. The first thing he said was, ”I am so sorry for the shit my coworkers have put you through. I am ashamed to be a surgeon because of the way they've treated you. You've been treated worse than an animal. The way they made you go through your c-section in 2008, it’s horrible. It’s like something taken out of the 1800s.The way doctors has turned you away…It makes me feel so bad.“ My first reply was; “You read my history?” I was stunned. A doctor /surgeon that actually took the time to read my history! He looked even more upset, and answered, “Of course!! All doctors should read the patients history. We can't read everything, but we read what matters. Or.. Sorry. We SHOULD read what matters.. I just want to apologize on the behalf of this hospital. On the behalf of my staff. I'm ashamed of what you've been through, and I'll do what I can so you won't face this again. This shouldn't have happened to you, and none of this is your fault. You have the right to get the help you need, when you need it. Especially since you have a complicated history, you should be taken seriously.“ He also told me his personal opinion about doctors and surgeons generally, which totally blew me away. The honesty from this surgeon took away some of the trauma that scared me at that hospital. It made me realize that my life matters just as much as anyone else's, even though I'm complicated. His honesty will always be with me, and he made me see that not every doctor or surgeon are like the ones I faced before I met him. And the hospital? They treated me with respect after this. I never faced problems with them again. I still don't like the hospital, but at least it doesn't terrify me to visit it anymore. There's much more to the story, but I’m not going to bore you with the details of it all.",2021-03-05T11:02:19.038Z,"What moments of brutal honesty from a doctor have you actually appreciated in hindsight?

But subtle vandalism is hard to fix.The community is often quite conservative or unable to change things. There are a lot of things the community is frustrated with from the way we handle new users to the way we handle requests for adminship and so on. But actually fixing them is a never-ending debate and we never get anything done. One thing we have tried that seems like a good thing is trials: actually testing out ideas to see if they work is a pretty good thing. The current 'Article Feedback' boxes appearing on English Wikipedia has come about very slowly as a result of numerous trials. The fundraising campaign every year is now being driven purely by pragmatism and testing. The reason you see Jimmy Wales' face is because it has been A-B tested to hell and found to be the most successful banner for raising money.Long-standing grudges between editors.

I hate nothing about being a Wikipedia editor, it has been one of the most extraordinary ongoing experiences of my life. I have learned a great deal about the topics where I edit, learned a great deal about broad collaboration, and met a huge number of extraordinary, dedicated people. I sometimes get frustrated with how much the negative aspects of editing are discussed. But, a number of people do have genuinely bad experiences — in some cases, truly traumatic, life-altering experiences — and it’s important to acknowledge and understand that, and to work to minimize its occurrence. I attribute my good experience to two things: (1) My approach: From the beginning, because of my experiences working on other wikis, I chose to use my real name as a Wikipedia editor, and to be diligent about conducting myself in a way that I could take pride in. I’ve fallen short of perfection, but I think I’ve done pretty well with that overall. I try to treat disagreements with empathy and/or detachment, and to talk through them without making things or taking things personally. It has paid off in many ways. One specific thing: early on, I was keenly aware of some of the burnout around me. I saw colleagues get deeply invested in disputes, and in some cases retire entirely from the site. I made a pretty conscious decision that I didn’t want that to happen to me. I have tried to be mindful of how many disagreements and disputes I allow into my editing experience and my life, so I don’t get overwhelmed. (2) Privilege: Many negative experiences result, in part, from being bullied for certain aspects of one’s identity. If I were a woman, if I had certain strong political views, if I were transgender or gay or black or a non-native English speaker, or any number of other things, I’d probably have a more difficult time. I try to be mindful of those dynamics as well, and to work to minimize bullying and similar behavior when I encounter it, to the extend I can. There are certain topics in Wikipedia in which groups of editors have banded together to try to control the content of the associated articles.  Some of the topics in which this occurs probably aren't surprising, such as the Palestine-Israel conflict, the Troubles in Ireland, and similar topics involving long-running, political and/or ethnic feuds.  You might be surprised, however, at some of the other topics in which this behavior occurs, such as Intelligent Design (controlled by a group of editors who are rabidly antagonistic towards the idea) and other science or science-related topics. O Continue ReadingThere are certain topics in Wikipedia in which groups of editors have banded together to try to control the content of the associated articles.

You might be surprised, however, at some of the other topics in which this behavior occurs, such as Intelligent Design (controlled by a group of editors who are rabidly antagonistic towards the idea) and other science or science-related topics. One reason why this is frustrating is that these groups usually make little effort to collaborate or cooperate with other editors from outside their group within that topic.  If you, for example, see a related article in a magazine and go and try to add a sentence or two about it to that topic in Wikipedia controlled by one of those groups, you will often find your contribution quickly reverted or purged.  If you try to start a discussion about it on the article's talk page, the controlling group will usually respond with indifference or hostility. Needless to say, this is frustrating to encounter, even more so because Wikipedia's administration, a significant percentage of which appear to be teenagers or college students, seem to have little idea of how to enforce Wikipedia's NPOV policy.  Thus, trying to reason with one of those groups of editors is usually a big waste of time and Wikipedia's conflict resolution process is extremely time-consuming and adversarial.",2021-03-05T11:04:03.245Z,"What are the most frustrating aspects of being a Wikipedia editor?

His story is already been made into a biopic Bollywood movie, but here is one such story about how Dhoni was denied a chance to make his Duleep trophy debut by some top level bureaucracy and a broken Tata Sumo. MS Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in 1999-2000 as an 18-year-old and made an immediate impact in his second season, playing a brilliant rearguard innings against Bengal in 2001. He scored his first first-class century, 114 in a match that Bihar managed to draw from a position of certain defeat. His talents were noticed and he was immediately included in the Duleep Trophy team of East Zone. This was a great opportunity for young Dhoni, as he had made a splash in the big pond of talent and got noticed and most of the regular India players were supposed to play international cricket for India against a touring Australia side. India was also in the process of finding a new wicketkeeper who could bat nicely, in place of then regular Nayan Mongia and many keepers like MSK Prasad, Vijay Dahiya, and Sameer Dighe. But this was the year 2001, before the time of Twitter and social media and the incumbent officials of the Bihar cricket association didn’t have many means or intention of giving this news of selection to MS Dhoni. By the time the news of selection reached Ranchi, it was too late and the East Zone team had already left to Agartala for the flight. But MS Dhoni’s friend Paramjit Singh hired a Tata Sumo car after getting contribution from locals and along with Dhoni and couple of friends, including his future brother- in-law Gautam Gupta, started a race against time to help Dhoni reach the match with just 20 hours in hand. Unfortunately, their journey came to a screeching halt, as the car developed some problems and Bengal keeper, Deep Dasgupta played for East Zone as a wicketkeeper against South Zone. One can say that Dasgupta was preferred over Dhoni since he had already played Tests for India by that time and officials knowingly didn’t want the message to reach Dhoni in time. He couldn’t play that match, but went to Pune for the second match with the team and was included as a 12th man and Sachin Tendulkar who played for West Zone and scored a match winning 199*, had asked MS Dhoni for water, making it his first interaction with the batting great After this Dhoni got a job as ticket collector for the South Eastern Railways, but due to his cricketing commitments, was irregular at work and was served a notice by the railways. Fortunately, after 3 years, he was included in the India A side against Kenya and he grabbed the opportunity with both hands and was the Man of the series. And suddenly, the country came to know of a keeper that was a quick runner between wickets, was a good keeper and more importantly, could hit big shots, which went out of the ground. Thanks to some backing by East Zone selector Pranab Roy, Dhoni managed to earn the India cap within a year of that Kenya series. source : Story of how a young MS Dhoni was denied a chance for an early India debut - CricTracker ""Two things define you.

I have very closely dealt with institutes offering training in Digital marketing and here I am sharing my views about the best digital marketing course. Whether it is advanced tools or integrated digital marketing strategy, at this point in time one definitely needs to know these skills for efficient performance. What I have realized so far is that these are not very difficult to learn, there are actually a lot of things to learn which makes it look so complex. Only a few courses, these days are able to provide effective training around digital marketing.  If you browse the internet, you can easily find many courses offering digital marketing courses and to the best of my knowledge, I find institutes like IIM SKILLS best for learning digital marketing. They have been in the industry for near around 6-7 years and are quite popular among students and professionals. What I genuinely like about them is that the institute solely believes that theories don’t help in learning as much as practicals do. Coming back to IIM SKILLS, the students there have to build a WordPress website of their own choice and as they learn various digital marketing strategies, they can apply their knowledge practically on their sites to see the strategies work in real-time. Though the industry keeps improving but the fundamentals remain the same and therefore IIM SKILLS offers skills that are necessary for anyone in order to become a digital marketing professional. The skills offered are: Inbound MarketingEmail MarketingSocial Media MarketingSearch Engine OptimizationSearch Engine MarketingVideo MarketingIntegrated Marketing StrategyMedia Buying and PlanningAdvanced BloggingIn addition to what I have mentioned before, The course is actually suitable for everyone, in fact there is no restriction on who can or cannot enroll this course. Anyone with such interests or one who wants to become a digital marketing professional can do this course. The certifications are most important when it comes to applying for jobs and IIM SKILLS offers 4 certifications which are highly valuable. The offered certifications are: Google CertificationHubspot CertificationFacebook Blueprint CertificationIIM SKILLS Master Course CertificationThis is all I know, and you can definitely find more on the internet. Thank you for reading. I am doing a job in digital marketing and I can tell you many things about digital marketing courses.

Most important thing is that don’t waste money on a digital marketing course. I have done internship twice in digital marketing during my college days and then after finishing college, I completed a 4 months course in digital marketing. My experience says that I did not learn anything new from the course. They just teach you basics and you can’t get perfect because of lack of practical knowledge. My suggestion is to do internships in companies and there you will learn a lot of things because of real work and pressure. There are many companies where you can do an internship and enhance your skills. On my first day of internship, I had 0% knowledge in digital marketing. But with the time you will learn things. There is youtube available for every problem. Trust me, you can learn digital marketing on youtube if you have some basic knowledge. Many videos are available on every topic. If you want to build your career in digital marketing then start finding companies for internships. Maybe they will not pay you but the amount of experience you get from these companies are amazing. Start reading blogs about topics on digital marketing. Reading will teach you a lot. According to me, you must get knowledge of these topics under digital marketing.

Digital Marketing is the new trend. Everyone wants to learn digital marketing and start earning online. But which course is best for you?  Let me answer this very frankly. A Single Course can not make you an expert in Digital Marketing. Why I am saying this? Because when I was searching for a course in digital marketing I had the same question in my mind. I have gone through more than 20–30 courses, attended more than 10–12 pre-enrollment session of different course selling companies (Online & Offline) Finally decided to enroll with one of them (Don't want to mention the name) I won’t say the cou Continue ReadingDigital Marketing is the new trend. Everyone wants to learn digital marketing and start earning online. But which course is best for you?  Let me answer this very frankly. A Single Course can not make you an expert in Digital Marketing. Why I am saying this? Because when I was searching for a course in digital marketing I had the same question in my mind. I have gone through more than 20–30 courses, attended more than 10–12 pre-enrollment session of different course selling companies (Online & Offline) Finally decided to enroll with one of them (Don't want to mention the name) I won’t say the course was not good. But it was more of a basics knowledge of digital marketing. Digital Marketing is a very vast field, There is so much to learn and every day people are inventing new trends in digital marketing. There is so much to learn and trust me anything you want to learn is available for free on the internet. So my first advice would be to don’t purchase courses from the companies that offer courses like, Basis to Advanced DIgital Marketing, A to Z Digital Marketing, 24+ Module Digital Marketing Course. They will charge you around 25K – 50K and promise you that you’ll get placed in a good company. Later they are only going to offer you internships with a basic stipend. SO Don’t Fall for them. As I told you before you can’t be a Digital Marketing Expert from a single course in just 3 or 6 months. So I would suggest you start learning Digital Marketing skills one by one. Once you master one skill you can go for another one. Some of the skills you can start with, Social Media MarketingSEO ( Search Engine Optimization)PPC/ Paid AdvertisingContent MarketingWordPress/ Web DesigningEmail MarketingAffiliate MarketingFacebook Ads ExpertSales Funnels ExpertSo these are the skills which are in trend these days, You can choose any one of them and start learning. But the question still lefts remains the same that Which is the best courses to learn these skills? Everything is available on the Internet and youtube for free. But if you still want to join some courses. You can buy a course from UDEMY, Coursera which offers a great courses at a very affordable price. Other than that you can reads blogs and watch case studies of successful peoples. There are many internet marketers who offers their personalised course to learn these skills. They share their personal experienceand tested and proven methods to master these skills, So you can join one of them. There courses are very affordable and make sure they offer mentor support so that whenever you have doubts, It can be solved. So once you have learned these skills, The most important part is to apply it. You cannot learn Advanceddigital marketing until to apply it yourself. Best way is to start a blog or a website and start applying all this knowledge on this. You can sign up on social media platforms and start building your profiles. Share valuable content over there, start reaching people for your services. If you family and friends have some king of online business , you can approach them and tell them what you can do for them.

Once published, you can promote it to your audience. At the same time, Udami also helps to promote its course at its end. Promoting products / services as influencer I am sure you have heard that celebrities have charged the bomb for mentioning the brand name on Instagram or talking about it on Facebook. This is called influencer marketing. And don't have to be a big celebrity to earn money from it. If you have a target audience, you can charge money to promote the product or services. For example, if you have a Facebook group consisting primarily of parents, you can charge a fixed fee to promote the product or service for parents / children. Or if you have a good Instagram of people interested in fitness, you can charge brands to promote your weight loss products / services.

While a lot of clients may be looking for native English speaking writers, even as a writer from India, you can find a good amount of work. Just make sure that your articles are high quality and grammatically correct. One great thing about being in India and gaining access to such platforms is that you have a chance to start a competition to start your services at a lower price with which to start. This can help you get those initial customers and build some credibility in the platform. I work with many authors on these platforms and pay them between 500 and $ 1500 per month (depending on the amount of work that they deliver). Become an insurance agent.

First of all, you should know who to trust. Some companies may also ask you to register with them before working on projects. The most important watch in such projects should always be away from websites that offer money that seems too good to be true. Be careful and cautious when evaluating the reputation of a website as many of them may be a scam or fraud. But, if the company provides trust and security, you can easily earn a lot of money with this amazing survey, search and review method. The conclusion There are many ways to earn money online, and none of those methods are easy. This will require a lot of work and you may have to wait patiently for it to bloom. But it is still worth it. If you are a beginner, I would recommend starting a niche site. It is one of the best ways to earn money online and opens up a lot of potential avenues for monetizing the site. The best thing about earning money online is that once you have a steady income with one method, it is easy to add some other methods to it and earn more money in a short period of time. For example, I was using one of my blogs to earn money online using display ads. But as soon as I offered my courses, my income immediately increased 3 times. I added more affiliate products to my site and made more money from the same audience and similar traffic. So work hard on one of these methods, and once you crack it, work on stacking multiple income sources.

In this post I’m going to walk you through the steps to start affiliate marketing in India. To keep the video short & simple, we’ve covered just the basics there. All the steps shown in the video will be explained in detail in this article. Let’s start with the basics: What is Affiliate Marketing? Affiliate Marketing is simply: This is how it works: You find a product you want to promoteYou sign up for their affiliate programYou will get a special link (called as an affiliate link) which allows the company to see who clicked your link.You promote your affiliate link on the internet.When someone buys the product, you will be paid a commission.There are hundreds of affiliate programs all over the internet for all types of products. But in India, the most popular affiliate programs are from Amazon and Flipkart. So in this article we’ll focus on promoting products from these sites. The best part about Amazon is, once someone has clicked your affiliate link you will earn commissions on any product bought by them in the next 24hrs. This means, you’ll be paid for not just the product you promote but for all products sold on amazon. For example: Let’s say, A person clicks on your affiliate link at 9 a.m. But buys nothing! Again at 8 p.m, he/she goes to amazon directly & buys a product. You’ll get the commission for the sale. This is because when someone clicks your affiliate link a ‘cookie’ gets placed in the user’s browser and all purchases he/she makes within the next 24hrs, will be credited to you. STEP 1: Choose the type of product you want to promote select a category which interests you the most. Since you’ll be writing on this topic later, make sure you choose a topic which you’re familiar with. The reason you need to choose one specific topic is because, it will make it easier for you to write for a specific audience. This is also called as selecting a ‘niche’. STEP 2: Create a Website After you’ve selected your topic, it’s time to make your website. Even though there are other ways to promote your affiliate link, the most effective and future-proof way is with the help of your own website. Your website will form the foundation of your online business. STEP 3: Sign-up for the Amazon Affiliate Program Once you’ve created your website, you can sign up for the affiliate program. If you’re thinking about choosing between either flipkart or amazon affiliate program, go for the one which has the higher commissions for the product category you’ve chosen. If both has the same commission rate, go for amazon. Many affiliate marketers in India have said to have made more money in amazon than flipkart. Amazon Affiliate Program: Sign-up here (recommended)Flipkart Affiliate Program: Sign-up here During registration amazon will ask you to enter your website address and a few other details. Even if you haven’t added any content to your site yet, tell them how you plan to promote products on your site and they’ll approve it. STEP 4: Select the item you’re going to promote If you already know the product you’re going to promote, then go ahead and search the product name in the search box provided. If you’re not sure yet, then it’s a good idea to take help from amazon and see which products are selling well. To do this: Go to the amazon bestsellers page.Select your category from the left side. You’ll see a list of the top selling products in that category.Pick a product which you like (preferably one with a lot of positive reviews).When you promote a product which is already selling well it is a lot easier to get people to buy it compared to promoting an unknown product. STEP 5: Write content about the product Based on the product you’ve chosen, decide on what article you want to write. There are many different types of content you can write. I’ve listed the most popular types of content for affiliate marketing below: 5 Types of Content you can Write: “How to” articles & tutorials: These are the best as they add a lot of value to your readers. They also generate sales very easily if done correctly. For example, “How to get rid of pimples” article with links to products which has worked well for you.Review articles: You can write about products you’ve tried personally and help people decide whether to buy the product or not.Comparison articles: Compare two or more similar products. Eg. Samsung S6 vs iPhone 6sContent Curation: This is where you collect & make a useful list products which are helpful to others.Offer or Discount articles where you share the best deals and coupons codes of products related to your topic.So, these are the types of content you can post to promote your affiliate link. Always make sure that your visitors get a benefit out of your site. How to Add your Affiliate Link When you’re signed into amazon associates, you’ll see a grey bar at the top of all product pages. To get your affiliate link for a product, simply click “link to this page”. Right click in the preview area and copy the link address (this is your affiliate link). Click the buy button in your article and click edit. Select link to custom URL & paste the link. Also check “open link in a new tab”. Click update & publish the article. Now, when you click the buy button displayed on the page, it’ll take the user to your affiliate link. This allows them to buy the product on amazon. How to check your earnings? You can check your earnings on the amazon associate page. When someone buys something using your affiliate link it will show up on your earning report page. So, this is how you can promote products using your affiliate link. All of these steps can be used on any ecommerce site of your choice. Eg: Flipkart, Snapdeal, Jabong, etc. I hope this post helps you kickstart your own affiliate marketing site. Once you figure out how to add value to your readers, it will be very easy to attract traffic and get sales. If you have any doubts or questions, share them in the comments below.

Yojimbo (1961)  Quite simply, it’s a masterclass in cinematic storytelling, the timeless tale of a lone drifter who blows into town and takes out the trash. Based on the hard-boiled crime novels Red Harvest and The Glass Key by Dashiell Hammett, Yojimbo (often translated as The Bodyguard) plays second fiddle to Akira Kurosawa’s better-known outings like Seven Samurai and Rashomon, but it’s nonetheless a classic. Toshiro Mifune lights up the screen as the gruff ronin antihero Sanjuro (the original “Man with No Name”) and Tatsuya Nakadai is unforgettable as the sinister gun-toting villain Unosu Continue Reading1.

Based on the hard-boiled crime novels Red Harvest and The Glass Key by Dashiell Hammett, Yojimbo (often translated as The Bodyguard) plays second fiddle to Akira Kurosawa’s better-known outings like Seven Samurai and Rashomon, but it’s nonetheless a classic. Toshiro Mifune lights up the screen as the gruff ronin antihero Sanjuro (the original “Man with No Name”) and Tatsuya Nakadai is unforgettable as the sinister gun-toting villain Unosuke. Add in Masaru Sato’s eerie score and Akira Kurosawa’s absolutely impeccable cinematography and editing, and what you’ve got (in my humble opinion) is the best film ever made. It’s got everything. Machismo. Hectic swordplay. Showdowns at high noon. This “Eastern” almost out-Westerns the spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, who (it’s said) cribbed directly from Kurosawa and particularly Yojimbo to make A Fistful of Dollars three years later. It is, and probably always will be, my favorite film of all time. 2. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)  I really don’t feel the need to explain this one. Saw it for the first time when I was twelve or thirteen and from that point on, Indy was my number-one hero. I wanted his life. I may or may not have a fedora, a leather jacket, and a kangaroo-hide bullwhip in my closet as I type this. 3. Hatari! (1962)  I’m a huge fan of John Wayne and of Westerns in general…but this ain’t a Western, funnily enough. John Wayne plays hard-bitten animal wrangler Sean Mercer, who leads a diverse crew of drivers, marksmen, zookeepers, and other animal specialists in East Africa, whose job it is to capture wild animals for zoos. How do they do this? By running them down in trucks and jeeps and lassoing them with ropes. This film is awesome. The plot is nothing to write home about, just a cheesy romance between the Duke and Elsa Martinelli, with a few moments of campy comedy in between—but it has an incredible score by Henry Mancini, and includes gorgeous shots of Tanzania, including the Ngorogoro Crater and the Manyara region. The animal chases are thrilling, and there are tons of them. Before I fell in love with Indiana Jones, I was convinced that I would one day be driving a beat-up, asthmatic old pickup truck around the Serengeti, chasing down zebras and giraffes and wildebeest. 4. The Road Warrior (1981)  The first Mad Max film was good, but Mad Max 2 (or The Road Warrior, as it was called in the United States, because nobody there had ever heard of the original) was apocalyptically glorious. Souped-up rat rods, leather-wearing baddies, a dry and dusty wasteland, a tanker full of juice, Mel Gibson’s bleak and beat-up visage, the sawed-off shotgun and, of course, that mean-lookin’ V8 Interceptor adds up to all the dystopian post-apocalyptic vehicular manslaughter you could want in one film. Don’t take my word for it, though. Here’s an excellent (and extremely obscene) video review. 5. The Thing (1982)  I’m a huge fan of sci-fi films. I also like sci-fi horror, when it’s done right. I’m also a big John Carpenter fan, and a fan of Golden Age science fiction. The Thing may have the most perfect premise for a horror story ever. So there’s this bunch of American guys at an Antarctic research base. Winter’s closing in. Out of nowhere, a helicopter full of crazy gun-toting Norwegians shows up, shooting at what looks like an ordinary Siberian husky. The Norwegians accidentally blow themselves up with grenades, and the befuddled Americans adopt the dog, and kennel it with the rest of the sled dogs. Later that night, R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) hears the sled dogs howling and screaming. When he and the rest of the team get to the kennels, they see that the sled dog they’ve recently adopted has shed its skin and sprouted clawed tentacles, and its face has split into a slimy, fang-riddled maw, and it’s busily devouring the rest of the dogs. Things only get grosser and more paranoid from there, as MacReady and the others slowly realize that the Thing can perfectly imitate any living creature, including humans, and in all likelihood has already infected one or more of the team. The Thing is one of the best horror films I’ve ever seen, both suspenseful and disturbing not only because of its gore and special effects (although those are excellent), but because of its amazing premise. What would you do if you were trapped in a cramped Antarctic research base with a being that could absorb and subsume you at the slightest touch, with teammates who could already be infected? 1.

Having a proactive method did help me to insert a few jokes too! Regardless, of the quality of the jokes, I was able to cover a major chunk of the content. A tip would be to not write everything down - word for word. It would prohibit you from being natural and smooth. Recording Resources If you have got a recent, advanced smartphone, I would recommend to use it cause why not? I have a Samsung Galaxy S9. It gives really great 1080K videos in the output. Though I did have to invest some money in a cheap lapel/lavalier mic. This was a great investment since my videos also depend on voicing over and audio content. Similarly, I am thinking of getting a tripod for my recordings. This would really make my video recording a one-man job. Editing Resources I initially was editing my videos on just Shotcut. The tool is designed keeping beginners in mind. It does help you apply some filters and adjust the video and sound properties. Learning it would be a 15 minute task. You could just youtube it. I also realized that many people would not be listening to the audio but just watch videos. Then I thought of inserting subtitles. I used Typito Their auto-captions generation automatically assigned the captions in the video saving me considerable time. Plus, it's got some good features too like titles and animations. Location The location really varies according to your own need. I spoke to my gym owner if I could record my videos in his gym and he agreed! As a part of good ethic I mentioned them in my videos. Kind of a win-win. So that's almost that. I did start with no experience and then ended up learning a lot and ended up producing 7 videos! It does help to regularly improve the quality of the videos which you can notice if you compare my first and my recent vid.  Overall, it's not such a tough process if you break down the whole mountain. That's my 2 cent advice.

So here it is NDTV made a mistake. They always do and it surely compromises the security of the nation and men who stand there to face the real situation totally unbiased from what all is coming in media. Many people are blaming the authorities that why did they allowed the media at the first place but my friends they were allowed only to the certain extent where every other news channel from BBC world to any local news channel was allowed and they can’t just ban one channel until proven guilty and when one tense situation is going on and authorities are busy dealing with the situation no one is going to take action right then so it is happening after 11 months after government was sure of that they have enough material to pose a ban that could not be challenged onto the court then they decided to impose the ban. Now NDTV should have been more careful while reporting during the operation in Pathankot. All news channels did much more in Mumbai during 26/11, Barkha Dutt did worse during Kargil. Media must introspect and NDTV should take it on their chin, make self-corrections, and move on. But there are other questions...1. In Pathankot and Uri, there was clearly an inside angle. In Pathankot, an SP was in the spotlight. He was easily given clean chit. Why? Drug money? Smuggling? Money going to Badals with whom BJP is in alliance? 2. When ISI was invited to inspect Pathankot, was our national security not compromised? Who will be punished or banned for this? 3. Why was NDTV India singled out? Other channels did the same at different times. Is it because Ravish poses uncomfortable questions to the government much more often? It would be nice if all the news channels get united and black themselves out on the same day as the NDTV in an act of solidarity. This would be a penance for their mistakes; it would also be a fitting reply to the government. This is my point. Edit 1 a lot of ppl are arguing with me that bringing isi was no mistake and I tried to reason everything the way I can do publicly but seriously it s disturbing how ppl follow government blindly. Gov are created for controlling ppl like us all around the world through our the history in the most civic manner possible.so I like modi..its way betr than last government but even a good government can be bad and make pre notioned un fair decision and we should not promote this culture it is my point…. Now do you think Pakistan will ever invite raw or army officials for investigation the same way we did..in Pakistan sarif would be killed or murdered by army for this thing. Do you think America would ever invite pak or China to investigate even into Pentagon gardens? No.n America has far better terms with both the countries than us.n here we can do anything.because there would always be fools to support government blindly just coz media said so. I am going to talk only facts, no non-sense. Lets first understand the problem.Here is a good brief by Hindustan Times on Why was NDTV India banned and what does the law say?

Lets first understand the problem.Here is a good brief by Hindustan Times on Why was NDTV India banned and what does the law say? Amid all the outrage, there is still confusion over why the ban was imposed and under which law. Here is an explanation of some important aspects of the ban: What does the ban entail? The Information & Broadcasting ministry has passed an order to “prohibit the transmission or re-transmission of NDTV India channel for one day on any platform throughout India with effect from 00:01 hrs on 9th November,2016 till 00:01 hrs of 10th November, 2016”. Why was NDTV India banned? Sources in the Information &Broadcasting ministry say action was taken against the channel because it had revealed sensitive details, such as the location of the ammunition depot, school and residential areas in its coverage of the Pathankot attack. It also appeared to disclose the location of the attackers. This crucial information could have been readily picked up by the terrorists’ handlers and jeopardised national security as well as the lives of civilians and defence personnel. What does the law say? Under Rule 6(1)(p) of the Cable TV Network (Regulation) Act, no programme should be carried in the cable service which contains live coverage of any anti-terrorist operation by security forces, wherein media coverage shall be restricted to periodic briefing by an officer designated by the appropriate government, till such operation concludes. What was the process followed? January 29: Showcause notice was issued to NDTV India for violation of Cable Act; they were asked to reply within 15 days. February 5: The channel responded, submitting that the coverage was balanced and responsible. July 25: Channel’s representatives were given a personal hearing before an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC). November 2: The order announcing the ban was made public. NDTV India can take legal recourse and appeal the ban. What were the observations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC)? The IMC, which includes joint secretaries home, defence, I&B, health and family welfare, consumer affairs, law and justice, external affairs, women and child development and representative of the Advertising Standards Council of India recommended that NDTV India be taken off-air for one day. In its report to the Information & Broadcasting ministry, the IMC observed that disclosure of sensitive information has several ramifications such as causing alarm and de-moralisation of citizens and security forces, collateral damage to critical assets, apprehension among families of those serving in combat. Not the first timeSuch a thing has happened in the past as well. The issue is being given un-necessary footage this time. Here is what Venkaiyah Naidu has to say on politics around NDTV India ban: UPA government, during 2005-14, ordered several television channels to go off air in 21 instances, for a period ranging from one day to two months for showing obscene visuals including 13 cases of telecasting adult-rated films when most of the children and the young would have been fast asleep. People of the country are also wise enough to appreciate which of the two violations — showing obscene visuals at the stroke of midnight and risking the lives of defense personnel and civilians through a live telecast of anti-terrorist operations in broad daylight — is a serious threat to the interest of the nation Where NDTV went wrong?Remember the law stated above regarding such a situation? Now here is where NDTV went wrong, the exact reason why I&B Ministry recommended a token ban on NDTV India:    These are the transcripts of NDTV reporter’s live reporting of that day. The law clearly says that no program should be carried in the cable service which contains live coverage of any anti-terrorist operation by security forces, wherein media coverage shall be restricted to periodic briefing by an officer designated by the appropriate Government, till such operation concludes. Clearly NDTV did not heed to the law at all. My opinionOne day ban is very appropriate action. I don’t believe in the concept of 100% freedom. Media and a small group of self proclaimed liberals preach ‘absolute freedom of media’, which, in my opinion, is wrong idea. Nothing is above law. You have ZERO freedom against law. As simple as that. Inter ministerial committee (IMC)of information and broadcasting ministry imposed a ban of one day to NDTV channel.Govt.will achieve nothing from one day ban. Govt.should award financial ban in lieu of one day ban. some are saying that coverage of pathankot attack broadcasting in NDTV was a threat with national security.But listen that it might had been happened unintentionally.

NDTV summarizes and cover-up full things and point out the exact location of MIGs,fighter planes,rocket launchers etc to the terrorists.A more fatal accident might be happened because of this.but everyone should have get a chance to correct himself.so financial ban was necessary not a single day banNDTV NDTV India is anti BJP channels,but it also played a key role to coverage 2G scam and provided a concrete news to all viewers .What about Zee news.it is a pro BJP channel but it doesn't mean than when Congress come in power will ban zee news irrespective of concrete facts.

The type of employer can make a big difference in whether or not the person stays with their employer for a long time. The one question people always ask is ""What is the best way to be a professional SEO specialist?""  Having thought about this question and having considered the answers some I feel like there is one answer that can answer this question and a few other questions. This is an answer I call ""your love of the craft"". This answer might take some getting used to but the good news is it's very easy to get started and it takes very little effort to begin to build up your skills. So, what is the best way to be a professional SEO specialist? If you have the skills and the passion for the art of Search Engine Optimization and for helping other people to see themselves in the same light as you then there are very few things that you will not be able to do. Since so many companies hire people who do not know what they are doing or how to go about doing their job, the only thing holding them back is often the fact that they are not totally clear on how to go about it. This brings us to the answer to the question of what is the best way to be a professional SEO specialist. Once you have your information set straight and have confidence in your abilities you can then find out what the companies you are considering working for actually require of you. Many employers expect that you learn a specific skill that they need and if this is the case then it is likely that the skill that you learn would lead to being hired for the job. If the company requires a more generalized skill set that you can apply to everything then this is great. The other thing to consider is the fact that you may get a pay increase once you start to get more experience at doing the specific skill set. Answering this question is pretty straight forward, and you will find that once you find something that you really want to do and that you enjoy then this is a good career option for you. If you are working towards a good income and if the information is available to you, then this is a good way to keep yourself motivated. Going after a pay raise from a larger company may lead to a job working for them right away or it could lead to a second or third job as a freelancer. It really all depends on the employee and how much time and money they are willing to put into the pursuit of a dream. Going after a paycheck after hours of sleep can be a great feeling, and being paid for your work is a good feeling too. The only way to find out is to find out what the job description for your specific skills is and then go find out!

We have added 7 best SEO tips for beginners that will help you to rank your website at the top in 2019. 1. Concentrate On Us Continue Readingf you really want to be at the top of the ladder, it’s not sufficient to look out popular trends. Promoters make the strategy for SEO to optimize their website to get the first rank in Google because this will help you to get more website traffic. Now, the question arises how to rank your websites and blogs. Well, search engine optimization techniques have changed a lot. That’s the reason we have to take advice from an expert to make the best SEO tactics for your business. We have added 7 best SEO tips for beginners that will help you to rank your website at the top in 2019. 1. Concentrate On User Query In order to generate a user query, we need to understand the distinct types of the user query. Enter those keywords which our user would be looking for and based on those keywords we’ll be able to recognize what type of content our audience wants. Well, there are the 3 types of query generally search by the users on the internet. Informative queriesIn informative queries, people search in Google for the particular subject. It can be a topic, theme, and thesis. For example, people might search for “how to do SEO”. Well, People aren’t searching for any shopping website or product they are searching for particular information regarding their queries. Navigational queriesIn navigational queries, people search in search engine for special kind of content by review their choices. For example, “What is the best software for video editing?” However, many sites may include links to purchase, but websites aren’t pressurizing the users to buy. “Facebook” and “YouTube” are the well-known name for navigational queries. Transactional queriesAs I’m using the term transactional, you guys must have a question in your mind– is it something regarding banking transaction? Well, yes. So if you have the credit card in your pocket, be ready to purchase the products. Suppose if you search for “Where can I buy shoes?” That means we are ready to pay for the product. For example, online shopping websites selling their products that people want to buy. This kind of websites doesn’t contain any information regarding blogs. Now, I hope you guys understand these 3 types of queries. You can optimize your content for better ranking of a website using these 3 queries. 2. Internal linking of a website I’m a huge fan of internal links. As we all know “Content is a King in SEO.” Internal linking is a technique used for especially in content marketing. Let’s talk about what is internal linking and how it’s the impact on our website ranking? When we link our website from one page to another page in the same domain is referred to as internal linking. Why internal linking? Internal linking is necessary for the website because it helps to maintain the structure of the site and publish the link. Internal linking can be done by creating links on the website’s header, navigation bar or footer. How to do internal linking? Create long contentIf we want to create long content then we must have a lot of internal pages. For better internal linking we have to create more links on our site it’ll help us to increase the page rank of our site, increase the no. of visitors and site performance.

To demonstrate what Windows lack, I will show you why Apple is a great brand.From the beginning of Apple, Steve Jobs stressed on design and look of his products. He used to ask his engineers to redo the designs until he is satisfied. When he launched his first OS for Mac, he was so concerned with the way the calculator program looked that the engineer responsible for it made a software where Steve himself could design it. Steve came up with a pretty good design which was the Apple's standard calculator design for the coming years. You can see his vision in action here. See how Mac OS used to look in 2000 and compare it to Windows.   Mac OS X   Windows 2000 See how classic Mac OS used to look? Right, first impression is the best impression. What people see first is how the product looks and yes, Mac OS was incredible with its awe inspiring, glassy looking title bars, scroll bars and menus. And see those grayish windows boxes as if there are no other colors in the world. Now the second aspect. Performance.Steve Jobs used to believe that the software should be seamlessly integrated with the hardware. That is, the software should be made in such a way that it works best on the hardware it was built for. It should not be licensed for others to use, because that will mess up with the performance. See it in this way. If you are building a website, the design you have in mind can be easily implemented on your system. But as you transport it to some other system with a different screen size, the whole design goes haywire. Howsoever good you have made it, what you will get won't be the same as what you thought.   Contradictory to what Steve believed in, Bill Gates licensed his software to other companies. This led to the dis-harmony between the hardware it was installed on and the OS itself. Because it was not custom made.Windows, when used on other hardware lags and gets stuck while Mac runs very smoothly. This is the reason more than 90% developers and graphic designers use a Mac. Also, I feel that a Mac is easier to use as compared to Windows. Every one who has bought a Windows after using Mac for an year or two can testify this. Windows suck realtime. Can you believe the most trustworthy OS they built was back in 2001 when they made Windows XP??I mean where is the F-ing innovation?? To conclude, I would say Windows is great but it lags a lot (remember that there is a technical and non-technical meaning for the word 'lag'). It lags behind a Mac in terms of looks, quality of software, ease of use and but ya leads in terms of viruses and stupid software (bloatware to be precise) built for it which eats up memory. I’ve been using windows since I was 13 years old. That’s almost 30 years. Back then I think it was Windows version 3.0 running on an ancient Nimbus 186.

I’ve tried this with Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 95 SE, Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8 and Windows 10. This is despite the fact that I am a Certified Microsoft Technician and have sat and passed a course on networking with Microsoft. The minimum pass mark is 100%. You literally resit it until you get every answer correct and each test is randomised. I passed first try. If after 30 years, 10 operating systems and an MS qualification in networking I still can’t transfer a bloody file from one Windows OS computer to another Windows OS computer using an Ethernet cable then I’m guessing that a lot of other people also find this next to impossible. I forgot to mention my BEng Degree in Software Engineering. It’s supposed to be one of the easiest things to do. I’ve written my own firmware drivers for comms chips and developed the hardware to communicate remotely via RS232 and RS485 and that was easier to achieve than getting two Windows computers to talk to one another. And that required probes, EPROM flash writers, specialised hardware and software and a bloody high quality oscilloscope, yet it was still easier. To say that Windows is a steaming pile of shit is the understatement of all the universes combined. Even God couldn’t make it worse than it is. I literally don’t have a long enough life span to get one of the simplest functions to work. It is omni-shit! Compared to the Mac OS (my preferred OS), Windows gets in the way of using a computer. Microsoft does not care how you work with a computer as long as you do it their way.  The paradigm for Windows is that it is a computer geek's environment. Designed and run by geeks. And, as such, it works for them.  Unfortunately, for most users, it is a tool needed to accomplish work. And, as a tool, it gets in the way. Command structures differ from program to program.

Crashes are frequent. Messages can be obtuse. The system requires constant intervention. The system will reboot for upgrades with little warning if you aren't attentive, no matter what you are doing. It has not, in the past, been user friendly.  I've used Windows and Mac OSs since the first PCs came out. Larger systems as well. Off them all, including C/PM, Windows is the most difficult because of its frequent crashes and lack of standard operability.  I keep my Macs running most of the time. I simply don't shut them down or reboot unless an upgrade requires it. I don't worry about viruses (I'm careful where I compute). I bet, between 2 machines, I have not had 5 crashes requiring a reboot in 5 years. That has been the case for as long as I remember.  I can't leave my Windows machine up (required for certain software I had to run) full time. It's far more vulnerable to intrusion and other nasty bits. Worse, it's crash history is appalling. It crashes at least once, every time I use it.  But, crashes aside, the biggest problem is that it is less user-friendly than Macs and has a steeper learning curve.",2021-03-05T11:18:08.830Z,"Why do people hate Windows? ",Quora

The whole Scripal’s comedy is a plain schmaltz. Look at these two murderous killers occupying the same space at the precisely up to seconds same moment. Enjoy.  Craig Murray Skripals – The Mystery Deepens 995 6 Sep, 2018 The time that “Boshirov and Petrov” were allegedly in Salisbury carrying out the attack is all entirely within the period the Skripals were universally reported to have left their home with their mobile phones switched off. A key hole in the British government’s account of the Salisbury poisonings has been plugged – the lack of any actual suspects. And it has been plugged in a way that appears broadly convincing – these two men do appear to have traveled to Salisbury at the right time to have been involved. But what has not been established is the men’s identity and that they are agents of the Russian state, or just what they did in Salisbury. If they are Russian agents, they are remarkably amateur assassins. Meanwhile the new evidence throws the previously reported timelines into confusion – and demolishes the theories put out by “experts” as to why the Novichok dose was not fatal. This BBC report gives a very useful timeline summary of events. At 09.15 on Sunday 4 March the Skripals’ car was seen on CCTV driving through three different locations in Salisbury. Both Skripals had switched off their mobile phones and they remained off for over four hours, which has baffled geo-location. There is no CCTV footage that indicates the Skripals returning to their home. It has therefore always been assumed that they last touched the door handle around 9am. But the Metropolitan Police state that Boshirov and Petrov did not arrive in Salisbury until 11.48 on the day of the poisoning. That means that they could not have applied a nerve agent to the Skripals’ doorknob before noon at the earliest. But there has never been any indication that the Skripals returned to their home after noon on Sunday 4 March. If they did so, they and/or their car somehow avoided all CCTV cameras. Remember they were caught by three CCTV cameras on leaving, and Borishov and Petrov were caught frequently on CCTV on arriving. The Skripals were next seen on CCTV at 13.30, driving down Devizes road. After that their movements were clearly witnessed or recorded until their admission to hospital. So even if the Skripals made an “invisible” trip home before being seen on Devizes Road, that means the very latest they could have touched the doorknob is 13.15. The longest possible gap between the novichok being placed on the doorknob and the Skripals touching it would have been one hour and 15 minutes. Do you recall all those “experts” leaping in to tell us that the “ten times deadlier than VX” nerve agent was not fatal because it had degraded overnight on the doorknob? Well that cannot be true. The time between application and contact was between a minute and (at most) just over an hour on this new timeline. In general it is worth observing that the Skripals, and poor Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, all managed to achieve almost complete CCTV invisibility in their widespread movements around Salisbury at the key times, while in contrast “Petrov and Boshirov” managed to be frequently caught in high quality all the time during their brief visit. This is especially remarkable in the case of the Skripals’ location around noon on 4 March. The government can only maintain that they returned home at this time, as they insist they got the nerve agent from the doorknob. But why was their car so frequently caught on CCTV leaving, but not at all returning? It appears very much more probable that they came into contact with the nerve agent somewhere else, while they were out. “Boshirov and Petrov” plainly are of interest in this case. But only Theresa May stated they were Russian agents: the police did not, and stated that they expected those were not their real identities. We do not know who Boshirov and Petrov were. It appears very likely their appearance was to do with the Skripals on that day. But they may have been meeting them, outside the home. The evidence points to that, rather than doorknobs. Such a meeting might explain why the Skripals had turned off their mobile phones to attempt to avoid surveillance. It is also telling the police have pressed no charges against them in the case of Dawn Sturgess, which would be manslaughter at least if the government version is true. If “Boshirov and Petrov” are secret agents, their incompetence is astounding. They used public transport rather than a vehicle and left the clearest possible CCTV footprint. They failed in their assassination attempt. They left traces of novichok everywhere and could well have poisoned themselves, and left the “murder weapon” lying around to be found. Their timings in Salisbury were extremely tight – and British Sunday rail service dependent. There are other possibilities of who “Boshirov and Petrov” really are, of which Ukrainian is the obvious one. One thing I discovered when British Ambassador to Uzbekistan was that there had been a large Ukrainian ethnic group of scientists working at the Soviet chemical weapon testing facility there at Nukus. There are many other possibilities. Yesterday’s revelations certainly add to the amount we know about the Skripal event. But they raise as many new questions as they give answers.

Pros of a major studio: Marketing (more resources available for marketing)Distribution (more resources for distribution)“Quality” (release by a major studio is perceived to have some standard, although people might ridicule a studio film, there is a certain level of professionalism expected in the film)Cons of a major studio: Less control (unless you’re the next big thing, you have very little say over everything - no final cut, no marketing, etc)Less attention - your film is one of many and so they might not devote as much time to your filmDifficult to negotiate with (they have a lot more to offer you so you might not get a favorable contract, depends on how badly they want your film or how good you are at negotiating)Pros of an indie company: More say over your film - they’re more willing to work with you to make sure you’re satisfiedEasier to negotiate with - since you guys are more like partners, they’re usually more willing to negotiate with youMore targeted - indie company might spend a longer time trying to find the right target market for your filmCons of an indie company: Less resource for marketing (less money for marketing)Less resource for distribution (they’ll have to negotiate with other companies for distribution via VOD, TV, etc whereas studios will already have distribution partners)“Untested” - public not sure if the film is professionally made (a studio would not release an amateurish film whereas an indie company might)This is just a rough summary as every company is different. There’s a lot less difference than there used to be, but as someone who went to film school and to a TV production school I found the following to be true: Film was more about the application of art while TV was more the application of technology with more restraining rules of production. When you think about true TV programming (news, talk shows, sports, etc) it isn't ever very creative, at least as far as the actual production goes. You are going to have the same set ups across the board. A certain number of cameras set up for coverage so that post production is minimal, if it exists at all. Film production, on the other hand, has more freedom to apply different set ups, usually because there is time to do so and also the post production process is more involved. Many TV shows are shot more as a film production (Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Mr. Robot, etc) but you would never (hardly ever?) see a movie shot as a TV production (well, there is Jackass). In fact when TV shows cross over to film there is usually a radical change in the way the production is carried out. Budget which determines ability to hire/cast people. Think of it this way, McConaissance happened only after Matthew McConaughey rejected a $15 million role for a studio film for lower-paying, artistic films (source 'Dallas Buyers Club': Matthew McConaughey Rejected a $15 Million Paycheck). It was his personal choice to do so. If he didn't, the independent films would not be able to afford his usual rate and would have had to cast another less famous actor and the films might not received as much attention as it did. Budget affects everything as it determines access to talents. Some actors might simply want to do something purely for the money (i.e people suspect that's the reason behind Nicholas Cage's recent choices) whereas other actors might only be interested in films with higher budget as it guarantees a certain quality (i.e. I can't recall Tom Cruise or Leonardo Di Caprio in art house/independent films).  Your cast determines the perceived marketability of the film which affects foreign sales (international distribution basically) and numbers of screens that the exhibitors are willing to allocate (exhibition).  Some would say distribution is also a factor and it is BUT, a good independent film can secure distribution as the studio will generally pick it up (Slumdog Millionaire was made for $15 million, Paranormal Activity was made for $15,000 and Saw was made for $1.2 million). Conversely, a bad studio film might change to VOD or quickly exit the theaters (After Earth, etc). The main difference is the budget but it pretty much affects everything.",2021-03-05T11:23:09.849Z,"What are the differences between film productions and film distributors and what are their works?

There were may reasons to go in the military, and every person had their purposes in life. Mine was very simple.  I received a post card over the mail from the U. S. Army.  In the post card there were this soldiers exercising, and in the background you could see some city.  In the post card it read, ""Don't just visit Europe, go live there.""   I found it fascinating!!  So when I met the military recruiter, I asked him to guarantee Europe as my option to go in the military.  Fast forward 5 months and I found myself crossing the Atlantic to Frankfurt, Germany. I was scared, yet I was thrilled because I could not believe I was there.   I enjoyed every minute I spent in the military.  It was the best decision I made in my lifetime. But at the end of this story, why did I really go into the military?  I did it because I realized how much I love the United States of America, and what it stands for.  I loved the Honor and the Glory I received as a Soldier.  I did it because we stood for liberty and justice for all.  I did it because I loved spit shining boots.  I did it because I was proud of the uniform I wore.  I did it because the flag of the United States of America is something to be proud of.  I did it because when I hear the National Anthem, or Taps, or Reveille or Retreat, I still feel the goose bumps on my skin rise.  It is what I call, : For the Love of God and Country.""

When you have a friend who gets blown up in another country and you have to watch his family bury him in pieces because his body is scattered everywhere, it hurts. It pisses you the fuck off that someone somewhere did this just because hes an American. Then it makes you even more mad that they might be alive. What do you want at that point?

They do not belong in cages. Tigers and lions should be swimming, mating, hunting and raising their young, but life in a cage is all they get. Days spent traveling and being shipped to their next destination, that’s their life. Elephants do not freely give themselves to trainers. They are beaten and taken from their mothers and forced to perform out of fear. ANIMALS WERE NOT PUT HERE TO ENTERTAIN HUMANS.  Most accusations of animal cruelty in circuses focus on the elephants, but from an animal rights perspective, no animals should be forced to perform tricks in order to earn money for their human captors.  Circuses and Animal Rights The animal rights position is that animals have a right to be free of human use and exploitation. In a vegan world, animals would interact with humans when and if they want to, not because they are chained to a stake or trapped in a cage. Animal rights are not about bigger cages or more humane training methods; it's about not using or exploiting animals for food, clothing, or entertainment. Attention has focused on elephants because they are considered by many to be highly intelligent, are the largest circus animals, might be the most abused, and arguably suffer more in captivity than smaller animals. However, animal rights are not about ranking or quantifying suffering, because all sentient beings deserve to be free.  Circuses and Animal Welfare The animal welfare position is that humans have a right to use animals, but cannot harm animals gratuitously and must treat them ""humanely."" What is considered ""humane"" varies greatly. Many animal welfare advocates consider fur, foie gras, and cosmetics testing to be frivolous uses of animals, with too much animal suffering and not much benefit to humans. Some animal welfare advocates would say that eating meat is morally acceptable as long as the animals were raised and slaughtered ""humanely.""  Regarding circuses, some animal welfare advocates would support keeping animals in circuses as long as training methods are not too cruel. Los Angeles recently banned the use of bullhooks, a sharp tool that is used as punishment in training elephants. Many would support a ban on ""wild"" or ""exotic"" animals in circuses.  Circus Cruelty Animals in circuses are often beaten, shocked, kicked, or cruelly confined in order to train them to be obedient and do tricks. With elephants, the abuse begins when they are babies to break their spirits. All four of the baby elephant's legs are chained or tied for up to 23 hours per day. While they are chained, they are beaten and shocked with electric prods. It can take up to six months before they learn that struggling is futile. The abuse continues into adulthood, and they are never free of the bullhooks that puncture their skin. Bloody wounds are covered with makeup to conceal them from the public. Some argue that elephants must love performing because you can't bully such a large animal into doing tricks, but with the weapons at their disposal and years of physical abuse, elephant trainers can usually beat them into submission. There are, however, tragic cases where the elephants rampaged and/or killed their tormentors, leading to the elephants being put down.  Elephants are not the only victims of abuse in circuses. According to Big Cat Rescue, lions and tigers also suffer at the hands of their trainers: ""Often the cats are beaten, starved, and confined for long periods of time in order to get them to cooperate with what the trainers want. And life on the road means that most of a cat’s life is spent in a circus wagon in the back of a semi-truck or in a crowded, stinking box car on a train or barge.""  An investigation of one circus by Animal Defenders International found that the dancing bears ""spend around 90% of their time shut in their cages inside a trailer. Their time outside these miserable prison cells generally averages just 10 minutes a day on weekdays and 20 minutes on weekends."" ADI's video ""shows one bear desperately circling a small steel cage measuring about 31/2 feet wide, by 6ft deep and about 8ft high. The steel floor of this barren cage is covered in just a scattering of sawdust.""  With horses, dogs, and other domesticated animals, training and confinement may not be as torturous, but any time an animal is used commercially, the animals' well-being is not the first priority. Even if the circuses did not engage in cruel training or extreme confinement methods (zoos generally do not engage in cruel training or extreme confinement, but still violate the animals' rights), animal rights advocates would oppose the use of animals in circuses because of breeding, buying selling and confining animals violates their rights.  Circus Animals and the Law Bolivia was the first country in the world to ban animals in circuses. China and Greece followed. The United Kingdom has banned the use of ""wild"" animals in circuses but allows ""domesticated"" animals to be used. In the United States, the federal Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act would ban the use of nonhuman primates, elephants, lions, tigers, and other species in circuses, but has not been passed yet. While no U.S. states have banned animals in circuses, at least seventeen towns have banned them.  The welfare of the animals in circuses in the U.S. is governed by the Animal Welfare Act, which offers only the bare minimum of protection and does not prohibit the use of bullhooks or electric prods. Other laws, like the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act protect certain animals, such as elephants and sea lions. A lawsuit against Ringling Brothers was dismissed based on a finding that plaintiffs did not have standing; the court did not rule on the cruelty allegations.  The Solution While some animal advocates want to regulate the use of animals in circuses, circuses with animals will never be considered completely cruelty-free. Also, some advocates believe that a ban on bullhooks just causes the practice to remain backstage and does little to help the animals. The solution is to go vegan, boycott circuses with animals, and support animal-free circuses, such as Cirque du Soleil and Cirque Dreams.

Over the past 4 years, I’ve generated over 50 million organic views on my written content—with $0 spent on advertising, retargeting, or Boosting. I’ve written over 400+ columns for Inc Magazine exclusively. I’ve had work published in just about every major publication: TIME, Forbes, Fortune, Business Insider, CNBC, The Chicago Tribune, and dozens more. And in the past year, I’ve built a 17+ person company called Digital Press, writing and publishing over 1,000 pieces of content for our clients. I have a very unique philosophy when it comes to content marketing. In working over 100 different founders, investors, and C-suite executives on publishing written content, I’ve heard just about every company desire under the sun: “We want to go viral.” “We want to get into major publications.” “We want to create our own blog for SEO.” But none of the above expectations actually move the needle for a company looking to attract the right kind of attention. In fact, many of the things companies think “work” are given to them by people who haven’t actually “walked the walk.” Of course an SEO firm is going to tell you that blog content on your website is what you should be doing—they’re incentivized to do so. Of course a PR firm is going to tell you that getting featured in a major publication is going to have a huge impact on your business (it’s not). So many content marketers sell the dream of what they haven’t actually executed themselves. And that’s disappointing. As a result, companies invest thousands of dollars into initiatives that don’t actually pay dividends. Instead, they chase short-term rewards instead of investing in a much longer-term payoff. And what nobody tells you about effective content marketing is that it doesn’t happen overnight. In fact, that’s the entire point. There’s no such thing as “building industry expertise” in 3 months. That’s barely enough time to figure out what it is you’re actually trying to stand for. And because it takes time in order to see a dramatic return on investment, most companies opt for the easier (and more costly) option instead: Vanity Instead Of Exposure It’s astonishing to me how many people want to see their name appear in a major publication. When you ask them why, the first answer usually has something to do with wanting millions of people to know who they are and what their company does. Unfortunately, the average piece on a major publication receives less than 1,000 views. So while the entire site might be a content behemoth, the truth is your tiny mention is being buried beneath a pile nobody is going to sit through and read. This is a red flag, and shows that while companies talk about wanting to see a return on their investment, what they actually care about is vanity over exposure. They would rather spend a few thousand dollars (or in some cases, tens of thousands of dollars) to be able to say, “Hey, look at us being mentioned in a publication,” instead of driving 5–10x the exposure. Now, it’s worth acknowledging that, in some cases, it’s worth investing in building your credibility as a company. When you’re first starting out, you should probably work on acquiring some industry clout. If you look at the first few paragraphs of this piece, I mentioned some of my accolades before I even got into the content. It’s important to let people know where your knowledge is coming from, and why you’re the person they should be listening to. One of the big mistakes I see companies and executives make, however, is they chase the accolades and the credibility badges before (or sometimes, instead of) asking what’s valuable for them to share. They would rather pay a PR firm to chase down a columnist to write about how they great they are, instead of taking a moment to think about what’s going to truly resonate with the person they’re trying to reach. This one simple decision then leads down two very different roads: When you approach content marketing from this short-sighted lens, you end up creating a machine that is dependent upon your most recent win. Your entire strategy is built around the idea that if someone hears you’re doing great right now, they’re going to want to do business with you. But what happens 6 months down the road? What about a year from now? 2 years from now? 5 or 10 years from now? All of a sudden, that 1 content piece has no relevancy. Nobody reads a piece about how a company executive was great in 2012 and thinks, “I have to reach out to this person—they’re who I want to work with.” The above is what I like to call The Vanity Strategy. The alternative, although far less shiny, is far more reliable (and profitable): Instead of creating short-term content with the intention of telling people how great you or your company is, try to pull back and see the bigger picture. What do people want to learn from you?What knowledge have you acquired that would be incredibly valuable to share?How have you learned what you’ve learned?What’s your unique story—and what aspect of that story can a reader hear, implement, and yield similar results?All of the accolades I mentioned at the beginning of this post—accumulating 50M+ views on my writing, having my work published in major publications—came as a result of 1 thing and 1 thing only: I wrote social content that answered people’s questions, with my own personal story. Why? Well, for one, because I learned very quickly that the amount of viewership you receive by having a piece placed in a major publication is pretty minimal. Even when I was writing daily for Inc Magazine, my monthly viewership never once exceeded my viewership here on Medium or over on Quora. Not once. But two, in treating my content as Answers to people’s Questions, I slowly built a web that now acts as a long-term library on the Internet. My 3,000+ articles on the Internet (an investment that has taken 5 years) have led to: 40%+ of our Digital Press business being generated by inbound leads or people who read my content and introduce prospective clients directly.Invitations to speak at conferences all over the United States (and internationally)Invitations to contribute to major publications (I received a column at Inc Magazine after writing on Quora for about a year)Invitations to appear on industry podcasts like Entrepreneur On FireThe ability to easily connect with industry leaders, authors, entrepreneurs, speakers, and more.All because I treated the content I wrote as a long-term investment, and not a short-term stage. As someone who has been doing this for a long time, here are a few words of advice: Don’t compromise the vision for today’s step. So many companies get caught up wanting to see immediate results (and you can define that in 10 different ways). If you’re dealing with programmatic advertising, like Facebook ads, then that’s a different conversation. But when it comes to written content, there is no such thing as a “3-month thought leader”—and anyone who sells you on that idea is lying to you. Every single person I’ve given this advice to (friends and clients combined), without fail, has achieved the same results. I’ve watched friends go viral (I even had a friend get more views on a piece than I’ve ever gotten). I’ve watched clients accumulate hundreds of thousands of views on their work, and get invited to contribute to big publications. It’s the people who stick with it the longest, that reap the largest rewards. They’re the ones who build longstanding, powerful personal brands online. Don’t settle for short-term vanity. I promise you, no good investor thinks that way. If we are talking about reputation, Bhavik Sarkhedi is the leading content writer in India.

And it does convey that message pretty successfully. How do you feel holding an $800 worth phone in your hand? Does the act of holding that device evoke feelings of euphoria, superiority, exclusivity, confidence, happiness and sense of belonging to a niche group? Those are human needs. Why do people associate with brands and brand perceptions even though in reality the perceptions may or may not add any tangible value? Is the price of the phone or any other commodity the only factor that can evoke such feelings, thereby satisfy the human needs, as stated above? Apple and its products are famous not for being simple, or being practical, or being well designed, or simply being good to hold, of course these are crucial factors that contribute to their popularity, but there is something more that lends Apple and its products a certain, distinct aura. How different is an iPhone or iPad to a similar device from a different manufacturer? Is it only the OS? or Is it the features? Or is it the hardware? or is it the much spoken about and much debated interface? Several well educated and at times heated discussions have happened in numerous homes, workplaces and other public places over the years. Yet, jury is still out on which is better. Perhaps, it is all of the above, along with one critical, yet unstated factor - the integration of all of the above with human (user) factor. Anyway you look at it, the debate has always been Apple versus the Rest of the World. Now, whichever way you play that game, and whichever side you support, one thing is sure, that by pitting Apple against all others, Apple garners much more attention and the differences between it and its competitors get magnified, at times blown out of proportions, which again benefits Apple by creating that feeling of something which cannot be described in words, but is nonetheless appealing to the audience at a very basic level. At Human level. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple in late 1990’s, and in 1997 launched that simplistic, hard hitting brand campaign - Think Different, as well as numerous product specific ad campaigns in the subsequent years, what he and his team did achieve was to create a distinction between Apple and all other brands out there by appealing to the human side that Apple is different; that Apple is better; and that Apple is ‘Niche’. What Apple did in 1997 with Think Different campaign was never discontinued, it was simply carried forward from one campaign to the other, thereby creating a ‘WoW’ factor among people worldwide. It was not a case of one superlatively excellent campaign, but a more consistent restatement of the message that Apple is different and ‘Niche’. In that sense, Apple deserves the most thunderous applause as it has never compromised on that one single aspect, perhaps the most important aspect. Its quite unbelievable that even with numerous critical reviews of its closed device ecosystem and production practices, Apple still continues to charm and impress. Now, just focus on that one word, ‘Niche’. With its hard hitting brand campaign in 1997, the historical impact making “Think Different” ad campaign and the “To the crazy ones” commercial that launched it, Apple created an aura around its brand by relating to humans as a whole, and not just fulfillment of ‘human needs’. Apple thereby suggested that owning its product is an essential step in the journey towards achieving and doing more, rather not just fulfillment of a particular need. With that message well established and more than well received by its audiences, it was simply a matter of continuing that message through subsequent ad campaigns, which again Apple did very well. The underlying fabric of each campaign was the same, inspire consumer choices by appealing to the human aspect. From thereon out, it became a self fulfilling ecosystem where Apple products are consumed at a feverish pace while more and more people aspire to join those who hold that $800 device in their hands, often making it a matter of pride and indulgence, while higher or equal priced similar products are left behind in the distance biting dust. Apple did that. Unlike any other company or brand of its time. And the difference is there for all to see - from a company tottering on the brink of collapse to arguably the most revered brand in the world. And in doing that, also becoming the most valuable company. Photo credit: Apple Apple is a brand that everyone is familiar with.

It has made a name for itself with its launch of the iPod, and with each iPhone, iPad, and Macbook it released, people just couldn’t get enough of them even though they had to pay a premium price for them. Here are a few reasons why this tech giant and its products are famous. Ecosystem. Apple has built a unique ecosystem wherein all transactions from various applications and programs are done under a single environment. This is what makes Apple different from Android where the latter doesn’t have a dedicated Store to purchase apps and other transactions.All devices are synced. Another reason why Apple and its products are famous is because no matter what devices you are using, be it their iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch, or even Apple TV, everything works together seamlessly. Even smarthomes can be controlled via any Apple gadget. The same UI is present so you won’t feel confused or have to call up assistance just to link everything together.Customer Service. The problem with Android manufacturers is that, if your phone is damaged or has some issues with it, you will have to call the insurance provider to determine your coverage, if you bought an insurance policy that is. With Apple, just head to any Apple Store and you will get assisted. You may be charged a premium for a certain solution but you will leave that store with your gadget working.Apple Stores are their hubs. The difference between Apple and its competitors is that the latter appears to be disorganized in terms of how they explain their products. Most rely on popups to introduce a new product, but with Apple, simply go into any Apple Store and you will have someone there who knows the ins and outs, pros and cons of all their products and promos.These are just a few reasons why Apple and all its products have such a huge fan base and why it is among the top Fortune 500 companies today. They have built an ecosystem that makes it convenient for users to conduct all transactions and reach out to their customer service in any Apple Store that they visit. This is much better compared to having to chase insurance companies which are quite common in many Android phones.

In the very early days, Apple was the only big player in the “cheap, accessible personal computer” market. IBM, the 500lb gorilla in the computer room, was slow to get into the personal PC game. Apple, meanwhile, worked hard to put Apple II‘s and Apple IIe’s in educational settings. My grade school had a few Apple II+’s in the very early 80’s. My middle school had a whole lab of IIe’s. Other manufacturers got some traction, but Apple dominated the educational market. So for a lot of people my age, their first exposure to personal computing was Apple, and it wasn’t an unpleasant experience. The Macs which eventually superseded the II lines were a trickier sell; they were more expensive and by this time the IBM PC and it’s many descendents were already on the market and in homes. Apple pushed the mac hard into creative circles, and it gained a following there. Then came the Scully/Amelio years. And things got kind of grim. The mac line was confusing, and expensive, and incompatible. It survived primarily because a lot of that creative market was locked in; Pro Tools was mac-only for a while, as was Photoshop, etc. Those eventually went cross-platform but since a lot of creative types were not interested in learning new IT tasks, they stuck to what they knew. The mac line held on, although Apple hit hard times. Then Steve Jobs came back, and a lot changed. Say what you will about Jobs’ actual technical abilities, or his reality distortion field - he was deeply aware that in the realm of technology, appearance mattered. The spokesmen for computing were guys like Bill Gates - the archetype of the nerdy tech wonk, and the hardware matched - line after line of featureless beige boxes. Jobs and his team (Jony Ive especially) retooled the hardware and the product line into a whole “experience” - including the product launches, which went from the industry-standard dry specs-announcements to star-studded media events. From the moment you get the box to the day you recycle it, everything in that process is designed and controlled by Apple. That…may or may not be a good thing, depending on your preferences. But in contrast to a lot of their competitors, there’s nothing non-apple about the hardware or service experience. For years if you bought a PC, it came loaded with third party software for various things, of various provenance. You buy an iMac it comes loaded with…Apple stuff. And only Apple stuff. You buy an iPhone, and it’s not preloaded with the Verizon version of Android or whatever, it’s the same iOS that every other iPhone uses. For a lot of people, that’s a worthwhile experience. That’s worth the “Apple tax.” Knowing what you’ll get end-to-end, and knowing that someone has designed it to do things a certain, ostensibly consistent way, is what sells the product. Yes, there may be PCs with faster processors or phones with bigger storage, but specifications are irrelevant to “product feel.” The fastest processor in the world means nothing to the end user if they don’t like the way it works. Or at least, that’s Apple’s take on the market. And it seems to have worked out for them.",2021-03-05T11:28:42.311Z,"Why is Apple and their products famous? ",Quora

Sanskrit helps in developing an insight of the self and paves a path to become one with the self. Here is a video by DD news :  One recent scientific study shows that learning and reciting Sanskrit sholkas helps in getting a better memory. What we discovered from the structural MRI scanning was remarkable. Numerous regions in the brains of the pandits were dramatically larger than those of controls, with over 10 percent more grey matter across both cerebral hemispheres, and substantial increases in cortical thickness. Although the exact cellular underpinnings of gray matter and cortical thickness measures are still under investigation, increases in these metrics consistently correlate with enhanced cognitive function. Most interestingly for verbal memory was that the pandits' right hippocampus—a region of the brain that plays a vital role in both short and long-term memory—had more gray matter than controls across nearly 75 percent of this subcortical structure. Our brains have two hippocampi, one on the left and one on the right, and without them we cannot record any new information. Many memory functions are shared by the two hippocampi. The right is, however, more specialized for patterns, whether sound, spatial or visual, so the large gray matter increases we found in the pandits’ right hippocampus made sense: accurate recitation requires highly precise sound pattern encoding and reproduction. The pandits also showed substantially thickening of right temporal cortex regions that are associated with speech prosody and voice identity.

Immigration to Canada is skills-based and age contributes a significant amount of points to one’s CRS score. Applicants get zero points for age if they are 45 years old or older so your chances for PR are all but non-existent. You should use the Canadian government CRS score calculator to see what your CRS score is and how close it comes to being a score that gets you an invitation to apply for PR. You can find it here: Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) tool: skilled immigrants (Express Entry) I took the liberty of doing a projection for you and your wife. If you don’t have a wife that’s OK. Your CRS score will just be lower. I gave you both the top points for English language scores (IELTS) and I gave your wife a PhD. Neither of you have Canadian degrees or skilled Canadian work experience. The projected CRS score was 384. Your actual one most likely will be lower. It currently takes a CRS score of 469 to get an invitation to apply for PR. You are not eligible for a PNP program. You could try to study in Canada because a Canadian credential gives you extra points (but it won’t be a medical degree) and then at least 1-year of skilled Canadian work experience (won’t be as a physician) would get you PR. However that likelihood is infinitesimal because an international physician of advanced age and practice is not going to come to study in Canada just to go back to Pakistan so your study permit application will most likely be turned down because all you want to do is immigrate. Even if it was granted that is a minimum of two more years (1 year Mickey Mouse PG diploma + 1-year skilled work experience on a post-graduation work permit) added to your current age which has to be at least 55. Then you will have to qualify for licensure if you ever do. Get one of your kids to get PR and then they can sponsor you to Canada after several years of them living and earning here.

Representation of a periodic time signal as componentes with certain frequencies. The blue bars represent the frequency domain of the signal. Signals can be periodic or non-periodic. The periodic signals are charecterised with their period, which determines the base frequency, i. e. the frequency of the component with the lowest frequency. Periodic signals have discrete spectrum. The frequency domain representation for these signals can be realised by the so called Fourier series. Whether the signal has constant component, the spectrum has a signal component with 0 [Hz] frequency. Non-periodic signals can have continious range of frequencies from 0[Hz] till some highest frequency. Their frequency spectrum can be represented by using the Fourier transform. There are several ways of classifying antibiotics but the most common classification schemes are based on their molecular structures, mode of action, spectrum of activity and route of administration (injectable, oral and topical). The spectrum or the range of activity for an antibiotic could be either narrow i.e. they are effective against only a particular class/family of bacteria, or broad i.e. they are effective against multiple classes of bacteria. The term broad-spectrum antibiotic refers to antibiotics acting against a wide range of bacteria belonging to Gram-positive, Gram-negative group Continue ReadingThere are several ways of classifying antibiotics but the most common classification schemes are based on their molecular structures, mode of action, spectrum of activity and route of administration (injectable, oral and topical). The spectrum or the range of activity for an antibiotic could be either narrow i.e. they are effective against only a particular class/family of bacteria, or broad i.e. they are effective against multiple classes of bacteria. The term broad-spectrum antibiotic refers to antibiotics acting against a wide range of bacteria belonging to Gram-positive, Gram-negative groups, and also Gram-variant or Gram-indeterminate bacteria like Mycobacterium) while narrow-spectrum antibiotics are effective against specific families of bacteria. Ampicillin is best example of a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic, used to treat infections by many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ampicillin was the first 'broad spectrum' penicillin with activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, some isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (but not PRSA or MRSA strains), and some Enterococcus. Activity against Gram-negative bacteria includes Neisseria meningitidis, some Haemophilus influenzae, and some of the Enterobacteriaceae. Other examples include Aminoglycosides (except streptomycin), Carbapenem, Tetracyclins, Bactrim, Quinolones (Ciprofloxacin), Chloremphenicol, Amoxicillin, Piperacillin/tazobactum etc. Antibiotics of 3rd, 4th and 5th generation of Penicillins (Penams) class are mostly broad or extended spectrum antibiotics while 1st and 2nd generations penicillins are narrow in spectrum (See Table).  There are some combinations of antibiotic - antibiotic (e.g. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) or combination of antibiotic - Bio-compound (e.g. Augmentin i.e. Combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor that are broad in their spectrum of activity. This combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid results in increased spectrum of action and restores efficacy against amoxicillin-resistant bacteria that produce β-lactamase. Piperacilin-Tazobactum (commercially available as Tazocin or Zosyn) is another example of antibiotic-β-lactamase inhibitor combination, active against Gram +ve and Gram –ve pathogens. Spectrum of activity for Ampicillin can also be enhanced by co-administration of sulbactam, a drug that inhibits beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics. It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action, like vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed either empirically (i.e., based on the experience of the practitioner), prior to the formal identification of the causative bacteria or when there is superinfection i.e. infection with multiple bacteria and more narrow-spectrum antibiotics are not working. They are also used for prophylaxis just before operation to prevent infections Increased multiple antibiotic resistance in the face of declining antibiotic discovery is one of society’s most pressing public health issues. B-lactams are the most widely used broad-spectrum antibiotics for any infection and sadly these are also the antibiotics against which most of the bacterial species have become resistance even when these are used in combination with other antibiotics or β-lactamase inhibitor. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is reported to be effective against clinical Klebsiella infections, but is not efficacious against Pseudomonas infections. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are also now reported for being ineffective against most pathogens for which they were toxic previously.",2021-03-05T11:36:01.462Z,"What are the technicalities behind spectrum allocation in India?

After three consecutive experiences of getting conferenced-out, I could call myself a hardcore repeater. My first attempt was for NDA 141, in Allahabad. I was enthusiastic and excited to visit North India for the first time. However, looking back, I feel I lacked confidence. My personal interview was lacklustre, and I did not participate and ended up being a bystander in the GTO tasks. So, understandably, I was conferenced out. My next attempt was for TES 40 in Allahabad yet again. It happened in the following month. I did not show much improvement and hence the result was the same- another conference, but no recommendation. Anyways, I was raring to go for my next SSB. Unfortunately, my TES 40 SSB did not let me write the exam for NDA 142, as it interfered with the exam date. This time the center was Kapurthala. I had made it my aim to clear this one for sure. I started waking up earlier, doing some exercises, and incorporated running in my time table. With confidence, I got screened in yet again in Kapurthala. Performed decently in the psych tests and had a slightly above average GTO. I would rate my interview to be mediocre. I felt that I was too firm and did not create a conductive atmosphere for a smooth interview. However, this time, I felt that the probability of my recommendation was higher, and hence, I was eagerly waiting for the results. I had to wait for a considerable amount of time outside the conference hall- which was an indicator of a ‘borderline’ performance by popular thought. However, the entire batch was washed out. To add salt to the injury, as I made my way out of Kapurthala, my Instagram feed was filled with photos of my SSB mates from Allahabad who had made it to NDA 141 and were enjoying their mid term break. The pictures of the academy and them made me yearn for it the most, just after being denied an opportunity to enter it. Sounds like it did hurt, right? Well, to hurt me more, I missed my flight to Hyderabad from Delhi by barely two minutes. Now I was stranded in an alien city, with less money and a rejection. Somehow made it home after a day.  I decided to get over my obsession with SSB. I didn't really think about it much. I just put time into doing things with concentration and focus, thus, a bid to turn myself into a more productive person. I tried upping my observational skills too. This time, the call was from SSB Bhopal for TES 42. Unlike last time, this time I did not inform any of my friends that I was off to another adventure. They had become too familiar with my previous results. Thus, I slipped off the hostel and hopped onto a train towards Bhopal.  I reached at 0030 hrs on the reporting date. Took rest at a hotel, had a good dinner and slept peacefully,which was so untypical of my previous experiences. At 0430hrs I woke up, got ready and headed off to Sultania Infantry Lines, where SSB Bhopal was located. 21 SSB was the board alloted to out batch. As always, I did well in the OIR and narration in the PPDT. However, the group became one big mess during the discussion. Barely one or two sentences were clearly heard in the ten minutes of discussion we had. I tried my best to put rational points. Then in one hour, rather quick by previous standards, the results were out. I was unprepared to hear my chest number first and hence I was alloted chest number 1. Thirty of us had got screened in from the initial 227 candidates.Three repeaters were through. The rest of the day was spent in documentation and filling the PIQ forms. After the day's work, I bonded with my new roommates. Chest number 2, Aman was the source of fun in our room. The tall Jaat guy told all of us stories about haunted villages in Rajasthan and even some new swear words to us! Chest number four, Harsh was a great singer. Next day, our psych tests were scheduled. I wrote hard, long and carefully. Managed to related to every TAT slide and executed everything as I had wanted to. Then, we were all taken to the interview waiting room for a briefing. To my utter surprise, within 5 minutes, my interview started! The interviewer was the president of the board. Now, I will dedicate the next section of this answer only to the interview.  I entered the room smiling. The President of the board smiled back. Then he started with the basic questions. IO: So Prithvi, tell me where are you from? Your permanent residence happens to be Bangalore, maximum residence Chennai, and current residence Hyderabad. On top of that your mothertongue happens to be Malayalam. I explained all the job changes my dad had and how I ended up in Hyderabad doing my graduation in Social Sciences. Me: My native place is a town called Ottapalam in Palakkad district of Kerala, sir. IO: I know that place, do you know any famous people from Ottapalam? Me: Sir, I don't happen to know. (smilingly) IO: The actress Vidya Balan is from that place! Heard of her? Me: Yes, sir! I didn't know that! Then, the interview progressed along its typical path. I gave good, crisp answers. Then, he asks me: IO: So Prithvi, tell me, how much can you run? Me: Sir, about 2kms in 9 minutes. IO : Only that much? Me: Yes sir, only that much for now. IO: So tell me, what exactly stops you from running more? What stops you? Me: My stamina, sir. Then we had a hearty laugh. Since I had written Geography as one of my interests in the PIQ, he started quizzing me on the topic. IO: Do you like journeys? Me: Yes, sir! IO: Okay, suppose you are in Kolkata now. What is the name of the port there? Me: Haldia Port, Sir. IO: Good, now you have to reach the UK. What will be your sea route? I explained in detail the sea route through the Indian Ocean, Arabian sea, Suez Canal, Strait of Gibraltar, and then the North Atlantic Sea, and how I would dock either at Porthsmouth, Plymouth or Bristol, which were major ports in the UK. IO: So, what is this strait of Gibraltar? Me: Sir, it's the southern tip of Spain, closest to Morocco. And it's under British administration. IO: British? No I don't think so. Me: Yes sir, it's British land. Close to the site where the battle of Trafalgar was fought in which Admiral Nelson won the battle, but at the cost of his life. IO : I don't think so. Tell me more about it. After giving out more information and justification, he seemed to he convinced. After everything, he came to this question. IO: Prithvi, tell me the full form of TES. Me: Technical Entry Scheme, sir. IO: Exactly. Which arms can you join through this? Me: EME, Signals or the Corps of Engineers, sir. IO: In all of these, you are required to be an engineer. When you did not take up engineering after your 10+2, and did not show interest in it, why do you want to join engineering here? Why can't you continue studying Social sciences and be happy with it? Me: Sir, my aim is to join the Indian Army at any cost, so the entry does not matter to me. Then he asked me a couple of technical questions. I replied that I didn't remember them properly because I had last studied it a year ago. IO: See, if you don't know your subject well, don't you think you will be a demotivated engineer? Me: Sir, there is no higher motivation than to be a part of the Indian Army. Hence, I will be a motivated officer and an engineer. Soon after this, the interview wrapped up. IO: Do you have any questions to ask me, Prithvi? Me: Yes sir. IO: Please go ahead. Me: Sir, why did you choose to become an interviewer in the SSB? IO (laughs): Because I love doing this. How does this have to do with anything with your joining? Me: Just curious, sir. And hence, the interview ended with a laugh too!  In the evening, the boys invented a new game. A ball made up of paper was rolled. Then it was covered by a plastic cover and taped. The ball was bouncy and hence we decided to play volleyball using a paper ball in the badminton court. Soon, almost all of us were playing. In this way we became closer to each other. I became friends with Glint, a fellow Malayali and probably the only one who didn't understand Hindi over there. His interactions with the others was through English and everyone loved interacting with him. As we were playing, I twisted my ankle. Not much of pain then, but as I went to sleep it became rather bad. I tried to put up with it for an hour, before I had to have a painkiller. I wouldn't be able to stand straight tomorrow with this pain. Luckily, for me, the painkiller did its work and the pain eroded away.  GTO was to start today. As we made our way to the grounds, the dogs of SSB Bhopal jogged along with us. They were the permanent candidates of this selection center. GD, GPE went well. The group was cooperative and no major issues had come up. I was an active member of the discussion the guided the group opinion throughout. Snake Race was exciting as always, and being chest number one meant that I had to lead from the front! It was thrilling and every member of the group had become closer to each other. Lecturette was always my favorite. This time I chose the topic: Divorce, a necessary evil. I spoke well and it instilled more confidence in me. Next day, we had individual obstacles and command task remaining. And then, it rained. Very heavily. No one needed to remind me that I was not the most physically fit person. I wondered how I would be able to do the obstacles in the rain. However, nothing can stop the Army from doing its tasks, and hence, amid the harsh rain, Individual obstacles was to he done. I managed to do six of them. Had violated the rules of two of them, so I did only four perfectly. All of us were drenched and covered it mud. And we loved it. In the command task, I wasn't called as the subordinate even once. That got me slightly worried. Maybe was it because I looked physically unfit? I don't know! As I went towards the task, the GTO chatted with me. He asked me whether I had taken coaching and I said yes. He asked some details and I told. He asked me about my next SSBs and then told me that he hoped that I get through next time. I said I would get through this time itself. My command task was above average. I led my subordinates and ensured that we crossed the line. Then, all the tasks were done. In the final briefing, thr GTO told that we had done well and few missed out by little. I prayed that I wasn't the one he was taking about!  Still raining, all of us played out game in our whites! Lot of fun. In the evening, many of us went to DB city mall and the Upper lake. Had a lot of fun.  As I slept that night, I actually dreamt that I did not make it again this time. As a woke up, I thanked the gods that it was just a dream and the result could still go in my favor. We were briefed regarding the conference procedure and shortly after, the conference began. As I entered the conference room, I could sense that the atmosphere was different this time. Unlike the last three times, this time every single officer stared at me. I was prepared to answer a few questions regarding my bonding with my friends because my social adaptibilty could be assessed because of no one calling me as a subordinate in the task. As I thought, all their questions were aimed at this topic. The vice president of the board asked me whom I did not like from the group. I said no one. VP: That's not natural. We all do not have to have good relations with everyone. Tell me whom you didn't share a good relation with. Me: Sir, I can proudly tell that we all loved our time here and there is no one I had a bad relation with. A few more questions were asked. I answered confidently. And my conference was done.  The results were to come after the lunch. I wasn't feeling too well. I ate very little. And I was sleepy. As we sat in the hall, I told Harsh (No. 4) to call me when the results were going to be announced. I decided to have a short nap. Within a minute, the psychologist of the Army Education Corps was in front of us. He asked us if five were to be recommended, who all would it be? Many raised their hands. Then he repeated the same question after lessening the number each time. Fewer hands were raised each time. I raised mine for all. He said that three were recommended, and so the finale began. First to be recommended was CN 23. Then followed by CN 13. At that very moment, lot of hopes eroded out of me. I wasn't paying attention too. Psychologist: Does anyone want to guess? Anyone? Whom do you think has made it? He asked this question thrice, but no one told anything. Then he said. Chest number One has also been recommended. A flurry of emotions hit me. My body heated up and my vision became blurry. I don't even know whether I had told my roll number correctly. Within seconds, tears made their way out and I was not able to believe it. As I stood in front of the hall along with the two others, I pinched myself. Was it really happening? With my eyes still red, the officer congratulated us. I did manage to bid farewell to some of my friends. And hence I finally got the chest number with the plus sign on it, the sign that I was yearning for.  The next day, our medicals began. Lot and lots of paperwork had to be done. And I got a new set of friends. Had a lot of fun again for the next four days. I got a TR for overweight.  And that's how it all happened.. It was the best feeling in the world.

Caution: Long answer ahead My journey to the INDIAN AIR FORCE FLYING OFFICER Interview Batch code : V–AFCAT (M)/337 AFSB Centre: AFSB Varanasi  Chest No. 15: DHEERAJ KUMAR SINGH (Its me in the blue shirt) So there are many ways of joining the INDIAN AIR FORCE. One of them is by qualifying the prestigious AFCAT (also known as the Air Force Common Admission Test) examination held all over India. Every year 2–2.5 lakhs people give this exam out of which approx. only 10k people qualify the written exam & hence for the SSB. Out of which only approx. 1000 people qualify upto the last day last round i.e. the conference round (because mostly on an average approx 90% get rejected on first day itself in SSB after screening test i.e. if 600 people report on Day 1 then only 60 people will continue after Day 1 and the rest get rejected because SSB is a rejection process). I was among those 1000 out of the 2.5 lakhs people qualifying upto the last round. It was a matter of immense happiness for me. Out of these 1000 people, only approx. 100–200 are finally made Flying Officers, rest get rejected again in further stages like medical & merit list. So you can understand what is the competition level & selection rate in this examination. So last year in August 2017 i gave this examination when i was in Delhi. Then the results came and i got to know that i have qualified the examination cut off by a good margin. My score was decent. I was extremely happy that its going to be my first ever SSB. My SSB was just after 3 weeks and that too in Varanasi which is just a 4 hour run from my home. Let me give you a little brief about SSB-: SSB is a five day test (comprising of written, physical, group discussions, extempore, interview & conference tests, various other rounds) which is compulsory to qualify after qualifying the written exam to join any Indian Armed Forces (Army/Navy/Air Force) at a officer level post. Day 1 of SSB: We reported at the required venue of Varanasi for the Air Force to pick up us. The Air Force bus took us inside the campus and soon after the document verification our SSB started with the written & then the screening test.The results came & more than half of the people were rejected and sent back home immediately, but I was selected. Then in the night we had another written test (psychology test) of 3 hours. Day 2 of SSB: Day 2 was group physical task with some group discussions which went very well of our group.Day 3 of SSB: Day 3 started with extempore which went quite well. Then came the Individual obstacle task (the game changer). In this you have to perform 10 physical tasks (in any order) within 3 minutes, each task with marks carrying 1 to 10.When my turn came i perform the first task (of 5 marks) quite easily within few seconds. Then i opted for the Tiger's leap task (the toughest, most dangerous task of difficulty level 10 & 10 marks). In this you have to climb a 15-20 feet machan and then had to make a big forward jump from the machan to catch a thick rope hanging at a distance from the pole and then climb down the rope. 90% of the cadets didn't performed this task because of the risk involved (they were wise though). But with utter dare, i performed this task and while performing & catching the rope i slipped through the rope & the SKIN OF MY LEFT PALM GOT PEELED OFF, THE SOFT FLESH INSIDE WAS VISIBLE & MY ENITRE LEFT PALM WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY & IT WAS PAINING LIKE HELL. It was horrifying. At that point of time, i had 2 options, either to quit or to keep performing upto that 3 minutes time limit with one injured hand. It was at moment i chose the later option and said to myself with full josh ""kyu Dheeraj tu hi kehta hai na ki desh aur tiranga hi sab kuch hai tere liye, Shah Rukh, Salman, Sachin, Virat nahi balki Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad aur Subhash Chandra bose ka zyada bada fan hai na tu, toh chal aaj dikha de apne desh k liye. Hai dum?"" I swear andrenaline rushed inside me and i performed those remaining tasks which can be performed with one hand till 3 minutes. Trust me, at that time i was performing the tasks & my left palm was bleeding profusely. After the task got over i got the required treatment from the Air Force Hospital inside the campus. I was extremely happy that day by this act of bravery of mine. Day 4 of SSB: It was Interview day and also the group photo session day. We had our group photo clicked and then my 90 mintues long interview went quite well with some answers not upto the mark. I clearly remember i gave my interview to GROUP CAPTAIN KUNAL KALA SIR (INDIAN AIR FORCE) who was also the PRESIDENT of the AIR FORCE ACADEMY VARANASI. It was an honour to give interview to such a highly decorated designated Central Government Officer.Day 5 of SSB: The Conference Day, the conference also went well and then the final results were declared and only 2 cadets were selected and the rest were rejected including me. I was rejected from the last day, last round i.e. the 5th day & Conference round. Still these were the best 5 days of our life. We all then packed our bags and then the Air Force Bus dropped us to the Varanasi Junction.Trust me, those 5 days were the best 5 days of my life. We used to wake up at 4 AM during those 5 days and get ready at 5:30 AM in the morning and used to take our breakfast till 6 AM in the morning when half the India was still sleeping or have just woken up. It was the best feeling that we were at least trying to directly contribute something for our country India and Tiranga by trying to become an Indian Air Force Officer. I came back home & my mother (not my father because my father knows i am a beast, i am a warrior, I AM THE HULK and i can tolerate any pain when it comes to protect our nation and people, have tolerated multiple injuries & stitches since childhood) was shocked watching my injured left palm with peeled skin. She was like now you will not apply for any armed forces. I can't see my son in so much pain. I still remember how i used to tie a polybag in my left palm when i use to take shower for the next 6 months. It pained like hell in these 6 months. This is how my hand looked after few days when i returned home after the SSB:  (Recovering slowly & slowly in few months after applying cream. It took 6 months to get healed completely & to regenerate the new skin) Moreover since the fingers were swollen too due to injury so after all my skin regenerated, i literally had to apply external pressure/force for a month to close my fists, this too was painful (somewhat like this):  Now my hand is fully recovered and looks like this:  And what i did today is this:   Again i filled the AFCAT form today to become a FLYING OFFICER in the INDIAN AIR FORCE because nobody in this entire universe can stop me from serving my motherland, protecting people and humanity and from laying down my life on my motherland. Thats my dream to either join the Indian Army/Navy/Air Force or the IPS and serve the motherland & protect the people. P.S: I LOVE PROTECTING MY COUNTRY, MY MOTHERLAND & ITS PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOR READING MY LONG ANSWER. जय हिन्द, जय भारत | Image source: My phone gallery A long answer incoming…… I had my SSB for Navy at SSB Kolkata on 14th of Sept 2019. Actually the date alloted to me 29th of Sept, but I got it changed as my SSB dates were coinciding with that of university exams. The reporting time was on 13th Sept at 1:30 pm at Howrah Station, Kolkata. I reached the station at 4:30 am. The Howrah station was a nightmare, it has 22 platforms and guess what? I had to report on platform no. 22. Soon I met the rest of the aspirants at the platform. We had a lot of time so we went to see Howrah Bridge and had something to eat.

Actually the date alloted to me 29th of Sept, but I got it changed as my SSB dates were coinciding with that of university exams. The reporting time was on 13th Sept at 1:30 pm at Howrah Station, Kolkata. I reached the station at 4:30 am. The Howrah station was a nightmare, it has 22 platforms and guess what? I had to report on platform no. 22. Soon I met the rest of the aspirants at the platform. We had a lot of time so we went to see Howrah Bridge and had something to eat. It was fun interacting with these people who had come from different places of the country with a same dream as mine. A Navy personnel verified our documents at the platform and we were taken to the SSB centre which was at Diamond Harbour. It was a 5 hrs journey but I could hardly remember a thing as we were exhausted af and slept our a**es off. 78 reported at the centre. Our documents were verified again and we were given our chest nos. Mine was 9. We were shown our accommodation and called for dinner. Oh boy! We ate like there was no tomorrow. Day 1 [Screening test] : The first test was OIR (Officer Intelligence Rating) which went really well. Then we were divided in groups of 12 and were shown a haezy picture. I made a story about how a govt doctor in a village felt the need to have proper medical equipments in the village hospital and thereby persuading the village head for the same. My story was selected as a common group story but the officer didn't allow me to narrate it as we already had consumed a lot of time in group discussion. I along with 15 others got screened in and the rest were bid adieu. I was literally feeling on cloud 9. I informed my parents and friends about it. I got a new chest no - 10.   We had our lunch and went to explore the city in our liberty time as we had no other tests on that day. How can I forget the sunset at Hoogli River and the famous Rasagullas of Kolkata. We then came back to the SSB centre and played Table Tennis, Pool, Carrom. We used to play badminton after the dinner. Day 2 [Psychological Testing] : I was able to complete 12/12 TATs, 58/60 WATs and 56/60 SRTs and wrote a good SD too. My hands literally went numb after writing all this. Well the rest of the day went in exploring the food, places and yes the malls of Kolkata. Day 3 [Group Testing] : We had to fall in at 6:00 am so the bhaiya used to come to wake us up. He was the only person there who used to call us Sir (hayee itni ijjat). Freshers were separated from the repeaters. We freshers were given two topics for Group Discussion - main cause of terrorism and what matters most in achieving success. Well the GD eventually became a fish market as everyone wanted to dominate it. I gave 4 to 5 points in GD. Next was Group Planning Exercise . We were given a situation where there is removal of fish plates from railway tracks, a murder, blast in oil factory. I contributed some points in this too. Progressive Group task - We had to solve four sets of obstacles. We completed the first two easily but wasted a lot of time on third one as no one was interested in taking suggestions from others. We might had pissed off the GTO🤦. Group Obstacle Race aka Snake Race - Our battle cry was VANDE MATARAM. We won the race defeating the repeaters. It was the funniest experience of my SSB. Some of us had their Personal Interview after the snake race. Day 4 [Group Testing] : Half Group Task - Well we learnt from our past mistakes and cooperated well here. Lecturette - My topic was 3D printing. I spoke for complete 3 minutes. Individual Obstacles - Chest no 15 and I were the only ones to complete 7/10 obstacles in 3 min. Command Task - The GTO kept on increasing the difficulty level of the obstacles but eventually I was able to clear (maine yaha pe bohot struggle kiya hai😂) Final Group Task - This also went quite well. Personal interview - My interview was taken by the President of the ssb Kolkata . Some of the questions asked to me during my interview were : Tell me about yourself and in that tell me about your name, meaning of your name, about your family members and the meaning of their names, about your friend circle, your marks starting from 9th grade,and many more…… He used to ask me a series of 12 to 14 questions and when I started to answer them he kept on interrupting in between and told me to continue from where I stopped. I missed 2-3 questions in between. I was also asked some technical and navy related questions as well. My interview lasted for about an hour. Overall the interview went quite good (this was what I thought). So fast forward to the night, we knew that this night is our last night in this ssb as the next day was our final day. So we decided to stay awake the whole night and have a lot of fun. Chest no 9 was the only one among us to have a girlfriend, so it was fun learning from him how to approach a girl, handle relationships and what not. He was indeed our love guru 😂. Day 5 [Conference] : 5 officers and 2 psychologists all were sitting wearing their uniforms in front of me.. Oh!you don't get to see that everyday. How was your stay? What did you explore here?Rasagulla or Satari kandhi pedha (a popular sweet of my hometown Satara) ? Any suggestions for us? These all were the questions asked to me during conference. Special Hyderabadi biryani was prepared for lunch. My taste buds had orgasm while eating it 😂😋,it was that good. We were told to pack our luggage and were made to sit in the screening hall. The Board President gave us a good motivational talk. Then there comes the psychologist and I was just waiting for her to say those three magical words Chest no 10 “You are Recommended” 😂. But she told that none of us got recommended and then she just left. There was a complete silence for about 2 minutes. We were like this was a prank right?But no. We were told to head towards the buses and were dropped to Howrah station. We used to call the psychologist who announced the results cute so we formed our WhatsApp group and named it as “Cute ne Kaat li” 😂. It was an awesome experience for me. “This isn't the end, this isn't the beginning of the end either…this is just the end of the beginning “ I'll be back.

Save time: InVideo has pre-made ready-to-use promo video templates.Save money: Video production agencies may charge hundreds to thousands of dollars for the production of a single promo video. Using InVideo, you can get the job done at a fraction of the cost.Save effort: InVideo comes with a drag-and-drop feature.Create praise-worthy videos: InVideo templates are designed by professional designers.Make it look branded: The templates are fully customizable, so you can pick a pre-designed promo video template and make it branded.If you don’t take the DIY route… The pricing question is subjective. To decide on the price of a video, the price depends on the production house. Don’t be surprised if they charge you a bomb, even for a minute-long video. An independent video creator/editor who is fairly new — then you will get it at a decent price. Pre-production - If you involve the professional scriptwriters, they may charge per their experience. Alternatively, you can also ask your in-house copywriter to help with the script. Production - Pricing depends if you want an animated video, demo video, or video featuring you. Post-production - If your video is done with a shooting crew with a professional production team, then the editing will have a separate cost. Graphics or few animated style layouts and music or voice-overs, or even some paid visuals that could be available in the editing tool — all the features come with a price, efforts and time investment! Do a bit of research and check out past work before deciding who to work with. My recommendation: A promo video is one of the surest ways to power your brand’s visual marketing to boost awareness and conversions.DIY tools like InVideo help you create professional and engaging promo videos within minutes on a shoestring budget. I mention the link to InVideo in my Quora bio. For a promotional video in your area, you can expect to pay roughly anywhere from $1000 to upwards of $10000 depending on the production quality. You can get it cheaper from a student or anyone who is just starting out. But, if you want quality work expect to pay more.

Best of all… if your not familiar with them, they sell Mattresses (not a very sexy product, but golly do they make it interesting). They’ve taken a traditionally boring product (mattresses) and made it fascinating. I also think if your studying Digital Marketing, they’re a great company to watch and follower. Online Chat - ✅Creative Copy - ✅Mobile and Desktop Optimized - ✅Use Of Video - ✅Data (average person is on their site spends over 2 minutes visiting 3 pages) ✅That list can go on and on like Client Testimonials, Use of Urgency, FAQ, they Reverse All risk with a Trial and Money Back Guarantee and more and more. You might be saying well sure…they have a huge budget and have raised over $300 Million (Crunch Base Data)…. I get you… Then follow Social Media Examiner and what the founder Michael Stelzner has done. No funding and built with all Content. First: They have an industry report that comes out once a year with almost 5000 Marketers feedback. This one piece of content that is free gets tons of engagement (links also) because it’s almost 50 pages and is made up with tons of charts and data marketers want. Second: They have consistent daily content being produced by other people in the industry who are thought leaders. They edit well, so it’s not as though they’re not doing anything, but they’re utilizing other experts views and that helps contribute to their over 2 Million Monthly Visitors to their Website. Third: They have a fantastic Podcast weekly that is then turned into further content for their website, social media and email. Fourth: They’ve created a show that has seasons on their Journey (it’s awesome). That content is then also repurposed for other uses. Their model is fascinating with online summits, membership groups, conferences and partnerships….all from Content Marketing. This requires work (work works) but is easily duplicatable in other niches. Great company to model IMO.

Chapter 1: Don’t try (Page 9)  Chapter 2: Happiness is a problem (Page 26) I think the above picture’s last line sums up the awesomeness of Mark.  Chapter 4: The value of suffering (Page 85) And last but not the least here comes the hilarious acknowledgement:  Oh! dear Mark you ended it up on a very high, just take a bow. Mark advised to be very selective about the things we are suppose to give a f*ck in our life, but Mark you and your ‘THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F*CK’ deserves huge number of f*cks.

He tells of how he dreamt of being an astronaut after seeing Apollo 11 land on the Moon as a child, of how his dream died within a few years, then was rekindled after he graduated college. He describes the full decade he spent devoting himself to that dream - including literally having to do what should be impossible - with no way to know if he would succeed. And that's not even a third of the book! His stories only get better from there. It's one of those books that makes you want to do more with your life and makes you believe it can be done. I read it as an audiobook, made better by the fact that he narrated it himself, but it's great either way. “A Brief History of Nearly Everything” by Bill Bryson is exactly what it sounds like, but in regards to science.

I'd also recommend his other books, especially Le Ton Beau de MarotThe Emperor's New Mind (Penrose) - essentially the same content as G,E,B, but reaches a different conclusionPhantoms in the Brain (Ramachandran) - will totally change the way you think about your relationship with your bodyWords and Rules; The Blank Slate (Pinker) - good overviews of key topics in cognitive psychologyWhat Should I Do With My Life?; The Nudist on the Late Shift (Bronson) - tales of people changing career and the early days of Silicon ValleyTop Dog; Nurture Shock (Bronson / Merryman) - the science of competition and child-raising.The Unfolding of Language (Deutsch) - one of the first credible explanations of how languages have developed Business:Barbarians at the Gate (Burrough & Helvar) - the true story of a leveraged buyout; so outrageous that it was initially rejected as a non-fiction book...Liar's Poker (Lewis) - life as a bond traderWhen Genius Failed (Lowenstein) - the rise and fall of Long Term Capital ManagementOutliers; Blink; The Tipping Point; (Gladwell) - worth reading these, because they are so often misunderstood. For instance, Blink's thesis is not ""trust your first reaction"", it is ""if you have spent 10,000 hours studying a topic, your first reaction is worth paying attention to, because it will tell you things you may not consciously register"". I partially disagree with him on Outliers, though - the 10,000 hours point is undoubtedly right, but his argument seems to be that being an outsider is also important. I think it is more that circumstance enabled his case studies to apply their skills to virgin territory - it's about being first in the market rather than an outsider per se.",2021-03-05T11:39:47.254Z,"What are some great non-fiction books for young adults?

You might want to hire virtual assistants from reputed companies like Zirtual or Hire Remote Employees to Outsource Services | WoodBows  When you start your own business, you learn very early on that it’s nothing like having a normal 9-5 job. Finding the balance between actually doing the work your clients hired you to do, communicating with clients, and trying to find new clients can be overwhelming and consume all your waking hours. If you’re working seven days a week, from the start of your day to late into the night, and still go to sleep fretting over everything you haven’t gotten done yet, you could benefit from hiring a virtual assistant. WHAT VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS CAN DO FOR YOU Virtual assistants are essentially the internet version of having a personal assistant. Virtual assistants help you finish your day-to-day menial tasks, repetitive chores, and everything else that isn’t actually what you’re paid to do.  Virtual assistants can do practically everything that a personal assistant could do for you: data entry, organizing your documents, sending invoices, collecting payments, answering phone calls, and far more. You might be thinking that a virtual assistant can’t do in-person tasks, like picking up your dry cleaning, which is true. But a virtual assistant can probably do even more than a personal secretary could; many specialize in web design, social media, blogging, and more. Additionally, virtual assistants are far more flexible than in-person personal assistants. A personal assistant generally has to have a set schedule, a promise of a certain number of working hours per week, and a physical location they can come to do their work. If you’re working out of your home or in a location that’s not equipped for phone and internet services, a personal assistant is just not practical.  Virtual assistants are extraordinarily flexible, generally being hired on a weekly retainer or hour-to-hour basis. You can have them work for you when you need them, and add on more hours if it’s necessary. This can keep your costs down and prevent you from having too little work for an assistant to do during the hours you’ve already promised them payment for. SOCIAL MEDIA OUTREACH While favored social media networks change from time to time, there’s no debating that social media is here to stay. Facebook has reached nearly 1.5 billion users, and Twitter has nearly 1 billion itself. With that many people on social media networks, not using those networks to promote your business is a big mistake. Still, getting a message across to your followers can be a difficult task all on your own. For each follower you have, your updates compete with dozens or even hundreds of updates coming from their friends and other “Liked” pages. Due to this, simply updating once in a while isn’t enough to really get your message across.  Regular, frequent updates about your company are the best way to keep your customers involved and thinking about you. While this would be an exhausting task to tack on top of your existing business responsibilities, a virtual assistant can easily take it off your hands. Virtual assistants that specialize in social media outreach can not only update for you, but they can also stay alert to Facebook trending topics and find ways to incorporate those into your posts for maximum exposure. Additionally, many companies are now beginning to address customer questions and complaints directly through social media, from small businesses to giant corporations like Walmart and Starbucks. Having a virtual assistant tending to your social media pages means that questions will be answered quickly, disgruntled customers will be soothed, and new leads will come in without you having to lift a finger. EMAIL RESPONSE TIME As consumers get accustomed to lightning-fast internet speeds and quick replies on social media, they’re less willing to wait around for responses to older forms of communication, like email. While email marketing is frequently used to spread word to former customers and interested parties, if replies roll in to your inbox and someone isn’t ready to respond, customers may move on or look to competitors.  As with social media, virtual assistants are great for answering and filtering your emails. Extremely important emails can be passed along to you, but everything else from SPAM to potential clients with frequently asked questions can be taken care of by a friendly, well-written and persuasive virtual assistant. STRESS, LACK OF SLEEP, AND YOUR HEALTH Having a virtual assistant isn’t just about delegating time-consuming tasks to another person so you can spend more time working on what only you can do. It’s also about giving you back your personal time and rest. Stress and sleep depravation are horrible for your overall health, your mind’s clarity, and your resistance to illnesses. A lack of sleep can increase your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, depression, and even affect your memory and reaction time. An excess of stress only makes the risk of these illnesses even higher. Even if you’re managing to get everything you need done by yourself, being stricken with one of these illnesses or even being at a higher risk of catching the common cold can throw your business into disarray. Without you, your business can’t run; if hiring a virtual assistant means you’re protecting your health, it’s well worth it. CONCLUSION Hiring a virtual assistant is an affordable and flexible way to maintain good communication with your customers and to find new customers, too. Instead of struggling to maintain what you’ve achieved, you can take more time for yourself and see your business flourish more than you could going at it alone. 25 Tasks to Outsource to a General Virtual Assistant 1.

If you have new visitors, that is also good news: they’ve seen your URL in advertising or elsewhere and it stuck in their memory. Organic For Internet Marketers, this is the jackpot. Organic traffic happens when searchers type in phrases related to your company and its products or services. For example, if I was searching for “brass tea kettles” (true story) on Google and your brass tea kettle emporium was listed at the top of the page, in my delight I would have to click on the link to your website. Because you didn’t pay to be on Google, your appearance would be natural, or organic. Search engine optimization is the art of helping companies be found organically on search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Paid Paid traffic are the visitors that come to your website through online advertising. The largest purveyor of this traffic is Google AdWords, an advertising avenue through Google. You might have noticed text ads when you search on Google or even appearing at the bottom of YouTube videos that you’re watching. Online advertising takes many shapes and forms and can be content-related or search-related. You might have heard someone working in Internet marketing refer to SEM, or Search Engine Marketing. That’s an acronym for someone who works with paid traffic. All FirstSearch packages at Mavidea come with management of AdWords for your company. This is a great way to cover more areas that potential customers may be searching for and an opportunity to reach out to customers in a new geographic area. Referral Long, long ago, people used to refer to the Internet primarily as “The World Wide Web.” In fact, that’s where the “www” suffix in URLs originated. While people may not call it the web anymore, the Internet still functions as billions of interconnected pages. These links that we’ve become so used to are like roads to get from one destination to another. When someone finds a link to your webpage on another website, this is called referral traffic. Referral traffic is a way to cast a wider net and to gain influence online. As your company appears more often and on relevant websites, potential customers will trust.

There's the engineering and there's the orchestration toward something without a single, dedicated purpose. Whether it's all aesthetically beautiful is just, almost literally, icing on the cake. Form follows function, no? If it works well, it'll look good too. A beauty evolves. There's little different between traditional architecture's goals and those of IT systems - other than the obvious. And it applies on micro or macro scales too.",2021-03-05T11:44:11.358Z,"How did the word architect come to be used for the design of computer systems? ",Quora

Affiliate Marketing The best part about this is that you will never have to deal with buying products, manufacturing products or doing any form of customer sales after service. Though you have to find a specific niche, you will have to research low competition keywords on that specific niche and aim to rank on page one of Google. Then you will place offers on your site that cater to that particular niche and if your site visitors click on the referral link and they purchase from the destination site's store, you will be paid a commission by your partner. A rough starting cost breakdown would be $10 for hosting a web, $10 for your domain name and lastly anything between $20 to $50 for a WordPress theme. Income potential would be limited to how many offers can you chuck out in a month. 2. Flipping Used Textbooks One of the easiest ways of earning money online is flipping used textbook. There are a couple of ways to do this but one of the all-time favourite ways is to buy used books on Amazon and trading it in via Amazon trade-in program. As we all know that college/university textbook can be quite costly for brand new ones, especially science textbooks which can cost up to $100+++. So what you can do is find the Amazon trade-in price for any books that you come across at a low price point. Example, Quantum Physics textbook have a trade-in price of $80 and you managed to find a second hand on online for $20 bucks. BAM, a neat $60 profit. This income potential is dependent on the amount of time you put in searching for books online and matching it with Amazon trade-in price. 3. Amazon FBA FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) which allow you to ride on the success of the biggest online retailing platform Amazon. As you're able to skip the hard work of promoting and advertising, packing, shipping, returns and dealing with customer service which is fulfilled by Amazon.

Perhaps you can do a market research on the ideal product and focus on the sales volume through your competitors' sales volume. Next would be finding a company to manufacture your product and arranging it to be ship to Amazon warehouse. Approximately every 2 weeks or so you will receive an electronic fund transfer to your bank account should you make any sales. Though you might need some capital of at least US$1000 to kickstart it.

First, it used CGI sparingly. Very sparingly—-only four minutes of a 127 minute movie contain CGI at all. Nine contain Stan Winston’s puppets. The other 112 minutes have no dinosaurs visible at all. This allowed the artists to focus on the scenes where dinosaurs appear much more easily than newer movies with oodles of CGI.

First, it used CGI sparingly. Very sparingly—-only four minutes of a 127 minute movie contain CGI at all. Nine contain Stan Winston’s puppets. The other 112 minutes have no dinosaurs visible at all. This allowed the artists to focus on the scenes where dinosaurs appear much more easily than newer movies with oodles of CGI. Second, Jurassic Park came out before the color-grading craze that Oh Brother Where Art Thou started. Color-grading was a thing before then, but it was used in Jurassic Park to make the blacks in frame deeper and thus increase the sense of dread the film so masterfully shows. In some modern films, color-grading works: it makes the explosions pop in Mad Max: Fury Road and separates the fantasy world of Lord of the Rings from our real one. But in movies that are supposed to take place in the real world, those fantastic blues and oranges only serve to make us feel like we’re in a fantasy. Jurassic World commits this sin, for example. Third, Jurassic Park hides the parts of the dinosaurs that could give away the trick. The feet are often where it happens, and you see dinosaur feet hidden behind cars, splashes of water, foliage, and so on. They hide in atmospheric sets, with gloom and fog and rain covering them. Putting CGI on full display often ages a movie, as happened in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Fourth and finally, the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park move with real weight. Some of this is due to studying real animals, some comes from having the animals move a little more ponderously, and some comes from the way they interact with a real-feeling environment. Either way, that sets it apart from movies like Avatar where the animals don’t seem to have any weight from the way they move. There isn’t a lot of CGI in the original Jurassic Park. There was The T-Rex’s legs. The torso was a computer controlled robot attached to a trailer.The Raptors were stop motion, or rather ILM’s ‘Go Motion’. They did basic stop motion photography with double exposed frames in between each frame.The Compy’s were puppets.The only real CGI was used in long shots that included either large herds of large dinosaurs seen from a distance. They were given enough time to do it right. AND there were only about 70 CG shots in the whole movie — as opposed to 2300 in a single Marvel film nowdays. And they deftly moved back and forth between Stan Winston’s animatronics and the CG, never depending on one approach for too long. Like a good magician, they are always distracting you and switching tactics so you can’t hone in on which method they are using.",2021-03-05T11:49:24.273Z,"How did they get the CGI in Jurassic Park to look better than a lot of CGI in modern movies?

Looking for “elephant labia” (just checking to see if the lady elephants got equal treatment to the male elephants), the search redirects to the word vulva and then shows more pictures (only 6 this time) of human female anatomy. Apparently, sexually sensitive (or too strange to think about?) topics in Wikipedia may be a bit unbalanced. Parents: If you’re concerned that your kids are getting sex education from Wikipedia, you are probably justified. If you’re worried about it, maybe you can have them use one of the many “kid safe” search engines. If you live on a farm with animals, never mind. They probably already know how that stuff works. - Caution: If they look up the word “coitus” in Wikipedia they will be directed to an entry with several drawings that show exactly how things fit together. Yes. Wikipedia has widely acknowledged problems of systemic bias - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BIAS - that is basically the sort of people who write Wikipedia come from a particular background and have particular interests that mean certain topics get more coverage than others. There is pretty much a guarantee that there are many individual articles throughout Wikipedia which will have biases.",2021-03-05T11:49:49.794Z,"Is Wikipedia biased? ",Quora

Among all the trendy business projects that are currently popular on the market, online gambling is firmly holding the leading positions. Such a stereotypical industry surprisingly managed to get high marks in terms of profitability, accessibility, and easy startup. However, backed up by such incredibly reliable companies as 2WinPower, the new operators continue to pop up regularly, steadily building their way to the top. Let’s see what makes the online gambling business one of the most profitable ways to make money on the internet. Accessible environment Similarly to other internet business projects, online gambling offers its operators a straightforward organizational process. Since all actions are performed on the internet, you don’t need to leave your working place to launch your own platform remotely. Moreover, one of the most attractive features of this direction is that your clients can also stay wherever they want to enjoy the favourite gaming content on their compatible devices. Licensing Don’t think that you are establishing an illegal platform that risks being banned in a few hours. You will be able to apply for permission at the supporting jurisdictions and offer licensed services as a respected operator. Your clients will be sure that their deposits are completely safe, meaning more and more of them will join your website. There is no need to worry about the invested amounts – you will eventually return them back in almost no time due to the increased traffic on your platform. Pay-off period Speaking about the returned investments, you will be able to make them up in just 3-6 months after the beginning of your operation. However, it will only work if your gambling website is genuinely designed according to the standards and requirements that will surely bring you a stable profit. Just half a year, and you will be able to enjoy the net profit from a smooth business project. Total market revenue By the end of 2018, the gross value of the market equalled more than $44 billion. That’s quite an achievement, considering that the industry established itself less than 20 years ago. Moreover, this sum doesn’t stop growing. The estimated calculations say that by the end of 2020, the total market revenue will exceed $50 billion. Isn’t it just a perfect time to join the industry? Advertising possibilities As you might already know, the internet is just a perfect place for commercials. You can spot the ads almost on every website, promoting various products and services. Even though you can’t freely popularize online gambling industry due to certain restrictions, there are a few viable ways to advertise your gaming website: affiliate systems;social media marketing;search engine optimization;blog writing;video content;emailing.What do you actually do to start an online gambling platform from scratch?  First things first – if you are new to the industry, you must have no clue of all the nuances of the organizational process. Of course, the internet is mostly open space, meaning information is highly accessible. However, it won’t give you such a thing as experience. Instead, you may resort to the professional guide companies, such as 2WinPower, offering you a turnkey business solution that eliminates the lack of experience. At the end of the organizational process, you will have a fully working gambling platform that brings you stable income in the long term. Hope, you will find your dream earning methods and won’t be mistaken with the choice. ​UC News app allows writers/bloggers to earn money online.

How To Earn Money From UC News App After you publish on UC news app, the next thing you might probably think of is monetizing your content.

When it comes to selling your content always remember “Content is the king”. Write content that is helpful to the audience. Now after you write some healthy content, all you need are the clicks on your content. To compel reader to read your content, a little clickbait always wins. But Don’t take this to the extreme! I said a little.. It means writing a title which is appealing and people get curious to find out what’s inside. Don’t write misleading title. This might work for getting a first click but reader may bounce back on finding your content irrelevant and may never visit again. To build a loyal audience, never mislead using fake titles or images. Although writing a right thing in the smart way makes you win the game.

Balance will be reduced only if the withdrawal is completed. 8.Currently they only support USD currency in the panel. You’ll still be able to get local currency during withdraw though.

You can also earn money for publishing your content on UC News app. That’s again a big motivator and a reason to rate this app a big fat 5. As said every new thing comes with some drawback.

There is software specifically designed for repairing audio (Izotope’s RX is brilliant for this) but many video editing programs have ways of dealing with background noise. Two things will help you with the repairs: The first is if the background wind noise is reasonably consistent. The second is if you have a few seconds of recording which just has the background wind noise, without the characters speaking. Sampling this will give you a default level which the program will use to fix the rest of the audio. Software such as iZotope RX can probably remove a lot of the noise, but it depends on how bad the noise is. It needs a clean sample of the noise between lines. Hopefully you shot with handles.

60421d39ed76476feda1ea3d,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-say-that-circus-animals-are-abused?-,"Imagine your life as a slave. That's what a circus animal's life is like. The same argument you have just used is the same the argument that slave supportes used. (They are fed, taken care of, etc. ) What is the price of freedom? Afwiw, they are whipped (like slaves) forced to work until they drop (like slaves) they are slaves. And slavery is abusive, to say the least. The very least. I don’t think there’s a need to “stop” circuses from including animals. If people no longer want to see animals in shows, all they have to do is not go to see animals in shows. I went to school for classical music. I like classical music a lot. But unfortunately for me, classical music is not very popular at this time.

If people no longer want to see animals in shows, all they have to do is not go to see animals in shows. I went to school for classical music. I like classical music a lot. But unfortunately for me, classical music is not very popular at this time. It’s been in a state of decline for quite a while in the US. The decline of classical music didn’t come about because people petitioned and protested and passed laws. It happened because people expressed their individual preferences, and all of those preferences added up to the majority of folks wanting to hear more rock, pop, etc. and less classical. As a result, there are fewer symphony orchestras to choose from out there. But they still exist. And thankfully, because there are no laws or bans that say I can’t listen to classical music, I continue to listen to it and enjoy live orchestra performances. Even though it’s not the most popular, this form of entertainment remains available to me, and I am free to choose to enjoy it. Circuses can be handled in the same way. Some people like animal circuses a lot. Others do not. Anyone who is not entertained by seeing animals perform may choose not to go see a circus with performing animals. If the circus declines in popularity, there may be fewer circuses to choose from, but they’d still exist for those who want to see them. I guess what I’m really getting down to is, “stopping”, i.e. implementing laws or bans that say people can’t enjoy certain types of entertainment, really gets in the way of free choice and individual rights. There are currently bans against circuses in various cities…for example, Pittsfield MA. The people of Pittsfield don’t have a choice…their city council has decided FOR them that animal circuses are not a form of entertainment that they are allowed to enjoy in their hometown. They’ll have to travel somewhere else if they want to see an animal circus. This ban applies to every person living in Pittsfield, whether they agreed with it or not. To me, that seems wrong. And of course, I imagine this question was asked because of the popular belief that circus animals are abused and/or exploited. As much as I’d LOVE to get into that, you didn’t directly reference that point, so I’ll refrain. Instead, let me just say this: whatever you believe about animal circuses, you’re absolutely entitled to that viewpoint. You have a right to form your own opinions and beliefs. And I’d like to point out that everyone else around you is entitled to form their own opinions and beliefs too, just as you have. That said, think of how you might feel if someone imposed their personal viewpoints, opinions, or morals on you as law. Or if you like, turn that around…think about how others would feel if YOUR opinions and morals became laws they’d have to follow. I don’t know about you, but personally I’d see that as an infringement on my rights. Do you think it's good to use animals in a circus? I have mixed feelings on this. One is that I grew up loving to go to the circus. The best part was after the show when my parents would take me behind the scenes to see the animals. The elephants would be standing around munching their hay, sometimes with a man rubbing their trunks and feeding them treats. The man always seemed to be in as much physical contact as possible, hugging the giant beast. It always seemed like there was a partnership. Of course the elephants were chained to the floor. The horses were well cared for. Certainly more healt Continue ReadingDo you think it's good to use animals in a circus? I have mixed feelings on this. One is that I grew up loving to go to the circus. The best part was after the show when my parents would take me behind the scenes to see the animals. The elephants would be standing around munching their hay, sometimes with a man rubbing their trunks and feeding them treats. The man always seemed to be in as much physical contact as possible, hugging the giant beast. It always seemed like there was a partnership. Of course the elephants were chained to the floor. The horses were well cared for. Certainly more healthy and happy than those standing in dirt lots or trying to survive without any care. The big cats didn’t seem very happy. They were crowded into small cages, and they would grimace and hiss much like a house cat does… but in a big way. I felt some sympathy for them. The dog acts were just dogs in their downtime. They would be scampering around their trainer, jumping up and down into their trailer and vying for attention. I noticed the bullhooks being used occasionally on the elephants, behind and ear to guide them as they walked. I saw the bearing reins used to keep horse’s heads high, and weighted boots. But overall I never thought the animals that were most trainable seemed unhappy. Would they have preferred an open field of chest high grass, or a home with a couch to lay on? Maybe… or not. I tend to think animals like to work more than standing around bored all the time. Here’s the thing… I judge the relative indignities and pain and effort of performing or working for a human master in the same ways I evaluate their natural nonworking lives. Horses LIKE to race against each other. They like to pull a load. They like to see new landscapes. So do dogs. And I believe well managed elephants like what they do. Are there abuses?

I think that every woman should be able to decide whether or not she wants to have a baby. Now, people argue that she could have used birth control, not had sex at all, or could give the baby up for adoption. Here are my reasons against those. There is no birth control method that is foolproof, and even if you use it, there is still the possibility that you will get pregnant. My roommate got pregnant the first time they had sex.

I think that every woman should be able to decide whether or not she wants to have a baby. Now, people argue that she could have used birth control, not had sex at all, or could give the baby up for adoption. Here are my reasons against those. There is no birth control method that is foolproof, and even if you use it, there is still the possibility that you will get pregnant. My roommate got pregnant the first time they had sex. He used a condom, she was on the pill, and he pulled out. They still got pregnant. There was nothing else they could have done to prevent it. Birth control isn't available to everyone. It isn't inexpensive and many people are unable to afford it. Planned Parenthood offers contraception, but they are losing funding because people don't approve of them. People are also often embarrassed to ask their parents or buy condoms because of the way people judge. Even if wait to have sex until you are married, that doesn't mean you will get pregnant when the two of you are ready. It also doesn't mean that your marriage will work or that having a baby will keep it together.Yes you could give the baby up for adoption, but I have seen people go through that and it tore them up. They spent 9 months bonding with their daughter, feeling her grow and kick, only to have her taken away a few hours after she was born. The adoptive couple was nice, but they didn't want an open adoption. My friend will never know her daughter.I don't think I could ever go through with an abortion, but I see a few reasons why someone might: They were raped and became pregnant because of it. I think that if a woman has been forced into being pregnant, and she doesn't want to relive that every time she feels the baby, she shouldn't have to. She shouldn't be forced to either raise a baby that was conceived by rape or have to carry the baby to give it to someone else. If she can do, that is amazing, but she should have the choice.The girl gets pregnant at such a young age that there is no way she can raise the baby. A girl usually gets her period around 12-13 years old, and from then on, she can have kids. We have all seen girls who are that young who have had sex and are pregnant. You can't even work at most places until you are 16, and you can't work at a job that will pay will till you are 18 or 21. That means the kid would be in school by the time you could get a job and provide for them. Plus, they're too young to even be able to do their homework on time let alone raise a baby.Maybe being pregnant is dangerous and is putting the baby and the mom at risk. Doctors do have to recommend abortions sometimes because the baby will not survive, nor will the mother. This could be caused by any number of different medical reasons.being born into an abusive family or a family that can't support it, but won't give the baby away. A house where they are going to be abused and see others being abused, is not an acceptable place to live and grow up in. And foster homes are rarely beneficial, and many kids never get adopted.I do think babies are humans and I think the pictures of torn up baby parts are disturbing and wrong. However, I also think that sometimes the best decision is to not have the baby.  The baby can't make decisions yet and they don't know what the world has out there. I don't think people should abortions because they keep getting pregnant because they don't use protection and they don't want kids, but I think there are scenarios where it is ok. I'm probably going to lose followers for this. Several times I bumped into people shoving such handout at my face. I usually took a glance before dumping it in the trash can. Honestly, I feel hungry, seeing pictures of aborted fetuses.

Several times I bumped into people shoving such handout at my face. I usually took a glance before dumping it in the trash can. Honestly, I feel hungry, seeing pictures of aborted fetuses. The pictures of aborted fetus remind me of a large fish I haven't finished eating, the pork my mother tried to cook, or slain pigs awaiting human processing. I like eating meat, and what the pictures show me reminds me of meat, which facilitates my mouth to produce saliva. In essence, the bundle of blood and tissue that constitute the fetuses is nothing more than medical waste. Even if the fetus looks remotely like a half-baby, it's still medical waste, not a breathing human, not a baby. I don't have a problem with abortion, nor do I hold prejudice against females who have had abortion before. But I do have a problem with someone spreading these pictures around. Are you respecting life? Do you seriouly believe the sanctity of life? Do you have no better way of making a statement than ruining someone else’s day? Don’t you know that everyone is fighting a battle you're not aware of? I can take these pictures lightly, but not everyone else. If a woman who had an abortion because of a fatal complication saw the pictures, she would be guaranteed terrible nightmares for the rest of the week, or month. If a young adult who was once foolish enough to have unprotected sex saw the pictures, the long buried memories she had tried so hard to forget would be flooding in. If a guy persuaded his wife to abort the baby who would be severely handicapped, and he saw the pictures, he would be consumed by guilt towards his wife. Everyone chooses abortion for a reason. The decision is already hard enough. Life is already hard enough. If you are against abortion, good, keep it to yourself, don't end your own pregnancy, talk to the legislators, or lobby in front of the Capitol Hill. Leave innocent people alone. In fact, the gruesomeness of the “unborn baby” has nothing to do with abortion. The fetuses are gruesome not as a result of abortion, but they are simply gruesome by nature, the same way as why you are ugly. Flip through a medical student’s textbook. There are a lot more pictures even more gruesome. What do you want to say about them? Also because of abortion? I don't see why people would hand out leaflets printed with bundles of gruesome medical waste. They are either assholes trying to ruin other people’s day, or publicly teaching random passers-by human biology. They’re an oddity to me, but they don’t bother me probably beyond seeing a dead squirrel on the road. Definitely not enough for me to change my position.

All bloody and gory depending on the research (the euthanasia is peaceful). Just to improve science and the quality of your care if you get sick. Your meat is killed in unpleasant ways, too. Blood everywhere. Ewwww A small fetus on a penny or whatever isn’t my favorite thing in the world to see, but truthfully, that little thing doesn’t outweigh the bodily autonomy of a woman. And it looks quite like a small baby mouse. Some of which sadly get eaten by their mothers when the moms are stressed. They’re obviously not the same thing, but I’ve seen tiny bloody pink things that have been killed. So that doesn’t shock me. Life and death are very close to one another. I’m not afraid to see death. Is that what these pictures are hoping to accomplish? And small bloody pink things that barely look like people and look more like mutilated baby mice aren’t too convincing to me. Edit: to sum… A lot of Western cultures (and India which is very Westernized nowadays anyhow…some parts) are not comfortable with death as a part of life. I figure those pictures are meant to: 1) Scare me because…death and blood…ew…scary! (physical disgust reaction) I’m comfortable with death as a part of life. And yes, it does happen to be bloody and ugly sometimes. 2) Make my heart ache because a “baby” has been slaughtered. (moral outrage/disgust reaction) The fact the entity is smaller or as big as a penny and barely looks like a human being makes me question, though, how that’s supposed to work? I have sympathy for what are clearly injured or killed other human beings. Not for some super small baby mouse-looking thing. So it’s not really enough to get me to reflect on my position. Although I did stop long enough to look at the picture that I was offered a brochure. I’d never seen one of those pictures before. Miscarriages happen fairly frequently. If you took a picture of a bloody bunch of tissue in a toilet it’d be equivalent to these “baby” photos slapped up by pro-lifers.[1] [1] About 80% of miscarriages happen at 12 weeks or less…those are about the ages those fetuses on the pennies are. 3 months is the latest a woman can have an abortion without a special exception (late term abortion).

First, you really need to define & understand exactly what a PLR product is. It could be data content or media content in a book, audio, video, graphics or software, etc originally created by someone other than yourself. THE creator of the PLR content/product owns the FULL copyrights, often sold in part or (MRR, FRR & PRR) in full as a “product”. Usually an info/training or promo product like an ebook, audio or video item that can be legally given away, sold and resold for honest profit. When you purchase or obtain it, YOUR use of the material is limited to the terms of use applied to and included with your possession & use of it. PLR = P=Private L=Label R=Rights FRR = F=Full R=Resell R=Rights MRR = M=Master R=Resell R=Rights PRR = P=Personal R=Resell R=Rights So, any PLR product you use, the “Rights” should be owned by you which legally allows you to giveaway, sale, resale, share/transfer, copy/reproduce and /or edit the product which should be clearly stated in the license. That license should be included with the original PLR product outlining YOUR use of it. In answer to your question, “Yes” you can as long as your “Rights” allow it and “No” if they don’t. Primarily, you must own the PLR product in order to legally comply with its intended use. If you do own and use the content, make sure to proof read and edit the content before distributing online or anywhere else because most likely you’re not the only owner of that core content which has been or is being duplicated word for word in the original PLR product by the all other “owners” somewhere else in cyberspace.

Facebook Ads Manager will guide you to create, run and test many ad tests so that you can find out which ad formula is catching attention of your consumers. 5. Partner With Other Brands Small business can reach out to more people by collaborating with other ventures. This is an effective way of marketing your products or services as you are using the consumers of the other ventures for promoting your products. For example, if you are a beauty therapist, you can approach a hair stylist with the proposal of offering free manicure to its clients. In this way, you will advertise your small business amid the ready-made clients of the other enterprise. Similarly, your coffee shop can provide free vouchers to the other businesses such as a plumber’s customers. 6. Use Social Media A majority of your target customers are on different social channels. Most of your target audience is using social media for customer support. Your small business must be present on all the major social platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Make sure that you devote your time to efforts for the growth of your social media audience. Many clever marketing professional invest a lot of time and money toward building their social media presence. So, find out which social channels your audience is using more and make special marketing plans to target such channels. 7. Promote On Coupon Deal Sites Coupon deal sites have massive number of your target consumers. You should explore marketing opportunities presented by big coupon deal sites like Groupon. Even big businesses offer limited-time-discounts to their members on these sites. You can easily target local advertising on the coupon deal sites. Your brand awareness amongst the audience increases manifold and new customers come searching for your small business. Keep in mind that your main purpose of using coupon deal sites should not be to earn profit and sales. The purpose should be to generate awareness about your small and unknown business by encouraging people to try your products. 8. Advertise In Print Media Print media such as newspapers and magazines have large readership. A reputed newspaper reaches to a huge number of people from different educational and social backgrounds. In fact, newspapers are read by almost all section of populations. This means that your advertisements of products or services will catch attention of people who rely more on print media for detailed news and views. Many retail consumers take their purchasing decisions based on the information they get from advertisements in newspapers. Your small enterprise can now afford placing ads in print media as the advertisements rates have decreased over the years. Make sure that you combine print media with online marketing strategies. 9. Explore Webinars Webinars are also seen by marketing experts as a potential strategy to draw customers to a business. A webinar is a seminar conducted online in varied forms such as demonstration, discussion and presentation. Often, clever marketers use webinars to generate a larger email list. People who join a webinar have to give their details such as name, phone number and email. So, your small business can generate a larger number of emails this way. You can then use these emails to promote your products or services. Webinar marketing is surely a great way to promote your small business steadily. As compared to simple videos, webinars are far more engaging because of the live Q&A sessions for the subscribers. When they get answers to their specific queries, they feel special and satisfied. 10. Help Others By Offering Free Consultation People want help from experts. You can use their urge for help by offering your expert views on a problem free to them. If you can position yourself as an authority in your niche and provide free consultation, it will help generate new leads. The people who need your expertise on a product or service will be impressed by your free service. In return, many of them will buy your products as their way of thanking you. By offering your free consultation, you are helping your potential customers in making a right purchasing decision. Also, one can use referral software such as Omnistar through which your customer would refer your company to others. But this marketing tactic will work more efficiently if your small business offers expert services or high-priced products, which need an informed buying decision. 11. Email Marketing Email marketing is a time-tested way to convince the consumers about the usefulness of a product or service. Remember that many people want to have more information and convincing before making a purchasing decision. To gather email addresses of your potential customers, you will offer them something enticing such as a free download, a ‘seat’ at a webinar, a coupon, a free service trial and so on. When a person subscribes to your free offerings, you include one more member in your email list. Email marketing is a low-cost strategy that you can use to enhance your global reach of business. You can send emails in an automatic way without wasting your time. Emails are easy to setup and run and you can establish communication with your consumers immediately. 12. Direct Mail Marketing Direct mail marketing is a conventional way of business promotion. Many small businesses still use it effectively. Since online channels already have a massive amount of content, people want to be engaged in a different way. But you need to make your direct mail attractive to draw the recipients’ attention. Start with creating an eye-catching envelope design and make it appear bulky so that people open it to satisfy their curiosity. Use all the tricks such as creating unique shapes of envelope, use attractive colors, make envelope lumpy to grab the attention. Make sure that the letter inside of envelope has a compelling content for the best results. Right from the headline to the main body of the letter, everything must send your message to the readers in quick time. 13. Offer Incentives To Your Staff You should use your own employees to promote your business. This is also a marketing strategy to get new customers. Your employees know about your business more than the outsiders do. After all, they know your product or service inside out. Just offer some incentives to the staff. For example, you can offer financial rewards to the employees who refer new clients or bring in new business. You can offer these incentives in money and in various other ways such as vouchers for restaurants, movies, membership to publications etc. To conclude, these marketing ideas will surely help you in promoting your products or services among your target consumers. You must devote time and money to reap benefits from these strategies.

We All Do Support, We All Do Marketing, We All Do Sales At ArchiSnapper, marketing is not a single person’s responsibility. The same goes for support. We don’t have person A and B on marketing, and person C and D on support. The people that are doing marketing, are the same people that offer customer support. And in fact, they are the same that manage sales. The only team that’s a bit separate of all these tasks is our development team, although they also help with support. You must be thinking: “no, not good, it’s not possible for one and the same person to be good in all those things“. We think the opposite is true: you can’t be good at marketing or sales if you never do support. Let’s talk about marketing first. Small side note: We’re talking about the traditional marketing activities here (e.g. content creation, sending newsletters, making product videos). Disregarding that in fact, everything we do is marketing. (Read more about this at the bottom of this article). We believe that it’s not possible to be good at marketing without spending a considerable amount of time talking with customers. To market our product, we have to know our product, and understand how our customers use and value the product. The only way to achieve this is by talking with customers about our product. We listen to the words they use. We help them get started with our app, and call them to understand their exact processes and requirements. We ask them for feedback and what they like about our product. We answer hundreds of small support questions. So everyone who is involved in traditional marketing activities at ArchiSnapper will spend a considerable time on frontline activities; like calling new trial users, answering customer questions, and giving product demos. By doing customer support every person in our team really gets to master our product and gets to know every little detail that customers are asking about. And when that person later gives a sales demo, he’ll be able to answer specific questions like ‘how can I link ArchiSnapper to my Dropbox account‘, or ‘how much RAM does my device need‘. A salesperson that masters their product/service, understand their customers’ needs, and that can answer any question (technical or not) will have a way better chance of success. In fact, supporting customers doesn’t only help to become better at marketing or sales. It helps our development team to understand how our customers use our product and what’s important to them (not to us!). It helps us focus on the value we are generating for our users with a certain feature instead of on writing perfect code and developing things no one needs. Talking with customers also helps us focus on the right priorities: we don’t need to invent ‘cool‘ features or philosophize about our strategic 2030 plan. Based on day-to-day support, we know what our users need, we know the things they like about our product, and we don’t want to change, and we know how we can improve the product to generate even more value. So that’s what we’re working on, feature by feature. Everybody being involved in support, makes everyone better in every role. Take care, Jerry  Note on “Everything is marketing”: If marketing is everything we do to get new customers, then everything we do is marketing: a phone call with a customer is marketingmaking our product better is marketinghelping customers with questions is marketingsending invoices is marketingeven solving a bug is marketing… every single act we do is marketing, since ultimately it all contributes to a buyers decision.We believe that treating our users well – by offering awesome support, building a great product, answering a phone call in a friendly way – is simply the best marketing we can do.

With time he will be spending all day indoors and most of the night out which is really good for the cat. Trust me they know how to take care of themselves. Start them young. 2.Feed your cat raw meat (chicken,goat,guts,organs except liver)and other things likes cooked eggs..fried. Rarely give them milk and carbs, once a week. 3.When the cat gets sick unless it's obviously life threatening just allow the cat to heal itself. Always feed him his favorite meat for my cats its fresh goat meat and some fresh milk. Cats heal fast when they are healthy. 4.Sometimes they don't come back in the morning, as usual, from hunts or whatever cats do at night. Don't over think. During the mating season, one of my cats doesn't come back home for almost a week..the other 2 or 3 days..but they always come back; a little beat but always okay. 5.Cats sleep a lot. Can make you worry. My cats come home around 6 in the morning and can sleep from 7am , after I feed them, until 8pm. 6.Cats hates fleas and I don't wash my cats, they hate water. I lost a cat to a chemical flea killer so I now use diatomaceous earth. It is an abrasive white dust that kills parasites by physically shredding them. Very safe for both cats and humans. It has many other uses and also kills internal parasites in animals and humans too. Perfect to sprinkle on carpets. 7.Cats love humans a lot. Being in the same room as you most of the time is important so allow cat access to you. 8.If not illegal don't vaccinate your cat. Trust me. 9.Every cat is different so know your cat. One of my cats eats certain meats and things that the other doesn't. 10. Cats know what is good and what is bad for them as long as its naturally presented to them. My cats drink fresh milk and don't drink powdered milk. Idk why. They both hate cooked meat, again idk why, I guess its the blood in raw meat. 11.Cats can be trained to not scratch and piss in the house. Be patient. My two unneutered male cats don't piss indoors, it's like they know its my territory. They scratch and shit when they go out so no stress. 12.Always provide fresh water. Always. 13.Cats eat many things, even some vegetables and fruits like avocado so just chill and let the cat show you things. That's all.

This is important, because cats can do some really annoying things, like clawing furniture, or sometimes peeing where they're not supposed to. I've known people who kept their cats always locked in the bathroom, or throw the cat out or have it euthanized for scratching furniture. Cat behavior - WikipediaLearn about cat body language. You can learn a lot of this just by observing your cat over time. Also, different vocalizations. Your cat will talk to you with various sounds. Some cats talk more than others! This is also something you'll learn over time. Have everything you need before you bring the cat home: a good size litterbox (not small), cat litter (the clumping kind works best), food (I recommend both wet and dry), dishes for food and water, treats, and toys.Never spank your cat or hurt it in any other way. Look online for ways to deal with whatever problem you're having.Cats have different personalities. Some like to be on or around you all the time, some are more aloof and don't like being handled too much. If you get your cat from a shelter and you have a preference, let the staff know what kind of personality you would like and they can point out the ones with that trait. There Are 5 Feline Personality Types - Which Is Your Cat?Safety— watch out for the cat when you open and close doors, including the refrigerator and dryer, if you have one. Look around your home for things that might need to be “child-proofed""—keeping the toilet closed (especially if you have a kitten), windows (they can push out or shred window screens and fall out), use outlet covers, don't leave plastic bags and rubber bands lying around (some cats like to eat them), don't let them chew on wires, get rid of any toxic-to-cats plants. Poisonous Plants Can you tell I'm a worrier? 40 Cat Safety Tips - PetchaWhen you go to pick out your cat, try to spend at least a few minutes with the ones you're interested in. The right cat will pick you! If the cat shows interest in you by meowing, rubbing against you, touching you in any kind of way, you have been chosen! Of course, you don't have to do this…personally, I will sometimes take the one who's been there the longest, or is the oldest, or doesn't seem to be wanted because of some disease or deformity.

They'll pounce on your feet too. This phase doesn't last long, and it's usually just the tiny ones that do it. 20 Things Your New Kitten Wants You to KnowKittens play all the time, and than pass out wherever they happen to be. Also, everything is a toy to them, including you. Don't let them get in the habit of play-biting, because they won't outgrow it and getting bitten by an adult cat is not fun! How to Stop Kitten BitingUsing a litterbox is pretty much instinct— just show the kitten where it is and put him/her in it. Until kitty remembers where it is, you might want to put her in it every few hours. You could even move her little paws in scratching motion so she gets the idea.Enjoy your new furry friend!

Also make sure to show them the food and water immediately, and try not to change where you keep them.They have rough, scratchy tongues.  If they lick you and it feels weird, it's normal.Cats sleep a lot.  There's nothing wrong with your cat if he or she sleeps for most of the day.  You'll be jealous of the amount of cozy sunbathing  time they get every day.  They clean themselves with their tongues - they do not need to be cleaned by you at all, unless, like Maya said, they have something toxic or especially icky in their fur.They will love you and cuddle you on their own time - you absolutely can't force it.  To show them you're not a threat when they're still getting used to you, let them smell your hand and pet them gently around the head, ears, and chin.  This is a pretty safe spot to pet all cats - they tend to love it.  Most cats have no-zones, too, like paws and tummies.  Approach these areas with caution and don't touch them there if they show they don't want you to (which they'll certainly show you).If a cat rolls over on its back and exposes its belly to you, it generally means that they trust you (they're making themselves vulnerable in front of you).  However, this does not necessarily mean they want you to pet their bellies.  Like I said, most cats are iffy about belly rubs unless they really trust you.  Even then, many don't like it (although some love it).When they wag their tails (not swishing, but wagging), they're unhappy.  Let them have their space.Teach them not to do certain things (scratch furniture, chew cords, etc.) by firmly saying ""No!"" or ""Stop!""  You can also make some sort of noise that will get their attention, like clapping your hands or making a ""Sssstttt"" sound (this works best for my cats).  Do not try to physically punish them for bad behavior or intimidate them by stomping your feet and chasing them away - it'll just make them trust you less.Some cats are more vocal than others.  Sometimes your cat will meow to get your attention for something specific (food, water, let me outside, etc.), but otherwise, some cats just like to talk.  If your cat is meowing at you for no apparent reason, you might just have a talkative cat.  Embrace it.Cats can be a wonderful alarm clock.  If you get in the habit of feeding them at a certain time every day, they'll expect you to be up-and-at-'em every day at that time to feed them.  They have various techniques for waking you up - my old cat used to lick my dad's hair every morning when she wanted to be fed.  Many cats will just meow or walk on you until you wake up.Some cats are cuddlier and more friendly than others.  There's nothing wrong with your cat if he or she is shy and not very affectionate.  Every cat is unique.If your cat will be an outdoor cat: Expect to find dead rodents and birds occasionally to frequently, depending on how skilled a hunter your cat is.  To my great dismay, you can't train this out of them.  It's in their blood and they're going to hunt no matter how much this displeases you.  They'll also be very proud of their kills, so they'll often try to leave them where you can see them or even occasionally bring them in the house.  Keep an eye out for ticks and fleas, and like Maya said, treat them regularly with some kind of anti-flea and tick ointment.  They don't like it very much, but they'll get over it.Spay or neuter your cat.  You should probably do this for an indoor cat as well (especially for a female, since she will go into heat fairly frequently if not spayed), but it's especially important if your cat will be an outdoor cat.I recommend watching some episodes of ""My Cat From Hell"" to learn some interesting and useful tips about cat behavior.  My biggest takeaway from the show: cats like to have a few places where they feel safe and protected.  These tend to be either places high off the ground or little crevices they can squeeze into to be alone.  If your cat is having behavioral problems or issues adjusting to your household, make sure he or she has a few safe places to hide out or just acclimate themselves comfortably to their new environment.",2021-03-05T12:09:28.671Z,"What should you know as a first time cat owner?

Just schedule it from the web, and you're good to go. Even cooler, Social Report has a built-in image editor that you can use to add filters, crop, and make other adjustments to your photographs. This lets you take your images from start to finish without leaving the Social Report app. Sounds great to us!

You can customize the types of content that Social Drift interacts with to ensure you only get followers that are interested in your product or service.

Below are some predictions of what digital marketing will look like in the closest future. 1. Mobile Remains Priority Mobile conversion issues have been at the top of Google’s priorities, heightened by mobile overcoming desktop circa 2014. Finally, Apple’s Safari will start to feel more pressure to support service workers for Progressive Web Apps (PWA). If Safari beings to support PWAs’ core functionality, it’ll drastically improve their marketability. 2. Web Performance Optimization Becomes Sexy Websites have been growing in size creating a website obesity crisis (http://HTTPachive.org shows ~280% growth 2011 v 2017). Sites are going to have determine the right solution mix from their website as multiple remedies emerge (including: HTTP/2, AMP, PWA, CRP, RAILS). 3. We’re Going to Continue Hear About Machine Learning (ML) Victories Google’s research blog has been publishing a ton about breakthroughs in ML, along with technologies that make ML more accessible to the average human being (think: Your Home for Data Science, TensorFlow, and Facets visualizations). ML offers the potential to better understand multimedia content better. We’ll likely see more poignant, targeted KG responses and SERPs in these areas. Also, as the training wheel supports for Google’s algorithm, structured data is an important aspect of developing data classification. Google will likely continue to expand structured data documentation. Bing will face more pressure to support JSON-LD, as websites being leveraging the format. 4. Google’s Going to Face More Media Pressure Google will be at the center of public debates surrounding fake news, data security (against hacking attacks), privacy concerns, and proprietary information. Following this trend, Google will likely ramp up the importance of HTTPS. About 60% of the top 100 sites are on HTTPS already. 5. Conversational Devices and Voice Search Voice search technology is becoming closer to conversational (within a word accuracy rate that people are willing to deal with). Once the capabilities reach acceptable levels, we’ll likely see a resurgence of chat bots. 6. Content Diversification Companies will really need to adapt to this trend to stay in the game. We’ll see larger companies hiring video producers and graphic designers to collaborate with their marketing teams. But where it gets really exciting is if you work for a startup; let’s say you’re a one or two-person marketing department, then you’re going to have to learn those skills yourselves. 7. Automation and AI While the same can be said for most industries, automation and more intelligent human-informed (but machine implemented) decision making will continue to eat into the digital marketing job sector. While a lot of the jobs that will get swallowed are more fringe digital marketing, strategies such as chat bots and bid-management will continue to advance and replace some of the less technical human-based skill-sets that currently exist. Content and more specifically copy creation/writing are other elements that could be replaced by machines as technologies become more advanced at producing comprehensible language.

The days of leaning on print magazines or billboards for business advertisements, thinking they alone could generate enough buyers for a company to be successful, are gone. How Digital Marketing was? Not long ago, companies became successful by explicitly showing their products, telling us how they would solve our problems and constantly promoting how they were better than the competition. Nowadays, people trust other consumers more than they trust direct brand advertisements. In some ways, the mission now is understanding that people don’t want to buy something that is obviously displayed as a product. Every day, companies are creating new ways to make people feel like they want their products -- or even better like they actually need them. Consumers want to make their own choices and buy what they buy for personal reasons. According to research from ODM Group, over 70% of consumers consult social media before making a purchase. So, people don’t always choose by themselves when buying something. They often want to know what others think first. Evolution of Digital Marketing We need to change the customer shopping experience. More than the first stage of delight, people like to feel appreciated all of the time. You need to improve strategies for your potential customers as much as for your current ones. The marketing process now indicates that the selling/buying system is based on a flywheel. The old, funnel-like system seemed to only care about customers before they bought. After the buying process, they weren’t a priority to help with the company’s culture, customer service or marketing strategy. The flywheel system is based on the ability of our clients to give us feedback at all times: before, during and after buying. We live in a moment in history when technology can help us in bringing more and better audiences to like our products. It’s easier to get to more people, but it's important to realize that not all of them will be interested in your company. Future of Digital Marketing in India With 450 million internet users in India, businesses can no more choose to ignore their presence on digital and online media. In the absence of digital presence, customers are bound to discover and opt for the services of your competitor (who has already mastered digital marketing). The top 6 digital areas of focus for most brands are: Social media marketing – 88.17%Search engine optimization – 70.97%Content marketing via blogs – 56.99%Email campaigns – 55.91%Landing page optimization – 55.91%Search engine marketing – 55.91%With the growing influence of digital marketing in today’s world, educational institutes are focusing on providing education, trainings related to digital marketing. But If are already a working professional, then I would suggest instead of pushing full-time education on digital marketing, you can try for certification from professional firms like Edu4Sure, Coursera etc. Peace Out :) RISE OF DIGITAL MARKETING DURING COVID -19 AND HOW IT MADE SURE THAT THE FUTURE OF DIGITAL MARKETING IS VERY BRIGHT We live in unprecedented times where our definition of normal has gone away.

The landscape of the world has changed in a jiffy, and we’re left with no choice, but to adapt to the ongoing shifts. Digital has emerged as the undebatable winner amidst the crisis and we’ve all bowed down to the power it has commanded lately. Even the traditional businesses are channelizing the digital medium to reach out to a wider audience. Facebook and Instagram are encouraging small scale businesses to open shops online and expand the scale of their business. Even the entertainment industry has revamped itself and is adapting to the reign of OTT platforms. While all these years, the transformation towards digital was gradual and scalable, in the last few months, the graph has escalated by leaps and bounds. The traditional career paths are becoming seemingly redundant after digital has taken over. The fresh graduates or the new job-seekers have nothing to lose and everything to win as they’d be exposed to a plethora of exciting opportunities. For those that are ready to adapt to the digitization of the world, the future looks promising Digital marketing has garnered massive popularity for the dynamism and growth it promises. At once, a chosen few resorted to digital as a medium of marketing, but now, it has become a mandatory platform for anyone who seeks visibility across masses. Thus, it has opened up an ocean of opportunities for those that are enthusiastic about the digital skills and passionate about the art of marketing. In these times, we all realized that digital is the only way to stay connected in any crisis.

What you need to look for is a photographer with a lot of talent that is just starting out.  This type of photographer will price themselves lower than others in order to build their business.  Once they have referrals and some business coming in, they will raise their prices.   A second source of inexpensive photography is discounts.  Many photographers will discount if they don't feel they will book that date otherwise.  This means you need to have your wedding on a day that other people will not be having their wedding.   So how do you find that inexpensive photographer? 1.  Have a realistic budget:Every area has different price ranges, but for major cities, anything under $2500 is considered cheap. If you're looking for a $500 dollar photographer, then  the answer is no you cannot find one.  A budget of $2000-$2500 for a photographer is definitely extremely inexpensive, but you may be able to find a photographer for that price.   2.  Contact other photographers:Wedding photographers will know if one of their friends are up and coming.  Contact a wedding photographer you like and respect but perhaps they are too expensive for you.  Give them your budget and ask them if there is anyone they know within that price range.  They may not know anyone, but they might. 3. Have your wedding on a Friday:Wedding photographers will give discounts for weddings that occur on Fridays and Sundays.  Contact a photographer that you like that might be slightly above your price range and ask them if they have discounts for Fridays or Sundays.  Photographers would rather be working than not and Friday and Sunday weddings are more rare than Saturdays.  Most good wedding photographers have no trouble booking Saturdays. 4. Have your wedding during the offseason:The offseason for every city is different.  Generally it could be between October and March, during the colder months.  You would be risking poor weather, but there are less weddings during these months and therefore the wedding photographer would rather work than not work.  You could possibly ask for a discount if you have an offseason wedding.  5.  Search wedding photographer listings.  WPJA.com weddingwire.com and other sites all list a lot of wedding photographers.  Many of the sites will list the photographer's starting price and some photos.  This could be a quick way of finding a photographer who is just starting out but has a great eye for photography.  Finally, if you find a photographer who is reasonably priced, be sure to look at an entire gallery of photos.  Don't just look at the great photos on their website.  You need to know what you'll be getting.  If you do find a photographer you like.  Book them right away.  Inexpensive photographers who are good will book up extremely quickly.  Do not hesitate.  Sign the contract and secure your date. It is standard to require payment in full before the wedding.

That can be broken into payments several different ways for the clients convenience, but professionals can not afford to invest a lot of time in a client who is then going to play games with payment after the fact. This is especially important for budget weddings, because those are the clients most likely to decide that they don’t want to pay that much money for the photos after the event. Once the wedding is done, the excitement is over, and the bank accounts are empty. The total cost may be more than expected, or it might just feel like a bigger hit than expected. That is the worst possible time for the photographer to come around asking for yet another big payment. On top of that, there is a lot of very bad advice on the internet about how to pay wedding vendors less, after the event is done. You are hiring a professional, to do a professional job. Find someone who charges a rate you are comfortable with, and just pay the bill up front. The photographer who is shy about asking for payment, and who will let you defer the payment until after the wedding is the amateur who is still getting used to getting paid for the work. They may not have the experience you want, their professional practices aren’t established, and you are both taking chances. You risk them delivering a lower quality product, and they risk you not paying them. How the photographer handles payment provides you a little bit of information as to their professionalism. If they stumble and hesitate and let the subject of payment slip until later, that’s a sign they haven’t done this very much. If they just tell you the price, and the terms, and send you an invoice, that’s a sign that they have their business practices in place and know what they are doing. When I am talking to a potential client, there is a point in the discussion where they are clearly at least considering hiring me. That’s when I send them a formal proposal, with all the terms spelled out in detail, what, when, where, what will be delivered, what I will wear, and when I expect payment. They can sign on-line and pay their deposit on-line right there. Very direct and easy.

One of the best decisions I made and would not trade that moment with anyone else.  We did the “first look.” Man, we spent a fortune on the cocktail hour and I would be damned if I had to miss out on the delicious assortment. Also, I needed to see my husband before the actual ceremony and it was a really intimate time with just the two of us. I made my own cupcakes for dessert. That’s right. I made a small cake for my husband and me to cut, but the desserts for the guests were my homemade cupcakes that I made from scratch. Kendra’s cupcake assortment consisted of carrot cake with homemade cream cheese frosting, chocolate cupcakes with a salted caramel frosting and a homemade caramel drizzle, and pumpkin cupcakes with a maple buttercream frosting. All from scratch a couple of days before the wedding. I even made an assortment of homemade cookies for the guests to take back to their room. Saved myself a fortune and spared my guests the horrible taste of fondant.  Did not throw the bouquet. I think there were a small number of single ladies and I doubt they would be interested in lining up for that. Also, I can’t throw behind my back and would probably knock out the DJ or something. Nobody caught the garter. I was not interested in wearing one and I was not interested in my husband going up my dress to retrieve it. Hard pass. We gave out shots as wedding gifts. No candied covered almonds or fancy mints. I bought a few bottles of fireball and poured them into mini mason jars and dressed them up to be the perfect little wedding gift.  Did not go to a floral shop for flowers. I pre-ordered all of my flowers from Costco to be delivered to my house two days before the wedding. The centerpiece was just a single white rose with baby breaths and I cut and assembled my bouquets for myself and my bridesmaids. Probably spent less than $300 on flowers all said and done.

He might be eligible for a 1 to 1 aide in a public classroom, which is how I started. He might be eligible to go to a school that specializes in the education of children on the spectrum, which is where I work now. He should be assessed for his Occupation Therapy needs, as well as his Speech/Language Pathology needs. There are a wide variety of tools and techniques that could be made available to him that could make his school career more successful and less stressful. These can also aid him in navigating a world designed for an by the neurotypical. Some things to avoid…. ANY promise of a cure. There isn’t one. As said above, there are tools and techniques to make your child less stressed and more successful, but he was born with autism. Like blue eyes, it is who he is. Dietary restrictions. Many will say keep him away from gluten, or wheat, or soy, or particular food dye. There is no evidence that any of these have any impact on autism. People on the spectrum will often restrict their own diet. I have seen many children be severely underweight because of restrictions placed on an already restricted diet. Anti Vaccinators. There was a study done by someone named Andrew Wakefield about 20(?) years ago. He falsely claimed there was a link between autism and vaccines. This has been since debunked and his article in The Lancet (along with his medical license) pulled. However a significant chunk of people in the autism community (and some outside the community) have been convinced that there is a link. They are wrong. Blame. Nothing you or anyone else did caused autism, as far as we know. There has not been an environmental causal link to autism, so it has nothing to do with what you did or did not do, where you lived, what you ate, etc. Claims to knowledge of a cause. There is work being done in this area, but there is no consensus yet as to the cause of autism. Some of this may be because of the nature of the diagnosis. Autism is diagnosed by its symptoms. It is possible (even probable) that there are many causes of the symptoms we have put together and labeled “autism.” We know that one cause of autism is Tuberous Sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis. However, people born with Tuberous Sclerosis make up a small fraction of people with autism. At the end of the day, love your son. For who he is and will become. Get to know him and try to meet him where he exists. He will have a hard time meeting you and your perspective. Support him, help him learn in his way how to make him more successful and less stressed by a world designed by and for people that are different than he is.

You will see these same sorts of individuals in all sorts of spaces, though. Men who never mature to the point of being able to apply critical thought. Women of this sort exist as well, but not often in what one would call masculine spaces, such as video gaming. In both cases, their ego relies on being pampered in an environment where they can easily perform well. Or at least, easily not suck at what they’re trying to do.

Your brain tries to make some kind of sense of the limited sensory input like the sounds of the machines keeping you alive, the sensations in your body, the voices you hear... At the beginning I think the coma was not complete -- I felt my first emergency operation. I was in blue-white searing pain. I felt the knives slice through my flesh and every scrape of the scalpels as they slowly cut away my muscles and tissue. I had necrotizing fasciitis. Otherwise known as flesh eating disease. I screamed and screamed but nobody could hear me. During the coma I could hear voices and was trying to make sense of what they were saying. Their words often entered my dreams. My husband kept telling me ""you're fine, you're fine"" but I knew even through the coma that he was lying. I had terrifying repetitive dreams from which I couldn't escape, couldn't wake up from, couldn't make sense of... I thought Obama was assassinated, North Korea had blown up the moon and the entire western world was encased in a tomb-like cruise ship by muslim extremists. I thought my husband had run off with another woman, took our child with him and that he wanted to kill me. (Meanwhile the poor angel was camping out in intensive care for 3 weeks by my side constantly). The best thing that ever happened during my coma was when a Dr said, ""Mme. Lang, you are in a hospital. Your dream is not real. You are in intensive care."" This strong male voice that made sense was the single fragile thread of hope that I clung to in my Alice-in-wonderland hell. If you're ever by the bedside of a loved one in a coma, talk to them. They hear you. Tell them you love them, that you're going to stay with them and explain that they're in hospital. Give them hope. Edit (Feb 2020): Thank you for all the kind-hearted comments and upvotes! I never expected to share this story but feel much better having done so. I felt so alone with it before. I had very intense PTSD after this experience, which is why I couldn’t revisit this answer for a long time. But Llfe has vastly improved now. Many people have commented that there are different types of comas. Mine was induced, which could explain the nightmarishness. I hope to God none of you ever have to go through it. Blessings to all.

After a major operation my body couldn't handle the stress and I slipped into a coma. It was nice at first. All these beautiful repressed memories that the brain was showing me in first person, but I found out I can switch to third person on my will. So I got up and started roaming the memories which began in a chronological order from my birth. So in third person I saw my own birth, my first day at school, my first spoken word, things which I normally didn't remember. Everything was okay at first but then the order of the events reached my accident (because of which I had to undergo a major surgery), the brain went into an infinite loop. It started showing me what happened during those exact two seconds when I took the impact of the vehicle on me. Although at that time I had a blackout, the brain and eyes were recording it seems. And it didn't just show me what was happening, it started generating the exact amount of pain I felt when I was hit by the vehicle, over and over, again and again, times infinity. The third person me screamed at the first person me to stop, but the first person me didn't listen. I don't know how many times I was hit by the vehicle in the dream and how many times I felt the pain, eventually I got tired from fighting all the battles with my own brain and got tired of being hit by the vehicle and just accepted my fate, because everything was so painful.  I decided this time when the vehicle hits me, I would fall down and never get back up (as the brain was making me get back up) and would sleep. And I succeeded in falling asleep. What saved me was a dream of ""falling"" that I had in third person which had enough strength to shake the first person up which stopped the infinite loop and woke up the actual me in the hospital bed. A coma is not a nice experience. Your mind holds you hostage while it acts like a suicide bomber. If you try to harm it, it will explode with you and you would forever lose yourself within yourself. It is as if you are a three-dimensional being surrounded by dreams that are of five-dimensions. How will get out? You cannot. Only in the rarest chances you get out. The most weird thing is that your perception of time is gone. What felt like years of unending pain, was actually for 2 days in the real world.

According to the Police investigation, the car was doing 60mph when it lost control and it went broadside into a 4x4 which was doing 50mph. The collision made a Nissan X-Trail shaped impression in the passenger side of my little Peugeot 106 and the impact twisted the passenger seat - in which was sat one of my best friends - almost 90 degrees. We had just fuelled up for a drive to our nearest city when our vehicles collided on a country road, mine thrown over a bank and coming to rest in a field. The hot exhaust pipe pierced the petrol tank and highly flammable fuel was leaking everywhere. It must have been particularly difficult for the rescuers when using the Jaws of Life to cut us both out. The local Air Ambulance was on staff changeover at the time so a nearby RAF Search and Rescue Sea King and a Police helicopter were dispatched to transport us both individually. We were both in a critical condition at this time and were airlifted to hospital as fast as possible. The medical professionals were waiting for us when we arrived and rushed us through to ITU. I don't remember any of this, it’s just what I've been told. When the assessment started I was doing one thing which meant I had a chance of survival so was Blue Lighted to a specialist hospital—with one free bed—about an hour away. My friend, however, was too badly injured and was pronounced dead a number of hours later. Mum had the difficult task of breaking this to me shortly after we both burst into tears upon my recognition of her some weeks thereafter. The consultants had warned my parents to prepare for their son as being unable to walk, talk, or even identify them again and had been advised to withhold any details about my friend until I had asked. Mum and I spent several days following this in an oscillating state of anxiety, pain, fear, and confusion. I would often drift in and out of the room, essentially undergoing a reset and would have to be reminded of where I was and what had happened each time I regained consciousness. It must have been so hard for Mum. Once inside the specialist hospital, I was plugged into a life support machine which is where I stayed, unconscious, for six weeks. Obviously, your question is going to receive different answers as everyone has had different experiences which are true to themselves, but I remember two things from being in a coma: 1) The moment the medical professionals had to usher my parents out of the room due to the fact they thought they were going to lose me, I remember looking down on myself. There were several people working around my bed but it was completely peaceful where I was. I think I recall someone using the word, ""bliss"", in a previous answer and I can't think of a better word to describe it. Time became an irrelevant concept - it just didn't matter anymore. There was no pressure from anything; no obligation to do anything or be anywhere. I was one-step removed from everyday reality, just observing. I remember to my left was the most pure and nourishing white light coming from a window… I later learned that I had been given some of the most powerful drugs known to the NHS to shrink my vital organs as my brain was swelling to a dangerous degree. I am still unsure whether this contributed to the hallucinations I experienced but I feel that is a somewhat trivial thing to concern yourself with following such an experience. You become aware of the fragility of life. The beauty in simplicity. The appreciation of silence. The appreciation of space. The appreciation of relationships. The deeper connectedness. That which you once considered important becomes embarrassingly insignificant and that which you once took for granted become greatly treasured. Of course, this didn't come straight away. I got severely depressed sometime after being discharged from hospital. Nothing mattered anymore. I bounced off the walls of the house with absolutely no absolutely interest in doing anything anymore. It got to a point whereby Mum stepped in and, after gaining my consent, contacted a Neuro-Linguistic Programmer. Some weeks later, whilst sat in the room with the therapist, we established that I was blaming myself for my friend's death and, together, we relived the thoughts and emotions I had associated with the event. We thoroughly revisted the event and collected the thoughts of blame into one place—assigning a colour and a shape to them—which then travelled down my arm and out of my body. I have, of course, simplified it for the purpose of answering the question. I remember walking out of that building, looking up at the sky, and being able to breathe for the first time in a long time. Self-development and working on myself has since become an essential form of entertainment. I get so much satisfaction out of managing my condition and do so very well. I now live as mindfully as possible and meditate regularly. I understand that everyone is different but, at our core, we do share some fundamental similarities. Whilst being careful not to adopt a dogmatic approach to such an activity, I would encourage others—whether they have been through a stressful event or not—to try a similar thing. I find that mindfulness and meditation have been so effective at connecting with and grounding myself that it'd be selfish of me not to share. By sitting with yourself and your thoughts you find out who you really are as opposed to settling for who the world thinks you should be. This journey all begins by setting aside some time each day to be by yourself, sitting and watching your own breath; it really was as straightforward, and as challenging, as that. 2) Whilst in a coma I also remember my brother sitting in the corner of the room in tears. This was particularly notable due to the fact he isn't usually one to show his emotions. At this time, I had been unconscious for four to five weeks and had been transferred to ITU; my eyes would sometimes open, but behind them, “I” was nowhere to be seen. I was still on life support as my brain wasn't even working enough to instruct my body to breathe. It's interesting to think that something must have been online—however temporarily—for me to remember the event of my brother crying, though… I am still in recovery 12-and-a-half years later (as of the original edit dated 30 Nov 2015) and experience an unreliable short-term memory; an emotional memory that more than makes up for this lack of cognitive function; balance issues; a poor gait; intense physical pain that often occurs in my hip, knee, and foot; emotional lability; delayed cognition and, more notably, a high level of fatigue. I find I can't deal with too much stimulus post head injury and often crave silence and simplicity. Regardless of all of this, I do feel lucky to have been that close to death and lived to tell the tale. There are many things I have lost from going through the above experience but also a great many I have gained. If my friend was here now he would very likely welcome the attitude. He was a true one-of-a-kind always on the hunt for adventure, be that with cars, motorbikes, the ladies, dodgy electronics or even the occasional recreational substance. If there was something going on, he would often have an involvement. He was great fun to be around. Depression does creep up on me from time to time and I occasionally get overwhelmed to the point whereby I feel as if there is a universe of thought inside my head which I have been forced to navigate around in a beaten-up old spaceship that's running low on fuel, but I am learning these are the moments whereby I need to stop and listen to myself. These are the moments whereby I need to stop sludging through whatever it is I'm wrestling with and get in touch with who I am again. Not my thoughts, not my emotions, but with myself. These are the moments whereby I need to stop and identify whether I am being swept away in the flow of someone else's life and, if so, what I need to do to correct it. These are the moments whereby I need to cultivate a growth mindset rather than continue wallowing in a fixed one. Switch from a problem-focus to a solution-focus. I have always had a tendency to value my independence but my head injury and subsequent disabilities seem to have ramped this up somewhat. I work hard to keep my vibration high and thrive on doing as much by myself as possible. My parents themselves have said that I am like I have always been but “turned up to 11.” This has been especially difficult for me, I have noticed, in long-term relationships. I give everything I have to life and work tirelessly to keep on top of myself and rectify my shortcomings. After a few months of diluting this focus and sharing these energies with someone else—by the time I realise that we are vibrating at very different frequencies and have been expending a lot of unnecessary energy explaining ourselves and largely misunderstanding where each other are coming from—I see my life stretching out before me on a set of rails that are leading further away from where I need to be. My subconscious has been wrestling with this knowledge for a lot longer than I am consciously aware but I am far too exhausted from battling with myself to do anything about it. I become a passenger in my own life, as it were, both figuratively and literally. I do now feel I have been through the above lessons enough times to have established what works for me and I am now confident in moving forwards with these learnings, a little stronger and, I would like to think, wiser. The most important relationship, I have come to realise, is the one we have with ourselves. There is no better use of our time and energy than finding out who we really are and then “organising and executing around our priorities” as Steven R. Covey puts it in The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. The whole premise of my life, I have discovered, is to leave people a little better than they were when I found them. I use the skills I have gained as a result of managing my experience to engage with others—particularly those who are under circumstances that people would usually shy away from. I truly listen to people both mindfully and non-judgementally, walking with them through whatever situations they may be facing and helping them to realise the strength and ability that already exists within. This approach often helps others realise the strength needed to get through whatever issues they may be facing already lies within and I have built up some very nourishing relationships over the years as a result. I do need to look after myself to ensure I can continue with this work, though. My auntie, who is somewhat of an oracle when it comes to juggling the human condition, once stressed the need for me to look after myself during a video call. “It's important not to just look after the world,” she said, “but to look after ourselves in the world.” I do consider myself privileged to have had an out-of-body experience at such a young age. It fundamentally changes you. I am now completely comfortable, for example, being in my own company and living my own truth, whatever that is and wherever that takes me. I am now completely comfortable stepping back and observing rather than forcing myself to keep up with the status quo. I have worked hard to give my days structure and now know exactly what works for me. We have all been programmed to head towards ideals set by others and fail to realise that, in the process of doing so, we may be getting further away from our own. When was the last time you stopped to consider this? When was the last time you stopped to think about what you genuinely wanted from life as opposed to that which is fed to you by the status quo? There is so much to absorb if we slow down and pay attention but we are only interested in pushing our realities away; only interested in doing whatever we can to keep up with others and pacify the monkey that is chattering away in our heads; only interested in continuing to gather layers of thought that build up in our minds preventing us from connecting with our true selves. We pull out our phones, turn on the TV, open a book, put on the headphones—anything to avoid having to sit with ourselves. But this is exactly where we will find our answers. We continually want for more even though we never find ourselves satisfied. Doesn’t that in itself tell you something? The Zen philosopher Alan Watts put it beautifully when he said those who think all the time have nothing to think about except thoughts so they lose touch with reality and live in a world of illusion. Just for a second, stop whatever you're doing and get comfortable. A zazen cushion works particularly well for this. But if you haven’t got one, simply sit on the floor, the edge of the sofa, or the chair you are currently on. Now notice your breathing. Really watch it. There is nothing else for you to do. Watch your breath as it comes in and again as it goes out. Don't think about anything else but the breath. Be aware of your lungs filling; the oxygen in your blood being refreshed; your cells in your body coming alive. Count to yourself as you inhale and again as you exhale if that makes it easier. Thoughts will arise but no one thought or emotion is any better than the next with this practice. The key thing here is to spend time sitting with whatever is there and breathing into it instead of feeling as if you need to distract yourself from it. The benefit of this practice begins with focusing on how we deal with these interruptions. You are more than whatever you are thinking right now. You are more than what you are feeling right now. At your deepest level, you are the one that is aware of it all… Keep sitting and breathing until you clear yourself of adjectives, nouns, verbs, and anything else which separates you from your direct experience. Sit with these thoughts; these emotions; these desires. Observe as they change at the drop of a hat. I’m hungry! I'm tired! I'm bored! This hurts! Observe as they try to pull you this way and that. Get up! Why are you wasting your time sitting here when you could be up doing something?! Keep sitting until you become deeply aware these words that are flying around are only labels to describe the quality of your experience. Sit and observe as your mind sits there orchestrating the quality of your life. Recognise and acknowledge these thoughts as merely thoughts before returning your focus back to the breath. Do this time and time again. You are more than what you’re thinking and are more than what you’re feeling. You are the vast awareness that lies behind all of this. You are pure consciousness: the intellect of the universe. This really is the most beautifully simple exercise that, with some commitment, can yield the most wonderful results. Sometimes sitting will be hard and at other times it will be easy. Sometimes it will be scary and uncomfortable, sometimes it will be blissful and relaxing. Remain open to whatever arises and simply return your attention to the breath. Do it time and time again. Remember, you are more than your thoughts. You are more than your emotions. You are more than your sadness. You are more than your fears. You are more than your anxieties and more than your depression. The very nature of feeling these feelings suggests that you are not present. With practice and patience, you may find your mind beginning to rest, just like ripples upon a lake. It really is the most wonderful feeling. In a modern translation of the Majjhima Nikāya (Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha), breathing practice is written as follows — Find a place where you are alone. Train yourself in the following way: When you breathe in, experience breathing in. When you breathe out, be fully conscious that you are breathing out. If you cherish and practice this, it will bear great fruit. Whatever you are doing and wherever you are, you will find steadiness, calm, and concentration if you become conscious of your breathing. It's important to understand that your mind will wander when you start doing this, but you're not doing anything wrong. It's what our minds are designed to do. It is one of the reasons we, as a race, have managed to put man on the moon. It is one of the reasons we, as a race, can engineer magnificent bridges and dams in an effort to improve our human experience. It is one of the reasons we, as a race, can start vaccinating people from scratch a matter of months after discovering a new virus. It becomes far more important how we react to these thoughts, these desires, these emotions. Your wandering mind is not the problem. Your addiction to it, is. If visualisation helps, you may wish to start the exercise by imagining yourself sat on the banks of a river watching your thoughts come and go with the flow of water, or as clouds drifting in the sky overhead. Just focus on breathing in, and breathing out. Again, you are not your thoughts. You are not your feelings. You are, in fact, the vast awareness behind it all. You are the consciousness of the universe. To quote the Zen practitioner, Steve Hagen: “There is nothing to prove, nothing to figure out, nothing to get, nothing to understand. When we finally stop explaining everything to ourselves, we may discover that in silence, complete understanding is already there.” Now, I sure as hell don’t claim to have all the answers but what I do know is that my life has improved in ways I couldn't have possibly imagined since seriously committing myself to the above process. So much so, in fact, I’ve written this with a view to it becoming part of someone else’s roadmap to inner healing. Through this practice, I realised that whatever I believed, whatever I was thinking—whatever story I was telling myself—was the root cause of all my suffering. Whatever I was thinking separated me from, and closed me off to, how I experienced the world. That little voice in my head, however necessary it may have been to engage with day-to-day life was, in fact, preventing me from engaging with day-to-day life. After some commitment, I realised a great freedom. I remember sitting on the zafu one day and the brackets of my mind just falling away. Whatever limitations were keeping me held under the impression I was separate from everything else just disappeared; they ceased to exist. My shoulders dropped, my head rolled back, and I started laughing. To this day, it is one of the most profound things I’ve experienced. I then began paying attention to things differently. I began paying attention to things as they were as opposed to what they appeared to be having passed through my mind’s filter. I became aware of the beauty in everything, from the limitless expanse of the sky to the microscopic details of a tree. In that brief moment on the zafu, I discovered true, lasting contentment. I discovered true, lasting peace. I became aware that everything is connected on a level that I still haven’t found the right words to describe, even after all these years. I discovered absolute love. I discovered absolute compassion. I discovered absolute truth. I truly believe I transcended myself and, in the process, realised I already had all the answers I had been looking for. The truth is already within you and it is silent. You are already spiritually perfect. This practice does require that you revisit it over and over with a certain openness and curiosity rather than simply sitting to force an outcome, but with practice and patience, you may well be thankful that you reached this point in your internetting. Or perhaps you won't. Who am I to tell you? At the end of the day, I'm just another idiot airing their opinion on the internet.",2021-03-05T12:17:48.282Z,"What does it feel like to be in a coma?

Giant marketing organizations are not totally subject to their own channel for content distribution. They pay a decent amount to the channels who as of now have a fan base. This should be possible with straightforward advances. To make money through Youtube, you can approach some company which sells products from your niche. They shall pay you a decent amount basis your audience size and the views you offer. This sum can be anything from $1 to $10 for each view through.Direct Promotion: Broadly utilized as sponsorship. The publicizing organization adds to your revenue by paying you a settled sum for their coordinated effort with your channel. It is slightly different from affiliate marketing. Here you should demonstrate a depiction of their items into your video. In return, they will pay you a certain sum which can shift from $100 to more or less contingent upon your audience size.Crowdfunding: There are numerous crowdfunding sites like patreon that give you an option to accept donation or tips in return you keep your promise to create content. You can provide free information to anybody and approach them for some help.Thanks. YouTube monetization is fairly straightforward. Companies create advertisements that get placed at the beginning of your videos. These are called pre-roll ads. Each time a viewer watches an ad all the way through, you get paid.

Actions speak louder than words. What are successful business owners doing? Are they writing blogs? Are they recording podcasts? Are they creating new smart home products? If you want to be like these successful business owners, watch what they are doing, not what they are saying.  The next step to starting your business is to decide which of these models listed above you want to be like. Which one would you want to own? Which one would you be able to offer something similar, but with your own unique positioning? It can be intimidating when you’re first starting out to think that you can’t possibly create something as great as the 10 businesses above, but they all started where you are now. Think about it: success doesn’t just happen overnight, and neither does failure. The everyday decisions you make all accumulate to success or disaster. So I challenge you—get started! The first step you need to take is to decide. Decide which business model do you want to model after, and brainstorm how you are going to position yourself differently.

I will justify my answer below. Let's assume a few scenarios where I will justify my above statement. Let's take a look at Flipkart. One of the greatest disadvantages is that you can only order through their app which troubles by showing some crap discounts notification so and so. You decide to order something and checkout successfully. You get the product delivered to you and pay for the product. After unpacking the product, let's assume that the product is either defective, or you realize that it's refurbished (yeah you read it right they sell refurbished items in the name of new ), or you are not satisfied with the quality of the product. You try to get in touch with the customer care executive. You will need some amount of patience for that and after holding for 10 minutes you hear some response. After initial formalities, you state your issue and the customer care executive will look into your account and ask you if you would like to opt for a return. After placing the return request you have to wait till a minimum duration of 5 days until the product is picked up from your place then wait for the replacement, which would take another 5–10 days. Finally, you get the replaced item delivered to you and again you want to return it. Contact the customer care executive and state your issue to them and they request you to wait a few minutes to check the details and come back and say that “ Sir, I have looked into your account and found that you had purchased this item on so and so date and returned it on so and so date and since we have a 10 days replacement guarantee you will not be able to return that product . Please visit the concerned service center for further assistance. Thank you.” You hang up the call, feel like being cheated. I understand how it feels to spend your hard-earned money on something useless. Believe me, you won't anything more than that. Now let's take a look at Amazon's service. Amazon is customer friendly and doesn't command it's customer's to book only through app though it offers some benefits of booking through the app. You decide to book a product and checkout by providing your details. You will get your product delivered before the estimated time. Let's assume the same case here that you got a defective or you are not satisfied with the product. All you need to do is log in to their app and request for a call from their customers care to you and you need to clarify your issues with the product. The executive never asks for any sort of details such as order number, mobile number, etc. Verifies your details and asks you to return the product. Forgot to mention that even you can send an email to them and get a reply within no time. Guess when will the product be picked up from you, the next day (Sorry if you guessed 3-5 days) . And you will receive a confirmation of the product after it is picked up from you. Then just relax for the next 3 days and a maximum of 4 days you will get your refund back into your opted method of refund. Here's another advantage of being an Amazon customer that suppose you face any problems with the product after 30 days ( Yes again you read it right, Amazon has a 30 days replacement guarantee ). Amazon would still ask you to return your product and refund your entire amount. Another thing is if you purchase a product today and you realize that the price of the same product has been decreased just write back to the customer care about this they will return the difference of both the price in the form of a gift card back to your account within few seconds. For example, you purchased a product for ₹2500 and find that the price is decreased to ₹2300. Amazon would add a gift card of ₹200 to your account. From the above-stated scenario, I consider Amazon better than Flipkart. P.S. If you find a product whose price has gone extremely low please avoid purchasing it. That could be a refurbished item. Though you can rely upon some extent on Amazon. I would prefer better stay away from all the hassles. The above stated are from my personal experience. I am not associated in any form with Amazon, I wish I could join the firm someday. I have hurt anyone's feeling's then please state the reason for being hurt in the comments. And I'm sorry for making it long but I couldn't resist myself from expressing it. -THANKS Till now I have had a number of experiences, all in favor of one of these brands. I’ll mention one of the experiences I had with both Amazon and Flipkart. Amazon Experience It was sale period on Amazon and I was looking for new headphones. And after a bit of survey I found Skullcandy S5GRHT-448 Grind 2.0 for a price of Rs 2000 ( MRP was around Rs 4500).

And after a bit of survey I found Skullcandy S5GRHT-448 Grind 2.0 for a price of Rs 2000 ( MRP was around Rs 4500).  It got delivered in a couple of days but when I used it, I realized that it’s pause/play button wasn’t working as expected. And so I contacted the customer care and told them about the issue. *Without any further questions* , they issued a replacement. And when the new headphones arrived, I noticed that flaps of the box were not properly glued and it seemed as if it had been opened before and re-glued. The headset was working fine but I just didn’t want to take any risk. So yet again, I contacted Amazon customer care. This time the customer care told me that the product was no longer available at the same seller. *Without any further questions*, they were ready to offer me a full refund. And once they give me the refund, I could order from some other seller. To this I told them how I really needed a new headset and now the price had increased to Rs 2500 (which was Rs 2000 in sale) as the sale had ended. *Without any further questions*, they added Rs 500 as Amazon Pay balance in my account so that I could buy the headphones from some other seller.  And I was just so surprised that is Amazon seriously giving me 500 bucks *on pure trust* that I would go for the same headphones and not some other product now? Well keeping their trust, I did order the same headphones and were worth the money! Flipkart Experience I was a fresher in college so I had bought a kettle for my room. And for that kettle, I ordered a Prestige wooden spatula of Rs 200.  I received the product in a couple of days and when I opened the package, I simply initiated a *replacement* (and not a refund) on the same day. The next day, I received a call from Flipkart executive asking me a whole lot of questions and demanding reasons behind me initiating a replacement for the spatula. I literally had to convince him of me not being guilty of the broken spatula. They issued the replacement but that interrogation call really pissed me off.  At one place where Amazon asks me nothing even when I am returning an expensive product multiple times, Flipkart asks multiple questions just for the replacement of a not so expensive product.  This was just one of the experiences. There are many more reasons for Amazon being way better than Flipkart like: Amazon Prime serviceBetter search resultsBetter customer support and servicesBetter offers and discountsAmazon Pay cashback ( I literally have got hundreds of rupees back :D)New contests in every couple of daysActs as a customer’s company and not just a business company and many others…Conclusion: Even though Amazon entered the Indian market a bit late, it has surpassed Flipkart in the quality of services and products. PS: My dad soon got me *Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Headphones* :p Nope. It can never be better than Amazon. Here's why... Because they don't give a sh*t about you or your orders.I have talked with around 20 customer care executives and their seniors in the past week and one can easily understand the core culture of flipkart is to push away/eliminate the problem and not solve it unlike Amazon where the customer is the priority.

Because they don't give a sh*t about you or your orders.I have talked with around 20 customer care executives and their seniors in the past week and one can easily understand the core culture of flipkart is to push away/eliminate the problem and not solve it unlike Amazon where the customer is the priority. I am a victim of one such scam by flipkart. I had ordered a laptop Lenovo Ideapad 330 Ryzen 5 4gb Ram variant ( Order Id- OD11373492478543300) on 26th Oct18 for ₹27,990.  I ordered it bcoz I was selected for an internship at a startup and a laptop was a compulsory requirement. So my misfortune started from here, the expected delivery date was of 28th Oct(sunday) and nobody came on that day. On 29th Oct(monday) morning I got an sms that my product was out for delivery... I immediately contacted the customer service and scheduled the delivery on Nov 1st so that I can get the product myself as it was a holiday date. But the wishmaster without any intimation just called me on 31st Oct that he is standing at my doorstep,  as I was in office I couldn't possibly take the product and explained the same to him. So again on Nov 1st no sms, mail, no delivery from flipkart. I called them up on Nov 2nd regarding this and they gave me a promise date - 6th Nov,and told my product will definitely be delivered on or before Nov 6th. I called them up for next two days(3rd,4th Nov) hoping I could get the product earlier as it was required for my work. But got the same thing repeated again and again. All of them assured me one thing, that my product would be delivered on or before 6th Nov and I also got an email, sms conformation regarding the same. And I waited and waited for 6th, and suddenly on 4th Nov these guys changed my promise date to 8th Nov without any prior notice and sent me an sms regarding the same afterwards .  I again contacted the customer service for 2 days and the same damn thing was told by every executive that my product will be delivered on or before 8th and they don't have the authority to change anything. I thought maybe as this order is a COD(cash on delivery) they aren't caring and tried to make online payment through debit card which failed without reason.  So anyways thought I will take it by COD only. And once again waited for 8th, and today they are telling me to cancel the order as there has been an delay from courier service due operations failure or something. I was completely devastated and reached out to them and after being put on hold for nearly 20mins twice I was connected to a senior manager named Ms Neha and she told me to pick my product from the courier service office by myself.  I was quite relieved that my problem was finally solved and reached the courier office which was 7kms away from my house only to find out it was closed for the past 6 months from the owner. Later I realized that flipkart had fooled me just to extend this further or end it completely. This was very hard for me, because after all the troubles, phone calls, commuting there was no result. I was told to cancel my order which was the only option left according to them. And was told I wouldn't be getting any discount on the product if I would be reordering and which was now priced at nearly ₹35,000.  During these 10 days I was highly stressed,manipulated,mentally harassed by flipkart. No, I am not exaggerating at all. I have all the relevant proof(sms,mail,recordings,screenshots etc) required. And they didn't even care that my 10 days were wasted waiting for the product. I hope and wish no one would have to go through what I experienced in the future. My friends have advised me to give a complaint in Consumer Court. And right now I am planning for it. I have written this in a hurry and i am willing to provide any clarification required. Edit : Got the laptop on 10/11/18 (Saturday).  Was busy hence couldn't update it till now. I guess as this post got decent no of views,it might have reached flipkart and that might have been the reason for this. Glad that atleast I got the laptop.",2021-03-05T12:21:51.067Z,"Is Flipkart better than Amazon in India? ",Quora

Turn on the VHS machine before you open the program on the computer or it may have trouble seeing the video, the sound or both. You have to be there at the end to stop the recording or it will continue recording after the end of the movie. The instructions are really bad so go through them carefully. if recording to the drive, you pretty much just tell it were to put the files, start the recorder and press record on the computer program. I suggest recording to a named folder or if recording multiple movies, they might record over the first movie. ——— If you are recording to a DVD, you have change a couple settings. PLACE THE DVD IN THE DRIVE Make sure the program has found the DVD drive under the QUALITY setting, this determines how much time you have on your disk, you chose from Best, Good, Normal, and average. (this is basically a speed selection, Best is fast, and it works down to average, which would be slow. The slower the speed, the more time on the DVD, however, slow speed may interpret as not as clear a picture as you may like.) If you pick the wrong one and it checks the disk, it will tell you if there is enough room for the recording or not. I find NORMAL pretty much records all the movies. then under RECORDING DURATION TIME, you have to put how long the movie is by time. If you put the time in too short, it will cut off the movie so you need to get this right. Then down by RECORDING AND BURNING, check that box Start the vhs play back and on the computer program, hit RECORD. Make backups of your recording so you don’t lose it. Those VHS tapes can’t have a lot of life left in them. This also works for NON PROTECTED DVD recordings also. Good luck There are a couple of steps involved. First you need to use a software application that will take your VHS Recording and essentially create a Digitized Copy. I have used Dazzle and found it to be easy and has many different types of formats (such as MP3) that you can save your digitized files. Another is Roxio, and a Google Search will turn up even more.

But you do want to play the File to make sure it meets your satisfaction and requirements. Once you have a File Folder of Recordings you can store that folder on any of the Various Cloud Services. If your using Windows they Offer “One Drive”, there is also Google Drive, DropBox, and Many Others. You could even open an Amazon Storage Volume for a Very Reasonable Price if you want to become familiar with their Services. The cloud service is nice, because it allows you to download a file easily to your Smart Cell Phone or Tablet for Playback, anywhere.

I've seen lots of garbage gaming PCs over the years with cheap power supplies, bargain basement system boards and all manner of cut corners that result in a system lasting 1-2 years before suffering a failure. A good gaming PC will stay relevant in AAA titles for 3-5 years (I generally set expectations at 4 years, but getting 5 isn't uncommon for some performance targets) without suffering a failure.* Gaming PCs are expensive and to be worth while, they need to last for a while.*Note, failures happen even to the best of systems at a relatively low rate. There is, however, a significant difference in failure rate between ""good"" gaming PCs and cheap ones.  Quality and attention to detail are the things that separate a generic gaming PC from a good gaming PC. Quality costs, but over the life of the system, there's just no substitute for doing it right from the very beginning.

You need to have creativity—a way with words and excellent communication skills as you will be required to explain and inform, about the most complex of issues, in the simplest of terms—to a large number of people. Moreover, you require great deal of patience, because in this field, it takes a lot of hard work, and quite some time, to make it to the top. Introduction The world has witnessed a phenomenal and unprecedented explosion in communication technology and media. All boundaries have been transcended, and the entire global community seems to have been brought together into one unified whole. And it is here that mass-communication, as a stream of study, and as a career, becomes so important and enviable. Mass Communication is not limited to journalism alone. To a great extent mass media is a modern reality which covers all aspects of human life. Moreover, a great change can be observed in the concept of people working in mass media. Careers in Mass Communication are not only high paying but also bring in a great deal of job satisfaction and expression of creativity. Step-by-Step Not long ago, people with good communication skills and a degree in literature were considered fit for journalism and other areas of mass communication. However, with technology playing greater role in our lives, all professions related to mass communication now require skilled professionals who work fast and efficiently send across the message to a whole range of audience. Even though with the proliferation of blogs, it is commonly claimed that ‘anyone’ can become a journalist, a closer inspection of reality proves that only those with professional training make the grade. Start Early Unlike engineering or medical streams there are no preparation strategies or set formulae for making a career in mass communication. A graduate degree in the field is good to start with but a post graduate degree or diploma is almost essential to be considered for responsible positions in any organisation. Meanwhile, you need to start blogging or work as a freelance contributor to newspapers and a host of online publishing sites to develop your communication skills. Maturity, objectivity and a sensible train of thought are essential. What would it Cost Me? Courses in mass communication are expensive as tuition fees and charges and expenses for doing projects, internships, and field work are quite high. Most of the institutes offering under graduate courses charge anywhere from Rs 60,000 to Rs 2, 00,000 per year. It means you will have to pay nearly three lakhs for a course of three years duration. Similarly, a PG diploma course from Indian Institute of Mass Communication can cost in the range of Rs 40,000 to Rs 1,00,000 for one year. PG course in Mass Communication from MCRC at Jamia Millia Islamia can cost around one lakh for two years. Funding/Scholarship IIMC offers scholarship for candidates in each branch i.e. print media English and Hindi and Electronic Media which is almost half of the fees – for first two toppers. Several other memorial scholarships at the institute are based on merit. Other mass communication institutes too provide merit based freeships and scholarships. Education loans are available from nationalised banks such as Allahabad Bank and Punjab National Bank wherein a student can seek a loan up to Rs 7.5 lakhs at low interest rates. Job Prospects A professional course in mass communication opens doors for a career in films & TV, publishing, public relations, journalism, editing, direction, filmmaking, scriptwriting, production, etc. In nutshell, Mass Communication widens up the horizon of career options for a person. Depending upon personal interest and inclination a mass communication professional can choose a job. Attractive and high paying jobs as journalist, actor, director, editor, screenwriter, RJ, producer, VJ are available to the talented and trained individuals. Pay Packet Whereas candidates passing out from IIMC, MCRC Jamia, Symbiosis College and many other institutes receive attractive placement after their courses and handsome salaries, students from not-so-well- known institutes have to work hard to get placed. Starting salary for a mass communication professional could be between Rs 12,000 and 25,000. After 5 Years of work experience a professional can expect higher salary in the range of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1,00,000 per month. Demand and Supply Demand and supply plays a crucial role in careers of mass communication professionals. The global recession had cost many high profile journalists their jobs and the graduates of these turbulent times found it extremely hard to get placed. On the contrary, there is a dearth of trained professionals in mass media, new entertainment and news channels and with new launches in the pipeline the demand will only shoot up. Opening up of media sector for foreign investment is expected to create new jobs in the field. Market Watch Career opportunities in mass communication are expected to increase as not less than 70 news channels will come up in next five years. Thanks to mass media, news and entertainment job opportunities are aplenty for trained professionals in various roles - particularly in journalism and films. India being the largest producer of films in the world has ample opportunities. Technically qualified media professionals can work for TV channels, production houses or can make documentaries on their own. International Focus News Corporation of Rupert Murdoch, Disney Entertainment, Warner Brothers, CNBC, Guardian Group, BBC, ABC and many others are included among the large media groups which offer attractive jobs in mass communication at different levels and positions. In fact jobs in these organisations are attractive in terms of compensation and offer challenging job profiles. Indian professionals have an edge to work in international media houses for they have excellent command over English language. Positives/Negatives Like any career option, mass communication too has positive features as well as a flip side.A career in mass communication requires commitment, dedication and sacrifice of personal time for the sake of staying on front or top, particularly in news industry. A journalist may have to work day in and day out to get breaking news. Similarly, media professionals who are in entertainment or film making need to work with passion which may come at the cost of their personal life.However, in a nutshell, mass communication as a career provides job satisfaction, name and fame and a challenge to live with. Different Roles,Different Names Following are the various job profiles offered to graduates in mass communication: Fashion PhotographerFilm DirectorTV CorrespondentProducerRadio Jockey/ RJScreenwriterSound EngineerSound Mixer and Sound RecordistSpecial CorrespondentVideo JockeyArt DirectorEditorEvent managerPublic Relations OfficerTips for Getting Hired Besides pursuing a course from a mass communication institute, a candidate is required to possess certain skills or interests which help him get a job. Candidates who are interested to get into news media should have keen interest and sound knowledge of news and current affairs. Global perspective on various issues helps candidates in obtaining the position of reporter or journalist. Similarly, those who are interested in electronic media are required to have practical knowledge on video editing. Most of the mass media training institutes offer internship programs with news channels or entertainment channels which help candidates get a job after completion of the course. Pro Advice Before you end up enrolling for a long course, take a short one month course with an institute to see how much it interest to you and will you be able to take this up as a full time career or not. Begin with learning Content Writing Master Course, recommended place to learn is IIM SKILLS Institute. Upvote if this helps. The mass communication industry provides exciting and well-paying job opportunities in ad agencies, print media (newspapers, magazines, and journals), broadcasting media (radio), visual media (television) and the internet of late.

Delicious real mozzarella, fantastic toppings, peperoncini, and a special cup of garlic butter dipping sauce for the crust, so you could eat it just like breadsticks. It was heaven.

Every weekend, all of the local pizzerias would do a Friday advertising push to win as much of the student weekend pizza dollar as possible. That meant a LOT of coupons, and every student got to pick their favorite weekend study treat. One Thursday, the Domino’s marketing team was in a nasty funk, and decided to play dirty. In that Friday’s student paper, they placed this ad… Bring us 30 competitors’ coupons, and get a FREE PIZZA! Oooooh…. nasty, eh? Poor Papa John’s was getting no business this weekend… Except that, one of the students at the school newspaper happened to love Papa John’s, and mentioned the Domino’s ad order to a friend who worked there. Papa John’s thought for a minute, and then placed their own weekly ad. That Friday’s edition saw two massive ads, running side-by-side. The Domino’s ad… Bring us 30 competitors’ coupons, and get a FREE PIZZA! And the Papa John’s ad… Thank you to all of our wonderful customers! Here are 30 Papa John’s coupons for you to enjoy.Because everyone deserves a pizza. Students flooded the Domino’s, newspaper in hand, demanding their FREE pizzas. Domino’s had to close its doors for the weekend after completely running out of product. … while losing a pile of money. … and a fair bit of pride.

If it’s any more involved than that, even if only to open envelopes to fish out the checks and write up a deposit slip before driving by the bank, you’ve lost your shot at perfection. But, if the perfect business ever existed, I never heard of it. What comes closest? My corporate attorneys once asked me to comment on the business plan of a prospective client. A: Hospitals and medical facilities would pay him to pick up medical waste. B: The waste, which he now owns at a profit, would be sorted with much incinerated (as usual) but with disposable medical devices set aside. C: The devices (catheters, intubation tubes and such) would go through a radiation bath. Less than one cent per item and they are clean and sterile. D: The items are repackaged and sold into non-first-world markets at eighty cents on the dollar versus their cost new. I told my attorneys the plan was pure genius. He’s already money ahead once he’s rounded up his raw materials. Why charge eighty percent of original price when he’s already money ahead? No doubt he calculated supply volume and figured out that would be the pricing level that would yield an adequate supply of stock on hand. Selling goods that you made money to own comes close to perfection. That’s been three decades ago. I never heard of such a business in reality. Guess it, like many genius plans, was crushed by regulation. I’ve used my window-washer experience several times here on Quora. It’s a genius plan too that anyone, anyone can use for a quick infusion of money even if you are flat broke. A: Show up at a store with dirty windows and ask if you can wash them. B: If yes, ask to be fronted the money for the small bit of equipment and supplies you’ll need. C: As you get money ahead, add employees, fully equipped, to wash the windows of your client stores while you focus on customer relations (picking up the payment). You’ll notice that business plan is one full step shorter. Also, stores pay for window washing out of petty cash… you don’t even need a bank account! No one has any record that you are even making money, a fact that has certain upside ramifications depending on how you want to play it. (Guess I need to revise my ideal of business-model perfection.) A couple of months after I first hired the guy to do my windows and fronted him the supplies, I noticed him around town in a suit contented to handle just the transactional end of his enterprise. Meanwhile, I saw not one… not two… three of his associates busily washing windows around town. Amused at the goofy little business this goofy little guy had put together, I started idly running the numbers through my head. Within a few strides, I’d lost my amusement and ground to a halt in the realization the guy was making four times as much as I was as a retail business partner with one-fourth of the headaches. And, if he had an associate in each of the shopping districts north, west and south of us, he could easily be on the receiving end of a million dollars a year… in cash! Keep it simple. If you actually have to work in your business for longer than it takes to get it up and running, bad plan. Incredible how many people settle not on a business to liberate themselves from work but a job to bury themselves in work. You may think I was being glib with my model of an impossible perfect business, but you’ll be surprised if you take the time to contrast your plan with it how much you can often pare away to make your plan simpler and less costly and complicated to run.  Okay, by popular request, one of my window washer answers: Why is it so hard for some people to make money, yet so easy for others? Sales tend to be quite an uncertain thing.

Hesitation in sales is explainable. But it’s not okay. Ambiguity makes you look neither good nor convincing. It does not bring you sales, it doesn’t get you clients. In order to make you feel better and more confident, top salespeople shared their closing sales techniques and strategies. They don’t work for each and every client but when your traditional approach fails, one of these strategies can play a crucial part in your success. Also, closing techniques and strategies are here to help you drop “maybes” and be assertive. If you get worried and your heart starts beating 140 times per minute, having some ready-to-go templates will make it easier to dive into the process. Many of the closing techniques for sales we are going to talk about were developed and practiced by leading salespeople like Larry Ellison and Erika Feidner. These folks know their stuff and they can help you get better as well.  Technique #1. Time-limited Close When to use: a perfect fit for situations when your prospect backs away with phrases like “I’d like to think it over”, “I’d like to sleep on it”. How it works: when a prospect tries to put away the decision, you bring up a limited discount, a promotion, etc. Example:  “I can understand that you want to consider everything carefully, but we have a 30% discount on this product which expires tomorrow. So, buying it today would be a great deal for you”. Tip: the time-limited sale closing techniques are only valid if you do have an ongoing discount or promotion. Lying will not make your client more eager to close the deal. On the contrary, it will just make you look like a pushy salesperson (and, as a matter of fact, no one likes to be approached by such a guy). Technique #2. The Assumptive Close When to use: it is one of the best sales closing techniques if the prospect seems to be far from making up his mind. By using the right questions and phrases, you direct them towards the closed deal. Example: you can use one of these lines: ""Would you prefer a blue or yellow purse?""""Our standard shipping will get it to you by Monday. Is it okay, or would you like to order the rush delivery?""""Will 10 units be enough to start with?""""If you sign for a year in advance, you’ll get a 10% discount.""Depending on your industry, you can come up with new phrases. For example, in the catering industry, you could go with something like “Will you be having ketchup or soy sauce with your meal?” Technique #3. The Custom Close When to use: works if you've known your prospect for a while, know their needs and wants, and have the product that can satisfy them. Example: “So, you want a wireless router with Gigabit Ethernet, detachable antennas, a traffic meter and a WPA Enterprise. Any additional features?” You wait for the customer to answer, in 99%, all of them say “no”. After you hear the answer, you say in a casual way : “Okay, then our [name of the product] is a good fit. It comes with a 1-year warranty for 399$. All I need is your signature, and I’ll have it delivered to you until the end of the day”. Keep it casual when you hand the contract to the prospect. Every hesitation here might deprive you of the success. Tip: the technique is better to be used if trust and mutual respect are already established. It’s a good fit for customers you've known for a while. Technique #4. The Question Close When to use: using questions is one of the most effective sales closing techniques to work with objections. If you see that a prospect is not quite sure about getting the product, try asking questions to find out the reason and try to change their mind. Example: ""Is the product I’m offering solving your problem?""""Can we proceed with the shipment?""""Is the delivery date okay with you?""Asking questions is a win-win move for you as well as your client: it’s both a good way to close the sale and find out whether the customer is happy with the choice (it’s important to remember about the happy long-term relationship).

The Garos have to go through immense hardships in order to build sustainable livelihoods within their culture. At the same time, it's really fascinating and awe-inspiring to read about a Garo farmer who became an entrepreneur and even took bold steps to bring about massive change within his community.  The farmer is Layland Marak from the village of Ganolgre, the Rongram C&RD Block in West Garo Hills where he is engaged in a unique business of processing and selling Aloevera products through a Chizingjang Self Help Group (SHG) named. He has brought about a radical change within his village and tremendous growth. He is praiseworthy for his tireless efforts to get his SHG to new heights. He has helped to build significant opportunities to assist his fellow members of the society so that they too can pursue their dreams. In 2006, he attended a two-day training course on Aloe Vera cultivation and processing organised by the North Eastern Region Community Resource Management Project for Upland Areas (NERCOMP) sponsored by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a two-day training programme on Aloevera cultivation and processing.The cultivation activities of Layland revolve around the crop called Aloe Vera. With the help of a self-help group named Chizingjan, he set up a business to process and sell a variety of aloe vera products , providing the villagers with an alternative source of jobs. He has also educated many farmers and finally they are setting up a new processing factory for Aloe Vera. The SHG produces numerous products that include soaps, juices, and gels.It initially received Rs. 7,00,000 in sales. But, it has risen steadily and the SHG 's profit in 2019 is Rs. 20,00,000. Layland also became the first entrepreneurs of a Garo Hills social enterprise and also helped his entire community achieve a better livelihood under the Rongram Group and Rural Development Block, but also built roads and toilets for his village through the income gained from his company.Layland has also expanded into livestock and fisheries according to Meghalaya Basin Development Authority. Unfortunately, this company has not been doing so well and the fishes have remained largely unsold. But on the other hand, his livestock company is doing well. Layland currently owns four Jersey cows, which produce between 7 and 8 litres of milk a day. He sells the milk to dairy farmers, which sell it in turn at Tura. He is giving his family a share of the proceeds.As his practical knowledge on aloe vera increased, Layland eventually became a master trainer, imparting training to other aspiring entrepreneurs who wished to start work in aloe vera. In 2012 Layland was invited to give practical training to farmers at the Senapati district of Manipur. Later that year he was invited to provide training to aloe vera farmers at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.In 2016, in partnership with the North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation Limited (NERAMAC) and the District Commerce and Industries Center, IFAD invited Layland to be part of the international trade fairs held in places such as New Delhi and Mumbai, recognised by NERAMAC as one of the state's up and coming organic farmers.",2021-03-05T12:27:23.116Z,"Who are the Indian women we should be proud of?

604223d5ed76476feda1f1e5,https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-video-produced-in-television?-,"This would depend a bit on the doctrine of the particular TV company, but usually it would be: Planningpitchcommissioningbudgetingproduction planningRealisationShootingEditingDeliveryFinalisationPR, advertising and social buzzCompressionUploadingRelease/BroadcastAny kind of broadcast TV goes through a whole cycle of concept-pitching, budgeting, planning, gathering the team and so on. Realisation depends on what you’re making. If it’s a major drama, the script was probably signed-off during planning, and compromises negotiated so that, even though your script called for Hong Kong, it could still be filmed in Bournemouth. If it’s a news piece, then the script might be being finalised up to the moment before delivery. Realisation is when the show goes from a shared idea in the mind of the director and producer to something which exists as a file (and previously on videotape) ready to be delivered to the audience. Realisation is often going to be scripting, shooting, editing, but if it’s a live broadcast there may be no script and no editing, just live cuts on the vision mixer. For network TV, delivery means broadcast. The show has to be scheduled in. PR has to go out about it. Trailers have to be shown, adverts have to be placed. If it needs closed-captioning, or subtitling, that has to be done. For the BBC, it also has to be prepped to be available as a download on iTunes moments after the live broadcast finishes. For a home video production, you have to finish off the edit, which means committing to it, compress it for your delivery mechanisms, upload it to Facebook, YouTube, or wherever else it’s going, and then do all the bits of titling and thumbnailing that your provider requires. You may need to schedule it as a premiere. If you’re doing it live, you will need to work beforehand on having your delivery and its backup mechanisms ready.  We do a weekly piece (in Dutch) of about fifteen minutes with three items introduced by a presenter. We plan ten days in advance, and spend five days writing and editing scripts and gathering visuals. We usually shoot the sections (or create, for animations) separately, and do the presenting once the other pieces are ready. Then everything gets edited together into one programme, compressed, and uploaded as a premiere and separate, shareable, segments. In terms of time taken, it’s 70% planning, 10% shooting, 10% editing and 10% delivery. When we started doing it in April, we did much less planning, and took correspondingly longer to shoot, edit and deliver. Overall, we find that planning everything cuts the shooting time down to just one or two takes. Editing one or two takes is far less time-consuming than trying to cobble together fifteen pieces, or even five. We work mainly with a teleprompter—again, more time spent planning, but dramatically less trying to stitch sections together that almost work. Making a documentary is easy. Making a good documentary is very hard. Getting a TV network to broadcast your documentary, virtually impossible. Broadcast networks used to have documentary divisions. Now they don’t because the public at large is not interested in them. Networks like Discovery and TLC only work with established production companies. Your best bet, produce your documentary. Get it into festivals. If it’s really good and you make a name for yourself, do another. Then pitch something to PBS. If that sells and you have a few that played at festivals, try to pitch it to a cable network. Good luck.",2021-03-05T12:28:05.386Z,"How is a video produced in television? ",Quora

Bad news is, you can be a film director for your entire life and still be an unknown. I know several film directors. I know one who actually makes a living doing documentaries. The rest do short films for festivals. One actually makes feature films. He never went to film school. He finds other aspiring filmmakers and uses them and their equipment. Nobody ever sees his films because he can’t get them distributed. He finances them by borrowing money from his 401K. He also has a very lucrative “regular job” and those two things help keep him churning out unwatchable dreck that he’d probably have to pay you to sit through. He doesn’t make short films as much as he makes full-length features. Two hours, or more, long. He “hires” local talent (mostly he cons people into working for free) and once they start to see him for the talentless hack he is, they usually move on or become directors themselves because they figure if he can be a director, anyone can. He’s as clueless about what audiences want to see as any studio executive in Hollywood. He uses people for anything he can get from them for as long as he can get it. Once they walk away from him, he always finds another. What he can’t get with charm, he gets by bullying and intimidation. But, he keeps on making movies. Nothing stops him. Money, friends, family and anything else are all grist for his movie making mill. Most people don’t work with him more than once, but he always finds another to replace those who won’t fall in line. Now, as bad as that might sound, if I had to bet all my money (or any money) on any of the filmmakers I know, it would be this guy. Reason? It isn’t because of his talent (or lack of…he makes Ed Wood seem like Spielberg) or his sparkling personality (I’ve seen cockroaches that are more likeable). It’s because he’s persistent. He’s been making self-financed cinematic garbage for decades now. He’s never given up. He never will until he’s room temperature. You’ve never heard of him but you will. His time is coming. I’m not looking forward to it and neither should you, but he already has the “Hollywood” mindset and it’s only a matter of time before Hollywood discovers the director it has long dreamed of. He has no talent, no scruples and not a speck of artistic integrity. He cares nothing about entertainment, being liked by audiences (or anyone else), is a total and complete sell-out and will never question a decision made by a studio executive, no matter how bone-headed it might be. He’ll make the biggest current Hollywood hack you can think of seem like Ingmar Bergman by comparison. I’ve had the chance to meet him in person several times and have purposely avoided it. I already know several people he tried to bleed dry and I don’t wish to join his long trail of victims. Lesson: If you are relentlessly, single-mindedly driven to make movies without regard to having friends, family, wives or girlfriends, and would pretty much sell your soul to become a Hollywood director, you will be successful. Like I said, you haven’t heard of this guy…yet. But trust me, you will. He will be scorned by many, except his Hollywood masters that he hasn’t met yet but he will make millions or billions of dollars and live in a house as big as a small city. It’s his destiny. He’s stepped on many to get there and he’ll step on many more before it’s over. He will not be denied…and that’s why he’ll eventually make it. How do I become a movie director if I haven't gone to film school? This… this feels like a trick question. (Looks anxiously around for traps or hidden cameras.) Um… the way you become a movie director is to start directing movies? The vast, overwhelming majority of working movie directors started off either shooting their own low-budget movies, or to a lesser extent working in a “movie-adjacent” industry (commercials, primarily.)

Sometimes I get asked to speak on panels about low-budget moviemaking. I have a schtick I like to employ. I ask, “How many of you own or have access to a personal computer?” Duh - everyone does. Then I take out my own cheap-ass Android cellphone, and ask, “How many of you own a smartphone?” Again - everyone does. “Then why the fuck aren’t you making movies?” I challenge. I get nervous laughter in return, because everyone knows I’m right. You can learn a lot about directing, and about all aspects of moviemaking, in film school. You will learn a helluva lot more about directing if you take the money you would spend on film school and just make a damn feature yourself. Yeah; it’s gonna fail. It’s not gonna make you any money, and you’re not going to win the Oscar. But if you spend four years making a movie (including directing it) then guess what? You’re now a movie director. The only question then is, are you going to make another one that’s better? If you do, you’re on your way to a career. Why aren’t you doing this…? <smile> Watch lots of films, not just the sort of films you already know you like. Watch movies you wouldn’t normally watch. Watch old movies. If you have a favorite director, go back and watch the films that inspired them. There are a lot of great youtube videos out there which can teach you basic filmmaking techniques.

Start with shorts, no one just jumps straight to something feature length. Try to learn a little bit about every aspect of filmmaking. Never think of any department as something you can just outsource to a specialist. You need a basic working knowledge of everything, sound, shooting, lighting, editing, otherwise you’ll be incapable of communicating the film’s needs to the crew. One of the biggest challenges when it comes to short films is learning to think small. It’s a lot easier to tell a story in twenty minutes than it is to tell a story in three. Then once you learn to tell a three minute story you’ll be that much better when it comes to telling a twenty minute story. This principle goes for other restrictions to. Try telling a story with no dialogue. Or a story that only takes place outside. Not only will this help you think creatively but it saves you money since you wont need sound or lighting. The former is also a great exercise to help you learn how to avoid unnecessary dialogue. Once you have some films made, take them to festivals before you put them on youtube. If you get into the right festival you might just luck out and make a connection.",2021-03-05T12:29:22.844Z,"How can I be a film director except from going to a film school? ",Quora

For most of humanities history advancements have been made when better tools are found for the job. Instead of walking we invented the wheel. Instead of 100s of monks copying texts, Gutenberg invented the printing press. The loom was invented and Jacquard invented a programmable pattern machine. Steam engines were invented so people did not have to do so much physical labour. You get the point. While there are many different discussions on computing in general, perhaps embedded chips in the body (that I find a bit scary), programming has been talked about here. I know Alan Kay has a vision to extend programming to all, and has mentioned Papert’s Logo and Apple Hypercard. Unfortunately, for the most part programming has become moribund. Actually this has been the case for quite a while, as John Backus said in his paper ‘Can Programming be Liberated from von Neumann?’ http://worrydream.com/refs/Backus-CanProgrammingBeLiberated.pdf. Backus said languages had become fat and flabby. Too many programmers think they are creating something cryptic and it should look cryptic. Part of the problem is that programming languages are thought of as being text. They are built around old text-based terminals. We now have wonderful graphical workstations – text-based terminals are a relic of the past. So are most programming languages, relics of the past. Like Bob Barton noted “Systems programmers are high priests of a low cult”. Now it seems most programmers are such cult priests. We should incorporate the ideas of Ted Nelson to programming, not think of a program as a linear document, structured to some extent as modules with primitive #include or #define text processing (an idea of Donald Knuth, picked up at Burroughs, when such things seemed a good idea). We should see concepts on a screen represented graphically* – if we need to see a definition of something in more detail, we use a hyperlink to bring that up as a pop up. Navigating the system should be easy. *I’m not talking about UML – an ugly graphical system that is so paper oriented and constrained by paper-based thinking it is more of a hindrance than it is worth. That is somewhat the vision of Xerox PARC in the 1980s. As Steve Jobs admitted “Object oriented (Smalltalk), I didn’t see that”. The structure of the program would be presented graphically. No text-based keywords or brackets to define blocks (getting rid of the arguments as to which is best). Inside the blocks could have different sublanguages based on what needs to be expressed. This could be text snippets (especially for maths formulas, etc). But text would be special and not lost in blocks of other text. They key to correctness (like Hoare reasons) is reasoning about the correctness of small bits of programming, and checks to make sure the building blocks of a system fit together. Such programming style is not ‘training wheels for beginners’ as one prominent cult has in its doctrines. These are the kinds of things used by professional programmers. Are we talking of programming for ‘professional programmers’? Not at all. Programming should be open to all – simple enough for kids. But such programming is not unsophisticated, in fact, it is sophisticated and would be the same approach used by professionals. We can use the same programming system for play, for experimentation and for building large-scale systems. But the programming community itself is very resistant to such ideas. They frequently dump on new ideas which could displace their power base and lock-in to their systems. I have expanded on these ideas in the following answer with more specifics. Ian Joyner's answer to What is the future of Programming, Which language should we lean on? There are several. One is people’s understanding of math. Math is not procedures and problem solving. It is understanding implications of assertions in a precise, logically consistent way, recognizing patterns, and being willing to explore “logical conclusions,” based on first principles. An etherial quality to it is it doesn’t just pursue implications of any and all ideas. It pursues beauty in abstractions. This is the big thing that most people miss about it, but it is essential to understanding math. There is a significant difference between understanding math as mathematicians do and the way  Continue ReadingThere are several. One is people’s understanding of math. Math is not procedures and problem solving. It is understanding implications of assertions in a precise, logically consistent way, recognizing patterns, and being willing to explore “logical conclusions,” based on first principles. An etherial quality to it is it doesn’t just pursue implications of any and all ideas. It pursues beauty in abstractions. This is the big thing that most people miss about it, but it is essential to understanding math. There is a significant difference between understanding math as mathematicians do and the way most schools teach it. Both the real and “school method” appear to be teaching the same thing, because they use the same basic assumptions, and the same symbology, but typical pedagogy does not teach the way mathematicians see the subject. Another is people’s understanding of science. Science is not about finding truth (that’s math). Science is, first of all, about modeling some object of study, but the pathway of getting there is finding out what’s false. There is “seeming truth” in science, in what has failed to be falsified, but this is always temporary. There are no eternal truths in science, because it is always seeking better models. It is understood in science that models are not reality. This is a major departure from how school science teaches them, since it is oriented to test students for “correct memory,” or in the case of science specifically, “hewing to correct knowledge.” As science understands models, they are approximations, based on ideas which have been tested, and criticized. Ideas which survive this rigorous testing are often mistaken for truth in education and society at large. The models can be quite reliable within known boundaries, but there will always be exceptions which are eventually found. That doesn’t seem true in a moment in time, until someone punches a new hole in a theory. This process should result in continual improvement in technical knowledge, where engineering practices can be refined to work with complexity of tolerances in better and better ways, making more reliable creations possible. Understanding these qualities will allow one to see where this is happening, and where it is not. A big bottleneck that has gotten even more severe as time has passed is the idea that computers are only for practical goals, and entertainment. It looks as if the computer revolution will only come when a third goal is added to this conception: popular scientific computing. This would involve using computers as representation systems that can be used to create, and communicate models between individuals in popular society, where they can be discussed in a scientific understanding of them (which is to say, testing them against observation, analytical critique, and a quality of unversality). An important factor is allowing individuals to interact with models by modifying their behaviors/rules and inputs. As I think has been demonstrated by people who understand this conception, people do not have to be professional scientists in order to get the benefits from it. Computers are mind amplifiers. So, high IQ should not be required to do this. Some tools for modeling that are approachable to a broad public are needed (a few of which are around). However, understanding of some powerful outlooks is necessary to make this happen, as well. Some successful attempts have been made in laboratory schools to make the outlooks approachable to children as young as 6 and 13 years old. Referring back to the first two bottlenecks, though, no school systems have picked up on them, on a wide scale, since they don’t fit into existing goals. Another very large bottleneck is the web, as it’s been structured. None of the modes of interaction that are standard in internet access allow for this approachable modeling and analysis activity to take place, on a widespread basis. So, it’s very difficult for anyone in the public to conceive of engaging in it, even if they had the desire to do so. Our professional/academic class is of little help in this regard, since it trusts itself a lot more than the process of science, seeing it as “baked in” to what a professional is. So, there is a lot to overcome before the revolution can be realized, but looking at it optimistically, the infrastructure that could be used for overcoming the obstacles has been around for about 20 years. Something that I think is lacking in it all is some bridges from the outlooks that are popular to the more powerful ones; creating a better learning curve.",2021-03-05T12:30:48.925Z,"What bottlenecks need to be addressed in order for the real computer revolution to happen?

My answer is not going to make you a happy soul. And I always wanted to be straight forward with answers pertaining to career moves. The current era is not the right time to get into Digital Marketing as a primary job. The reasons are many. Listed below are few critical ones: Companies who have been dependent on digital marketing have already reached that point where they dont need digital marketing anymore. Because they have already achieved that ranking or they have already achieved that many downloads or they have already obtained the brand image or they have already cracked organic reach. For eg. Flipkart will not need a digital marketer to market Flipkart as a brand or sell its products on Google and Facebook, because Flipkart has reached that level of maturity in terms of brand awareness. Ola would not need any more digital marketing for the very same reason. It would not make sense for them to hire a digital marketer and pay her the expected salary and ask her to keep the Facebook page alive.Consumer behaviour in India is changing. And there is already a decline in the affinity of people towards digital ads.Scams like data breach in Facebook have compelled the company to take very strict actions on data privacy. Hence its becoming more and more difficult for a digital marketer to reach out to a relevant audience.

My natural hair color is a rather boring mouse brown, so I darken it to the shade of deep rich coffee. I’d never go blonde, ash or any other shade. It wouldn’t suit me.

Another friend has tinted her hair red for so long that we forget she’s a natural blonde (ash blonde, if you care.) Some young women even think that grey is cool.

In the last 4 years I have evolved to be able to run successful digital strategies for who’s who in the industry. I also train students for SEO, SEM and Social Media. I managed all that without a course. However it took me a lot of reading and very minimal mentorship. Some tips I would like to highlight incase you want to make it on your own: Try getting a full time job in DM agency (not a brand), agencies don’t mind training if the resource is good and will stick around.If a full time offer is not converting, try to crack an internshipCreate as much dependency as you can while you are interning. Replacing you should be task, thats when you are offered a full time and with the salary that you deserve.Choose your agency wisely, one question you will ask is “What exact work will I be doing?”Start blog of your own, when you have a baby to feed you work harder. Best case you earn from your blog, worst case you still would be impressing recruiters with the blog.All of these pointers will ensure that you become an efficient digital marketer without a course. However if the first line of this answer does not connect to you then you should consider a course for sure. For someone with less discipline a course helps because Knowledge transfer is fastYou are more enthusiastic because you paidPeer learning (google this term if you don’t understand)One on one interaction with industry expertsYou get to network with industry expertsYou get to real insights from the #agencylife part of it.Remember there is nothing better then on the job training, you get paid to learn so your first job shouldn’t be about the money but only be about the profile and profile only.

But deep down i was really worried about the results. One side the conference is going and the other side all the candidates are worried and discussing many things like “iska hoga selection”? ( will he get selected), and few were like i haven't booked the tickets 🤣. Many of them told let's go to bar after this. I was just waiting for my turn. They made me wait for around 15 minutes but i didn't thought about the time i waited and confidently went inside and wished all the board members. It was my 14th conference so i wasn't excited or surpised to see so many officers altogether. The board president told me to have a sit. And started bombarding few questions. What if you forget your documents while coming to SSB. To which i said sir i will show my xerox of the documents. Then he said you don't have xerox also. To which i said i have the soft copy i will get it print. He said all shops are closed. Then i said i will ask my parents to send me the scan copy on my mobile. He said internet is down. Then i said sir i will sign an undertaking with your permission and get my documents speed post.He said okay FINE. So actually he was cornering me till the point i loose all my options and hope but i was giving out answers which were not irrelevant but somehow workable. Next question was what will you do after getting recommended (In my mind am i recommended?) I said sir i will call my parents and tell them later i have to motivate my juniors and many others to join the armed forces. After that he told me to leave. Then the Psychologist came with the result and straight away told chest no. 8. I was shocked like what? Everyone told it's you go get up. I got up told my name and roll no and went ahead to collect the new chest no. I was literally crying standing there and i couldn't believe that i have been recommended. It was the best thing which could happen to me and to any other aspirant in that case. I could recall all my 14 attempts standing there. Later when the officer went everyone came and congratulated me and the other candidate. So in total 2 of us got recommended. Later both of us cleared the medical as well. So finally 2 of us were ready in all terms from a total strength of 400.  ￼This is me and yes the chest no. Says 14th attempt “Trust me just hardwork” The day was 30th April 2019. The long wait was finally over. My batch of 38 candidates for SSC-Tech(53) entry was called inside the small room in the first floor of the SSB Bangalore administrative building. As we walked into the room, a rush of adrenaline ran through my body. My mind was restless. With hands sweaty and my heart pumping, I quietly occupied the last seat.

The long wait was finally over. My batch of 38 candidates for SSC-Tech(53) entry was called inside the small room in the first floor of the SSB Bangalore administrative building. As we walked into the room, a rush of adrenaline ran through my body. My mind was restless. With hands sweaty and my heart pumping, I quietly occupied the last seat. This feeling was a familiar one to me. I was conference out from Bhopal in December last year. Its always nerve wrecking when you go for the conference results because the next few minutes could totally change your life, forever. So as we settled down, in came the officer. A lieutenant colonel by rank, the officer looked ecstatic in his uniform. Since the uniform is only worn on the conference day, you don’t really get to know much about the officer himself. He stood in front of the podium and said: “ I will call out your chest numbers. Come and stand in front of me and speak out your name and date of birth. Okay. Ready” Everybody: “YES SIR!” He then took a pause for 5 seconds. Those 5 seconds felt like forever. And then he called out the first chest number: “CHEST NO.5!” I couldn’t believe it. This was my chest number. Still in a shock, I somehow shouted: “YES SIR!” And then i stood up and walked in front of him. All eyes were on me as I walked towards the podium. I stood facing him and shouted, “ABHISHEK SINGH, 18/07/1997” loudly and then he told me to stand beside him. 4 more names were called out. It was an excellent batch with 5 recommendations. And then he asked everybody else to leave. My friends came to congratulate me and we hugged each other. I wished them good luck. And then, we were handed back our phones. I switched on my phone. “Only 6% battery left” popped in a notification. I quickly tapped on my dad’s number. While the call was connecting, I had a plethora of thoughts running through my head. I had waited my entire life for this particular moment. I have always tried to be a good son, but i never did something that could make my dad so proud. My sister was the achiever in our family. She was the one being praised, always. I could also recall the days when i struggled to pass in 11th class exams. I failed to clear JEE. I couldn’t clear EAMCET. I didn’t qualify for VIT either. And the worst of all, I could never clear the NDA written, forget ssb. I remember those days very well. Those days were bad. I had lost all my confidence and there was nothing I could look up to. My future was blurry and dark. But, I never ever forgot the one lesson this time had taught me. Life rewards those who never call quits. Meanwhile, my call connected. Dad picked up the phone and said “Haan shubham, kaise ho?” He knew I was in the SSB but forgot that I had my conference that day. I said: “ Namaste Papa, Mein Recommend ho gya!” Dad: “Kya?” Me: “Papa, mei select ho gya” Dad: “Tum conference in ho gye” Me: “Haan Papa” Dad: Arey, bohot badhiya. Congratulations!” And his voice cracked. He was too emotional to say anything else. He paused for a sec, and in a sobbing voice he said “ Theek hai beta, baad mei baat karte hain”. This is what I wanted in life and god gave me the reason. I made my dad cry for a good reason. He served in the army for 30 years and retired as a honorary Subedar Major. It was his dream to be an officer. And after so many years, I had accomplished his dream. He was immensely proud and satisfied to learn about my success. I can’t express my feelings in mere words either. You have to experience it to know it. I will always cherish those days that I spent at SSB Bangalore.❤️  I’m the one taking the selfie😊 And now, wherever my parents go, they don’t forget to tell everybody about my success. I’ve never seen them more proud. I’m glad I got this oppurtunity in life. Thanks for reading. Chao✌️ Edit 1: I’m glad to recieve such a positive response from everybody.

It is important to entice the sponsors to get in touch with you. Affiliate Marketing. With the recent advancements in the field of technology, shoppers can already get what they want through several e-commerce websites. The owners of these sites are clearly in competition, which is why they provide opportunities for a podcaster (influencer) like you who can invite listeners to avail of their products and services. All you have to do is include a link to a particular site. When a customer clicks on the link and makes a purchase you will have a minimal share out from it. Build your brand. This is probably one of the most important benefits of having a podcast. You have all the chances you need to speak about your upcoming company or an existing firm, whatever works best for you. Take note that you need not engage in hard selling marketing through the episodes that you post. What is important is for you to start small until you have grown the business.

Donations allows you to gain support from early adopting and loyal fans.Later stage: sponsorship & premium contentOnce your numbers hit a certain level (depends a LOT on the niche, but 2000 for super-actionable, specific niches, or 4000+ for more general topics could be considered a rough minimum) sponsorship can start to pay some bills ($40 to $50 per thousand listeners is a decent average for two slots). And once in the groove, premium content can be a low-effort way to monetise a loyal audience.Teaching or business podcasts: sell a product or serviceUsually the most direct, and often the most proitable - create a product or service that’s relevant to your audience. Eg. a set of courses that go in-depth, a membership site that supports them, or a done-for-you service that enables them.Other methods include: crowdfunding - from the Patreon model, for episode to episode funding, to a traditional kickstarter to pre-fund a seasons based show.selling yourself - use your podcast as a showcase for your hosting and production skills, then create shows for other people or brands.Hope that helps, and for more details on each method, you can find it here - Podcast Monetisation | Which Method Is Right for Me and My Audience?

For examples: ""Use The Code ""Quora"" for 10% off your order"" Then MediaTemple pays you a set fee per use of that code. This can work well if you have a smaller but very engaged, active audience. CPM: Cost per thousand. This is most effective when you have a large audience. A sponsor pays you a set price per thousand listeners you get per month. This is a much larger risks for sponsors cause they pay you even if they don't see a huge impact from it(though they won't stick around if that happens) Often times they will do this in conjunction with a promo code to try and track the impact those ads are having. As far as implementing this the most effective way I have found is to set a part out of the show to talk about your sponsor. Ads at the very beginning and end usually dont work as well as a ""Let me talk a moment to tell you about Blah Blah"" Some will argue that this interrupts the listener experience, which it does to an extent, but it is also in your best interest to keep your sponsors happy. By placing it in the middle its not as easy for them to skip over it. Twit.tv does a good job of this method if you want an example. Those are the most common and probably the best methods atm.

The program started out well but unless you have buy-in and consistency from the management team, no program can succeed. Were I to create another program, I’d make a few changes. Our Onboarding is new and we are tweaking it thanks to feedback from new hires, managers and involved employees. We have a robust two-day Onboarding that goes beyond the usual Orientation. We’re not there to complete 20 forms and have the person start work. Training begins on Day 1. Prior to the start date, the manager is prompted to work with IT to set up the computer, job-specific programs and the phone and email, and the manager is also prompted to provide an email introduction and lunch with the new hire the first day. The new hire is welcomed by the Director of Human Resources. The HR Administrator provides an overview of benefits, goes through mandatory forms, and provides information about the company. She reviews some of the policies and turns the person over to me. I am a Corporate Trainer and Safety Specialist, and I review the remaining policies and procedures, talk about the company’s mission statement, and begin training. Training includes document reviews, slides, videos and e-training. All new hires receive training on safety, harassment policies, ergonomics, job specific and company culture and values. We go on a brief tour around the buildings and in many departments, pointing out departments, safety features, break rooms and bulletin boards. The HR team works with the person for the first 2 days in the mornings, and the afternoons are spent with the person’s supervisor. That Supervisor provides a tour of the area, introductions, assignments for the first 30 days, and explains expectations and how progress is measured. Again, this is a work in progress and we’ll make things smoother and easier as we receive feedback and automate more processes. At Greenhouse, as soon as our new hires sign their offer letter, they have access to Greenhouse Onboarding (we’re a little spoiled - we get to use our own product for this) and can start getting to know the people on their team, learning about the company - think: clubs and events - and setting up their profile so everyone else can start to get to know them too.

This means that even before they walk in the door on their first day, they know some faces, have a sense for how they’ll fit into the org, and have a few places (and people!) to go to for information. When I started at Greenhouse, one of my first projects was to build out our onboarding program. We had started the year at 45 employees, were planning to end with about 180, and were roughly halfway through the year (and headcount). ITo my happy surprise, I found that a group of rogue employees had already decided onboarding was super important, done a bunch of research, and were ready and waiting to pitch in, so “building” an onboarding program was less about starting from scratch and more about creating some structure and offering some guidance so the people who were already doing the work could do it more easily. The result: There are almost 40 (forty!) Greenhouse team members who volunteer their time to be part of onboarding each class of New Hires. The program is a mixture of discussions, activities, and lunches, and includes people from all over the company including our President and CEO. We also have a buddy program so new hires have someone to show them the ropes in their first few days and weeks. Involving so many people helps make sure that new hires have at least one familiar face in each department. It also helps our existing staff feel like they (or someone on their team) knows the faces and names of all the new people coming in. Our new hires are usually pretty anxious to jump in and get started (especially our engineers) so we’ve intentionally left their onboarding afternoons completely open to give them plenty of time to get to know their teams and get set up so they feel like they’re contributing as soon as possible. We wrap the whole thing up with two short surveys: one that asks how their first week has gone and if they’re feeling welcome and a second that asks how their first month has gone and if they’re starting to feel productive. If you’re wanting to set something up at your company (or improve what you have), I’d encourage you start by thinking about what your company needs from its onboarding program and surfacing what’s already happening. Then partner with your managers to understand their team or department onboarding needs - e.g., where are they struggling to get new hires up to speed, what do they think are the most important things for a new hire to learn. This will help you build something that meets the company-level onboarding objectives AND helps managers accomplish their department/team- onboarding objectives (hopefully there’s some overlap there anyway). Lastly, check-in regularly and often to see how things are going. Our onboarding program is something we’re pretty proud of but we’re still growing quickly and have already seen our onboarding needs shift since we started the program so being able to be agile is important too. We’ve found that it helps to encourage the onboarding teams to own their pieces of the program and iterate based on what they see working well (or not). We also use the data from our surveys to keep an eye on how things are going overall and make adjustments so we can keeping getting better over time. I hope that helps!

He almost became a part of my family and a real close friend of my father. It was the last winter I was studying under him. Three of us studied together, and every one except me had left because we had finished our syllabus already. However, my mom wanted me to continue. I was emotionally and sexually abused for 3 months before he got caught red-handed. Those were the most exhausting 3 months of my life and I still remember how shitty it was. I didn't have close friends at school, I couldn't tell my parents, because firstly nobody would have believed me and secondly, he threatened me all the time. It was 4days a week, for 3 months. After he got caught, my father asked him if he did what he did for 3 months and why he did it. He answered, “yes I did, because I liked it”. He didn't even apologize. So my father sent him away and asked him not to show his face ever or he would tell his wife and daughter about what he did. Later that same night, I overheard my parents talking about me, and I shouldn't have, because it changed my entire equation with my parents. My father asked my mother whether I was at fault, whether I led him on and my mother was quiet. So, there I was, standing behind a closed door, feeling betrayed and dejected and humiliated. I saw him several times after that, and every single time, I felt my heart stop beating and my legs were stuck to the ground and I couldn't move. I was depressed for a long time, and yes, I did try to harm myself. I didn't talk to my parents for months and when I did, one fine evening, I told them what I'd heard. They apologized and they said that they didn't mean it in the wrong way. Damage was already done. Six years have passed and I still don't trust my parents wholeheartedly. I hate my body and I hate people touching me, even if it is with love. I know they love me, I love them too. But it changed my heart completely. I still don't tell them everything, I talk very less and I don't feel safe even when I am home. I have lost my sense of security and no child should ever feel that. I love them but I lost some respect for them down the line. My mother told me once, “it happens to every girl once in her life” but she didn't understand what it felt like. The worst part was, I felt more abused seeing the lack of trust and faith my parents had for me than I felt when he was using my body. That's the most painful thing my parents did to me, unintentionally. Not both my parents, but my father specifically. But let me tell you the whole story. I had the perfect childhood. Two caring parents who were madly in love with each other, a beautiful little sister who was (and still is) my best friend, two cats and a dog. We lived in a small house in the Italian suburbs. We were not at all what you would consider ""rich"" but we were not doing bad with money either. We used to spend a lot of family time together.

But on Sundays we always web together somewhere like at the Continue ReadingNot both my parents, but my father specifically. But let me tell you the whole story. I had the perfect childhood. Two caring parents who were madly in love with each other, a beautiful little sister who was (and still is) my best friend, two cats and a dog. We lived in a small house in the Italian suburbs. We were not at all what you would consider ""rich"" but we were not doing bad with money either. We used to spend a lot of family time together. My dad worked Tue-Sat from 5 a.m. to 18.p.m. He was a butcher and had his own little shop. But on Sundays we always web together somewhere like at the beach or on the mountains. My mum didn't have a job. He helped my dad with the shop, but did not have any contract. She had previously worked in retail, but left her job at the age of 21 to follow my dad's dream. She was happy about it. We were all happy and things were going well. But then the crisis struck. Money slowly started to become less and less. When there is not much money to buy food, people turn to thing like pasta and other carbs: they cost lest and fill you up more. Meat became a ""luxury"" for most Italian family so my father began losing customers. At first, we had to give up our yearly one-week vacation. Then, as the years went by, we had to give up buying new clothes, new textbooks for school, and ultimately our house. We weren't able to pay mortgage so the bank took it and sold it to the best offerer. But most of all, we had to give up the relationship between my parents. As money became less and less, their love took the same route. They had violent fights for over three years. One night, I was 17, me and my sister couldn't take it anymore and told our parents they should just get a divorce, this had been going on for too long, they were just hurting each other. We asked our father to answer to this question as honestly as he possibly could:""Do you still love her"". And his response was what ruined my life for good. He shouted, without even thinking: ""I used to. Then you came (pointing at me). You were the biggest mistake of our life. And you too (pointing at my sister). If we didn't have you, none of this would have happened. Money ruined this marriage, but it wouldn't have if we didn't have you. We would have enough money for us two. You are what ruined our marriage. It is all your fault. And I will forever hate you for making me hate the love of my life."" He was completely crazy. My mum didn't try to stop him, she was very small framed. My dad tried to grab my sister by one arm but I put myself in front of her and he grabbed me instead. He twisted my arm so bad that he dislocated my shoulder but I couldn't stand the thought of him hurting my sister. I didn't know the strength I had until that moment: I pushed him so hard that he fell. It must have hit him only at that moment that he was doing something very wrong. He got up, exited the door and went away. My mum was in shock. I needed to get to the hospital to get my shoulder fixed, so I ringed my grandma and she took me. It was nothing bad, but I was hurting so bad in my heart for what just happened, that I cried the whole time. We went to sleep at my grandma's because we were afraid he was going to come back home and do something crazy. And we were right. That morning we found our door unlocked. Our dad had come and taken everything he could and had broken whatever he decided to leave there. He broke our glass table which was in million pieces on the floor. Put my moms clothes on the floor and pooped and peed on them. He broke my computer, cut my mattress. Wrote things like ""whore"" on my mother's wall. But worst of all, he had strangled my dog to death and put it on a plate where the table was before being shattered. - The worst part is that I can't hate him. He is now in jail for what he did, after the cops found proof. But he still gave me 14 perfect years, full of love and fun. I sometimes hate myself because I can't hate him. We are happier now, but he has never asked about nor supported me or my sister since. Sometimes I miss him. I miss the man he was before turning completely crazy. If there is one thing he has taight me is to give more value to people and less value to money, because the other way around will ruin your relationships, your passions and your life.

When I was 4 years old my mother dropped me off to live with relatives for almost a year so she could run around with her new boyfriend. At the end of that time, she came and got me to deliver me into the hands of the most evil SOB I’ve ever had the misfortune to encounter. For 11 years my mother stood by and allowed me to be tortured and abused in ways that most people can’t imagine. I’m not talking “I was beaten with a belt until I had welts” abuse. I did go through that, but there were much, much, more torturous, sadistic and twisted horrors inflicted on me than that. I won’t describe what I experienced any further than that. Some things are best left to wither and die in the past. When my sister and I were first brought into the horror of my stepfathers home, I developed this perception that it was my Mother, my sister and me against the cruelty of my stepfather. Then, when I realized that my Mom had surrendered me to this horrible abuse and wouldn’t be doing anything to help, it became my sister and me against the world. Then, when my sister began lying, blaming me for things she had done so she could escape my stepfather’s fury, I realized I was completely on my own. I even went to a teacher at school and showed him the purple, red and greenish welts striped up and down my back and nothing ever came of it. I have a distinct memory from when I was 9 or 10 when I recognized the truth of my existence. I felt this deep sinking in my heart as I realized that I was completely alone in the world. There was no one that could or would help me. My innocence died forever. No one at that age should have to feel so unwanted and brutalized. But I know I’m not the only one who has had to live like this. I’m sure there are millions going through it today. When I was sixteen I had grown to about 6 feet tall, 190 pounds, and one day when my stepfather came at me I stood my ground. There was no fight, I just stood with my fists clenched and asked him what he was going to do. The coward spun on his heel and walked away without a word. The next day my mother told me I had 3 days to get out of the house. So, my Mom allowed me to become homeless at 16. I later found out that an aunt had contacted my mother and wanted to pay for me to go to college. My stepfather said no and even though I was now out on my own, my mother never told me about my aunt’s kind offer. I wonder how my life may have been different if they had allowed my aunt to help me. The last time I saw my real father was when I was about 6 years old. My memories of him are pleasant. Then, he just vanished. The next time I heard anything about him was when he passed away around the year 2000. Turns out after abandoning us he had joined the Coast Guard, made a career of it, and then retired with a male partner up in Vermont. His partner preceded him in death. My father passed away without ever making any effort I know of to contact me. It’s pretty obvious he just turned his back on me and had no further use for me. It seems pretty apparent he was gay. I wonder if that’s why he never contacted me. Maybe he thought I couldn’t accept that. It wouldn’t have mattered to me. He left a small estate, but no will. Even in death he gave no thought to my sister or me. My story does have a happy ending. I went on to make a successful career in the US Air Force. Although I did have serious problems with alcohol for a long time, I’ve managed to put that behind me and had my last drink almost 25 years ago. I’m in a healthy marriage, my kids are grown and successful and I have a reasonably good relationship with them, given we live more than 500 miles apart! I eventually went to college with the help of the GI bill. I don’t feel sorry for myself. I like to remind myself at times, “Everyone has a story.” I think that everyone has sorrow, pain and challenge in their lives. I like to think that all mine was stacked up in my early years. I got through all that bad stuff and now life is good. In fact, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. My mother eventually divorced my stepfather. I don’t know where he is today and couldn’t care less. I have a strange relationship with my mother. I love her, but don’t feel the same closeness to her that most people feel with their mother. After all, in my heart I said goodbye to her many years ago when I was a child. I look after her and keep her safe and sound and give her the attention and love she needs. Not because she’s earned it the way most mothers have, but because it’s the right thing to do. I will not do to her what she did to me. I will be there for her as long as she needs me. I try everyday to treat people much better than I was treated. What else can we do in life? We can’t change or control the actions of other people. We can only control our own actions. My goal is to leave the world a better place than I found it. I will treat the world better than it treated me and in some small way, make the world a better place for others.

In Australia, for example, I think police have shot offenders two or three times in the past couple of years. In the UK the police deal with many violent offenders yet the police are unarmed. It appears that American police don’t have the skills to defuse a violent situation or the ability to recognize the time to show patience and understanding and the time to use some kind of force. Even when force is required shooting someone should rarely come up as an option. Given the frequency of these shootings and the incredible number of times when it is totally unnecessary maybe it’s time someone took the guns away from the US police until such time as they learn how to use them properly. There seems to be a complete lack of training in confrontation management or even basic courtesy. Police are supposed to be there to help and to calm a violent situation or confrontation not to escalate it. Whether this is a poor screening process when selecting officers of completely inadequate training I’m not sure. One thing is clear though, it has to change. There also should be serious consequences for discharging a firearm unnecessarily and mandatory jail time for shooting an unarmed or restrained offender no matter how violent they are. Killing someone should not be top of the option list, it should be way, way down at the bottom along with assaulting someone particularly one who is abusive or aggressive. It’s part of the job and as a professional law enforcement person you should be able to deal with this in a calm, restrained, professional manner. It really is time to confiscate the weapons of the US police and make them undertake some hardcore anger and conflict management training. Once they have proven they can effectively deal with a conflict situation without the need for killing someone then maybe, just maybe, they can have their guns back. Most US police departments either require or strongly recommend their officers carry a firearm while off-duty when they are in public. As to uniformed duty police officers, yes, they need to be armed. Recognize that in the US there are anywhere from 290 to 300 million firearms in the hands of the citizenry. Out of all those firearms only a tiny minority are illegally used in crimes — something on the order or .03% or so — and the US crime rate has been decreasing for the last 20 years. Today, we have fewer per-capita murders than in 1964. The police are likely to get into a violent encounter wit Continue ReadingMost US police departments either require or strongly recommend their officers carry a firearm while off-duty when they are in public.

Today, we have fewer per-capita murders than in 1964. The police are likely to get into a violent encounter with people with a predisposition to violence. If that person is armed, legally or illegally, the police officer must be able to defend himself effectively. There are two reasons for police to carry their guns off-duty. First is self-protection and to protect their families. It’s happened that off-duty officers have been attacked by violent criminals they’ve arrested and had their families threatened. It usually doesn’t end well for the criminal. The second reason is that police retain their police authority even when off-duty. An officer in some public place (market, restaurant, etc.) during some violent event may be able to take decisive action to save lives if he is armed. Intervention is left to the discretion of the officer since he’s working alone with no back-up available. Let’s also consider the reverse side of the coin. An unarmed officer caught in a robbery somewhere may be forced to give up his wallet or empty his pockets. If a criminal (or several) discover his police ID they may decide he’s worth killing. And that may lead to them killing others who would be witnesses. An armed officer at least has a chance of survival if he’s armed. Dear Anonymous, No. Police officers don’t need their firearms 24/7.

Some such practices are: 1. Map out your buyer’s journey and use video to create multiple touchpoints The first step to creating a good video strategy is to know what your audience wants. So when you start plotting out your video plan, know the points where you will be using it to meet your user. For instance, if brand awareness is your key business objective, explainer videos and short form video content is more apt. We created this 90 second video for NotifyFox which helped them achieve a 40% open rate.  However, if you are using video for stages like evaluation, detailed video tutorials and webinars are more effective. 2. Engage your audience with the story, not with brand promotion Use videos to show how your brand solves your consumer’s problems. Knit the industry jargon into an effective story which delivers the message but in a simpler format. Do mention your brand in places where it fits organically and doesn’t look promotional. 3. Don’t shy away from using humour B2B videos are largely created with an intent to educate the consumer, mainly because that’s what B2B audience is looking for. But even the B2B audience enjoys witty content, now and then. It is important to use your video with the intent to educate but you can create better engagement if you keep your audience entertained at the same time. Here’s one such B2B video which we absolutely love for its fun concept:  Source What Is Video Content Marketing?

Adapted from a light novel with the same title, it tells the story about the (nameless) protagonist (though he is often referred as watashi (私) — I in Japanese) and his junior, along with his best friend Ozu. Sounds like your standard-fare (university) student romance story, no? Well, not quite, not until you watch the first episode. See, what makes this anime so interesting (and so atypical) are the storytelling style, the narrative, and also the art style. In this anime, we follow the protagonist in joining a student club in his university, hoping for a rosy-tinted university life (and especially romance), but is that it? Of course not, because along with him joining the club, his best friend Ozu also trots along, whipping up mischief and bad luck for the protagonist in his wake. Okay, I get it, it's about your average, less-than-lucky-in-romance protagonist kind of story, isn't it? That's quite the standard fare, you know? This is where it gets interesting — starting from the first episode, after the protagonist laments about his unlucky, unrosy campus life, regretting that he joined the (insert name here) student club, he wished that he chose another club instead, and guess what, that is what will actually happen! The time rewinds and on the next episode he'll go back the square one, picking one club and all. As the story progresses, there will be slight changes in the storytelling structure, and after the first half of the series the storyline truly progresses from the cyclical form, and the development is just, well, rarely seen in other animes (without spoiling this anime too much, I can only say that it is just remarkable). The overall feel of the show from viewing the first episode might feel overwhelming to you (especially to the atypical narration style), but if you proceed to the second episode (and only continue afterwards) you will appreciate the way it is structured. Seriously, I can only say, watch it to get what makes this anime so recommendable. But what is it about that narrative style you are talking about? Well, that is also another interesting thing about this anime, a part of the overall storytelling style too. If you are a self-proclaimed Japanese language lover who found your love from watching animes, I think this is a good anime to test your love. The story is told from the protagonist's point of view (so yeah, first person POV), with omniscient, rapid narration from the protagonist all along the episodes. And when I say rapid, I do mean it.  Along with its storytelling style, it can be a deal maker or a deal breaker. Even if you just rely on reading the subtitle, you might still feel affected by the rapid pace of the narration (I mean how could you not though). But then, it does seem weird to recommend an anime (just) from its narrative style, so that brings me to the next point — the art style. The Tatami Galaxy is directed by Masaaki Yuasa, who is also known for directing other animes with surrealistic style (such as Kaiba). In this anime, he is aided by Yusuke Nakamura as the original character designer. I mean, just look at it     If you are rather bored with the *average* anime style, then this is definitely the anime to go ;) …and if those reasons still don't convince you, then I will tell you this — Asian Kung Fu Generation sings for the opening theme, and the ending theme (sung by Etsuko Yakushimaru) is also quite cool. So, that's my recommendation. What do you think? ;) Have you ever heard of FATE series? If yes, thank you, but if you haven't, watch it..

Saber Alter fan art from Fate Kaleid Liner Prisma Ilya Summary (don’t worry, no spoiler here): Fuyuki city, a location in present day Japan, is destined to be the place to conduct the next “Holy Grail War”. Seven people are chosen from around the world, each are given the privilege of summoning their own servant, a heroic spirit from the past. There are seven different class, Saber, Archer, Rider, etc. The goal of the war is to eliminate all other six master and the reward is to say your wish to the omnipotent wish granting device known as “The Holy Grail”.  Saber-sama when she's on formal wear, sooooooooooooo awesome….. The description is kind of not detail (sorry) but I assure you that the storyline is solid, authentic, unpredictable, and not some clichéd half-assed crap. You can see a sample of the fighting here, preferably at either 720p or above for its full glory:  Saber and Archer vs Berserker The graphic is.. outstanding.. UBW has the best visual quality at its time yet still satisfying today.. So before any of you guys watch it I will give the order from the beginning to the latest release: Fate/ Zero (canonical)Fate Stay Night (canonical)Fate Stay Night; Unlimited Blade Works (alternate aftermath of Stay Night)Fate Apocrypha (alternate universe)Fate Kaleid Liner Prisma Ilya (a Mahou Shoujo parody of the series, is cool and cute)Carnival Phantasm (Kind of a season long extra, nothing serious and is a good break from all the fight)Grand Order the Movie (alternate universe)Unlimited Blade Works the Movie (same as above)I heard that next year a next title is released, one site said it is at October 13 but who knows..And when you have finished all of the Anime, there's still a lot of Visual Novels and game (Grand Order and Extella) to complete. Oh one more thing.. Ufotable is a master grade studio so I suggest you watch it's other, mostly unheard of Titles like: Kara no Kyoukai (The Garden of Sinners)  The graphic is on par with Fate, and since both are written by the same person the theme of the story is similar (Magic, combat, dramatic events, etc) but on different universe. Very cool movie series and worth the shot. Thanks..",2021-03-05T12:49:39.816Z,"What are some lesser known anime that are actually great? ",Quora

During the Economic recession of 2007, his business got low. At that time, people couldn’t afford houses so there was no way they would make an investment in the Swimming pool. The business was reaching to bankruptcy.  Frustrated with life, he started blogging on his website to tell people how much he is passionate about swimming pool business. For one or two months, there was no traction but after some time, the audience began to grow. Soon the sales of Swimming pool again started. People were reading his blogs and talking to him. They wanted to know more about him, his life and his business. He started his business again. It was then he realized the potential of blogging. After a while, he handled the business to his associates and went into full-time blogging. After a while, he ventured into digital marketing. He started his won website Convince & Convert which helped people understand more about Digital Marketing. He is now considered one of the Gurus of Digital Marketing.

World is grey. Your money earning ability is mostly based on your skill, commitment, and outcome. You need to find your flow. You need to find what works the ‘best’ for you. Everyone has their own uniqueness and ability. My friend who was interested in sketching ended up making a lot of money in animation. He takes remote projects and executes them.One of my friend found voice overs to be a good money-making skill. He got gigs online from different marketplaces.Few others found digital marketing, graphics, coding to be their calling. They find their clients through referrals and online portals.But wait, finding your skill, your calling are not enough as you still need to find what is the optimum place and offering for your skill. For eg: Digital Marketing has niches. LinkedIn Marketing for corporate and decent brand is high paying whereas for Indian market Facebook Marketing is dead due to multiple players offering services at a dirt cheap price. So as someone who is entering the market, you need to find the optimum fit of your skill and market. Also, see the future scope. Is this field developing and space expanding? Can I increase my earning in the coming years? Do I have an unfair advantage? As a fresh graduate, many of us are fall to the marketing gimmick of ‘Learning Data Science in 1 Month’, ‘MLM Scams’, ‘Learning Certified Digital Marketing in 1 Month’ for making money. But are they reliable? No. You may end up getting a certificate. You may end up getting a gig but they might not be the best way to start off as they lack reliability, practicality and authenticity. So first rule of the thumb is understand what not to do when you are wanting to earn money. Rule 1: Do not do this while you search for the best way Stay away from click bait courses which promise you a lot of money. Life is not that simple. Avoid investing time in shady courses and MLM. (cause they highly unlikely :D )Rule 2: Find credible people and authentic course who are making good money and work with them Stay grounded in reality. Understand you cannot master data science in 1 month. You cannot be a top paid growth hacker in a month. Find courses which are offered by genuine people. Check for their authenticity and credibility. Learn from them. Then work under their tutelage.Rule 3: Find how can you can get clients and retain your old clients. Long term orientation is important. Short term is unsustainable and unhealthy. Once you have mastered your skill, gained the technical skill and developed some maturity, orient yourself for the future. Find clients who have an yearly business. Keep working with them. Choose delayed gratification of relationship than instant gratification. You need to ensure your client’s success as that ensures that they will be your evangelist and clients for future.Rule 4: Dominate a marketplace. Make yourself the best. Project yourself as the most authentic player in the niche. Be objective in your offering. In my opinion, I suggest freelancers or new comers to try Fiverr or Expert Right. When you have less competition and good gigs, you can dominate that marketplace and get good number of clients. Again, you need to be specific in choosing your projects as your indirect resource - time is invested.Rule 5: Divide your time into learning and earning. Invest your money into earning. Do not wait for learning. Markets expand fast and your skill might be irrelevant as time progresses. Allot your time into learning, unlearning and earning. Learn the upcoming tech and improve your knowledge stack. Unlearn the old outdated techniques replace them with the new. Keep earning and investing.Now, as best is subjective, culturally changing and context dependent. Best way is dependent on the process of earning, currency factor, conversion of time into money and outcome for the effort. Find how do you want to grow your career and where you want to grow. For India, I wouldn’t suggest digital marketing as it is overcrowded. Let us see some facts for Indian Economy: As per the stats mentioned by InvestIndia, India has become the fifth-largest economy in the world with a GDP of 2.6 tn. The economy is seen to have attracted investments and business in the form of start-ups, ranking 17th in the world, ranking 30th in the global manufacturing, 44 in logistics performance, 58 in global innovation, 58 in global competitiveness, 77th in the way of ease of doing business and many more. Employment rate last year has been 93.1%. And that’s a huge number to be known for various available opportunities in India. Considering the fact that you may not be interested in a full-time job, here are a few ideas for you to grab: Freelancing Online: You might find startups looking for you. But as a freelancer, be practical while choosing your client as many startups mushroom quick and shutdown quickly.This is one of the majorly growing sectors of the economy that has got people quitting their traditional ladder-climbing careers. India is the second-biggest economy making money via freelancing after the US. Different sectors of the economy such as creative writing, marketing, designing and development, accounting and finance, etc., have significant scope to freelance. Another great industry you can freelance is via offering professional services such as SMEs, tutors online, blogging, influencer marketing, etc.Women are testing the water. Considering the statistics of the freelancing world, The FlexJobs freelance survey mentions that 73.78% of freelancers in the world economy are women. While 42% of the world economy are full-time freelancers with freelancing being their primary pocket money, 58% of them do freelancing as a supplement to their primary job income.

Get Paid to Click  Star-Clicks is a PTC (paid to click) site that allows advertisers to place their promotions or links back to their websites, and for members to earn by clicking on and viewing these ads. A totally legitimate platform that pays out, its free membership allows you to earn cash for just clicking on ads. You can JOIN STAR CLICKS if you want to earn easy cash. A totally legitimate platform that pays out, its free membership allows you to earn peanuts, and takes ages to reach the minimum cash out amount. Paid membership on such low-paying platforms like this carries a risk that you would have to assess, before taking the plunge. To find out what is Star-Clicks, let us first take a look at its home page.  Earn & Make Money Online Get Paid By PayPal Bank Transfer has Easy Logic Limited as its parent company. This PTC (paid to click) website has been around since 2008, so I would say it is established and has built a reputation for itself. Disclaimer; This content was gotten from here and you can get more details about it on the website. How does Star-Clicks work The concept is a simple one. Just as with any other PTC website, Star-Clicks allows for advertisers to pay them to place their offers, promotions, and advertisements on their platform. These can also bring viewers back to their own websites. As a member, you would click on and view those ads for a few seconds, to qualify for earnings in the range of $0.01 to $0.02 per click. This is about the right kind of rate for PTC sites, so there is nothing here that would raise my suspicion about its legitimacy. Signing up on Star-Clicks Signing up would take just a few minutes, requiring you to enter your date of birth, home postal address, and phone number as well. Though usually I wouldn’t be too comfortable providing these information, Star-Clicks appears to be a legitimate platform, so I would go ahead to provide these if I really want to try to earn from this website. There will be a verification code sent to your mobile number, as well as an email that you would have to activate, then you are all set to start using Earn & Make Money Online Get Paid By PayPal Bank Transfer. Membership levels on Star-Clicks These are the three membership levels:  Silver Membership Once you are signed up, your membership is Silver, which is free. It allows you to make $0.01 per ad that you click on and view. The main issue with this is: the minimum amount for payout is $50, which is extremely high, and will take you ages to hit. Moreover, there is a maximum number of ads that you are eligible to click on per day. For this Silver membership, this cap is about 7 to 10. It means the maximum amount you can earn is $0.10 per day. Gold Membership The Gold membership of Earn & Make Money Online Get Paid By PayPal Bank Transfer is priced at $29.95, but at times they do offer a discounted price of $19.95, so you may want to keep a look out for that if you intend to upgrade. Do note that this fee only gives you one month on the membership. The pay per click rate can be slightly higher, but it still starts at $0.01. The advantage of getting on this Gold membership is the feature of unlimited ads, subject to availability. This means if there are few advertisers using the platform in the first place, you will never be able to get a significantly higher number of ads to click. You can get access to HTML code, which is supposed to provide you with more ads. Gold also provides you with 25% higher referral commissions than the Silver membership. I will explain more about this in a later section. However, do note that the minimum threshold for paying out is still $50, which is still rarely achievable despite the seemingly higher earning potential. Platinum membership This is the highest level of membership available, and costs $49.95. Do note that you CANNOT upgrade from a Gold membership to this Platinum one. So you should give it careful consideration before taking up the Gold or Platinum membership. On top of various other perks, the Platinum level earns you a minimum of $0.02 per click, with no minimum payout limit, and a 25% higher referral commissions as well. There is no minimum threshold for cashing out. This must be the greatest advantage for the Platinum membership, but it comes at a considerably higher cost, which increases your risk. Though the Gold and Platinum memberships sound more attractive than the Silver, personally I really wouldn’t recommend putting up any investments on such PTC platforms, since the earning potential is way too low. Remember, you came to the Star-Clicks platform to earn, not to spend. There is no guarantee that you will be able to earn more than your membership costs, so you could be making a loss from this. Earn through referral commissions This is the other way you can earn on Star-Clicks. When you refer people to join the platform, you earn $0.08 per sign up.  When your referral refers others, and their referrals refer yet others, you get to earn $0.08 per sign up too. This means you get to earn referral commissions for three levels down. It is not much, though, and will not make you a substantial income, unless you have sufficient internet marketing expertise and skills to bring in hoards of targeted traffic. The earnings do become quite significant when your referrals upgrade – you make $5 per Gold membership upgrade, and $10 per Platinum membership upgrade. Payment Methods on Earn & Make Money Online Get Paid By PayPal Bank Transfer Star-Clicks processes its payments through PayPal, direct bank transfer, or Bitcoin.  3. Earn Bitcoin by completeing surveys Bitcoin is viewed by many as one of the best options if you want to own cryptocurrency because it has better liquidity. This means you will be able to retain most of its value when you decide to convert it to fiat currency (government-issued currency). So, if you are interested in earning Bitcoin without actually mining it, there are plenty of sites around you can join. One such site is called Coinpayu. This site promises to pay you in Bitcoin for clicking ads What is Coinpayu and what does it offer? First things first, CoinPayU is a legit Paid-To-Click (PTC) site that will pay you for viewing ads. If you are new to PTC sites, I would suggest you read the ultimate PTC guide first so you’ll get an idea of how this kind of site works. Now, if you want to understand how well you can earn from this site, you have to take a closer look at the earning opportunities it offers. How to earn from COINPAYU Option 1 – Paid ads What makes Coinpayu a PTC site is essentially this earning opportunity. You will basically be able to earn by viewing ads. This is one of the easiest ways to earn rewards on any kind of online rewards site. All you really have to do is view an ad for a certain time and you earn the reward. However, this earning opportunity requires a lot of patience as the rewards are very low – but more about the earning potential later. Now, with Coinpayu, there are three types of ads you can view: surf ads, video ads and window ads. Surf ads will ask you to view certain websites.  Surf ads are ads you can earn from without having to necessarily view them. You just have to click the offer and let the timer run. As you can see in the photo above, when you view all the available surf ads, you will immediately see how much you will earn for viewing the ad as well as how long you need to view it. When you click an ad, it will open a new browser tab and display the site you need to view. The good thing about this opportunity is, you don’t actually have to view the ad to earn. You can just click the ad you want to work on and let the timer run out. By the way, the timer won’t be displayed in the new tab that will be opened but on the Surf Ads page of Coinpayu instead. So, you can just check the Surf Ads page to see if the timer has finished (you will know if it is done because it will display a message that you’ve earned the reward). When that happens, you can close the tab with the ad and click on another surf ad to start another round.  Window ads, on the other hand, are ads you have to pay attention to in order to earn. For Window Ads, the process is slightly different. The premise is still the same but you actually have to stay on the page that displays the ad for the timer to run. When you click a window ad, it will open a new browser tab displaying the ad. You will then see a progress bar loading at the top of the page. You have to make sure your mouse cursor is on any area of the page for the progress bar to load. If you move the cursor out of the page or if you switch to a different tab, the progress bar will stop loading. So, this type of ad will actually demand at least some of your attention to complete unlike the surf ads.  Video ads are like window ads because you also have to pay attention and stay on the ad window to earn the reward. For video ads, the process is similar to window ads. When you click on a video ad, it will open a new browser tab again showing the video you have to watch. You have to solve the captcha first before you can watch the video. Once you are done with the captcha, just click the play button and you will see the timer on the lower right-hand corner of the page (refer to photo above). Once the timer reaches 0, it will then change to a Visit Website button. Simply click the button to load the website to complete the process. Once you’ve done that, you will earn the reward for watching the video. So overall, among the three types of ads you can view, the easiest one to do is the surf ads. This is also the type with the most available ads you can view and it pays more compared to the other types of ads. Disclaimer; this content was gotten from paid from Surveys and you can readmore about it here Option 2 – Offerwalls Coinpayu also has offerwalls you can check out to earn additional rewards. Offerwalls are basically in-site advertising platforms that offer short tasks in exchange for a small reward. These short tasks are usually designed to promote either a website or a mobile app.  You can complete offers on offerwalls to earn higher rewards. The good thing about Coinpayu is that they have plenty of offerwalls you can do. As shown in the photo above, you just have to choose which offerwalls you want to work on. You will then see a bunch of offers you can do. Most of the offers you will find on their offerwalls will ask you to answer a survey or quiz, play a browser-based game, download a mobile app, or sign-up for a certain website. Each offer will tell you how much you will earn when you complete it. It will also show you the requirements you need to meet to earn the reward. For example, in the photo above, you will be asked to answer a survey on Yuno. Simply click the Reward button to start the survey. You just have to follow the instructions to complete the survey. Once you’ve completed the survey and earned the reward, the offer will be completed and the reward will be credited to your account. It is important to note that the offers on their offerwalls pay significantly more than their paid ads. So, in my opinion, this is the better earning opportunity in terms of earning potential. You just need to make sure you follow all the instructions given to earn the reward. Option 3 – Referral program Lastly, you can also earn rewards by participating in their referral program. To do so, you just have to share your invite link with the person you want to invite. Once they sign up using your link, they will become your referral.  You can invite people to join the site to earn a commission. As shown in the photo above, you can earn a commission when they click advertisements and do offers. The commission will depend on your membership (I will discuss later how to upgrade your membership). It’s a form of passive income but you have to make sure the people you invite are those that are really interested in earning on this site. Otherwise, you won’t earn anything from it. Recommended: Check Out the Top Survey Sites in Your Country How do you get paid? Every activity you do on Coinpayu will earn you a certain number of Satoshi (the smallest unit of a bitcoin). This will be reflected in your Coinpayu balance. The threshold you need to reach to withdraw your earnings will depend on the payment method you are using (refer to photo below).  The threshold you need to reach to withdraw your earnings will depend on the payment method you are using. As you can see, the minimum amount you can withdraw is 5,000 Satoshi if you are using Dogecoin, Litecoin, Faucetpay, or Payeer as your payment method. If you use a Bitcoin wallet, you will need to earn 10,000 Satoshi to withdraw your earnings. If you are using Ethereum, you will need 50,000 satoshi and there will be a 0.005 eth transaction fee that will be deducted from the amount you will withdraw. To put it into perspective, if you will withdraw 5,000 satoshi, that’s roughly around $0.57. So even though it seems like a lot, it’s actually not worth that much. Now, if you were hoping the site offers other rewards like gift cards, unfortunately, you will be disappointed. If you prefer to earn cash, I would instead suggest you check out the top sites that pay via PayPal. Now if you are looking for more sites where you can earn cryptocurrency, then I recommend you check out the best sites to earn Bitcoin. How much money can you make? If you read my PTC guide, you would know that PTC sites really don’t offer the best earning potential. This is because the amount you will earn from viewing ads will be very low. Fortunately, Coinpayu does offer a slightly better opportunity through offerwalls. But overall, I would still say the site has a low earning potential mainly because of the low rewards they offer. But just like most PTC sites, it offers a way for you to boost your earnings.  You can pay for an upgrade to increase your earnings but you have to plan it out properly. If you upgrade your membership level, you will receive several benefits which are geared mostly towards earning more. In the photo above, it shows you will receive more for viewing ads and completing offers. I’m not really a fan of the spend-more-to-earn-more strategy because, in my opinion, it totally defeats the purpose of joining an online rewards site. In the first place, you are supposed to earn from these sites without having to spend your own money. I’m not saying this kind of scheme (so to speak) doesn’t work. But if you do decide to upgrade your membership level, you have to make sure you have a solid plan to earn back the money you spent for the upgrade. If not, you can easily end up losing money instead of earning any. So keep that in mind before you decide to upgrade your membership level. Can you use it on mobile?  Coinpayu doesn’t have a mobile app you can download but the site is mobile-friendly. So, you can still work on the site pretty conveniently on a mobile device. All you have to do is open a web browser and log in to the site. You actually have to do this if you want to maximize your earnings on the site. As mentioned earlier, there are opportunities that will ask you to install mobile apps. You can only do this if you access the offer from a mobile device. So, you could say that it is a necessity to work on the site from your mobile device from time to time. And fortunately, Coinpayu makes it relatively easy for you, which is a good thing. Who can join Coinpayu? Coinpayu is available globally. You can join the site regardless of where you live. Though you just have to make sure you have an account from any of the payment methods they offer before you join.   4.Start a Blog and Monetize It Everyone with a product or service to sell is looking for agents to sell them. Find products you feel strongly about and become a dealer. Some higher priced items can fetch a $100 cut quickly. If you have your own website, then affiliate marketing can become even more lucrative. You can place affiliate links on your website and potentially make money while you sleep. Some products offer small commissions of a few bucks that may not seem like a lot, but the point of affiliate marketing is striving to build up consistent commissions that add up in a big way over time. 5.Get Paid to Walk Gigwalk is a side job that involves taking photos, picking up menus, and various other small assignments in your area. It works on an app that you download onto your phone. You receive the job orders, accept them and do the work, and confirm when the job is complete. While you won’t earn a ton of money through GigWalk, this website can help you earn something in your spare time.

Both depend on each other to position an organisation in the eyes of it’s stakeholders, clients and consumers. Corporate Communications mainly deals with the written and, at times, oral communication that needs to be done in order to keep all the stakeholders informed of a company’s vision, mission and strategic objectives. It involves internal as well as external communication, depending on who needs to know what. Corporate Communications use various different platforms to keep a company’s stakeholders updated of it’s activities. Website, brochures, newsletters, stakeholders’ letters/messages, annual reports, magazines are all external corporate communications mediums, while emails, announcements, minutes of meetings, intranet are internal communication platforms. All the above mentioned platforms are used to disseminate important information about an organisation’s present and future plans. Good organisations take corporate communications quite seriously because they know its their duty to share their plans with their stakeholders/shareholders. Here comes the role of Public Relations. As the name suggests, this department specifically deals with the information that goes out to the masses, in order to position an organisation’s brand in the eyes of general public. Public Relations use the external communications prepared by Corporate Communications to generate a positive image of the company. It uses mediums like press releases, social media, public activities, presentations etc. to create public interest in the products/services rendered by a company. Many a time, Public Relations team works closely with Corporate Communications team to identify external audiences (their tears too) and prepare appropriate external communication messages and publication materials. Public Relations department also engages with media agencies, advertising agencies (though Corporate Communications and Marketing are primarily responsible for recruiting an advertising agency) to reach out to masses and spread the company’s message. It is important to remember that Corporate Communications and Public Relations need to work very closely and exchange timely information to function successfully. Any lapse between the two departments can lead to huge losses. Keeping this in mind, a large number of organisations merge the two departments into one, under one manager/head to ensure smooth execution of activities. Both the teams sit together to identify their target audiences and agree upon the mode of communication as well as the content so that there is no discrepancy or ambiguity about any message.

60422a36ed76476feda1fb61,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-a-public-relation-consultant-target?-,"Every single morning, I wake up to 50+ pitches from Public Relations firms. A handful customize their email outreach by calling out a specific piece I had written they liked, or commenting on the writing I share on Quora/Medium. But the vast majority get inside my inbox by using a software tool to scrape my email from my Inc Magazine column. They want to know if I’d be interested in interviewing their client—a founder, a CEO, a small business owner, a mompreneur, etc. I’m not. And the reason I’m not interested isn’t because the person they’re pitching isn’t worth talking to. I’m not interested because it’s overwhelming to sift through this many messages in bulk. After I’ve Select All/Deleted every single PR pitch I’ve received, I can count on my inbox being flooded again by lunch. I have to clean my inbox every 3 hours. It’s obnoxious. If you work with a PR firm, I want to explain to you what you’re paying for: You’re paying for the above experience. You’re paying a firm to mass-blast columnists—many of whom don’t get paid. For the ones who do get paid (like myself), payment comes in the form of page views, not a flat rate per article. And as someone who has written over 400 articles for Inc Magazine exclusively, data has showed me the least popular article type is one about a founder nobody knows about. You’re not Mark Zuckerberg. And you’re not Elon Musk. If I want views, I should either write about Facebook, or I should write about something universal—like productivity, leadership, etc. (And not in the form of interviewing someone and repeating the same 3 leadership lessons every single founder on earth shares.) Which means, your PR firm is asking columnists to spend more time writing something that will yield less views. It’s a poor strategy. Instead, I highly encourage founders, CEOs, and serial entrepreneurs to flip their strategy. I’m not saying PR is worthless. PR has a time and place. But in order to execute PR well, you have to understand something about columnists (and, being one of them, I’d like to pull back the curtain and share something you don’t know). Columnists don’t have very much time. When I first started contributing to Inc Magazine, I was working 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at an advertising agency. After work, I’d ride the train home for an hour, head to the gym, make dinner, and then finally sit down to write around 9:00 p.m. I didn’t have time to interview people. Nor did I have time to try to figure out if the founder or executive a PR firm was pitching me was actually credible. I’d Google their name and the only thing that would come up would be the bio on their company website. I had no idea whether this person was someone I actually wanted to talk to—or if they had anything valuable to share in the first place. Instead, I ended up writing articles based on information I could easily find online. I wrote about founders whose work I admired on Medium. I wrote about CEOs who had podcasts or keynote speeches I enjoyed. I wrote about people who put themselves out there, and made it easy for me to source their insights. 99% of founders and executives don’t have a personal brand online. In fact, they’re invisible. What happens, then, is they spend thousands of dollars on PR. The PR firm pitches columnists in bulk (mistake #1). On the off-chance a columnist opens their email, reads it, and wants to chat with their client, the columnist ends up spending 5x the time writing a piece that receives -5x the viewership (mistake #2). And during the writing process, they struggle to give context to what the founder or executive shares because there’s nothing they can link to on the Internet (mistake #3). I know—because I have experienced all of these pain points as a columnist. To be perfectly honestly, these painful experiences are what gave me the idea to start Digital Press. A PR firm would be exponentially more successful (and columnists would have a much easier time writing) if the founder or executive already had a library of content online—authored by them. They would be able to make themselves for relatable. And columnists would easily be able to source their insights. It’s astounding to me how, when I break all of this down for our clients, and we start collaborating with their PR firm or department, how much more effective their efforts become. We’ve actually had CEOs start building their library of content, and then have publications reach out to them, asking if they’d like to contribute directly. This speaks to a much larger life lesson I believe is true in any context: Shortcuts are often longer roads in disguise. But when you take the time to do things the right way from the beginning, your work ends up paying dividends in the long run. Strategic public relations allows practitioners and clients to integrate PR tactics into an overall communications or marketing plan. It creates the opportunity to work towards a measurable, definable goal that further supports how public relations can help businesses grow. It is beyond sending out a press release and hoping it gets picked up by a reporter or that you get an email requesting an interview for your client. Strategic public relations includes identifying a goal or outcome and then employing various communications tools to achieve the defined goal. A plan of this ilk examines website domain authority and authoritative bloggers and influencers who can not only reach your target audience but support increased traffic to your website through authoritative links. It is expert positioning through content marketing and guest blogging tactics. It is leveraging social media and social media advertising campaigns to increase brand awareness and drive conversions on your website.  Public relations is evolving at a rapid pace and strategic PR is really the intersection of media relations, social media, content marketing and SEO. While the benefits are numerous, here are five reasons why engaging in a strategic PR plan can generate truly fantastic results: It Supports Company LongevityIt Influences Revenue Drivers, Supporting Lead Generation and Sales in the Digital LandscapeIt Builds AwarenessIt Gives You Leverage Over CompetitorsIt Builds Trust It is not typical work (yeah, which one is actually) but for me is SPECIAL. Sometimes you spend time with journalist - talking, meeting, laughing (let's be friends!), sometimes you need to have hard conversations. Sometimes you spend half of the month in your car driving to clients, meeting, press conference. Sometimes you create big strategy and can see its effects in newspaper or influence internet source. Sometimes you Sometimes you are postman, call center worker, negotiator. Sometimes you sleep on your notebook keyboard preparing month reports. Then you explain to the client why results are so high/low. Forget about work from 9am to 5 pm. You must be always there. You must be fast and/or funny (social media), serious as as adult should (meetings), work slow and precisely (creating strategy), work fast (reacting to crisis), be an artist (good creations) and do excellent maths (reports, statistics).

This is not because the country is dangerous, it is one of the safest countries I have been to, but because it will get boring. There are vast distances between anything. It takes 8 hours to get to Adelaide from Melbourne, and 6 hours to get to Canberra. It takes even longer to get to any of the other major cities. Outside of the cities, Australia is sparsely populated. Australia is not like the US or Canada where the majority of people live in smaller cities (like with 100,000-900,000 people) suburbs and towns. Australia has over 14,000,000 people living in their cities with a population of over 1,000,000, and a total population of only 23,130,000. 61% of their population lives in 5 cities: Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, or Adelaide. Melbourne and Sydney are both much larger than Los Angeles (within the city limits). Brisbane is bigger than Chicago (within the city limits), and Perth and Adelaide are both just slightly smaller than Chicago. In contrast in the US, about 22,000,000 people live in a city with a population of over 1,000,000 (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, and Dallas are the US cities with a population of over 1,000,000), out of our total population of 318,900,000. Less than 7% of the US population lives in a city larger than 1,000,000. The bulk of the population lives in suburbs and metropolitan areas outside of the large cities. Looking at population density this becomes apparent:   Keep in mind that the green areas have a population of 2-10 per square kilometer.  Yes most US cities are part of larger metropolitan areas, but that is kind of my point. In Australia it goes from the center of urban sprawl to nowhere much quicker than in the US. A drive in Australia outside of the US won't be at all like in the US (except maybe Alaska). You will see very few towns or people outside of the cities. What I am getting at is... it will be boring by yourself. Taxis Don't waste your money on taxis if possible. Seriously, they are not dangerous but Australian taxi drivers are weirdos, and taxis seem less reliable than in the US or Canada, and more expensive. After 10 sometimes the demand is so high (with tons of drunk people calling cabs) that it will take an hour or two for a taxi to arrive after you call them. I still remember the stupid 13 Cabs song from being on hold for 45 minutes. Another time I was going to the airport to catch a flight back to Melbourne, and two professors from the U of Melbourne got a cab and invited me to come along. I did. We were then told very NSFW party stories by the cab driver for 45 minutes on our way to the airport. The final cost was like... 70$ or something. After we got out, the professors told me their last cab driver was even worse, and told them intimate details about his sex life and his affairs with 3 women. It costs 20-30$ a day (in Australian dollars... like 13-21 USD as of Jan 14 2016) to rent a crappy car from Rent A Bomb (see Driving). Public transport(ation) is also very reliable in any of the larger cities. It is not very confusing once you know the geography as there are signs everywhere. Public Transport(ation) Public transport(ation) is pretty cheap. To get around Melbourne now costs edit: 39$ per week. I advise trying to learn the geography of the city, or else taking a map everywhere. Bus and tram stops always have very helpful signs on them telling you where the busses or trams go, so if you know where you want to go, it is easy. Trains generally have digital signs posted above the platforms, or at the entrances to the platforms. Driving If you try driving in Australia, have one of your Australian friends or family members drive with you the first time to give you pointers if possible. My first time driving I drove my girlfriend to get her new glasses, and her mum was in the car too telling me what to do driver's ed style. It doesn't usually take a rocket scientist to figure out how to drive on the left. The only difficult things for me still are traffic circles/roundabouts and using my windshield wipers and turn signals. I have a bad habit of looking the wrong way as I enter a roundabout just from driving on the right my whole life. It is also very confusing for me to use turn signals. On righthand drive cars (with the steering wheel on the right) the signal to turn or turn on your high-beams is on the right, while the knob for wiper fluid and windshield wipers is on the left. Even after driving for hours I still sometimes turn on my windshield wipers or squirt my windshield with wiper fluid when I mean to turn on the signal for right or left. This mistake is just funny, and really won't put you at high risk for crashing. Australians also complain about their drivers, but Australian drivers are better than American drivers on average, and much better than Canadian or European drivers. One problem for American and Canadian drivers is that the road markings in Australia are 100% different. Opposing lanes of traffic are divided by white lines, not yellow:  Don't make the mistake of driving in the wrong lane because of this. Signs also say things like ""overtake"" instead of ""pass"" and ""give way"" instead of ""yield"". These aren't too confusing though. Edit: Don't be in a hurry too much It can be frustrating, but it seems like Australians are not often in hurries. I remember walking faster than people and having to get passed crowds, and then I just decided to walk slower, and that fixed the problem. I think some of the other answers here where politeness was an issue, had problems where they were going too fast in interactions with salespeople. 10 an American that did graduate school in Australia I agree with most of the previous answers, here are some things I noticed: Neither culture is better or worse, most differences are cultural, historical and scale based.

You won't find equivalent college sports there but you will find pro Aussie rules. It is hands down 100 times easier to learn and enjoy as a newcomer than American football (Go Tigers). It also has the benefit of not having replay, the follow on legal analysis of each play and they let the guys play without disrupting play every 2 minutes.I had many British, American and obviously Australian classmates. What I learned is Americans think it is too British and the British think its too American. The Aussies just wish we would both stop talking about it.Learn very early how the shout system of drinking works. I argue that the Aussies are the fastest at ordering the next shout (in American speak that is buying the next round in a bar) in the world. If you’re a light weight drinker (never been a problem of mine) you will be in trouble fast.Never use the word fanny, even though your churchgoing grandma uses it in the States.Parties are generally BYOB...learned that from my Scottish classmate. He was very polite about it but was still embarrassing as i was polishing off his 4th beer (again never been a lightweight).Lastly, one of my favorite stories is from a British (wife) and Aussie (husband) couple friends of ours. When entering Australia and reading the customs form question, ""Have you ever been convicted of a crime?"" She turned to him and asked him"" if i say no will they still let me in?"" The Brits still enjoy riling up their Aussie nieces and nephews.I will stop here and say I enjoyed my time there immensely and can't wait to go back and see my many lifelong friends I made there. These were all things I learned over 10 years ago so take them with a grain of salt. As an Aussie, who now lives in the US, I have noticed how open and forthright Americans are when it comes to religion.

You’ll even find the term “in God we trust” everywhere from schools, court houses, and money. Mississippi is even proposing to print “in God we trust” on the state flag in lieu of the Confederate battle symbol. By contrast, Australia is becoming increasing secular, and many people claim not to be religious. In fact, according to the 2016 census, more Australians identify as being not religious 30.1% than any other religion. People do not openly talk about religion and it is something that is kept private in Australia. As a precaution I would recommend that you avoid discussing religion in a public setting. While Australians are generally a friendly bunch, religion is one of those contentious issues, which could ignite a debate. Similar to religion, I would also recommend that you avoid talking about guns, as most Australians are gun control advocates. That is unless you are also a pro-gun control advocate. In that case Australians will be only too happy to tell you how crazy they find the US obsession with guns. Another thing to be aware of is the way some Australians like to joke around. We call it “taking the piss”. This often involves some type of banter regarding a person's country of origin or accent etc. It’s often meant as a term of endearment, but sometimes we can take things a little too far, or people become derogatory. As a result, some foreigners may take offence to someone “taking the piss”, as they see it as an attack on them or their culture. The only piece of advice I can give is to just laugh it off. If you build a rapport with these people you can even start to dish a little bit of it back. Unfortunately Australia has its fair share of idiots, and if they offend you, I recommend walking away. There’s no point in spoiling your vacation over some dickhead. One last point I will touch upon is that people in Australia will often say “please” and “thank you” in one sentence. I’ve noticed how people in the US don’t tend to use those terms as much (at least not in New York anyway). They aren’t necessarily being rude, it’s just a cultural thing, or perhaps a New York thing. For example, my wife who is American will often ask me for a glass of water when I am up, but she never says please or thank you. On the flip side, she is often amused when we visit Australia, and I say “please” and “thank you” in one sentence (e.g. “could I please have a coffee thanks”). I think most Australians expect these types types of niceties in conversation and you could receive some gruff service if you fail to adhere to these social norms. Apart from that, I think most of the other contributors to this forum hit the nail on the head with their suggestions.",2021-03-05T13:00:38.057Z,"What should an American never do when visiting Australia?

They sure do find a way to get it back. Even still, I cleared about five thousand dollars and that was the most money I have ever had at one time, in my entire life. I know that might sound pitiful, especially to those of you who spend five thousand weekly, but for me that was a lot of money. I immediately bought my kids a bunch of stuff they wanted. They got to pick out toys that they never would have dreamed to even look at before. Otherwise, it basically paid off a lot of debt. People blow through their money because it's probably the first time they have ever been able to spend without feeling restricted. They can splurge on things they have always wanted or wanted to do. But money goes quickly, and before you know it, it's gone. Easy come …. Easy go. In 2010 somebody I know walked into work one day, announced to us all that he had won the lottery and was quitting, and walked out again. It turned out that he was part of a syndicate with the rest of his family and his share of the winnings was £6 million. It’s now 2018 and he’s earning £8 per hour working in a supermarket. What went wrong? Simple, he thought that because he was a millionaire he was able to lead a millionaire’s lifestyle. Within a week of receiving his winnings he’d spent the best part of £300,000 on cars. He’d booked holidays all over the world complete with first class flights Continue ReadingIn 2010 somebody I know walked into work one day, announced to us all that he had won the lottery and was quitting, and walked out again. It turned out that he was part of a syndicate with the rest of his family and his share of the winnings was £6 million. It’s now 2018 and he’s earning £8 per hour working in a supermarket. What went wrong? Simple, he thought that because he was a millionaire he was able to lead a millionaire’s lifestyle. Within a week of receiving his winnings he’d spent the best part of £300,000 on cars. He’d booked holidays all over the world complete with first class flights that in total probably cost him £100,000. A month later he completed the purchase of a £1.5 million house. He filled that house with the most expensive luxury items he could find. If I had to put a figure on it I’d guess that he probably spent around of £2.5 million within the first 12 months. He was loving life, he was living like a millionaire, never having to worry about money, able to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, without a care in the world. He didn’t have to listen to anybody around him any more, he was his own boss. Unfortunately in 2015 it all came crashing down. When he won the money everybody around him advised him to be sensible, to have his finances properly managed so that it would provide him with long term stability. However he didn’t want to hear that, because he wanted that £6 million now, he didn’t want to use that to earn him a much smaller amount than that every year because he was a millionaire, how was he going to live like a millionaire if that money was only earning him £200,000 a year. So when 2015 rolled around he pretty quickly found that he was living in an enormous house that cost a lot of money in general upkeep, he had a fleet of very expensive cars, now worth very little, that were extremely expensive to run, he had simply built up a lifestyle that needed a millionaires bank account to sustain when the reality is that he was a not particularly bright English Language graduate with an almost empty bank account. He ended up selling the house for less than he paid, got rid of all of the cars for less than half of what they cost him in the first place, steadily sold off the luxury items he owned and still continued to try and live like somebody with money. Even at this stage he didn’t decide to be sensible with what he had and very quickly he worked his way through what little he had remaining. Middle of last year it all finally ended, his pot ran dry, he used the last little bit that was remaining to get himself a mortgage on a tiny little new build property near Bristol and started looking for work again. So that is why I personally think that a lot of lottery winners end up broke in a short space of time. They think that having millions in the bank enables them to live a millionaire’s lifestyle. I know a guy who’d hit a mil and was working in the dollar store a year later. It’s because it would require a sudden change in personality in order for such a gambler to hold on to winnings. Let’s face it; the people who usually win the lottery are not people who happened to spend a dollar one day out of the blue and they got amazingly lucky. The people who win usually play $10, $20, $100 a week. They buy lots and lots of tickets. My friend was always an impulsive type. Skipping school on a whim, for example.

In order for them to hold on to a lump sum, they’d have to suddenly decide they were changing their ways. Mutual funds, bonds, a Prius — what fun is that? No way! How about investing in a new pizza-flavored ice cream company and some great paintings of Elvis and James Dean? And fly First Class to every overpriced tourist trap! The person I know simply blew through his money, as a million really isn’t that much, after all. He probably still plays lotto. And he stocks items at the dollar store. Better would have been to buy a dollar-store franchise, perhaps. Maybe he’d make 23 cents per item sold. Those pennies add up.

She distributed the 50 Lakh won in Kaun banega Crorepati to Gujrat Earthquake victims.She also works towards upliftment of women in Rural areas, Primary school education. So , let me question myself why I consider her to be most intelligent. She did not trade off her education for acting.She honed her acting skills and saw that her dance does not go unnoticed.Many actresses see that they marry some wealthy actors and get settled. But Madhuri Dixit , took a decision which surprised many. She married someone outside her profession , a renowned surgeon.She always kept a low profile, which depicts that she is always grounded.She also does behind the stage work for underprivileged societies, no hush-push about those.Finally, she maintains cordial relationship with almost everyone on the industry.With these in mind , I could vouch for Mrs.Madhuri Dixit Nene to be the most intelligent actress in India.

Academic, conference-full, big, internationally collaborant, mind-bending physics full of low pays, long hours, most golden-hearted people you ever meet and challenges that will never leave you bored. It wasn’t an easy choice, when I was younger I was constantly flipping between art, writing, journalism, history of art, engineering, astronomy and good old making money in IT and all of them had their own advantages. Physics differ depending on the field and application and different people tend to driff to different areas of it. I would risk a statement that the “crazy” and experimental part draws in most of the ENTP so particle physics, quantum computing, antimatter physics, laser physics: anything that’s really abstract, fun and makes things explode from time to time. Going through the typical characteristics of an ENTP and physics I think I could see those pros and cons: Pros: Lifelong learning: When you do science you can never stop. Every other month, every other year you work on something else, who knows, may in a decade you’ll specialise in a field you didn’t even knew existed when you were studying? It’s enough to keep ENTP minds occupied, challenged and even overhelmed most of the time.Conferencing and collaborating: Being an extravert who loves talking and presenting is a huge advantage in science. Travelling to all parts of the world to talk, to present, to find funds and new connections is a very important part of any research and in a field full of INTPs and INTJs being the person who can connect with others easily and loves presentations turns the part that scientists usually hate the best part of the job for the ENTPs.Independence: No matter if you work on a University, in a huge collaboration or a smaller Institute you’re usually the only person truly responsible for your career, work and plans. I structure my own days, I work during mornings, or in the middle of the night. Sometimes I work 3 hours. Sometimes 13 hours. I plan my own path and my own work. It’s only possible, it’s absolutely necessary in this kind of work.People: In my experience science is full of cheerfull, honest, adorably shy, curious, tolerant people with golden hearts. They keep up with ENTPs sense of humour, they fall right into this narrow field that gets ENTPs loyalty and respect, they can teach the ENTP hard work, discipline and focus and at the end of the day they are a safe space made out of NTs.Cons: Getting in: Starting your path in sciences through university degree (and then another and another and another) is a marathon. It requires many things that don’t come to ENTPs naturally like repetition, long hours of studying, reading, coding. There is so much to learn ovver such a long span of time that the ENTP way of just winging it doesn’t work anymore. You just have to get out of your comfort zone and learn how to do stuff regularly. Good news: it’s possible and it’s something that ENTP would struggle with at any other path in life.Practical problems: There are many things that someone who wants a professional career in science needs to keep in mind. The studying is very long, and never really ends. There are some well paid jobs there, but it’s a norm. You will probably have to move around the world a lot after your work, or field of study (open position for production of pions in Jakarta? I’m coming!). You will work on a very, very small part of a bigger puzzle and it will get frustrating sometimes. You may take one all-nighter too much and burn out. But then - I think every career has things like that.Loneliness and demotivation: While conferences and workshops are were ENTP thrive still the bulk of work is sitting in your office, staring at the screen and answering questions on Quora instead of writing your article. There is a lot of work that needs to be done alone. There are many outposts or positions that will make you travel out of your support net of friends into new cultures or simply very distant places (writing from above the polar circle here so forgive me my gloom). There are moments when this work feels isolating and it cuts really badly the ENTP need for someone else to push the first rock of the avalanche of motivation. But there are many physicist who work in the same place for decades, there are even more physicists with kids and family and there are many ways to work around it by keeping active, more social interests outside of your work. The good news I found this out the hard way and I’m going to save you some grief. The bad news? I found this out the hard way—later in life and dealt with a lot of confusion and grief along the way.

The bad news? I found this out the hard way—later in life and dealt with a lot of confusion and grief along the way. I love creating, re-structuring music, dance, poetry, learning languages, disappearing in cultural places for months and immersing myself in language. I also love for engaging in lively discussions and debates about physics theories into the early morning hours without a need for sleep or eating, learning other languages and cultural perspectives of physics and challenging present models and wondering if we could go beyond current models and re-invent physics itself? Unfortunately, I grew up an environment that held me back—that valued a strict puritanical work ethic over following one’s dreams (and viewed academics as “derelicts”). I come alive in academia because I am constantly learning and devouring anything from literature, poetry, computation to theoretical physics, quantum chemistry, QCD, discovering new particles, theories, and wondering if gravitational waves are made of oscillating particles and potential dark matter? This sense of self (re) discovery allowed me to follow (or how I learned to stop doubting myself and love) my childhood calling in Theoretical Physics. I am also known for “not suffering fools gladly” and had a wicked way of browbeating people in my younger years (But I have managed to keep the beast in check nowadays) and I could use some help in the sitzflesich department. That said, years of experience can save you the trouble now: Customer Service: Including having breaks and lunch timed (*shudder*), calls micromanaged, meeting metrics and standards—especially if those metrics leave a lot of unfinished work and more callbacks by customers who did not get their products-which defeats the purpose of the term “customer service” And is not rational in any sense…Administrative/Secretarial/assistantship positions (enough said).Anything that stifles your creativity, or doesn't allow you to push the edge.Micro managers and control freaks (How many ENTP’s reading this just cringed at that word?). Micromanagers that are constantly timing you, rather than letting your creativity flow.Caretaker position (Do not confuse for leadership)-anything that requires you to care for large groups of people and think for them-whatever their needs could possibly be.Anything considered mundane.Any place that keeps secrets and hides things-especially closes off education rather than the free exchange of ideas (I saved the worst for last because this is my version of hell).None of the jobs listed above are terrible, and are wonderful and enriching for the right personality type—just was not best with me.

And people have to be hired and paid to complete them. The idea of a job being useless is argumentative.

Remember word of mouth is one of the best marketing tools, so make sure you don't forget to provide a quality customer service as the first few customers trickle in, they can help you grow your initial user base the quickest, especially with the advent of social networking and the role it plays in influencing large numbers of friends, which can help spread the word like wildfire. That leads me on to my first point: Social Networking - Set yourself up on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and any others you can manage. These tools have given startups a great way of marketing their business for free. Take time to interact with others and offer value. It may be advisable to offer special introductory offers to entice your first few customers. Make them feel special and they might share the experience with their friends, followers, network whatever you want to call them. Give it away - That's right offer your product or service for free! Now this might not always be possible but if you can it's a good way to build up users. You can integrate this with your social networking strategy and offer your first 20 followers or fans your product/service free. This also builds up your social network. Now I know giving your product away for free doesn't make you money but you can offer your product free to gain users. I personally count a customer as someone who has paid for the product or service. giving your product away for free will increase its users and help you gain your first proper customer. If you are an online software company for instance you might even offer a basic free version or free trial in the hope of upgrading them to a paid package at some point, therefore creating a profitable ROI over the lifetime of that customer. Think a little closer to home - Friends, family, ex colleagues may all be potential customers. They would also be more inclined to buying your product as they may feel obliged to help you out. They can also be perfect in helping you see potential problems, where you might be going wrong. Spotting these and fixing it before you get too many customers from further afield who find problems, which may harm your brands reputation, is a benefit of selling to those closer to you. Network - This is an important step in making your business known. It also gives you the chance to learn and meet potential influences that can help spread the word about your business. Attend networking events for those in your industry, social meet-ups for small businesses and conferences. All of these will help you widen your network and help get yourself out there as well as your business. Bear in mind that you yourself are a brand also and this has a direct influence on your company. Paid Advertising - If you have some money to spend, putting it into a marketing budget can help you branch out. Whether you spend on marketing online, offline or both depends on your business. A local restaurant may use both local newspaper ads and Google local ads. A software firm may use only online advertising in the form of PPC (pay per click) such as Google adwords or may pay for banner placement on a targeted website.

While the strategy is designed for service based businesses, it works for product based companies regardless. Here’s what I am going to cover: The Overlooked Strategy: How we use it and get clients/customers quickly and for free.Blocking out 1–2 hours everyday so that you can execute the ‘Four Power Activities’ mentioned below. 1. Hunting.2. Advancing.3. Farming.4. Closing. Pratik, what is this ‘Overlooked Strategy’? The overlooked strategy is often, you know, overlooked. The Overlooked Strategy involves using social media like LinkedIn and Facebook groups. This strategy involves using your personal Facebook profile to join Facebook and LinkedIn groups, if you should know anything about social media in 2020, that would be, the groups on Facebook and LinkedIn is where you can directly reach hundreds of thousands of potential customers directly without paying Zuck anything. Now lets talk more about, the four power activities. I personally suggest clients to block around 1–2 hours daily for this activity as this will definitely increase the business significantly overtime. Surprisingly, many owners need instant results, which isn’t possible and thus, more often than not, they just don’t follow it. This table right here, have made us quite a good amount of money and I believe it would help you as well. Feel free to take a picture and put it on your wall or something, it helps.  🟥 HuntingI use to spend around 45 minutes every day at the start of my work, hunting for new clients/customers in Facebook groups. If your startup is a SaaS based product or a physical product, small activities like, commenting on other people’s post sharing genuine value and plugging your product in, works very well.🟩 AdvancingSpend 15–30 minutes advancing the potential clients/customers. Talk to people you had a conversation with yesterday, etc.🟦 FarmingIts just as what it sounds like, sowing for a better crop tomorrow. Here, we sow content. A really high quality content to ensure when we will be approached by our clients, they shouldn’t be seeing some whacky quotes and designs on our page. Spend money on hiring a professional graphic designer, its worth it.⬜️ ClosingHere, you can close the client by either sending them to your website and let them take the action, which would be followed up as well, which should lead to closing or, simply a strategy session for service based business, where you should give as much value as you can in those 15 minutes, that they should know you know what you’re doing. building you some authority and trust instantly.Its funny how ridiculously well this thing works, yet I do not see many people using strategy like this for their websites or businesses. The best part is, once you know what's working, you can simply automate the entire process mentioned in the table and let it run on its own. Hope it helps. Pratik.

The answer I got “We know you are a good programmer. Can you show us the user interface to see how it works?”. 2. Any useful open source project on Github is too complex for a beginner You’ve probably been told 1000+ times to contribute to open source projects on Github in order to build your portfolio. Don’t! Your life is gonna turn into a dark terrifying tunnel with no end in sight. Most projects, even the one’s you think are simple, are huge piles of code with complex logic. A beginner struggling to understand the basics of a programming language can only hope to get an idea of what’s going on. You are going to waste your precious time figuring out the impossible. 3. Hiring managers won’t look at the code You thought a nicely laid out Github profile would land you the dream job? I am sorry. Hiring managers won’t look at your Github. They will definitely ask you for your github account url. But even if they check it out, they won’t figure our what’s going on. Only my fellow programmers occasionally visit my profile to star a few of my repos. In order to be hired you will have to take a technical test regardless of how much code is already on your Github. 4. Store code on Github, have a different portfolio website. Look at Github as a code storage and version control tool, not a portfolio site that you should direct your clients to. When you build a product you are actually selling, your code will be in a private repo, where nobody ever sets their eyes upon it.

But even if they do, they will always ask you the annoying question you don’t wanna hear - “Where is your real world experience?” Concentrating on Github is a mistake. Contributing to open source projects when a beginner is a holy adventure into frustration. It’s a painful waste of time. Learn by building your own simple versions. Here is my advice: Create simple user interfaces that solve a simple problem that anyone can easily use. For example, create an app that schedules Tweets or Facebook posts. With or without Github, this app with a strong word for you in your job search than plain code that can’t talk by itself on Github. Most developers make mistakes that hinder them from landing their dream jobs fast enough and end up wasting their time. All the best in your job search. Cheers! No. The best way to get a job is to show a working product, that someone can use, and then explain what you did, specifically, to make it work. “I made this whole website. I did the entire menu system for this game. I did the backend for this website and it supports an average count of 100,000 daily users.” That’s what you want. Contributing to open source projects is actually an advanced skill. You can certainly try, but you will spend a ton of time trouble-shooting. That’s fine, if you can learn that way. You might have to fight to have your changes go through.

I did the entire menu system for this game. I did the backend for this website and it supports an average count of 100,000 daily users.” That’s what you want. Contributing to open source projects is actually an advanced skill. You can certainly try, but you will spend a ton of time trouble-shooting. That’s fine, if you can learn that way. You might have to fight to have your changes go through. Sometimes you won’t know when to fight and when to listen, because you don’t have enough experience to know when the other guy is right about a change. That world can be tough, though a lot of guys learn exactly by doing that, over and over. There are only two or three solid ways to get a job: get a degree or certificate of some kind, network (know someone), or finish a product. Those options actually have value in that order. So finishing a product is the most valuable and having a degree is the least. Though note, that I am assuming you are equally skilled in all 3 categories. Obviously you need the talent too. What if you can finish a programming problem but can’t troubleshoot new tech? Like what if the company uses 3 APIs that you have never used before? So your code breaks and you need to find 3 critical pieces of information about a library that is 100 thousand lines long. Do you know how to do that? On time? Can you do it alone? Do you have the courage and soft skills to ask for help, get the help, and make the person helping you feel good about it? Do you ship on time? Software has all kind of issues. There are unexpected bugs. There are maintenance issues. Sometimes you can’t scale. Sometimes you just get bored. Working on a passion project for a few hours a week is nothing like working 40 hours a week on the same boring bullshit, that just needs to get done. Are you productive in that kind of environment? There are so many questions that can’t be answered with Github, or a resume that doesn’t reference completed work, that the other person can relate to. You know what solves all of this problems? A completed project. If I can see what you accomplished, with actual results, then I have something to work with. Then I know that you did everything that is needed to get something done. The 1 thousand things you need to succeed, you have, for sure, unless you are lying. Though, lying about what you did only works for so much, so that’s not usually an issue. Proof. Prove you did something cool. The neat thing about software is that it is so open-ended that you can do pretty much anything. The hard part is picking something. Then you have to finish. Then you’ll get a job, easily. Absolutely NOT!! Those who say otherwise don’t believe them… As an employer, I would prefer a candidate write his own projects from the ground up, no matter how simple they are. This is how you learn. When we start we take baby steps & then we walk and then we run and then we climb mountains. Contributing to popular open-source projects for a newbie is tantamount to climbing a mountain for a baby.

You should have some significant amount of code on GitHub or your GitHub profile ought to be pretty active if you want to come across as a passionate or a serious developer to potential employers or anyone who’s sole aim is to judge you is a total BS. I mean, what were developers doing before GitHub wasn’t a thing? How were they getting jobs? Another trending BS: WHAT… you don’t know how to write the code for reversing a binary tree from scratch & then re-reverse it and then grow some apples and oranges on it, you just use the programming language API & you call yourself a developer? Yeah!! I just use the API because that saves me time & it is well tested. I know there won’t be any errors in production because of the API code. I prefer to use the API because I always have a deadline as opposed to writing the entire API from the ground up. Reversing a binary tree is not what I do in my day to day development work. Coming back to contributing to open source. What if I don’t write open-source code? What if I don’t want to make the code of my application, the core algorithms public? Under these scenarios - Am I not a developer? Will I be debarred by the developer society & sentenced to eternal solitude and blacklisted by all the employers? Honestly, when I was a beginner I tried looking into the code for some popular open-source projects with the hope of contributing to it & was rather overwhelmed and thrown back by the sheer complexity of the project, lack of documentation & the intensity of overwhelming electromagnetic waves coming out of it. Warning: If you are a beginner no matter how passionate you are don’t try contributing to open-source at home.

Rather Churchill uses the phrase to emphasise the contrast with the “Dark Age” that would threaten if the racist, populist and extreme right wing ideologies of the Nazis gained power across the whole world. Let me start with some indisputable facts, although at least one answer denies these. When I visit the Conservative Home website, I can find the speech made by Boris Johnson, on 9 May 2016, over six weeks before the referendum vote on 23 June 2016, where he said, “We can see the sunlit meadows beyond. I believe we would be mad not to take this once in a lifetime chance to walk through that door…” Boris Johnson's speech on the EU referendum: full text Johnson was echoing a speech by his hero, Winston Churchill, that specifically mentioned “sunlit uplands.” Since “sunlit hay meadows” are a well-know Continue ReadingLet me start with some indisputable facts, although at least one answer denies these.

I believe we would be mad not to take this once in a lifetime chance to walk through that door…” Boris Johnson's speech on the EU referendum: full text Johnson was echoing a speech by his hero, Winston Churchill, that specifically mentioned “sunlit uplands.” Since “sunlit hay meadows” are a well-known topographical feature, there is not a whit of difference in meaning between “sunlit meadows” and “sunlit uplands.” So, despite it being denied, elsewhere, it really happened! Reminding people about claims made during the referendum campaign is necessary to prevent the political revisionism that is commonplace with people who supported “Vote Leave.” Those who deny that the phrase was used are deliberately distorting the truth. Andrea Leadsom also used the precise words in the aftermath of the referendum when she stood as a candidate for party leader. So, it has been used by a member of the government, as mentioned in the question. The expression resonated with the public, which is why Johnson used it and commentators made the link to Churchill. I will now go to the website of “Vote Leave” here Michael Gove: ‘The Facts of Life Say Leave’ where we can all read and watch Gove’s speech, delivered on 19 April 2016, more than nine weeks before voting day. Here are some extracts. “The day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.” “BRITAIN CONTINUES IN THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ZONE” “The In campaign often argues that we would find it impossible to reach a trading agreement with EU nations after we vote leave. While there are, of course, some questions up for negotiation which will occupy our highly skilled Foreign Office civil servants, resolving them fully and properly won’t be any more complicated or onerous than the day-to-day work they undertake now navigating their way through EU recitals, trialogues and framework directives.” “There is a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Turkey that all European nations have access to, regardless of whether they are in or out of the euro or EU.26 After we vote to leave we will remain in this zone.” “As our European friends adjust to the referendum result they will quickly calculate that it is in their own interest to maintain the current free trade arrangements they enjoy with the UK. After all they sell far more to us than we do to them.” This is the “they need us more than we need them” claim that was often repeated and is still being repeated today! He continued, “Why would any of them wish to commit an act of profound economic self-harm? And if any of them did, why would the other EU nations let them?” Since Project Yellowhammer disclosed that the UK is willing to leave without a deal and to damage its economy, and no one is now denying that the UK economy will suffer damage, why would the EU 27 not be willing to suffer similarly? Gove also said, “It is sometimes claimed that we will only get free trade if we accept free movement.” He continued, “WE WILL TAKE BACK CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION Further, there are five more countries - Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey - in the queue to join the EU - and the European Commission, as we have just experienced ourselves during the recent negotiation process, regards ‘free movement’ as an inviolable principle of EU membership.” This was “Vote Leave” playing its racist card. Other “Vote Leave” supporters mentioned that 80 million Turks would soon have the right to come to the UK after joining the EU. In fact, there is zero chance of Turkey being admitted to membership in any foreseeable time line. The UK’s recently negotiated - but not yet ratified - trade agreements, with Japan and Turkey, both provide for more rights of those countries’ citizens to move to the UK. India has made clear that it will require more visas for its citizens to move to the UK if the UK wants a trade agreement with it. Boris Johnson made a promise that holders of British Overseas Citizen passports in Hong Kong would be able to come to the UK, too. There was no Parliamentary scrutiny and no referendum on any of this, of course! In conclusion, the promises have not just been abandoned; those who made them, or their apologists, try to deny having done so! In the age of the internet, the true position can be established very easily. However, alongside the denials, we can also learn that the overblown promises will not be kept. Now, citizens of the UK have been warned of the need to prepare for substantial disruption to the economy and much else. The short answer to the question is a resounding “YES!”",2021-03-05T13:13:30.658Z,"Have the promises of sunlit uplands from the government been abandoned in favour of a more realistic picture of what to expect after the transition period ends?

When I enter my mathematics class, as much as I love it, I do not learn how these concepts are applied to the real world. I just sit down, grind through dozens of problems and hope for the highest marks. There are some problems which aim to prepare children for the real world, from unit conversions to compound interest, however none of them engage students. This leads to young Americans being unprepared for the path which lays ahead of them. Most kids won’t need to know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, but most kids will need to know how to file their taxes and avoid an audit from the IRS. Additionally, the current education system stunts creativity amongst the brightest students. Those who desire to be ambitious entrepreneurs and politicians aren’t allowed to pursue their interests, and are forced to labor away writing an analytical essay on Edgar Allan Poe. Why should we be allowing America’s youth, the future of this country, to be denied an opportunity of a proper education; an education which prepares them to change the world for the better. Elon Musk’s own school, Ad Astra, has recognized this and has taken steps to address this problem accordingly.  At Ad Astra they treat kids like kids, and not prisoners. I hope for more schools which see the humanity in kids, and take steps to educate them properly. Let’s not educate kids on disengaging topics which they will likely never apply to their everyday lives. Rather, let’s educate kids on how things are done in the outside world. It’s important to understand the world around us, and I hope that more schools teach that correctly.

The program is definitely not worth it. I would rather spend 20% more and go to Australia or Canada and join a 3rd tier university than join this college and I feel this due to a lot of reasons. Here are some of those. 1. It is not the same as SP Jain Mumbai. Even though they have a similar name, it is not the same. Your final degree is not the same and people are now realising this. It comes down to poor quality of student discussions, the faculty , the management or the placements. 2. You are not their customers, the companies are. Which means they will market and pull you towards joining the program until you pay all the fee. Once you have no liabilities towards them, they don't care about you or your future as they have fresh batch of students who pour money into this scam. All feedback surveys are taken before you finish your course or get placed. Quite similar to Trump University; please refer to John Oliver video about Trump university, it is very similar to SP Jain. 3. Their placement committee is a group of unqualified and insensitive people who have no regard for students. Sure, they market themselves as having the good placements. But it's got nothing to do with the efforts from institut. Students take the initiative for the jobs and only 1% land up in good jobs. The rest are forced to accept whatever job offer they get, irrespective of salary else they will not be provided with any assistance for placements and they have to pay a fine for not taking the jain (there are people who were forced to accept jobs below what they were doing before joining this institution) 4. They will honey dick you to a point where you will not complain. We were provided with lavish villas and expensive facilities when we didn't need them. We invest in a course to learn and come out with a good future. But all the fee we pay is invested towards providing extravagant houses and expansion of SPJain to Spain and California instead of concentrating those funds towards building good futures for its students. 5. The management consists of a bunch of ruthless people who will pounce on a $2 bill given a chance. They literally charged $100 per person for dinner during my graduation, additional charges for renting graduation robes and photographs (about INR100000 for your parents to visit your graduation). 6. Their own employees secretively admit that it is not worth joining this institute. After my course, I spoke to a marketing executive to give my feedback about the course and she reveals that she would never invest in a course like this. Can you imagine that. She has made hundreds of students like me join the course while she herself is not convinced of what the institution offers. 7. They invest heavily in marketing and PR due to which they are ranked highly and cover up all their shortcomings and mistakes. I can go on and on and tell you about how horrible this college is and I just cannot digest the fact that I graduated from this college. If anyone plans to join this college, please don't! It's a waste of money. It's better to take a small part of the expenditure and go on a world tour. Or invest it in a small business of your own (however small it may be) or just look for a new job and work for 2 years, you'll end up in a comparable position. If you really want to pursue higher studies, I suggest you do a proper MBA and not a Global MBA or Universal MBA; nobody cares. Nobody knows SP Jain outside India and nobody will.

Also, our industry interface projects are one of the best platforms to showcase your talent to the company at present projects that were offered by Top MNCs and consulting firms are so challenging and are assigned with a mentor from the company depending on which company your group get. Along with that, we have got many companies coming for internships and full time opportunities. Recently I have got 2 internship opportunities with one of the Big 4 firms and a startup company in Singapore through networking when the school organised corporate meet events but am waiting for other good opportunities with a higher package from the school’s career service. And the most important thing if you go abroad for an MBA or any other studies hardly international schools will provide you career service, campus placement happens only in India. I have friends from Macquire, La Trobe & so on…… living in Sydney who have completed their MBAs but till now for 1 and half years they are not able to land up a job (hope they get it before their visa expires)….. . I feel like people shouldn’t compare SPJSGM with SPJIMR, I know SPJIMR is a good institution in India but it is just like you are comparing an international B school with a national level school but with good historical records, personally I feel like SPJIMR have very low diversification of students, staffs & activities can't say much about the institution as I don’t know much about it. In SPJSGM we have global learning activities, students from different parts of the world, faculties from worldwide reputed institutions from LBS to your Ivy league B schools and even top IIMs too ( both full time- visiting). *PS I wont like to disclose my identity as of now as my mates don’t know about my internship offers also I don’t want them to know about it the environment is super competitive here among the students. The course in SPJGSM pushes you badly out of your limit and might make you addicted to black coffee with only 3 to 4 hours of sleep a day. So, I would suggest analyse it on your own which one is better for you. But a big reply to those in Hindi - “Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad” , so we might not know about SPJIMR and you might not know about SPJSGM so don’t come up with any wrong conclusion.

Just last week Swarm announced the official agreement to join the OpenFinance Network (OFN) to list all Swarm’s SRC-20 security tokens on the trading platform. OFN is the first security token trading platform based and regulated in the US. Which means, now residents in the US can buy, sell and trade legally compliant security tokens, with Swarm’s SRC-20 tokens being one of the foremost to be offered by the platform. Swarm is a pioneer of the security token market, with the partnership of OFN signalling the first of many liquidity sources for SRC-20 token holders, opening the gates to access a wider audience of potential investors. Furthermore, in the last month Swarm has made significant ground in the space with the release of its first individual tech equity token, to represent shares in the $5.8 billion company Robinhood with the (RHET token). Not long thereafter, Swarm released its open-source Market Access Protocol (MAP), inviting security tokens and platforms (like OFN) to integrate and build upon it within their own systems. Swarm has been billed as the blockchain for private equity, providing investors with an alternative means of attaining and offering tokenized shares in real assets - such as properties, companies, institutional investment funds, etc., with no minimum entry fees. All regulatory, investor qualification, and jurisdiction requirements are built into the SRC-20 token and compatible to be traded with all other security tokens. Swarm has built the globally compliant infrastructure to reform the current restrictive processes investors face today by eliminating the middlemen and connecting the investor directly to the equity holder, while ensuring all legal and regulatory requirements are met in a secure and reliable environment. What the security token industry needs in order to accelerate its growth is a universal protocol and language to build upon within a standardized framework, and this is exactly what Swarm has set out to achieve. Soon the SRC-20 tokens will be live and liquid on the OpenFinance Network trading platform, and of course already live the Swarm Fund. A security token is a portable device that authenticates a person's identity electronically by collecting some sort of personal information.

Most PR objectives relate to giving information, influencing opinion and building or sustaining attitudes and feelings. There are different types of PR - internal relations, public affairs, financial, and media and marketing. Marketing PR which can be used to support the launch of a new product, invite press to test drive a new car, create an event when the 50th shop is opened, and sponsorship which can be used to defray costs and cement relationships with suppliers and distributors by offering free tickets to events, for example, or restaurants may invite journalists to review their new menu. Depending on the problem or objective, audiences will also be divided into primary and secondary groups. Launching a new product will mean more emphasis is placed on marketing PR groups, rather than financial audiences or the government. Furthermore, an individual can belong to more than one audience, so consistent PR communications across audiences is vital to avoid conveying contradictory messages to the same members of different publics. In today’s social media environment, I often think it can be like King Canute trying to hold back the tide and weary organisations and their PR people face a danger of becoming reactive, it’s all just too much sometimes. Take, for example, the disgruntled passenger who posted a sponsored tweet to express their anger regarding their lost luggage, only to be met with the reply: “Our Twitter account is only manned 9–5.” In today’s 24x7x365 “always on” economy and particularly in the travel industry which is highly competitive, you’d think BA could have staff on standby at home monitoring the account. I think it’s just the size of the task versus the small percentage of complaints likely to occur and the cost involved, that stops them investing in such slick customer service. But, you’d like to think that, God forbid, an aeroplane crashing on the runway would mean their Crisis Management plan would swing into action slickly and smoothly no matter what time of day or night. I’m pretty sure it would. PR is all a matter of proportional response. In order to survive in the ever-evolving communications business, with radically changing technologies, PR practitioners need to continue to do more work in moving towards positioning themselves as strategic advisers. It’s not easy. Nowadays, one size does not fit all. You need people who are specialists. For example, someone geared towards video and AV production will think very differently to the blogger and content creator. On the other hand it makes sense then for the PR manager to position themselves more strategically within an organisation, aligning themselves with the business objectives and supporting the company’s long-term profit base as they can oversee the success interpretation and distribution of key messages to markets, via the different specialist heads of divisions. In other words, if you just leave your specialists to get on with their bit, then fragmentation and ultimately confusion will reign in the marketplace(s) and as you know, “a confused mind does not buy”. The importance of relationship building is still uppermost in the PR manager’s tool-kit, particularly with the media, the heavyweights such as Huffington Post, spring to mind. Being in august journals such as this, can boost share price and provide valuable authenticity and credibility among buying audiences. There are three areas where the PR manager needs to focus - training and development so as to remain relevant and valued; expanding the use of PR as a strategic tool, instead of dropping back into being just one of the promotional tools and using PR as a means to measure and evaluate results which in turn it can communicate to the Management or the Board or the Client, thus proving the value and worth of the function in the strategic business arena to grow the business. PR is also used for financial results, employee relations, crisis management and reputation management and sometimes may not be called upon to do anything except be “on stand by” should a disaster occur in which case the pre-prepared plans will quick into action. PR is an important tool in understanding changes in internationalisation, Government regulatory departments and their impact on marketing activity and market entry. Back in the day you used to have to be a working practitioner in the PR industry for 10–12 years before you could apply and call yourself a Member of the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) still the main body for individual membership today. That’s how long it took me. These days, to reflect the speed of change, it’s now only 2 years. The Millennials have taken over. Entitled, super-qualified, smart, competitive etc., etc., coupled with the fact that the industry has fragmented and become more specialised. At the same time, it is integrated! How does that work? Well, you still want your integrated marketing communications - a Brand, a Vision, a Strategy but within that you now have to have specialisms, the “PR Manager” can no longer do it all. Thus, some agencies are re-forming around Ideas, Content and Creative (Strategy). Traditional PR agencies are regrouping with digital agencies to ensure they cover all specialisms. One account handler (PR executive) can no longer do it all. What works for written content, may not (will not?) work for audio or social etc. Certainly, the PR person has made the jump from tactical to strategic and is very much a powerhouse when it comes to “hacks” to leap frog a company forward - a viral video can be more than worth its weight in gold and PR people are traditionally creative brain-stormers. Increases in the speed of communication and the ever-increasing channels of communication mean that the PR executive has had to extend their capabilities from beyond their traditional word-smithing capabilities. Since the primary function of PR is to communicate, changes in technology have a particularly significant role in this industry, creating new means to deliver messages and how messages are delivered through new mediums such as advertorials, infomercials. PR has come of age in that it now seeks to employ management professionals from “blue chips”, those who understand business agendas and can therefore integrate with the management team. From the PR manger’s viewpoint, they wish to use their experiences and awareness of the company (or client’s) diverse mix of publics (and channels) to help the strategy formulation. The PR function also now recognises it cannot do everything and will pull in the specialists and align campaigns accordingly, it’s keeping it all together that’s the challenge and measuring and reporting back has become very complex which is why CRM systems are so valued, so campaigns can be run and monitored using a dashboard. This is where technology is so useful to the PR function, as it frees up the PR manager to oversee the communications strategy, create the messages, divide it up and then leave it to the specialists to get on with the execution of the campaigns tailored to suit their channel or medium. It also provides invaluable reporting that can’t be done any other way. This is why it’s so helpful to the PR manager/function as traditionally it’s sometimes been a role which has struggled to prove its worth. Here’s a start for this discussion.
