As people are starting to become more health conscious and/or requiring health interventions, an integrated approach is needed to best achieve overall health in patients/clients. The health coach role has arrived as a long overdue solution. Health coaches provide guidance and management in the major components of health, including diet, physical activity and wellness. They help people identify their ideal health goals, define a customized plan and guide them in putting the plan into action. This basically involves determining what areas of their clients’ lifestyle need to be changed for the better and making sure those changes are implemented. Here are five of the most popular health coach certifications, including how you can get them and other important details on each program:  1. NSHC – National Society of Health Coaches The NSHC offers a Health Coach Certification, which is the NSHC’s Certified Health Coach, CHC. This certification is only open to licensed and credentialed healthcare professionals. Individuals working as any of the following may take this program: physician, physician assistant– certified, licensed clinical counselor, doctor of chiropractic/podiatry, nurse practitioner/clinical nurse specialist, RN/LPN/LVN, therapists and assistants– physical/occupational/speech pathology / respiratory, dentist/licensed dental hygienist, registered dietician/CDR dietetic technician, CBNS certified nutrition specialist, psychologist, certified diabetic educator, pharmacist, NATA certified athletic trainer, ACSM certified exercise physiologist/ACSM certified exercise specialist, licensed acupuncturist. Those interested in the program, but not licensed or credentialed in any healthcare profession, may receive a ‘certificate of completion’ in lieu of the certification. The program material is the same for both the certification and the certificate of completion. Both the Certification and the Certificate of Completion program are offered in a hard-copy binder, with Skills Competency and tests conducted online. The re-certification, which must be done every 5 years, is also completed through an online examination. Recertification must be completed prior to the certification’s expiration date and the person seeking recertification must be a current member of the NSHC. When you purchase the program, you become a member for one year free and the annual renewal fee is $50.  2. American Council on Exercise (ACE) Geared towards both healthcare providers and fitness professionals, ACE’s Life Coach Certification is designed to help qualify and expand career opportunities for those looking to integrate additional health strategies into the lives of their clients/patients. For this certification, you have the option of purchasing the exam as part of one of two self-study packages. The “Standard” package includes ACE Academy which consists of weekly email courses reminding you to keep your studies on track, including an online practice exam. As an independent study, you can prepare for the ACE Health Coach Certification exam at home and at your own convenience. The exam itself is all computer-based and can be conveniently taken at one of over 500 testing locations.  3. Dr. Sears Wellness Institute The institute offers three different health coach certifications that are designed to get students certified within six weeks (longer if they take more than one program). Certification allows the individual to begin working as a health coach, teaching the tenets of Dr. Sears’ L.E.A.N. (Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitude and Nutrition) system. The six training programs (based on stages of life) available for certification are: Family Coach – A certification whose curriculum is targeted towards coaching families, educating them towards healthy lifestyle choices and preventing/fighting childhood obesity.Pregnant & Nursing Moms Coach – This certification has a targeted curriculum towards helping pregnant and nursing moms about how to stay healthy, reduce their stress, eat right, nutrition, and how to have their spouses involved for a positive pregnancy and post-pregnancy experience.Adults & Seniors Coach – This certification has a targeted curriculum towards helping adults and the elderly how to stay healthy, reduce stress, prevent disease, and help improve cognitive functions and nutritional needs.All the coaching programs are offered online making this program widely accessible to prospective health coaches. Re-certification is on an annual basis and is done by mail, along with a $145 fee. As long as you keep your certifications current and continue to pay the annual fee as a member in good standing you will have access to their online products, materials, marketing materials, and are eligible to have potential clients in your area be referred to you as well as advanced notifications of new product, workshops and promotions. There are some best life coaches like Alyson Cohen, Creative Calling Coaching, Donna LeBlanc, Dr. Gigi Arnaud, Eva Centeno, Anna Goldstein, Hilary Jacobs Hendel, Julie Melillo, Liz Morrison, Nick DiMattina",2021-03-06T15:17:02.962Z,"What is the best health coaching certification?

Here is a map of where it is legal or not to give nutritional advice, depending on your credentials. Empowering Professionals To Transform Health Through Nutrition There are many people who call themselves “health coaches” with varying levels of credibility. Some of them scare me so much that I have no problem reporting them to the department of public health in their state. For example, I once encountered a “health coach” who had done some unknown, unaccredited online training. She called herself a migraine expert. I consider this a danger to the public. Migraines can be either seriously dangerous or benign, and this person had zero credible qualifications to determine which. If I see a new patient with migraines, I do a complete neurological and general physical exam, a thorough history to determine the cause, order some lab work to rule out basic pathology, and if necessary order an MRI and refer to a neurologist. A health coach is simply not trained or qualified to do these things and has no business calling herself a migraine expert. If you worked with a client who did not get proper care because you led them to believe they did not need it, intentionally or not, you would be in very serious legal trouble. If you want to help people with their health, please seek qualified training as a dietitian, exercise instructor/trainer, nurse, or a multitude of other qualified health professions that lead to a license or certification that holds legal weight. Please talk to a lawyer for more information. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T15:17:42.980Z,"Do I need a degree to become a health coach? ",Quora

Hilda Labrada Gore I was always a poor swimmer. In all honesty, I once tried out for the swim team and nearly drowned in the effort. No kidding. The lifeguard had to jump in to save me, as I was going under. I was a middle-class kid with an average upbringing, so I figure I simply must have had a swim lesson, here or there, during my elementary years, but basically whenever I was in the water, it was like my attempt to make the swim team. I looked more like a person in distress, flailing around, gasping for air, than any kind of graceful, Olympic champion Katie Ledecky. To date, I am still in the same place when i Continue ReadingI was always a poor swimmer. In all honesty, I once tried out for the swim team and nearly drowned in the effort. No kidding. The lifeguard had to jump in to save me, as I was going under. I was a middle-class kid with an average upbringing, so I figure I simply must have had a swim lesson, here or there, during my elementary years, but basically whenever I was in the water, it was like my attempt to make the swim team. I looked more like a person in distress, flailing around, gasping for air, than any kind of graceful, Olympic champion Katie Ledecky. To date, I am still in the same place when it comes to swimming. But my sister, on the other hand, has drastically improved her technique. The difference? She found a swim coach. I did not. And why did she work with one? She wanted to attempt a triathlon and these always have a swim component. She was motivated. To have any chance of finishing, let alone finishing well, she was going to need coaching. What did she learn? Her technique was all wrong. She had to discard bad habits and incorporate new ones. She kept her commitment to meet with her coach regularly; she followed his lead and trained faithfully. The result? She was successful—completing not only one triathlon but several over the years! Me? I’m still flailing around, but I don’t want to put energy into this. So I haven’t decided to work with a swim coach. In terms of a health or wellness coach, if you find yourself “flailing and going under” too often when it comes to optimal well-being—you’re either sluggish or have pain, you’re unmotivated and inactive—a coach may be just the ticket. But remember that coaches only work if you do. You have to be motivated and willing to incorporate new habits for a change to result.",2021-03-06T15:26:10.773Z,"Where do health coaches work? ",Quora

The most important distinction is that a certified behavioral health coach is also a licensed psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, or master’s level mental health professional. Their approach to working with coaching clients uses similar coaching techniques and tools, but behavioral health coaches base their work on cognitive psychology and scientifically-proven methods of making behavioral changes that lead to lifelong transformations. Despite the fact that behavioral health coaching is based in positive psychology, behavioral coaches do not offer counseling or therapy to clients. Think of it this way – counselors and therapists focus on identifying how your past affects your current feelings and behaviors while coaches focus on modifying your current behaviors so you can reach your future goals of health and happiness. How Behavioral Health Coaching Helps You Working with a behavioral health coach gives you access to expert support and guidance on your path to positive behavior modification. Leveraging their knowledge and background, behavioral health coaches use principles of psychology, philosophy, motivational interviewing, goal clarification techniques, and life skills training to help you increase your happiness, improve your relationships, and enhance your effectiveness at work, study, home, or in social situations. Together, you and your coach will define the behaviors that are stopping you from reaching your full potential and create an action plan based on your personal vision and values, so you can take control of your situation. The best actions for you could include coaching sessions, homework, referrals, or coordination of care with other community resources. Once you and your coach define your goals and create a plan to reach those goals, your coach will hold you accountable so you stay on track and support you on your path to wellbeing by providing guidance, motivation, and structure along the way. Should You Work with a Behavioral Health Coach? Behavioral health coaching can help you achieve the goals that are important to you in any aspect of your life and wellbeing.

Behavioral coaches recognize that you’re the expert on you. Your coach is there to support you in making successful changes, but you’re always in control. How to Choose a Behavioral Health Coach Choosing a behavioral health coach is an important decision, and it’s critical that you select a coach who has been certified by a leading university or program. Make sure your behavioral health coach holds the necessary advanced degrees in addition to a certification from a reputable source.

It’s harsh but it’s true: no one is going to take fitness or nutrition advice from someone who is unhealthy and/or overweight. If you want to be a health coach you need to first coach yourself. Only once you are at your optimal health and fitness level can you start helping others get there. Once you have coached yourself you can start coaching others. To do this you need to improve all the skills necessary for coaching. These include: time management skills, communication skills, listening skills and problem solving skills. Once you have improved these skills you should find that your overall coaching skill improves immensely! I hope this has helped in some way and I wish you the best of luck. If you would like more information on how to improve your skills and techniques as a coach then I would suggest that you turn to more reliable sources such as books and/or seminars.

Being a medical assistant is NOT the same as being a coach. It is a particular discipline that has to be handled in a particular way. Coaching is not giving advice, mentoring, selling or teaching. It is its own process based on empowering the client to make their own choices. You don’t at any point in time tell the client what to do, imprint your ideas on them, try to force them to do anything or sell them any ideas. You also do not try and solve their issues for them. There are many skills to be learned to do coaching well and they need to be practiced and finehoned in a setting that is supportive and where you will actually be allowed to make mistakes and learn from them, and to finesse your output. You cannot do this on a short two-week course, in my view, and the candidates that I mentored through their training, who had done just a two-week course and who came to me after that, were nowhere near ready to coaching and were basically not able to do it. We more or less had to start from scratch. Do yourself a wonderful favour and opt to do a long course, spreaad over 4 or five months, where you do a module every month, so a long weekend, and have lots of time to think about your coaching, to practice it in many different forms - triads, phone coaching circles, one-on-ones, group practice, private written projects and self-coaching, as well as hiring your own coach during that time. That way you will really be able to absorb it all, think your piece, find out what kind of health coach you want to be (not simply the field you want to work in), maybe even compose a business plan, and set up a website for example. Be savvy, and you will progress in leaps and bounds, stand on solid ground and your practice will be unimpeachable. Rush it, and you will be one of the ones who brings the industry into ill repute and whose mistakes we have to continually correct. You won’t want to be in my position later on, either - when you are qualified and properly trained, you will want people to have done the same. You’ll want them to heed your words and have some integrity about themselves. Trust me on this. Only a few months ago I was contacted by someone who worked in Sales and who wanted to be a Sales Coach. I thought he was genuine in wanting to do this properly and invested time in talking to him about the profession of coaching. He was entirely ignorant, did not understand the difference between coaching, mentoring, teaching or any of these things. I was not surprised to find this in a beginner, but I was shocked to hear that he felt two conversations with me had equipped him to call himself a coach. I put this aside and offered to coach him and teach him what I know, which comes from 10 years in Change Management and 20 years in pure coaching. At that point he became uncontactable. I terminated the communication with him and told him how disappointed I was in his attitude and that I felt he would come acropper. Shortcuts never work. You will be found out. It’s a meaningful profession - I can’t think of a better reason to get up in the morning - and it deserves the best of us. I do hope you will agree. I wish you all the very best for your chosen path.",2021-03-06T15:36:46.239Z,"Can a medical assistant be a health coach? ",Quora

Here is a map of where it is legal or not to give nutritional advice, depending on your credentials. Empowering Professionals To Transform Health Through Nutrition There are many people who call themselves “health coaches” with varying levels of credibility. Some of them scare me so much that I have no problem reporting them to the department of public health in their state. For example, I once encountered a “health coach” who had done some unknown, unaccredited online training. She called herself a migraine expert. I consider this a danger to the public. Migraines can be either seriously dangerous or benign, and this person had zero credible qualifications to determine which. If I see a new patient with migraines, I do a complete neurological and general physical exam, a thorough history to determine the cause, order some lab work to rule out basic pathology, and if necessary order an MRI and refer to a neurologist. A health coach is simply not trained or qualified to do these things and has no business calling herself a migraine expert. If you worked with a client who did not get proper care because you led them to believe they did not need it, intentionally or not, you would be in very serious legal trouble. If you want to help people with their health, please seek qualified training as a dietitian, exercise instructor/trainer, nurse, or a multitude of other qualified health professions that lead to a license or certification that holds legal weight. Please talk to a lawyer for more information.",2021-03-06T15:37:25.493Z,"What is a financial health coach? ",Quora

While coaches don’t need to be an expert in every area that the client may address, they do need to have a broad and deep understanding of how to support people through the process of change. That said, if someone touts themselves as a health coach, I’d look for a HEALTHY coach. Most coaches offer an opportunity to chat either on the phone or in person before beginning sessions. It is important to gain an understanding of their perspectives on health to determine if you share similar values. How did they come to be a health coach? What relevant experience and training do they have? A coach can certainly be energetic and enthusiastic about what they can offer, but if somebody promises you the moon and the stars, be wary. Nobody can guarantee results except the you, the client. Because of confidentiality concerns, coaches may not be able to provide client testimonials, so I would not let that be a make or break issue. But you might want to ask about some success stories they have had. You might even wish to ask about occasions when clients have not succeeded, why they didn’t succeed, and what the coach learned from that experience (every client is a new learning experience.) Of course, word of mouth referrals are often the best referral source for coaches, so asking around on social media or from other health and wellness practitioners is a great place to start.

You will have ample amount of time to dedicate to yourself and your family. Professionalism is maintained throughout without impacting your personal life. Currently I am able to manage it with my IT job, learning the art of Perfumery, keeping myself fit. Having said that, I know lot of people doing it full-time and are doing it extremely well. The pay is extremely nice as well if you work hard. The life gets stressful if you don't enjoy being a coach. Also remember, just because your learn how to create a diet and a workout routine, doesn't make you a coach. There is a huge difference. I have seen some people who are expert when it comes to technical knowledge but show absolutely no empathy towards their clients when required. Client handling is altogether different. If you don't learn that , your life will get extremely stressful. How? Because remember when you are dealing with lot of clients you are not only dealing with them at metrics or at charts level, but at an emotional level as well. I have been a coach with Fittr for over 3 years now and it has been amazing. Progressed from Basic Coach to now an Advanced Coach while multitasking professionally and personally. It all boils down to how you take this work. Take it as any other job, you might be unhappy. Take it as an opportunity to make difference in people's lives which even money cannot bring, you will be in trance :)",2021-03-06T15:42:06.011Z,"What was your experience with a health coach like?

Since East Asia has a history of famines, it was considered to be a good sign if your leader was fat, because it signified that heaven would be pleased with the citizens who had looked after their leader by giving them a plentiful harvest.  If a leader was seen as thin, it would mean one or even both of the things below: The peasants were selfish by not giving their leader enough food to make himself physically powerfulHeaven itself had turned on their leader, and would in turn look upon the citizens as well Many Chinese and Korean emperors were known to sleep in a Buddhist temple during a famine with nothing more than a light sheet of clothing so that they could humble themselves before the gods in hopes that a new harvest would come about.  Above: Chinese Communist Leader Mao Zedong Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine - Wikipedia And since communist leaders are effectively left-wing nationalists, they would observe their country’s traditions with a communistic spin. And since East Asians have a long tradition of associating fat leaders as being powerful, the leaders of China from Mao Zedong to Deng Xiaoping, as well as the North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un would have gone along and adopted the tradition of becoming fat upon assuming their roles as leader.  Kim Jong Il was not a particularly fat man even after becoming leader, and he was even less so prior to 1994 when his father, Kim Il Sung, died very suddenly only days after meeting up with former president Jimmy Carter.  Above: Jimmy Carter Visiting President Kim Il Sung In June 1994 The story behind Carter's North Korean trip And while it may seem a bit odd, as westerners tend not to find obesity attractive even among their leaders — to many old fashioned people living in East Asia, seeing your 500 pound leader being so gluttonous that it feels as though he could knock even Donald Trump across the planet with a belly throw is seen as being sexually attractive to a lot of people living in these countries.  Above: A Very Sexy Man! Therefore, when someone asks why it is that their leader is so big while their people are thin, you should mention that it is due to the tradition that a big leader is equated to powerful among a significant portion of the population who may also be superstitious enough to believe that they are appeasing the heavens by fattening up their leader.  And I am sure that such a tradition is something that Kim Jong Un cannot complain about!

Can be done online, too. And classroom program fees could fall between $2,000 and $10,000. You’ll find many ads showing programs that complete in 2 months and $500, but they are all crap. To be honest, no program makes you a life coach. It will only make you look professional. Healing hearts is a born ability, and can be developed by practice. That is all. Life Coach is nothing but a torch which shows the way in the dark. Life Coach is nothing but a gentle breeze which blows on your face while you are being tortured by the scorching heat. Life Coach is nothing but an ear which listens to all that you’ve have to say, and understands all that you couldn’t express in words. He is a shoulder. He is a best friend. He is a lap of your mother. These qualities are very rare. People of this generation do not open their heart. They do not talk about their fears, their insecurities, their confusions, their inabilities. But, if you have across some people who have discussed these things with you. If you have come across people who came to you - crying, and went back - smiling, only to never come back with similar difficulties again. Then you have the ability to become a Life Coach. Practically, I would suggest you to Talk to people whenever you get a chance. Preferably, in person. Smile at them genuinely. Ask how their day is going. If they are in a hurry, do not hold them back. If they seem free enough to chat with, ask sensible questions. Do not directly get into their personal life. That is not the aim. You are not being their life coach here. You are only practicing to be comfortable with people, and making them feel comfortable with you. It is very important. Practice this more and more and more. With each time, it will make you a better communicator. It will erase your own doubts, and your ideas will get clearer and clearer. It is again very important. People only trust and follow the man who speak well, and whose thoughts are clear.Listen to people patiently. Observe their actions. Observe their body language. Observe what makes them awkward, what makes them switch the topic, what makes them smile, and what makes them open up. Again, you are not being their life coach here. You are only experiencing to talk with people. You are only experience to know about people. You are experiencing to communicate with people. Not just talking.Be calm. Be genuine. If they ask about your opinion, tell them genuinely. If you do not know, tell them you do not know. If you are scared, tell them you are scared. It will reciprocate. People will start being more genuine with you. They will be calmer with you. And that is again very important.Be a good writer. Be a good storyteller. Whenever someone comes to you with some problem, share a personal experience with them. May it be something you read somewhere. May it be your friend’s. Doesn’t matter. But, always start with a story. Then tell them what happened when you did X, and what happened when you did Y. What you realized years after that incident. How has the passing time showed you different frames of reference, and what have you learnt from it. You do not have to give them exact solutions. People are intelligent enough to figure it out themselves. You just have to share your experiences with them.There will be times when you’ll have no experiences to share. Not enough knowledge. Times when you’ll be skeptical about sharing your friends’. Or times when you’ll find unsatisfactory look on the faces of people. Well, that is what you need to discover. That is what will show you your niche. Your expertise. Your specialty. You can’t coach everyone. You can only coach people who are walking the path you’ve walked in the past.Now, after having fun by doing all this for years (after being confident enough,) start charging people. Build a professional website. Quora works, too. That is what I’m doing right now. Market yourself. Be shameless. Give talks. Print out posters. Jot down your thoughts. Share your experiences. Share your learning. You’ll not get clients often. In India, hardly anyone pays for counseling. But, if your previous clients - those good old people - were really benefited by your counseling, they would definitely bring money to you. They would direct their friends to you. Word of mouth will do wonders if you have brought wonders in people’s lives. Selflessly.I am also improving myself through all the methods I mentioned above. I am learning public speaking. I am having weak verbal skills. Introvert! But, my words and stories heal the bleeding hearts, people say. I do online coaching successfully. I am fondly known as SRK from Dear Zindagi among my school friends and my readers.  I guide serious writers. I share personal experiences with JEE aspirants. I motivate failures.

I apologize for the grammar or sentence cohesion - its late whilst I type this, so I could be off. The short answer is: NO! I have never come across an affiliate marketeer who is making a significant income from it and is willing to share this proof with me.  Not one.  Ever. Been 4+ years in the hunt and I know my fair share of affiliate marketeers. I have personally been banned from forums like www.warriorforum.com because I specifically challenged all those so called gurus who were selling their work for $97, or $47 or $27 (and made $100,000s from it), to show me proof.  The only proof I wanted was either a video recording of them entering their PayPal account or Bank Account statement that was showing the same.  Never got it.  I suggested many other options/alternatives to them to validate their wild income claims, only to get booted time and time again. yes, I tried under various IDs, etc.  Is there income from affiliate marketing - sure there is. Is it enough for people to make the wild claims they do - to sustain a large living of it - NO! That is a pure scam (in my opinion) and I refuse to budge from my stance, unless shown otherwise (i.e. proven wrong). Affiliate marketing benefits the company whose product/service you are selling. Let me repeat that again, affiliate marketing benefits the company you are promoting --- not you! Simple. 1000s of people sign up and promote their products in the hopes of making an income. If 1000s of people are actually promoting the product, then the products would be flying off the shelves - the sad reality of it is - they are not (in majority of the cases). If you promote say a product from Amazon, the cookie is only valid for 24-hours! Now lets say you have 50,000 visitors a month, realistically, 100-150 or so will click in (I say this from experience and from having seen many high-traffic blogs, who do affiliate marketing). Out of this 100-150 clicks, they usually have 1-3 sales per month. That's it. Those who claim that their cookie is valid for 45 days (good!), but what about the product? Either it is crap (a fact easily verified by the percentage of the income you would be getting back from the sale price), or the mere fact that 10,000+ people are promoting it. The chances of you making a sale is slim to none. The amount of money you spend in promoting the blog and promoting the product, does not do justice to the income made. Many people will tell you of how to go about making 100s of sites with micro-niches, etc. and you will be raking in the money. Please go ahead and try and prove me wrong. I would love to see to the contrary.  Like I cited, affiliate income is there, but not enough to make a significant living from it. Most of the Long Sales Letters you will see, with screen shots of crazy income accumulated over a 24-hour period, etc. are all fake. 100% fake. Why is it that only in this industry (Internet Marketing / Affiliate Marketing) do you see those LONG winded sales letters and when you try to leave the page, a message pops up asking you (convincing you for the last time) not to walk away from this lucrative opportunity.  I have seen so called gurus on Warrior Forum go bankrupt and absolutely broke. I keep bringing Warrior Forum again and again, because it is highlighted as the mecca for internet and affiliate marketing. The people who really are making money are those who are selling their products and services. A person who makes a product for say amazing SEO plugin for WordPress is making money. The affiliates are not. For example, Thesis WordPress theme by DIY Themes is surely making money, their affiliates are ""sooooooo"" many (emphasis supplied), that the entire market is chopped up and distributed amongst the 1000s of affiliates and what each gets in turn, are a few $100 at best (if at all). Its a numbers game for those starting out, and the odds are stacked against you. Why on earth would a person who has discovered a way or promotes a secret recipe of making $10,000s a month, share it with you for a few measly US$?  Answer - because that is the fraternity con.  All the other gurus would back each other and the novices like you and me, those who lie in bed all day, dreaming of how we could go online and make a very decent income and quit our jobs and take the vacations, get conned by these so called gurus, and money from our wallet (you will notice) will flow to 'them' be it in shape of SEO tactics, SEM, back links acquisitions, webpages setup, landing pages sales, mentorships, classes, plug-ins, robots, automated techniques, mailing list magic, 100% sure copy writing services, more secret recipes, analytical tools, more courses, e-books, more reading, the infamous ""try harder, don't give up now"" or ""shampoo-wash-rinse-repeat"" mantras that are constantly pounded into your subliminal mind. Those with deep pockets, and I mean deep, who have the resources to buy 1000s of domains, lots of resources working for specialized micro-niche pages, and driving traffic to them, one way or the other, are making money. They have a wide spectrum of websites which is equally balanced with a wide spectrum of website traffic (very high traffic to very low traffic) and they average a very decent income. But they are not on these boards selling their secrets. They stay away from such crap and continue to focus on what works for them. They have the money to do very large scale buying of Adwords and other keywords to drive traffic to their website and keep you out on the periphery.  Every story you read about affiliate marketing, is like a cocaine story. There is a pusher in there, trying to promote or push their product or service to you, whilst at all time keeping you mesmerized by the promise of the big affiliate income source. Its like when I was young and I read the ""Emperor's New Clothes"".... only a little boy could see that the Emperor riding on the horse was only in his undies...and if you continue to believe in this fable, that is all that you will have left. Ask around for how many have been successful at affiliate marketing and what portion does it constitute of their overall income - the answer would be surprising for you - very little. Meagre in most cases. Ask around to find someone who really made it - in affiliate marketing, and the answer is you won't find many. You will however find that most of them transition to some form of a product or service they sell to you, be it content writing, guru-ness teaching, learning the ropes, e-books, sales, etc. all to tell you how to make it in affiliate marketing world. Quite a contradiction.  The game is a loop. This answer is not about being venomous at all. But it is about letting people know - think before you take the leap. The internet has simply exploded with the false pretense of fast money, cars, vacations, debt-free living, beaches, jewelry, fine wines, villas by the beach and city condos.... I think you know better. There is no harm in learning affiliate marketing. Maybe you could be the one who makes it and proves me wrong. If so, I shall have a lot of respect for you. But do so with care. Most of what is taught - is freely available on the Internet.  Freely! You just have to be patient, and clever in seeking out the material and putting it all together. I don't expect everyone to 'get it' - and this is what cons rely on, they hope you don't get it and then con their way into making sure you are on the long but sure path of getting it - which sadly never arrives. You will be flustered, frustrated, angry and feel violated once you discover how much money you have wasted on it. For good orders sake, don't put your hand into your savings or college funds, retirement fund.  The only people I know off, who are making money, but still I have not seen an income statement to that effect and hence I am very cautious, are the people who run very large mailing lists. When you have numbers in the 25,000+ readers in your mailing list, it is very well possible to make affiliate money off them. However, having said this, there are two caveats to the above statement.  Many readers feel 'cheated' if a link they clicked on in your list, somehow made you money (yes, crazy thought, but it is true).You cannot continually keep pitching affiliate links to your readers, else they will deem the list to be a source of spam, and unsibscribe themselves from your list.(Mailing) Lists are run like campaigns, spaced a few days apart. The income can be 'decent' provided the offering and the campaign was well thought of. However, I might add, it takes (months, if not years) to have such a list of so many people who opt-in, and the key point to note in lists is that they cater to a very specific vertical/niche. You can only market within that niche. Building such a huge list of subscribers takes a lot of money, so if the Question is can you make it - via lists, I would say, the jury is still out. I am 'convinced' it can be made, however, I have yet to see proof for the same. I don't know what the big deal is why people cannot share proof. The affiliate marketing scam is equal in size if not greater in size to the Nigerian 401 scam. Yes, you really have a person willing to give you $ 1 Million. BS you say? Then how come you buy the same BS packaged in a different way, when someone tells you how you can make millions in affiliate marketing by buying their <insert product/service name here> for $X? Stay in this niche long enough, and you will unknowingly transform from an affiliate marketeer to a provider of services or a product (mark my words!). Then you too shall be trying to find newbies the 5,000+ people who are logged in on Warrior Forum or other places like Digital Point, etc. and be making a comfortable living, in trying to sell 'stuff' to these people (mostly genuine stuff but equally balanced by a lot of fraudulently pre-packed BS). And the best part is the newbies are in millions! Millions! Imagine the possibility of duping them! The subliminal advertising is so convincing, you will be drawn to it - the gravity of making money always will lure you. My advise, keep your wallet/money away! Do NOT go on the impulsive shopping spree. The 1 day only left, or a limited time offer. It just never ends.

In response I would like to share with you an interesting article excerpt from Christian Mickelsen who put into words that may make interesting reading for some people considering coaching as a career for themselves:  “5  Things  Most  Coaching  Schools  Won’t  Tell  You”  1. You  Do  Not  Have  to  Be  Certified  to  Start  a  Coaching  Business  Contrary  to  popular  belief,  you  do  not  have  to  be  certified  to  be  a  coach  or call  yourself  a  coach.  Coaching  is  an  unregulated  profession,  therefore anyone  can  call  themselves  a  coach.  Coaching  is  a  service  profession  where  you  will  be  affecting  peoples’  lives. Therefore,  it  is  highly  recommended  you  become  trained  so  you  know what you  are  doing.   The  majority  of  people  who  come  into  coaching  are  completely astonished at how  different  coaching  is  from  what  they  expected.  They  soon  realize that while  they  may  have  been  helping  people  or  giving  people  advice before,  they 100%  were  not  coaching.  Learning  the  coaching  process  teaches  you  how  to  help  people  help themselves  and  unlock  their  own  answers.  Most  students  are  happily surprised  at  how  much  more  they  are  able  to  empower  people  after learning this  process.   Why  it’s  smart  to  be  trained:  Being  a  trained  coach  not  only  helps you better  help  your  clients,  but  it  also  is  smart  for  you.  Because  using the coaching  process  doesn’t  involve  giving  advice,  it  releases  you  from any liability  for  decisions  your  clients  may  make,  which  is  a  huge  peace of mind when  running  a  business.  It still would not negate to have adequate liability insurance. During  a  coach  training  program,  you  will  learn  to  coach  and  become certified.  Even  though  it’s  not  “illegal”  to  run  a  coaching  business  without being  certified,  it  can  help  build  trust  with  clients.  Also,  some  students who  do  executive  and  business  coaching  may need  to  show  their certification  to win  contracts  with  corporations.   2. Most  of  the  time  it  is  completely  unnecessary  to  become  credentialed through  an  outside  organization  such  as  the  ICF  or  IAC.  Suddenly,  everyone  is  a  coaching  accrediting  body!  There’s  the  ICF,  IAC, PICB, Board  Certified  Coach,  and  many,  many  more!   So  which  one  do  you  need  to  become  affiliated  with  or  credentialed with?  Probably  none  of  them!  There  are  an  estimated  500,000  “coaches”  in  the  world  today.  Under 50,000 people  are  members  of  such  organizations  and  under  10,000  are credentialed  through  “accrediting  bodies.” You  can  look  at  this  2  ways:  1.  It’s  prestigious  and  sets  you  apart  to become credentialed  through  the  ICF  or  IAC  or  2.  Since  it  isn’t  that  hard to  become credentialed,  if  it  was  really  beneficial,  more  people  would  sign up.  3. It  can  be  counterproductive  to  become  credentialed  through  the  ICF  or IAC.  You  may  be  thinking,  “well  it  can’t  hurt  me  to  have  more  coaching certifications,  right?”  Wrong!  It  takes  time,  energy,  and  money  to  become  certified  through  outside governing  bodies.  Often,  it’s  much  more  money  than  their  fees  for  the application  itself.  Usually  you  have  to  have  a  certain  amount  of  training hours,  mentor  coaching  with  their  coaches  ($250-$750  an  hour),  and that’s not  even  counting  the  cost  to  keep  the  certification  up  in  the future.  For  example,  the  ICF  has  very  strict  criteria  for  what  a  coach  specific training hour  is.  Therefore,  valuable  education  you  may  take  to  enhance your coaching  practice  that  would  majorly  benefit  your  clients  may  not be considered  coach  specific enough.  There  is  an  art  and  science  to  coaching.  It’s  important  to  learn  the science, the  structure,  so  that  you  know  how  to  conduct  a  session.  Where most regulatory  bodies  miss  the  mark  is  on  the  art.  You  need  to  bring your  purpose, talents,  background,  expertise,  gifts,  and  passions  into  your coaching.  That’s  the art.  The  way  you  coach  that  helps  your  clients  best may  not  be  in  line  with the  limited  criteria  coaching  organizations  have.   As  coaches,  we  empower  people  to  exceed  limitations  and  have  confidence in themselves.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  not  having  confidence  in ourselves  if  we make  ourselves  get  unnecessary  credentialing  before  we take  on  paying clients.  Something  about  that  isn’t  right.  4. Coach  Training  is  NOT  the  Most  Important  Thing  to  Be  a  Successful Coach.  Most  coach  training  schools  will  tell  you  that  learning  to  coach  is  what you need  to  be  a  successful  coach.  They  are  partly  right.  You  do  need  to  learn  how  to  coach  properly  so  you  can  build  trust  with clients  and  have  confidence  in  yourself.   However,  you  also  need  to  know 2 additional  things:  1. Your  life  purpose - so  you  can  pick  the  right  niche  and  clientele  for you  2. How  to  market  and  get  clients  You  can  be  the  best  coach  in  the  world,  but  if  you  aren’t  coaching  in the right areas  on  topics  aligned  with  your  purpose,  you  will  get  burned out and  won’t attract  clients  that  are  right  for  you.  5. You  Do  Not  Have  to  Have  Months  or  Years  of  Training  to  Start Taking  on Clients  For  most  people  attracted  to  coaching,  learning  how  to  coach  is  simple. Yes,  it takes  practice,  and  yes  you  will  continually  build  on  your  skills forever.  However,  you  don’t  have  to  spend  years  before  you  take  on  paying clients.  The  problem with  most coach  training  programs  is  that  they  are  either too long  or  too  short. 12-18  month  programs  drag  the  information  out and don’t give  you access to  modules  until  the  class.  Then,  you  wouldn’t have access  to things  you need  to  know  for  an  entire  year!  So maybe this article will help some of you to make the best decision for yourself.",2021-03-06T17:22:38.690Z,"Is the ACE certified health coach exam hard? ",Quora

[Full Disclosure: I am a Mentor/Coach who helps new coaches, consultants and solo professionals get their businesses off the ground.] You're right… Coaching is no doubt one of the fastest growing industries of our era, second only to Information Technology.  I attribute this to both the huge ROI gained by people who subscribe to the various forms of coaching (often between 10:1 and as high as 50:1 return on investment in some cases); along with the intrinsic way human beings learn and adapt. Humans have been proven time and time again that they accomplish more when socially held accountable, and coaching does that very well in a methodological & professional way.  So in effect, people keep collectively investing in coaching because they see results; and the learning style is a proven one that yields rapid results.  Market Size: Let’s look at the numbers… Early in 2000, the Sydney Morning Herald (my favourite local newspaper in Aus), ranked Personal Coaching as the second fastest growth industry in the US, after Information Technology… Told you so :) The fact is that Billions are being spent every year on Coaching, and that figure is increasing. Further to that, a well known market research firm, Global Industry Analysts, projected the online learning industry (where many coaches offer their services in group settings), to be worth $107 Billion in 2015. So how does one tap into this clearly abundant industry, filled with potential clients? I have noticed three distinct areas that make the most impact for new coaches to find their ideal clients: 1) Harness the mindset to create success momentum in your own brain. Im sure many of you are aware of the “Law of Attraction” and have heard of people manifesting all sorts of things by simply thinking of them in the frame of having, instead of wanting. It can often seem far-fetched and therefor it’s easy to be skeptical and I don't blame you.  But it has merit. I’ve seen it firsthand in my own life and countless others. What I can say from my own personal experience, is that when I correctly adopted the winning mindset. I made some pretty powerful shifts in my business that cause a level of momentum I dreamed of.  The success mindset (or the It Girl Mindset, as I refer to in my business), is the combination of (a) Being confident that what you have to offer will seriously impact people, and (b) Taking inventory of your thoughts and planting seeds of joy and gratitude in your everyday interactions.  Life Changing Tip: Make it a habit to cultivate the success mindset upon waking and right before bed. This eventually programs your subconscious mind to work us into alignment with our desires.  2) Build Relationships, be visible & leverage your success stories Understand who your ideal clients are. Put yourself in their shoes. Feel their emotions. Take note of their language.  Once a coach has successfully helped a few clients to achieve their goals and built their reputation (to eventually become a thought leader) in their field they will begin to attract clients either through referral or due to the content that they create that contributes to the knowledge base around the topic relevant to the clients needs. Beyond one-on-one sessions the coach may build and develop group sessions, courses and webinars that allow them to further build and hone their expertise around an area of coaching. The insights developed through this will generate more ideas for quality content that will engage with the Coaches audience which in turn will drive more demand for their services. Life Changing Tip: Make it a habit to help 1 friend a day, often this can be as simple as an email. By helping other we are ultimately helping ourselves. 3) Become an expert or thought leader within your niche by being focused on the act of giving.  The fact is… The more people you impact and provide value too, the more clients will want to work with you. Many people fail to understand this as they are so focused on the self serving element of making fast money. The best coaches I know are in it to help people, and they do so willingly, for free, on various mediums.  This is crucial to attracting inbound clients, as in clients who find you. Being seen as a expert within your area of focus will ensure that you have credibility and authority to give advice on the subject.  In order to become an expert, a Coach should learn as much as possible about the topics related to their areas of focus. Coaching School or an advanced coaching programs such like Gina Devee’s ‘The Academy’ or my ‘IT Girl’ program will equip a would-be Coach with the skills needed help their clients to best achieve their goals. Having related experience in the field that a Coach is servicing is also very important as it shows that the Coach earned their stripes so to speak, for example, a business Coach who has built a successful business will have more credibility and be able to add more value to a client than one without such experience. Also, Seminars, Books, Videos and Blogs can all provide rich learning experiences for a Coach to become knowledgeable in their chosen area of focus.  Gaining knowledge is not enough to become an expert or thought leader in your area however. It is equally important to learn how to apply this knowledge in the real world and ‘Create Value’ and for potential clients as a way to build their trust in your abilities. The best way to do this is through content generation. This could be done through writing Blog Posts, Articles or Vlog. It could also be through building a Social Media presence across platforms such a Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pintrest, Periscope, SlideShare or contributing to online platforms that focus on such niches as the one you’re trying to target. Quora is a perfect example of such a platform. Once a Coach has achieved these two things then they will be well equipped to generate clients. In order to actually generate business from Coaching clients there are two main approaches that a Coach can take can take.  Side note: There are certain traits and skills that Coaches have in order to be more successful and I’ve written about them in depth here. Some are innate, but they all can be learned, but they are all geared to the development of a Coach's skills, and credibility which are crucial to build trust with the people who will ultimately become clients.It is important that a Coach doesn’t become complacent once they have some success. They must continue to push forward and growth themselves in order to remain relevant to the needs of those they seek to service. It is a long road to become a successful coach and the journey is never over. With persistence, ambition and a focus on the things mentioned above a Coach will be well equipped to attract many clients and help them to reach their goals and dreams.

Their client results are always impressive. They make great money doing what they love. And, just to make us all a little more jealous, they make it look effortless. Welcome to the elite coach. What is it that makes elite coaches so special? Is it their training? Their hard work and commitment? Their passion? Or do they know something most others don’t? The answer to all of those question is… yes. Elite coaches do know something most don’t. But it’s not just knowledge. It’s a set of practices they work on daily. And this set of practices helps them get better at forming strong relationships with their clients, fostering change, and improving their craft. Here are the active habits that set elite coaches apart from the rest. 1. Elite coaches practice the art of human connection. Better coaches aren’t just better at customizing workout and nutrition plans. They’re better with people. Elite coaches don’t limit conversations to “here’s what you have to do”; they speak to clients in a way that nurtures real human connection. By asking sincere questions, expressing compassion and being a steady source of support, they help guide their clients around obstacles so they can achieve their goals. To practice this approach: Ask leading questions that help clients open up and explore, imagine, or build on past successes. For example: If things were better with your eating/exercise, what would be different in your life? What would you do more of? Less of? Be proud of?Imagine that you have the body and health you want. What did it take for you to achieve it? What did you have to give up?What have you had success with in the past? How can we do more of that and apply it to your health and fitness?”And once you ask, really listen to their responses. Let them sink in. Learn from them. (For more on this approach, check out: Effective coach talk: What to say to clients and why it matters). 2. Elite coaches ask ‘why’. (Again… and again… and again.) You’ve probably seen it a million times. New clients get a taste for how hard it is to change their eating habits, do the extra 10 squats, run another mile, and rearrange their lives for all of it… and suddenly they don’t want it so badly, after all. Elite coaches have a way of inspiring their clients—in every single session—to want the hard work. They know how to unlock their clients’ deeper motivation, sense of purpose, and inner fire. How do they do this? For one thing, they know how to ask their clients why. To practice this approach: Use the ‘Five Whys’ technique. Here’s how it works: When establishing goals with your clients, you ask them why. Q: “Why do you want to accomplish this?”A: “Because I want to lose weight.” Then, whatever answer they come up with, you ask why again. Q: “And why do you want to lose weight in the first place?”A: “Because I used to be thinner and am embarrassed by how heavy I’ve gotten.” Continue asking why for a total of five times. It’s surprisingly challenging—and amazingly effective at getting to people’s core motivations. (By the way, elite coaches use ‘the Five Whys’ on themselves. Because they know that getting to the heart of their own motivation is the best place to begin.) 3. Elite coaches help the “competition.” Want to know a secret? To an elite coach, there’s no such thing as competition. Elite coaches don’t feel insecure about what other coaches are doing because they know how to use their individuality as an advantage in their careers. Rather than hiding and hoarding their knowledge, elite coaches share that knowledge and facilitate conversations, and in doing so build a trusted tribe around them. Find your tribe and help make those in your tribe successful, and you’ll be more likely to succeed, too. To practice this approach: Get engaged with other people’s content and social feeds. Take the extra few minutes to leave iTunes reviews on their podcasts; review their books on Amazon; share their Facebook posts; and so on. These simple actions will help them build their expertise and broaden their reach. As a bonus, you might expand your own social networks in the process. To take this concept up a notch, consider starting a Facebook group or other social community to serve as a source of mutual support, discussion, and inspiration. You’ll be able to answer questions and help your peers—and position yourself as an expert, too. 4. Elite coaches do less. “Doing it all” is a myth. Spreading yourself too thin is a first-class ticket to disappointment and failure. Instead, top-notch coaches figure out what’s truly crucial among their particular market and clientele, and do that. Elite coaches also know their clients can’t do it all. They know that giving clients just one small habit at a time is far more effective than throwing an ambitious project at them and hoping for the best. To practice this approach: Give the ‘one habit method’ a try. Of all the things your client wants to do and achieve, work with them to figure out which goal is most important to them right now. Then, based on their goal, help choose just one habit to start practicing today. The habit should be so simple it almost feels “too easy” and it should be something they can do in just five or ten minutes, every single day. Have your client practice that one habit every day for a minimum of two weeks. Ask them to check back in with you regularly to let you know whether or not they’ve completed the task. (If you’ve completed any kind of PN coaching, you’ll recognize this ‘one-habit’ method. There’s a reason we recommend it: it’s integral to our coaching method, because it works.) 5. Elite coaches practice the basics. Bruce Lee said: “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” Kick Guy never needed to have the perfect kick. All he had to do was focus on mastering the process and being excellent with all of the pieces. And that was enough to scare Bruce Lee. (Pretty scary.) Elite coaches are like Kick Guy. They’re willing to practice techniques—even the basic ones—again and again so they can move towards true mastery. They take this approach to their clients, too, helping them put their own foundation in place and acquire the skills they need to succeed in sustainable change. To practice this approach: Go back to basics with something you enjoy doing and consider yourself ‘pretty good’ at. Think back to the very first skills you learned to do that thing. If you’re a boxer, for example, consider your stance, your hip movement, or your jab. Could you benefit from drills focusing on your core techniques? Or, if you once struggled with poor eating habits, pay attention at mealtime. Do you still eat as slowly and mindfully as you once did? Would you benefit from paying more attention to how full you feel at the end of each meal? Pick one elemental thing you could take from ‘good’ to ‘great’ or ‘great’ to ‘positively killer.’ Then work on improving that one thing. Solicit help from a colleague or peer if you like. It may feel weird to act like a beginner again, but by doing so, you’re on your way to mastery. 6. Elite coaches listen for what they don’t want to hear. Many coaches (quite logically) focus on trying to strengthen their clients’ motivation—the side of them that is interested in change. But in the early stages of client development, it doesn’t work. Because that other side—the part that is scared of change and resistant to your efforts—is ridiculously strong. After all, it’s been preventing your client from changing for a long time. In order to get your clients moving in the right direction, coaches have to do something that might sound a bit paradoxical: they have to hear out the resistance first. Elite coaches listen for the resistance. They seek it out. Because they know they have to work with it, rather than against it. To practice this approach: Listen for your own resistance. Think of something you’ve been wanting to change, but haven’t gotten around to yet. Tip: think of all the things you’ve been telling yourself you should or shouldn’t do. Write down the thing you want to change. Then ask yourself: What is GOOD for me about NOT changing? (In other words, how does NOT changing benefit me or help me solve a problem?)What would be BAD about changing? What might I have to give up or lose?Write down your answers. How do you feel? Your resistance might feel a little calmer or quieter; you might feel a little more ready for change. Now that you understand your own resistance a little better, you can listen for it in client conversations, too. 7. Elite coaches know when to shut up. Elite coaches have a lot of expertise, but that doesn’t mean they always vocalize it. Think about it: When someone asks, “What should I eat after exercising?” an expert answers the question: “You should eat protein and carbs.” But when a client asks “What should I eat after exercise?” a coach asks, “Tell me about your training program and what you feel you can manage?” Coaches even consider “What do you like to eat after exercise?” A good coach doesn’t mind being quiet, asking questions or fading into the background a bit. Many fitness professionals try to be both expert and coach at the same time. But that never works. You can’t talk and listen at the same time. You have to know how and when to switch back and forth between the two. In other words: you need to know when to stop talking and listen. To practice this approach: Try using this ‘expert vs coach’ checklist on yourself: With your clients, do you spend most of your time… Expert Coach Talking and telling… or Listening and reflecting? Telling them what you know… or Sharing what you’re working on? Answering questions?… or Asking questions? Letting the client set the tone?… or Leading the client towards a decision or action? Pointing and directing?… or Guiding and accompanying? Taking the spotlight… or Fading into the background? If you find yourself more on the ‘expert’ side of things, try actively practicing some of the actions on the ‘coach’ side. 8. Elite coaches practice being imperfect. Lots of health and fitness professionals have high standards; most of us want to walk the walk. Moreover, we want to look like we walk the walk. So we try to refine our own health habits, working practices, and self-presentation. We know that our bodies are often advertisements for our services, so we worry about looking our best. But too often, we try to be perfect. And that becomes our downfall. Sure, on the one hand, a little fire keeps you energized and sharp. But too much pressure is a parking brake on performance. (Ever choked during a game or competition? You were probably overwhelmed by pressure. It happens to athletes all the time.) So while elite coaches strive for excellence, they don’t try to be perfect—and they don’t expect their clients to be perfect, either. To practice this approach: Try sharing a little of your own imperfect experience with your clients. When they’re fumbling with something, tell them about a time you felt awkward, embarrassed or uncomfortable yourself, either when working on your own fitness and nutrition journey or another time you were struggling to learn something new. When they’re feeling like a failure, let them know everyone falls down sometimes: share one of your own mistakes—and maybe even how you fixed it. 9. Elite coaches keep it real. If you work in the fitness and health industry, it’s easy to throw around a lot of ideas. Stuff like this: “Never eat processed food.”“Always eat local, seasonal, organic food.”On the surface, it’s hard to argue against either. But really? Unless you’re living in a yurt somewhere and growing all your own food from the ground up, I doubt you’re always eating whole, unprocessed, local, seasonal, organic food. Which means those nutrition ideals aren’t aspirational—they’re impossible. Even for the world’s top experts. Elite coaches are willing to do a reality check. They realize that people don’t need a nutritional deity to follow. They don’t need strict codes of conduct that includes words like “should”, “always”, and “never”. Instead of coaching from a place of fantasy, elite coaches stay grounded. They help their clients make progress, bit by bit. To practice this approach: Examine the rules you’ve set. Consider all the “rules” and expectations around fitness, nutrition, and health. Write down as many as you can think of. Be sure to include words like “should”, “always”, and “never”. You should always…You should never…Being “fit” means you always…Being “healthy” means you never…Eating “nutritiously” means…Now read your answers and think about whether a client could reasonably “always” or “never” do them. 10. Elite coaches ask for help. If you’re coaching other people, it only makes sense that you’ve experienced coaching yourself. After all, if you’ve never been coached through something, you can’t possibly understand what your clients are experiencing, thinking, and feeling. Elite coaches know this. They seek out mentorship and get coaching themselves. Sometimes it’s not even fitness related. It might be for their business, or their personal life (like how to be a better parent or partner), or a hobby they’re particularly passionate about. The important thing is that that they are willing to ask for help, to make themselves vulnerable, to go through the process of change… just like their clients. And they know how powerful that process of change can be. To practice this approach: Make your coaching checklist. What areas of expertise do you seek? Nutritional science?Coaching psychology?Business strategy?Professional development?General life wisdom?What kind of a mentor or coach would you like? What kind of a person are they?What sort of reputation do they have?What would you want them to show you or tell you in order for you to feel they were the “right fit.”Now think about people in your life (whether paid professionals, colleagues or friends) who may fit your criteria. If someone springs to mind, great. Ask if they’d be willing to lend their expertise and support to the thing you’d like help with.

It's a bit like being someone’s pastor or rabbi, while also being their therapist. There are some grey areas—pastoral counseling is a thing; therapy can often deal with religious values or dilemmas. But at the end of the day—clergy have one kind of role and authority; therapists have another; so mixing and matching in the same person can be confusing at best, dangerous at worst. In the same way—there are times when therapy deals with logistical planning or problem-solving, like coaching. There are times when coaching may address problems or behaviors that are incidental to a mental health diagnosis. But where I would expect a life coach to highlight advice-giving, logistical planning, and problem-solving—the first one is virtually absent from my practice of therapy, and the second two are relatively small components of it. And while a life coach might sometimes process or educate about relevant mental health symptoms, that's going to be a limited component of a larger orientation that’s much more focused on finding near-term, concrete solutions. In therapy, there are times where those things are the bulk of our work together. So—tbh, blurring those lines probably wouldn't lose somebody their license, unless they did it in a way that was harmful enough that they were probably in violation of some additional professional ethics, as well. It would be an ethical risk, and a potential ethical violation; could get someone in trouble with one or both professional associations, and/or their licensing board; but in most scenarios I can think of, where someone wasn't being deliberately deceptive about the nature of their work together, in a way that caused considerable harm, they'd more probably be required to document and explain what they did; and then potentially get handed some continuing education or supervision requirements, and their name posted on the publicly searchable “got in trouble” list for their state. (Where they'd probably get hit hardest in most cases would be—if an insurance company that had reimbursed them for therapy got wind of it, and made a determination that some or all of the “therapy” had actually been coaching—they definitely could compel the therapist to repay all of those payments. That happens often, even when the therapy is really therapy, if an insurance company finds some other reason that a given service shouldn't have been paid or covered. If they wanted to be especially mean, they could pursue charges of fraud, but that tends to get into questions of intent vs good-faith error, so… usually, they'd probably just demand the money back. Could be a lot of money, depending on how long the therapy/coaching relationship had been going, though!)

I would go as far as to say not one of them had a clue how the mind works, how to truly help people who are stuck or how to deal with someone who disagrees with them. That is my experience and I stick by it. Now, if you are working with someone who came to coaching after leaving the world of licensed psych work, that is a different thing all together and many are because they are sick of the lack of pay relative to what a coach can be paid and there aren’t any hassles with licensing boards, etc. I did not hire any of these folks, so I can’t speak to their efficacy, but they would have a much better idea how to help someone then someone who is working with an ‘intention’ for the session and asking a bunch of fruitless questions. Business coaching is also mostly a scam as far as my personal experience is concerned. If they can teach one something specific, like how to create a podcast, copy write because that is what they have built their original business on etc. or actually have a business back round and have run their own successful business you will have a better shot at getting something for your efforts. Of course, I am a hypnotist having found that I disagree with much of the pill pushing of toxic medications, mostly unneeded and instead go to the ‘cause’ of the problem - why it was created by the unconscious mind (something the mental health profs never learned) and what the purpose of the problem is - (what the person is getting out of having the problem) coupled with helping people find their compelling future. It’s a hell of a lot quicker in helping people by working in the part of the mind that stores all the answers, and is a lot more pleasant as the client is in an altered state while doing the work.

The biggest lie of my life. Entering first year Mbbs makes you realize the full extent of the syllabus you need to study just to clear that year. My entire year I was literally gripped by fear of failing my first year exams. Failing the exams means you have to sit with a separate batch for the reminder of your MBBS. Once first year was cleared our clinical postings began. And that's when the reality of what lies ahead fully hits you. Getting a good PG seat is far far more important and difficult than getting a MBBS seat. Post graduate seats weren't as many as now. There was a realistic chance that you may not even get a pg seat owing to the scarcity and high competition. This leads to the herd mentality of prematurely joining an entrance coaching institute in pre final year itself. The coaching gurus and some seniors also advice the same. So blindly you enter those centers for weekend classes. So me and my friends did the same. Let's call this coaching center A. It was the number two for entrance coaching at that time. So did it help? It was a pointless waste of time and money. So did we learn our lessons? No. Joined the second best coaching center in our internship again. Coaching center B. Lack of time and the busy schedule didn't allow us to give our best. Once again a waste of time and money. I bet you are wondering why we are always choosing the second best. We were saving up the first best for the real preparation post mbbs. Trying to act too smart. Stupid ass thinking actually. Anyway internship over. Finally joined coaching center C. I was sick and tired of attending classes. So I just joined test series. My friends though joined the regular classes. After slogging for 6 months finally managed to secure a good rank in PGI Chandigarh. One of my close friends managed to secure a single digit rank too. She was brilliant all through her MBBS. Now here comes the play of the coaching institutes. Coaching center A had shut down because of poor patronage. Coaching center B still had an ongoing competition with coaching center C. And they had this practice of putting topper pictures with their testimonials on their websites, pamphlets and study materials. So there it was in their next entrance preparation book, my friend's picture along with her testimonial. Standard thanks to God, parents and friends who stood by her. Eloquent lines about the coaching center and its famous teachers. About how helpful they were and how they paid individual care and attention. None of this was told by my friend. In fact the center B we barely attended any classes as I mentioned before. But there they were claiming credit for her success. Just because we had registered our names in their coaching center before. This is a common occurrence. Due to lack of guidance and constant fear of being under prepared we jump from one institute to another in various periods during MBBS. Frankly none of these institutes play a big role. It's all in your hands. Study from standard text books, read mcqs simultaneously when you study the subjects, give a lot of tests. Don't rely too much on these centers. They over hype themselves.",2021-03-06T18:31:13.278Z,"Can we get fees from a coaching institute if I apply for medical for some health problems? ",Quora

Now, these days, managers are selective in their hires due to the suplus supply and endless choices of nurses. If two new grads, one older and one younger, for example, were to seek jobs in the same healthcare facility, nine out of ten times the younger one would likely nab the position because of his or her potential to grow with the company. Another consideration is the school one graduated from. A nurse trained at John Hopkins, for example, is more likely to get the job than the one who received an online education from a less credible school. These factors apply to most jobs, except for those positions which specifically require elderly and experienced people, which is not common. Even CEOs and company executives are getting younger than ever before. There are multiple specialties in nursing to choose from. Many of them require physical strength for lifting and repeated quick walking, and stamina to last a typical 12-hour shift. In some specialties, like labor and delivery and emergency room, nurses find themselves running to save lives. Running is not required, but your colleagues will run in dare circumstances and you dare not be the odd man out. They will get you fired. Working in a doctor's clinic, a school, or a fertility clinic, for example, is less physically demanding, and the pay is equally less attractive. Retirees prefer to work in these areas after working in fast-paced, high-paying hospital jobs. Your resume and interview, if you get one, can speak volumes and land you an unexpected job. Bringing previous experiences from other careers, life experiences like community involvement and or other volunteer services, can improve your chances of nabbing an enviable nursing position at any age, so long as you show vigor and interest in the position.

6043d18ded76476feda35637,https://www.quora.com/What-is-mental-health-coaching?-,"I’m a coach who specialises in mental wellness. I’m particularly interested in helping people with depression and anxiety who’ve tried pharmaceuticals and talking therapy and feel disillusioned with them. My particular style of coaching involves being pro-active about mental health. Via a cutting edge hypnotherapy called Rapid Transformational Therapy, I get clients to uncover and understand what is making them depressed and anxious. Then I help them to eradicate the thoughts and beliefs that keep them trapped in a state of depression and anxiety. I work holistically, focusing on helping clients to make lifestyle changes that are proven to improve mental health, such as diet, exercise, stress management and finding support. They might need to find a new job if their current one is sucking the soul out of them, or to work on improving social anxiety so that they can make friends or find a romantic partner. I believe that depression occurs not through chemical imbalances in the brain, but from imbalances in your life. These days we’re out of whack because we’re bombarded by cultural & social expectations and media messages encouraging us to be more, do more, have more…………..and more and more. We’re made to feel as if we aren’t good enough at every turn. If we don’t have the perfect job, partner, outfit, hair colour, body shape, home, holidays, children….we’re made to feel defective somehow. There’s an army of people on social media who are ready to remind us how useless/wrong/stupid we are at any given time. We’re unappreciated at work, if we are lucky enough to have a job at all. The politicians make us feel powerless about the things that matter, like the state of the planet etc. We’ve lost sight of what’s truly important to us. And we’re so overwhelmed by the demands of the world around us that we’ve lost our connections to our own mind, body and soul, to the people around us, and to nature. Many of us have lost touch with who we are and what our values are. We don’t know how to find our passion and purpose in this life and we all need a reason for our existence to feel fulfilled.

A lot of manufacturers are touting different things about their installed cost per Watt, but the bottom line is that CPV projects have to be competitive to get built and, well, provide good installed cost data! This is the basis for my answer. CPV generally competes for the same capital and incentives as regular PV, and projects using CPV typically come to fruition thanks to the intervention of the same developers, EPC firms, etc. As a result, a CPV plant often has to be competitive with a PV plant. CPV's competitiveness now depends on what metrics are used to evaluate different project alternatives. Some like to use at internal rate of return (IRR), others prefer the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and a good number still look exclusively at cost per watt, which only reflects total installed cost of the project but doesn't reflect other attributes of the project. These other attributes are diverse but the most important one is maybe the energy produced by the plant, on a ""per watt"" basis. And because CPV modules use trackers, they receive more energy from the sun, and therefore produce more energy themselves. This one statement may deserve a paragraph on its own but let's leave it at that. So more energy produced means that a competitive CPV project can also cost more than PV project. For example, if a PV project has a cost of $2.5/Watt (large-scale), an equivalent CPV project may end up costing $3.00/Watt. I guess this only counts as a partial answer but hopefully useful.",2021-03-06T19:06:49.393Z,"What is installation cost per watt for concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) solar panels? ",Quora

India has got the ability to generate over 1,900 billion units of solar power annually, which is equal to the entire annual power demand till 2030. The future of India depends on achieving the ambitious solar power generation target of 100 GW by 2022. The cumulative solar capacity is going up to 15.6 GW, as recorded on June 30, 2017, the market sentiment is upbeat because of the record number of installations. In 2017 around 8-10 GW can be installed, we could also face a slowdown in the short term as not many tenders are being released. While the drastic reduction in tariffs will lead to more demand, it has also left investors concerned. The government will majorly drive the demand with the NTPC, NLC, CIL, NHPC and Railways all inviting tenders for solar projects. According to the Bloomberg New Energy Outlook 2017 report, more efficient batteries will provide flexibility of use and boost the reach of renewables, cutting the cost of solar energy by 66%. With energy storage picking up and costs becoming increasingly viable, this formidable combination will help create a truly sustainable ecosystem and reduce carbon footprint considerably. These were the prerequisite that how India can advance in the field of solar energy. There are many factors which determine the that India can turn into a solar energy:- 1. Geographical Advantage :- The geographical location of India is such that it can not only produce enough energy to meet its own requirements, but also produce enough energy for the entire world! Because it falls in the tropical region, it receives generous amounts of solar radiation all through the year amounting to nearly 3,000 long hours of sunshine. In India, there are top five states which have highest renewable energy capacity where solar modules are able to produce ample amounts of electricity even on overcast days. 2. Upcoming Solar Projects in India:- The states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Maharashtra have incredulous amounts of potential to tap solar energy, owing to their strategic location. At present, the Thar region in Rajasthan is home to some of the best solar projects of the country, generating close to 2,100 GW power. Gujarat houses one of the largest solar power plants in India. Last year saw Indian government has been approved of a master plan envisaging the upgradation of 50 of India’s cities to blossoming solar cities. 3. Highly Advantageous at Cheap Cost:- It is true that solar panels and solar systems are slightly expensive to purchase, to begin with. It is, however, also true that solar systems once set up help save money, from the moment on! Solar panels usually have a lifespan of around 25 years and are definitely worth the investment in every respect. The use of solar energy to power electrical appliances eliminates any dependency whatsoever on the constant supply of electricity to any place. Solar power is also good riddance of hefty monthly electricity bills for the common man. 4. Employment Prospects:- The transition to the utilization of solar energy is an imminent and long-impending one. It is only a matter of time before we see an entire solar sector come up. The persistent problem of unemployment in India will definitely also get better and the unemployed youth will be able to see the light of day with the creation of more and more jobs. Even though many people have already taken to installing solar panels in their homes and offices for meeting their energy requirements on a daily basis, there is still a long way to go before India becomes a complete solar nation. But this can be achieved, by going with a clean-tech company known as ZunRoof, who tries to solve all the energy related issues by simply converting the the un-utilised rooptops with solar panels, a of IIT alumni started ZunRoof couple of years ago.

There are many organisations which are into solar partially as they supply just certain components. Let me elaborate even more Electrical If you are already in the electrical industry into manufacturing of Electrical panels and so on….. You may look at creating string combiner boxes , Fuse boxes. Many Multinational Companies like Schneider, ABB, Eaton which manufacture switchgear products also manufacture solar specific switchgear-PV Fuses, DC Isolators/ Breakers.  There are many companies which manufacture electrical accessories like Connectors etc which have-/are developed/Developing solar specific products “Solar Inverter” A solar inverter is a more advanced version of UPS, Battery inverters. In this case too you will find that companies having a stronghold in power electronics ( viz Variable Frequency Drive Manufacturers, UPS manufacturers ) have developed Solar inverters. Examples ABB, Delta, Emerson( Now Vertiv) There are lots of local companies which were formerly into UPS and Battery inverters stepping into solar and making solar inverters. To sum it up if you are already one of them its easier for you to enter! Mechanical Module Mounting structures are quite simple mechanical structures consisting of “C” Channels “ Z” Channels “L” Angles assembled to form a mounting structure  If you are a mechanical fabricator. Manufacturer of such components you can look at supplying to requirements! The primary choice of material for Module mounting in India is HDG ( Hot dip Galvanized ) Steel. Although Aluminum is also not that far behind! Steel is consumed in large quantities for solar , Just as an estimate a 1000 kWp Solar project requires 30 Tonnes -40 Tonnes of Steel for mounting structure alone ( Depending on your wind Load and other stuff related to structural Stability) Civil Civil work involves creating foundation for module mounting structure. Something like this  Contractors Solar project requires a fair bit of manual labor work. The basic scope of work involves Creating of civil foundations.Erection of Module Mounting Structures.Wiring and Cabling .Many of the above work can be carried out by a Skilled labor with some basic training. If you are a existing Electrical/ Mechanical/ Civil Contractor, You can look to enter this field. I believe in India you do not need any special certifications/ Licensing to serve as contractor for a solar project(I may be wrong on this) Solar Entrepreneurship Training There are quite a lot of training programs conducted by various governmental and private organisation on this.

Maybe this matches the typical Solar City systems being installed today? I don't know. In any event it seems that there is a missing chunk of software and hardware that will use logic to make optimal use of your 2kW and 7kWh battery. For example it will need to turn off your refrigerator when you turn on the microwave if this is necessary to keep the total power drawn below 2kW. This means essentially that this device will have to replace your house DB (switchboard) and you will have to use different plug circuits for your refrigerator and microwave. An alternate solution would be to communicate with appliances such as your refrigerator to tell it to turn off, and again to tell it that sufficient power is available to turn on. Another solution would be to simultaneously draw power from the grid when the demand exceeds the power available from the battery. This sort-of negates the usefulness of having a battery in the first place because you can generally push electricity backwards into the grid to turn your electricity meter backwards, thereby using the grid as a ""battery"". It only makes economic sense where your electricity meter uses a different tariff for electricity consumed and electricity pushed back. Of course this depends totally on your contract for your grid connection and the meter they installed. What would make sense would be for the grid owners to add large amounts of battery storage. This would provide an economy of scale and would keep the electrical installations in homes simple. It seems that the viability of Powerwall and similar systems depends largely on government incentives and on power utility tariff structures.

The previous answers raise good points, but don’t tell the whole story. The “solar panels” that President Carter had installed on the White House were solar thermal collectors (the proper term) that produced hot water, and not solar photovoltaic modules (PV) (also the proper term) that produce electricity. That’s why the term “solar panel” is not used in the industry…it can mean many things.  At the time Carter was elected, solar electric (PV) technology was in its infancy. PV modules were extremely expensive for how few Watts they produced, and the technology was not yet available for a PV system to interface with the utility electric grid—to buy and sell power. Modern flat-plate solar thermal collectors are not really much more efficient than they were in 1979. Pumps, pipes, glass, heat exchangers, storage tanks, thermostats. Control systems are computerized now for some small efficiency gains and heat exchange fluids are more high-tech, but that’s about it. Contrary to one response here, solar thermal collectors do not, and never have, tracked the sun dawn to dusk. The White House system was fully functional, and provided hot water for the First Family, and the White House laundry and cafeteria. Carter styled himself as the “Solar President,” significantly increased funding for NREL (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) and formed SERI (the Solar Energy Research Institute). America’s fossil fuel situation in the 1970s was wildly unpredictable, with shortages, huge price spikes, and gas lines. I remember these vividly from my youth. Reagan, on the other hand, was firmly in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry, and was extremely skeptical about any form of renewable energy. Removing those solar collectors was likely a tip of the hat to the fossil fuel lobby that helped put him in power. [EDIT: Jerry Coffin correctly pointed out in the comments Reagan’s extremely pro-nuclear views. I believe he was in the nuclear power industry’s pocket, too.] The official White House line was that the roof underneath the collectors needed repair (not the collectors or system) and after removing them a White House spokesman said “Putting them back up would be very unwise, based on cost.” And, this was probably correct. Solar thermal collectors are actually very time-consuming and expensive to remove and replace for a roofing repair, compared to PV modules. With all solar technology, the first thing an installer should check is the condition of the roof! Carter’s solar tax credits program had some unintended negative consequences, too (remember, this was for solar hot water, not solar electric). Plumbing companies and fly-by-night operators all over the US jumped into the solar business for the “free money,” with little or no knowledge of proper solar hot water system design and installation. The result was leaky roofs, failed (and very primitive) controls, and shady operations disappearing into the night. You can see many of these Carter-era systems still on roofs today, as when one pump failed or a control relay burned out, the company that installed it went out of business long ago, and no reputable operator wants the water damage liability of removing them for scrap…and they are rarely worth anything, as the plumbing, pumps etc. have degraded over years of non-operation.  Fortunately, the modern renewable energy tax credit system (the Energy Policy Act of 2005, under George W. Bush) avoided most of these pitfalls. Modern renewables technology development partially backed by the government has been a success, with a few notable exceptions (like Abound and Solyndra) but these were tiny compared to the greater industry….and those companies are another question entirely…feel free to ask me about them!",2021-03-06T19:11:46.908Z,"Why did Reagan have the solar panels in the White House removed?

I graduated as an engineer in Information Technology. I worked for a few companies but soon after graduation I noticed that I was pushed into stagnant waters. I didn't have the same opportunities networking and especially direct customer contact was missing. I know a Deaf friend who did almost nothing the last ten years before retiring because nobody entrusted him with real projects but nobody also wanted to be responsible for firing a handicapped person. In the end he got a good retirement package. It was a government post. It is easy to get a job when you are bright but it gets boring immediately thereafter. Not only boring but outright dangerous for your career. With your communication handicap you are fighting a losing battle. I know some Deaf people who pretend to be successful in a responsible position in a hearing company but it always happens that about ten years later they get fired or leave the position or are happy to retire. Why? It's the communication handicap which cannot really be overcome if you are profoundly Deaf. There are many little communication situations like exchanging important information off the record at the coffee machine, the preference to phone, not overhearing something important your coworkers exchanged, impromptu meetings, meetings in a different language than the interpreter knows, the interpreter not able to translate terminology, and so on. You need to compensate and the evening you are more tired than others. You need to take off more time to rest. In the long term all these problems destroy your career. It's subtle. First we are humans and as such a very social animal. Communication is our lifeblood. It's like breathing. So we aren't aware how we communicate unless we explicitly focus our attention to communcation. Exactly like breathing. And second we all compete. In this competition Hearing people have an unfair advantage. I must clearly say so. The advantage is unfair. But I don't see a solution. Because it's in our lifeblood. So what's the best job for Deaf people? The best jobs are where Deaf work among themselves. Edit I just read a book about a Deaf girl. She told a story about a hearing work colleague mobbing her off a post. She being Deaf was just a sitting duck for this career-obsessed asshole. She got shot down without any mercy.

You can’t always predict when these small objects might hit your panels. For instance, small pebbles that bounce as cars’ wheels hit the pavement — they might hit your panels and scratch them. Nevertheless, falling debris of any size, if left unattended, will eventually lead to energy efficiency loss. 2. Lightning strikes When lightning hits your solar panels, you won’t only get downtime — you will also get total panel destruction. If you own a solar farm, then you should invest in a lightning protection system. One example is the Alltec Protection Pyramid by a provider called Alltec. It consists of: Surge Protection Device (SPD) systemInstalled grounding systemA structural lightning protection system3. Snow, condensation, and rain Different ranges of damages can come from different sources — snow, condensation, or rain. Snow. If heavy snow sets on your panels, you should remove them immediately. Low-angle roofs covered in ice accumulate snow easily. Condensation. Most solar panels have no issue with condensation. You just have to ensure the buildup will not drip into your attic or reach the electrical wirings. Rain. Panels can withstand moderate rainfall or even hurricanes. However, the racking and anchors have to withstand strong winds — they need to be flexible. 4. Overheating It sounds ironic but solar panels cannot handle extreme heat. This may lead to overheating and damage. Although panels are tested to withstand heat during manufacturing, they can still overheat. You can prevent this from happening. You can add a ventilation system like fans. Although, you shouldn’t cool it down by splashing it with water while it’s scorching.  5. Fire Finally, you should watch out for fire hazards. Naturally, a fire will destroy your panels and system, so you have to take preventative steps. First, make sure to protect the wirings well. If you have children or pets, ensure that they can’t go near them. Isolate your wirings by fencing them. If you’re about to install a solar panel system, ascertain that the installation will not be a hasty one. Haphazard setups will almost always lead to mishaps. In a nutshell Overall, these factors may be inevitable or manageable. What’s truly crucial is you prepare for them. Do your homework — the best way to prevent solar panel degradation is by educating yourself. Even better, consult the pros. Arm yourself with the knowledge supplied by those who design panels firsthand. In this short post, we will discuss the causes of solar panel damage and how to prepare for them. 1.

Companies are now starting to create their own open or closed (private) communities, much like groups on LinkedIn.

Once in a group, a user or prospect can then directly connect with the group owner, read other product information such as a prospectus, or get to know the portfolio manager.  A bank or financial company could then leverage the expertise and/or brands of its people – from advisors to top leaders – as we’ve seen in countless examples. Those people, using a platform like Finect, can then write content and invite people to join their community. By using invitation links to the group and key words or tags, both the group and content can be found not only on the three other social media platforms (if you choose), but also on search engines.

Since a photovoltaic installation does not increase the probability of lightning strikes, the solar modules themselves are no more at risk than the inverter or other loads connected to the grid. However, in the rare event of the solar generator being hit by a direct lightning strike, the modules are likely to suffer considerable damage. The only thing that will help in this scenario is the integration of an external lightning protection system. Much more frequent, by contrast, are indirect or close strikes, where a branch current of the lightning flows over the electrical installation, inducing a surge. In this case, tiered surge protection at the utility grid feed-in point or at the PV array can significantly reduce the risk of damage.

As an RN, you’ll be expected to provide patient care, health education, and emotional support for patients and families. In addition to that, administering medicine, performing diagnostic tasks, and teaching people how to manage injury and illness, will also be part of your daily routine. To become a registered nurse, you’ll need a relevant degree or diploma. And most importantly, you’ll need to become licensed. It’s no secret that this is a very demanding job. But RNs do get paid well and no one’s ever going to mistake it for a boring desk job. So if you want to help people in a variety of settings, this could be your next career. Median Salary: $70,000Projected Job Growth: 15% (400,000+) 2. Software Developers Right now you’re reading this post on some kind of computing device. That wouldn’t have been possible without a software developer writing the necessary lines of code for your device or application. Solving problems is the main focal point of software development. Finding ways to automate tasks and improve human interaction with technology, will be part of your daily duties. While having a relevant degree can help you, it’s not a requirement. There are many successful software developers earning a comfortable living without degrees. And if you want to be like them, you’ll need to invest in a course and become certified (if necessary), to prove you have the required skills. Technology will continue growing at a rapid pace. So if you want in on some of the action (and cash), then consider becoming a software developer. Who knows, maybe you’ll create the next great app! Median Salary: $103,560Projected Job Growth: 24% (300,000+) 3. Postsecondary Education Teachers College professors serve as the final transitional resources between young adults and the real world. As a professor you’ll guide those budding souls in academic and technical subjects designed to prepare them for the workforce. Some of your activities may also include research, getting published, or creating the next overpriced college textbook. Naturally, you need either a master’s degree or PhD to become a university professor. The cool thing is, it can be in an area that you’re passionate about. So that Art career you envisioned just might come to fruition. It’s a pretty flexible career that pays well and has many benefits. Plus you get to see fresh faces every year or two. And if you want to help influence them, there’s no better way to do it than by becoming a postsecondary education teacher. Median Salary: $76,000Projected Job Growth: 15% (195,000+) 4. Accountants and Auditors If you’re like most people, you pay someone (a lot of money) to manage your finances and keep Uncle Sam happy. This can be for your personal income, business income, or both. Contrary to popular belief accountants no longer sit in cubicles crunching numbers. As an accountant your job is to find the meaning behind those numbers and communicate them to clients or management. You also get to give advice and make decisions that can impact their financial situation. To become an accountant, you’ll first need an accounting (or relevant) degree. Then you’ll need to become certified, depending on the area of accounting. Once you have those, you can fulfill your lifelong dream of getting paid to play with numbers. Median Salary: $69,350Projected Job Growth: 10% (138,000+) 5. Management Analysts (a.k.a. Consultant) Processes and results. That pretty much sums of the job of a management analyst. It’s a job where you’ll be responsible for providing solutions to management. The kind of solutions that increases revenue and decreases costs to make the company more profitable. At the very least you’ll need some type of bachelor’s degree. But if you’ve got years of experience in a certain field (or you’re a genius), that may trump the degree requirement. In other words, companies may want degrees but they’ll never prioritize them over making money. While this career pays quite well, it does require frequent travel. So be prepared to rack up those frequent flyer miles. Median Salary: $82,450Projected Job Growth: 14% (110,000+) 6. Financial Managers The financial health of a business falls squarely upon the shoulders of a financial manager. This role is all about focusing on a business internally. You’ll ensure adherence to budgets – that profits are looked after and costs are controlled, keeping the business operating as financially safe as possible. Other responsibilities may include making investment decisions, creating financial reports, and developing strategies to influence future financial goals. In order to get that sweet six-figure salary, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree and experience in a similar financial role. Median Salary: $125,080Projected Job Growth: 19% (107,000+) 7. Physicians and Surgeons Imagine getting paid almost a quarter of million dollars to poke people and use cold metal objects to listen to their bodies. How many other jobs would pay you to do that? Unless you get paid to torture humans, the only way to legally do that is to become a doctor of some kind. You already know the deal here. Spend almost a decade of your life getting all the expensive qualifications you need. Qualifications that allow you to do stuff like perform surgeries, prescribe meds, diagnose and treat injuries, and more. As much as this career is going to explode in 10 years, it’s probably not going to be worth your time if you’re old. Let the college freshmen deal with the time and insane debt required to become a doctor. Median Salary: $220,000+Projected Job Growth: 13% (90,000+) 8. Medical and Health Services Managers Just because med-school isn’t for you doesn’t mean you have to give up your dreams of working in healthcare. As a healthcare administrator, you can run the damn facility and manage those rich physicians and surgeons. Haha suckers! You’ll be responsible for planning, directing, and coordinating all medical and health services. And the best part is… All you need is a relevant bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and some experience. Not to mention that your compensation can jump to high six-figures over time. Not bad eh? Median Salary: $98,350Projected Job Growth: 20% (72,000+) 9. Physical Therapists (PT) A PT helps patients with a variety of problems such as physical impairments, illnesses, and chronic pain. Depending on the field of physical therapy, your focus might be on prevention, maintenance, long-term treatment, and more. It’s also a very active career. You’re on your feet most of the time helping patients improve their movement, manage their pain, and get encouragement they need to stick with a routine. Once upon a time all you needed was a master’s degree in physical therapy and licensing to become a physical therapist. But things have changed. Now you need a DPT to earn close to $100K, which seems fair. Median Salary: $86,350Projected Job Growth: 28% (67,000+) 10. Nurse Practitioners (NP) NPs are basically registered nurses with advanced training in primary care services. This means they can perform a number of functions that were typically done by doctors – such as ordering medications, x-rays, and lab tests. As a NP most of what you do will be centered around health promotion, illness prevention, dealing with episodic illnesses, and management of chronic illnesses. The autonomy and scope you get in this career is immense. And this is reflected in the level of compensation, which easily surpasses six figures. However, getting to that level will require at least a master’s degree, experience in the field, and licensing. But for a career that is projected to grow tremendously, it’s definitely worth your time and effort. Median Salary: $110,930Projected Job Growth: 31% (64,000+) 10 Careers in Demand for The Next 10 Years Here are the best high-paying careers for the future: 1.

The reason the installed cost of solar power fell to a record low in the first quarter of 2017 is that there has been a continuous decline in the prices of photovoltaic (PV) modules and inverters, and labor costs, whereas module efficiency has increased. This has made getting a solar panel installed much more affordable.

To provide a good estimate we need to make a few assumptions: 1 MW continuous ( 24 MWh / day)no other sources of energy are availableoperation for 3 days with heavy cloud coverthe storage system will be recharges in 3 dayssystem installed in New England (my home)able to provide 1 MW continuous even in the winter monthsBased on these assumptions I’ll walk you though the process. Please adjust the numbers to fit your particular situation.  Step 1: Estimate solar resources We start by looking at the solar resources available at the location of interest. Based on this map the solar insolation for my home on the Southeastern Connecticut is about 2.5 kWh/m^2/day.  Source: Solar Maps | Geospatial Data Science | NREL  Step 2: Estimate size of array This simple equation is all we need: Energy =ηηAILS Where: ηη (Greek letter eta) = Efficiency of the solar panel. Modern panels are 10 to 15 % efficient.A = Active area of the array in square meters.I = Insolation a.k.a solar irradiance in Watt-hours per square meter per day. This was taken from the NREL map in Step 1.L = System losses including heating of solar panel, dust, snow, atmospheric haze, battery charger, and inverter. A conservative coefficient is 0.75.S = Storage losses. Storage is not 100% efficient. Even batteries lose energy when they charge and discharge. A conservative coefficient is 0.75.For this example we will estimate the daily energy produced as: 24MWh≈0.15(Area in m2)(2.5kWhm2)(0.75)(0.75)24MWh≈0.15(Area in m2)(2.5kWhm2)(0.75)(0.75) Area≈114,000m2Area≈114,000m2  Step 3: Adjust for storage and maintenance Solar is like a factory with a single production line. Storage is like a warehouse. On cloudy days the energy is pulled from the warehouse. The panels must be adjusted in size to power the load and restock the warehouse. The opening assumptions were chosen to make this size adjustment easy. Let’s assume we have a completely empty storage. Every day we must power the load and fill 1/3 of the warehouse. Consequently, the size of the array must be doubled. Area≈228,000m2Area≈228,000m2 Again, this is the size of the active solar array. The actual amount of land would be perhaps doubled to accommodate the solar panel tilt and maintenance. Know that the power plant requires a field nearly 0.5 km^2 (about 120 acres).  Step 4: Calculate number of panels: Earlier we assumed a panel with an efficiency of 15%. This is a good number for modern panels. A representative panel may be found here: https://www.gogreensolar.com/pro... This panel has a nameplate capacity of 250W, an efficiency of 15%, and an active surface area of 1.5 m2m2. Panels required=2280001.5≈150,000Panels required=2280001.5≈150,000 For reference, this solar farm will have a nameplate capacity of 38 MW.  Folks, I believe we need to step back and look at solar realistically. Solar is a very diffuse energy source. That 1 MW continuous solar power plant requires an extraordinary number of panels and nearly a 0.5 km2km2 upon which to mount them. Land is expensive. Also, we need to add storage which will add considerable cost. We must keep things in context. The diesel generator is the competition for plants of this size. A machine such as this could be installed in my basement along with the fuel to run it for days. Photo: Cat | 3512B Diesel Generator Set | Caterpillar  Where do we go from here: We could drop the storage requirement and add the diesel generator as the solar backup. The cost and size of the array would drop considerably. IMO this is a very bad decision as the resulting system is high cost and emits considerable CO2CO2. A much better solution is to combine nuclear, wind, solar, and a small amount of storage. Low cost reliable energy can be obtained by selecting the optimal proportion of each technology on a region by region basis. Add in hydo and geothermal if it is prudent to do so. I encourage you to have this conversation with a colleague. FUN FACT: There are 746 Watts per horsepower. This 1 MW solar power plant has a capacity of about 1300 hp.

If you get a lower interest loan (like a home equity) for a long enough term, you can get your payment close to the range of your eliminated electric bill. Then, on top of that, you will often be able to get a tax credit on your installation price, and as long as you have “net metering” from your power company, you will be paid back for the energy you send them over what you use. I do not know where it is effective, but in PA we generate a Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) for every 1,000 kWh we generate, and these are a commodity that are sold to the power companies which generates an extra income. All these extra benefits can further offset the payments. We have been more than pleased with our installation. We turned it on at the end of February. Our average weekly electric usage from the power company for this time of year went from using around 20 kWh before turning on the system, to -11 kWh afterwards, and we have not even seen the long days of June, July, and August! Even if it takes you 20 years to pay off the loan, your loan payments will be constant, while the grid electricity prices will continue to rise (making an increasing return on investment over time). Also, once you DO pay the system off, the remaining time you have the system operational will be just like free money. Whatever you might “lose” early on will be more than made up for in the long run, and if you dump the paybacks and incentives directly into the loan account, you will pay it off even faster and reap the rewards much quicker.",2021-03-06T19:27:34.014Z,"When will photovoltaic solar panels become cost-effective?

The standard American diet (SAD) includes far too much processed starch. The insulin released to metabolize that starch can completely block that release of HGH and with it the burning of fat. It seems simple enough to greatly reduce or eliminate the intake of sugar/starch until one naturally begins burning fat, There are two downsides. The first is that during the transition, muscle is cannibalized for amino acids which can be converted into glucose. One actually burns muscle. The second is that depositing new muscle requires more than protein. It requires a lot of energy that can only come from glucose, some 5–10 times as many starch calories as protein calories. Muscle shrinks during adult life and at some point it is insufficient to support normal daily activities. The lack, called sarcopenia, may be the best indicator of whether one would survive the next 12 months. At some age, sarcopenia becomes more likely to cause death than atherosclerosis or excess body fat. That suggests one start a keto diet with a decent muscle inventory, transition into it as rapidly as possible, perhaps with a water fast, and stop it when one has hit one’s body fat goal. You may ignore the graphic articles intended to frighten you. The recent international PURE study researched longevity. It recommended 15%-20% of calories from protein and 40%-50% EACH from fat and starch, Mortality increased slightly when EITHER fat or starch dropped below 40% and even more so when EITHER dropped below 10%. You will continue to see frightening articles warning about dietary starch below 10% but not the somewhat greater risk from dietary fat below 10%. One should return to a moderate diet ASAP. The best choice approved by physicians is the Mediterranean diet. It can easily meet the above optimal percentages and does not make one again fat even if it is somewhat imperfect.

The evidence is overwhelming that we are on our way to the sixth great extinction. And there’s considerable debate among scientists about how long it will take to kick in. We’re already losing some 200 species a day, and temperatures in countries like India and Pakistan are now regularly breaching ‘wet bulb’, which means high heat and humidity combinations that makes heat stroke a likely outcome for humans. The IPCC’s fifth assessment has us in runaway global warming in a matter of a few decades, and every survivable scenario they presented in the Fifth assessment assumed we’d have figured out a mechanism for carbon sequestration by now. There’s a video on the issue here. The temperatures anticipated in the next decade will be high enough to interfere with germination of seeds—both food crops and trees in the great forests. Giant arboreal forests are now becoming carbon sources rather than carbon sinks. That doesn’t bode well for trees continuing to provide half the planet’s oxygen. And once Arctic Ice is lost, we’ll see ocean temperatures rapidly advance to levels high enough to kill off the phytoplankton that provides almost all the other half of the planet’s oxygen. there are a number of feedback loops on heating that are already in play. Reversing the greenhouse effects of carbon are not sufficient to stop all the problems. And nobody has a solution for sequestering the billions of tons of carbon we’re adding yearly to the atmosphere. Even if we came up with one, costs will be in the trillion-dollar range. And there’s no reason to presume that humans are ready to dump trillions of dollars into solving the climate problem.

And while urbanization can bring benefits in terms of economies of scale, social cohesion, technological innovation, transportation efficiency and more, cities can also be breeding grounds for poverty, pollution and malaise.  To help inspire cities to make the most of the opportunities and minimize downsides of growth, here is Ten Urban Innovations, showcasing new ideas for boosting urban sustainability. The examples fall into four broad categories: better using underused capacity, evening out demand over time, encouraging small-scale infrastructure, and people-centered design. Each includes a “why” and “what” as well as an assessment of the potential for improving global well-being. Most also include a list of links for more information. Here’s a quick summary: Reprogramming Space In growing cities, the need for infrastructure can quickly outpace our ability to build it. many cities are tackling this head-on by repurposing and densifying use of existing urban land rather than building out, and by designing buildings in a way that allows them to switch functions — for example, from a theater to a night club — as needs change. An Internet of Pipes Clean, readily available water supplies are a growing concern for growing cities. Efforts to meet future needs include a variety of Internet-based innovations aimed at managing water challenges such as flood control, rainwater management, supply distribution, pipe leakage reduction and sanitation management. Twitter for Trees Urban trees help reduce temperature extremes, moderate stormwater surges, sequester carbon and capture nutrients from runoff. Melbourne is boosting interest in and appreciation for urban forests by inviting its residents to adopt and name individual trees and share updates, including carbon offset and other information, via social media. Augmented Humans People-powered transit not only helps make cities cleaner and less congested, it also can boost human health and well-being. But bicycling can sometimes seem too demanding for a workday commute. To make it more appealing and accessible, innovators are developing products such as the Copenhagen Wheel, a bike that runs partly on a battery recharged by braking and downhill travel. Co-heating, Co-cooling, CO2 Capture Co-generation facilities boost energy efficiency by taking waste heat from electricity generation and using it to heat or cool buildings. For even more benefit, the carbon dioxide generated in the process can be captured and used for horticulture, manufacturing or other applications. Sharing Spare Capacity City dwellers around the world are reducing the environmental footprint of consumption through sharing networks. Starting with increasingly common practices such as carpooling, lodging rental and shared ownership, the practice is expanding to include things like co-locating enterprises to allow them to share facilities such as gyms or classrooms. Mobility on Demand Computer- and smartphone-assisted traffic management and vehicle routing can reduce time and fuel wasted trying to travel through congested areas. Similarly, self-driving vehicles and car sharing can boost efficiency by maximizing use of vehicles and reducing need for space to park idle ones. Infrastructure for Social Integration The Colombian city of Medellin, once considered one of the world’s most dangerous cities, has been transformed by a focus on architecture and design. Shared spaces and improved public transit blur economic boundaries and boost a sense of connection and culture. Smart Street Poles As cities switch from polluting conventional streetlights to LED-based updates, they have the opportunity to connect light poles to form a web of information sensors that can do everything from gather air quality data to monitor traffic and reduce the risk of crime. Vertical Vegetables Cities can help cut food waste by growing perishable produce right in town, boosting individuals’ connections to food and reducing spoilage-promoting lengthy transit distance and time. With water-based gardening and LED-lighting, walls, roofs and other structures that serve one function can be taught to multitask as a food-producing garden, too. As global population grows, urban population is growing even faster — with 2.5 billion more city dwellers expected by 2050.

You’ll need to juggle a lot of things if you want to be an architect. Architects are not just designers, they are dreamers and doers. There is a unique mind inside the head of an architect that is magically able to juggle numbers, lines and angles, along with creative possibilities that most of us cannot fathom. We want to help you determine whether you could pull off the same juggling act that an architect can. Should you become one? Here’s what it takes to be an architect. 1. The glass is always half empty. This is how architecture is taught. There is always more you could do, things you could try, or ways it could be better. Your project will never be done. Many people learn early on that they pour their heart and soul into a project, and they have a really hard time with the criticism. One of the keys to getting past this is learning to disassociate from “the work”. It helps to think that the work has its own life. The work is what’s being criticized, not you as a person. It sounds silly, but a lot of architecture students never make it past the first year because of this. 2. You’re overly excited about telling people you’re an Architect. Thanks to Ayn Rand, many people (outside of the profession) naturally have a love for the image of an Architect. Sure, saying you’re an Architect can be cool in certain situations every once and while. BUT if this is overly important to you, then you maybe shouldn’t be an architect. The inglorious moments of working long and hard, being challenged by contractors, plans examiners, and difficult clients, will far outnumber the moments when you look cool for being an Architect. People who are successful in this profession care more about doing the work, then being recognized for doing it. Becoming an Architect should only be pursued if you are truly passionate about the work, and not because you want to look cool at a party. You will actually get to go to more parties if you don’t become an Architect. 3. The money sucks Architecture compares terribly in a cost benefit analysis with other professions. After college, entry-level salaries have always been very meager, and long hours are required. Many architects don’t start seeing decent money until after they become somewhat experienced, licensed, and accomplished. This generally takes 5-10 years out of college. I have watched people in other professions work a lot less, with less education, and still make double an Architect’s salary. Being an Architect is just a different lifestyle. Being a poor Architect is also very much a mindset. Not every Architect is destined to be broke. There are many ways out of it. Figuring out how not to be a poor Architect may be your greatest design challenge. The place to start is by studying business, entrepreneurship and learning how to sell architectural services. 4. Most architects don’t design The harsh reality of becoming an architect is that you spend many years in college being your own St architect (Star Architect) in your imaginary academic bubble. Student’s design all types of buildings, make all types of executive decisions, and never really face the harsh realities of business, codes, construct ability, and the public. After college, Graduates just carry out the executive decisions of others and work on the production side of the firm, rather than the decision-making side. Most architecture graduates spend their entire careers simply implementing the design decisions of others. By hacking your way through each annoying detail, and being in the trenches, you are becoming better prepared for being the one to make executive decisions in your future. 5. Hustling is rewarded more than talent Showing up is frequently 75% of the battle. People who are half as talented as you, will typically work three times as hard just to raise the standard. They will be rewarded, get their buildings built, and frequently outperform you. Architecture is one of the most competitive professions. It starts the second you apply to design school and it never stops. Many people have tons of creative energy deep inside of them that can become unlocked in a competitive environment. Embracing the competition is how many people surprise themselves with what they may be capable of as a designer. 7. Don’t even think about calling yourself an Architect, until you fulfill all the licensing requirements. 8. Your good deeds will frequently be punished. 9. You Are Willing to Work Hard Being dedicated to your career is an important factor in any profession, but with architecture, you must be willing to put in a lot of time. This could mean long hours at the office, at the site and even at home working out the details, ensuring perfection until 2 a.m., if necessary. It is your job to make sure every project is safe and sturdy, and that isn’t something that can be done with little effort. 10. You Are a Creative Thinker One of the most important qualities of being an architect is creativity. While staying within the confines of safety regulations, you want to design buildings and spaces that are awe-inspiring. The only way to do this is through creative thinking. Architects must use a combination of the left and right sides of their brain to harness both their logical, mathematical thinking and their unique, originative thinking. If you love to draw, sketch, imagine and create, and you are also a whiz with numbers, then it is highly likely that architecture is the right career path for you. 11. You Have a Love of Nature Putting aside all of the math and science for a moment, architects also have a profound love and deep respect for the natural world. Famous architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright lead the way in teaching architects that their designs should not interrupt the natural world, but rather follow the curves of nature and even enhance its beauty. If you understand that the house is of the hill rather than on the hill, then perhaps a career in architecture is just right for you. The best way for you to know if you have what it takes to become an architect is to actually talk to a few. They can give you in-depth insight into their daily grind, as well as the kind of person you must be and the skills you must have to be successful. Being an architect is more than just drawing and building. It involves social skills; a knowledge of engineering, math, science, physics and several related topics; dedication and drive; and, most important, the ability to design. well hope for useful..

Done wrong it could have potential for disaster. Method of enforcement should be mandatory male and female sterilizations after the first child by means of vasectomy or tubal ligation or any other effective means desired. We’d need to eliminate retirement and maybe even consider military conscription (with the military becoming a profitable government corporation for cheap and dangerous labor) of seniors who had children. Those who didn’t could still retire and never get conscripted. We’d need to do that to deal with the aging population. Otherwise they would be a burden if they didn’t stay in good working physical shape to prevent illness and keep on contributing to the economy. Preventative medicine is much cheaper than treatment of disease. We’d also just need all those old people to still be productive and contribute. So them joining the military would give us the means to ensure preventative medicine like physical fitness and also productivity from some sort of work. We’d need to take effective measures against things like sex selective abortion which might imbalance the gender ratios. If things still got out of balance somehow we could push back by issuing birth permits for only the gender we needed more of until the balance was restored. It would need to be only temporary with planned transition to a two child policy once the population had reduced enough. Due to longevity we couldn’t let people have children until all their grandparents died. Otherwise the population could keep growing from longevity alone. We would absolutely need to make sure there are no exceptions or cheaters. Everyone in the world would need to be DNA registered without exception. We should absolutely feed the children as well as possible to help them become bigger and smarter than their parents. They will need a exercise (PE) program during school that focuses on maximizing brain growth rather than running stamina or anything else. The reason for this is that once the population is reduced we still want the remainder of the human race to have at least the same degree of collective cooperative intelligence as the higher population before them used to have. Fewer bigger brains probably can cooperate together more easily than many smaller brains so it will probably work out well enough even if we don’t double the brain size for every time we halve the population. Still if we could double the average brain size at the same time as halving the total population that would be awesome and would probably total a MUCH higher degree of collective cooperative intelligence, like more than just double. So much intelligence is lost in cooperation and communication. Example, if you put together a group of mice with the total brain size of a present-day average adult human the mice will still be dumb mice and won’t gain all that much from cooperation. The single adult human will always be so much smarter than all the mice because they loose so much in cooperation. They might even be too dumb to cooperate. Even with chimps or some smarter more cooperative animals you will still get the same thing, the human will still be much smarter than their equivalent brain size in combined lesser animals. Well humans with bigger brains might make us look like those chimps, if not those mice. So we could actually effectively make the human race a lot smarter with better technology at the same time as we reduced the population. That would be worthwhile. We will have to focus on using the surpluses created by population reduction to increase standard of living and restore our natural environment. We need to make sure to enjoy the potential benefits of population reduction or it might have been pretty pointless. We need to make sure not to waste it.

It’s not to say we don’t need efficiency, good architecture, tested code, all that. It’s that we need those things because they lead to the best possible user experience. Whether it’s end-user, API consumer, etc., we want reliability, robustness, speed, short development cycles, etc. So in software engineering, we have teams focused on working together and with other teams to deliver the best quality product, and they have to keep extensibility in mind. It’s not building one solution to one problem in the fastest way for that one problem, it’s building that solution in an ecosystem of thousands of other solutions in such a way that future code can be written in the best way possible with maximum mitigation of risk and rewriting. Think of lumberjacking/logging. Seriously? Yes, unfortunately my analogy skills hit a wall today, but bear with me.  Ever see these logging competitions on TV? The guys make so many types of cuts in the shortest amount of time within given parameters of the contest. That’s how they win. It’s a sport. Competitive programming is a lot like this. You don’t care about anything except for the shortest path to the best “cut” and that’s the whole point.  Real life is a little more like this. Here we see different tools used for different jobs to ensure safety. A team working together to make sure the “system” is functioning properly. Beyond this image, we have sustainability experts, logistics experts, etc. Hell, the guy in the first image doesn’t even need a hardhat, it’s so controlled. It’s the same in software engineering. The singular focus is fun, but in the world of professional software engineering, actions have consequences. Now, obviously a log falling on a worker is more fatal on the front-end of mistakes, but try telling the team writing code for life support machines that the stakes aren’t just as high. Overlap You might think that wait, the lumberjack competition is occupied by professionals in the field. And in general, you’d be right. Though in competitive programming, you’ll see a lot of software professionals as well, doing that as their hobby. Just like the professional logger isn’t going to be flying through cuts for speed in their dayjob, the professional software engineer is likely to keep the two separated, even if it may make for good cross training.

Having been forged deep within the earth, stone is naturally weather-resistant – particularly igneous varieties. That’s not to say stone is immortal. There are three major threats to its longevity: Earthquakes: Stone is brittle, so sudden shifts can cause it to crack.Acid rain: An increasing issue in highly polluted cities, acid rain can dissolve stone over time.Rising/salt damp: Porous stone like sandstone can be affected by rising damp, which can decay the material from the inside.These potential hazards aside, you can expect stone to last far beyond your own lifetime.

The best large company that has shown the best process and results is 3M. Let me tell you a few ways they manage innovation. 3M takes a long-term approach to the new product development process by creating a culture of innovation that encourages risk-taking, tolerates mistakes made along the way, and rewards achievement. A culture of innovation means that senior management encourages employees to spend a significant portion of their time on products and research that go beyond their usual scope of responsibilities.  Another way 3M capitalizes on its innovation success isby combining diverse technologies in new and unexpected ways. 3M draws upon innovative technologies from its portfolio of 55,000 products to create new solutions, such as using dental technology applied to car parts. By makingthese uncommon connections, the company pioneers new ways of innovating. Long before Google its engineers one day a week to pursue their own ideas, 3M let its researchers do the same with up to 15% of their time. In another unusual practice, 3M awards annual Genesis Grants, worth as much as $100,000, to company scientists for research. The money is allocated by their peers and is spent on projects for which ""no sensible, conventional person in the company would give money The company, as a result, had  in place agoal to generate 30% of revenue from new products introduced in the past fiveyears.   It's about inventing hundreds and hundreds of Next Small Things, year after year.  So how does 3M get these great results from its product innovation? They believe their success can be described in thefollowing seven points: They are committed to innovation. One sure way to show that is with money. In 2005, 3M spent $1.24 billion on research and development, or 6% of its $21.2 billion in revenue. That's an unusually high amount for an industrial manufacturer. And of that R&D outlay, a fifth went to basic research or pursuits that have no immediate practicality.  My takeaway: investment is certainly a measure of innovation commitment, necessary, but unfortunately not sufficient. Other measures of commitment are needed, such as celebrating even small successes by upper management. Related post: 6 Amazing Facts on Innovation You Need to Know The corporate culture must be actively maintained. Newcomers also quickly learn the stories of how 3M developed the first audio tapes, for instance, or Scotchgard. Tribes and peoples keep their cultures alive through oral histories; so does 3M.  Mytakeaway: a company’s culture is important for its employees to understand priorities and how things can get done. Stories of the past successes are the best way to enhance a corporate culture. Innovation is impossible without a broad base of technology. For instance, 3M claims to have leading know-how in 42 diverse technologies. That allows researchers to take an idea from one realm and apply it to another.  My takeaway: the more “dots you have to connect” the more new ideas you will find. 3M has long encouraged networking -- formal and informal -- among its researchers.  The scientists  formed an organization called the Technical Forum in 1951. It invites all of the company's 9,700 R&D personnel to an annual symposium, where everyone can see what everyone else is working on. Labs also host their own conferences and Webcasts and elect representatives to a governing body to set policy.  My takeaway: collaboration is one of the key enablers of innovation as innovation rarely starts from a single spark, but rather collaboration of many smart contributors. The company rewards employees for outstanding work, based on pre-established goals. The folks who call themselves 3Mers take pride in discoveries that lead to real-world products. Management reinforces this by fostering a dual-career ladder so veteran researchers can continue to move up without becoming managers. It also honors hundreds of employees -- nominated and selected by their peers -- for scientific achievements every year. And it gives the top 20 overachievers and their spouses a four-day holiday at 3M's corporate retreat. My takeaway: recognizing results is a great way to demonstrating the value of a company’s human capital. It also builds the innovative culture the company is so committed to.  Quantify efforts. 3M tallies how much of its revenue comes from products introduced in the past four years to judge whether its R&D money is being spent wisely. That way management can assess which lab is hitting its mark and which may be falling short. After reviewing its data, the company centralized basic research from 14 centers around the world to its headquarters campus in 2003. My takeaway:  if something is critically important to a business, as product innovation is to 3M, then it is important to be measured. It would be very interesting to review 3M’s detailed measurement plan and its results.  Research must be tied to the customer. Employees spend a lot of time with customers to understand what their needs are so they can go back to the labs to come up with valuable products. Of course, results will vary.  My takeaway: nothing earth shaking as all successful companies must be good here. Again, not much detail available on their specific ways to identify and prioritize customer wants and needs.

He/she may not be. They often are good at some topics, average at others, and bad at some. Many of them may be out of sync completely with latest IT tools, communication skills, and presentation / visualisation abilities. [ I say this out of my experience as an employer for more than 2 decades ]What do companies that hire these MBAs really want? - If you check the career graph of the most successful IIM graduates, you'll find them great at these 5 things -Leadership ability - the strength with which they lead a team, or the full company itselfLearning ability - things change, and change itself accelerates, making intense learning ability a key to sustained leadershipSmartness - the ability to see what'll sell, and what'll bombPeople skills - the passion to connect with team-members, work positively with them, bring the best to the table from everyoneAbility to take stress - the strength to consistently put in efforts day in, and day out (needs terrific emotional, psychological and physical fitness)So anyone who is an MBA from an IIM and is blessed with these traits, or can develop these in time, will reap rich rewards. As long as companies will exist, they will need exceptional leaders to ensure their survival and prosperity. But are the packages really justified? Yes, and No. Yes - because they help snatch the best talent available on campus, and ensure that competition doesn't get it. No, because they can lull someone into complacency pretty soon. But do the IIMs really develop the 5 skills mentioned above? A clear anwer - No. Most of the people making it to the best of the IIMs have these latent skills, and the selection procedure just ensures such people get in. And then, they have the environment, the tools, the opportunity to really break through. But is the selection procedure perfect? Not at all! It's just like all other imperfect examinations in the world, that are great at minimising imperfections, not eliminating it. So being a domain expert is irrelevant? Not at all. The most successful of CEOs will need the best of domain experts to aid their grand vision. And yes, a lot of CAs and some Law experts also end up doing an MBA, to shore up their CVs, and take advantage of certain opportunities otherwise out of reach. A simple example - Abraham Lincoln, who never fought personally in any battle let alone the massive US Civil War, is consistently ranked as the best US President ever. He was great at leading, getting the best Generals, and demolishing competition to ensure national unity. He is revered precisely for that. So how exactly is a leader different from a manager? The difference between a leader and a manager is often simple -  a leader knows the goal and can rally people to that. A manager helps manage the journey to that goal.a leader can see things in the future (don't ask me ""how""); a manager can help convert that into reality through day-to-day operational excellencea leader can passionately drum up people's conscience and energies into a unified whole, raring to go; a manager (or a functional expert) provides the nuts-and-bolts for the raceSo what should I do? Become a leader, or a manager? If you were leader material, you would never even ask this question. So can domain experts like, say, CAs never lead a company?  Not at all! Many with the skills needed to do THAT are doing it. Example of one great CA doing precisely that is the dashing Mr. Kumar Managalam Birla! He has something interesting to say, here - CAs face major challenge from MBAs: Kumar Mangalam Birla  Finally, are the packages really justified? The late Sumantra Ghoshal, one of the most clear-headed of management gurus India has produced in a long time, used to say - ""... and only 10% of managers have the right mix of energy and focus to make all the difference ..."" Those proverbial 10% are the ones running the show today. Have a great day :)",2021-03-06T19:52:59.033Z,"Why are MBAs from IIMs hired at hefty packages even when they are not experts in any particular subject? ",Quora

The good news is that you've been exposed to marketing theories, which will help on the consultation side. I suggest creating a business plan and treat your interest like the startup business it is (or will become). You'll need a website, networking targets, and a deep analysis of your consumers. The latter will come from apprenticing with an existing consultant, or within a firm that has outside associates who act as independent contractors (like a PR firm would have). To ramp up your sustainability skillset do a couple of things first:  Sit down and rewrite your resume as if you are looking for work as a sustainability expert now – yes, even before you’re ready. This is an important exercise that will show you immediately where you have transferrable skills and where you don’t. It will bolster your confidence a bit, and give you tangible evidence of where you need to improve your resume Join every LinkedIn and Facebook group that focuses on sustainability, and begin to jump in and ask insightful or clarifying questions. Give very brief opinions on topics and questions raised by others – but only after you research what good answers should be, always doing so without conveying that you know with absolute certainty of what you speak. At this stage it’s not about establishing yourself as an expert, it’s about joining the conversation in a meaningful way. Be sure to compliment people whose responses you like. You’ll get to know industry vendors and leaders, and it will give you an opportunity to slowly build your network and reputation Go to every workshop, MeetUp meeting, or professional organization that hosts anything related to sustainability. Here you’ll also be inside the conversation and meet others who do what you want to do or need what you’ll eventually provide. (e.g. IFMA has local chapters in most major cities and has at least one or two sustainability speakers at their meetings each year, and you may be able to attend for free or for a very small cover change.) Start a new Pinterest profile that only has sustainability-related themes. This does two things: it focuses your attention on what’s trending and relevant, and gives you conversation starters that will eventually lend your interest in the topic credibility Compile as many quality links as you can (in a Favorites folder on your web browser) on other sustainability consultants and experts, and then cull through them to develop your marketing strategy and collateral designs. Also check to see what credentials and experience they have so you’ll now best what your next steps should be to position yourself well within this group of peers Compile a folder of links to vendors as well, and in the title of the link be sure to note what they specialize in for easier reference later (e.g. Hightower Integration – chilled water control panels) Figure out one small sustainability task you can do NOW and volunteer to assist a local nonprofit with it so you can build your confidence and create references (e.g. Find a nursing home that needs better recycling habits and offer to design signage and connect them to appropriate agencies that will help with the implementation) Decide what your brand’s ethics will be and give yourself hard limits to adhere to them with every person (business-wise or personal) every time. Examples might include: always delivering on time without ever renegotiating, being the most prepared person in the room, having the most polish presentations/documents, being warm and approachable to everyone, etc. Find someone in sustainability you connect with who will let you ask them questions from time to time. If you meet over coffee bring them a nice thank-you gift to the first meeting, and then at each subsequent one (even if they tell you it isn’t necessary). If you meet online or by telephone, email them afterward with a gift card code for Amazon or Starbucks ($10 is plenty). The point is to keep this resource juicy – you want them to remain excited to help you. Trust me, it will pay off in spades and leave them ready to say good things about your thoughtfulnessThe great news is that if you do even half the suggestions listed here you'll be at least as successful as 50% of other sustainability consultants.

This is borne out by examining the paleoclimate of the Earth during the last 600 million years, determining its rate of change and then comparing it to the rate the Earth is warming today. Scientific studies of the Earth’s past climate have identified that the Earth progresses from a state of being cool to being warm and then back to being cool again. The data of the average global temperature that represents a changing cool/warm state was published by Dr C. R. Scotese and is available for viewing on his Paleomap Project website. The Average global temperature graph that is found on the website indicates the peaks and troughs in the Earth’s average global temperature across the periods of the last 600 million years. It takes a little interpretation because the axis on the graph are not linear but there is a clear example of the rate of change in the average global temperature that can be used to compare against what is happening today. The Permian period is a time that existed 300 to 250 million years ago. The period began when an ice age ended and continued until it reached a peak average global temperature point. Both the ice age (the Karoo ice age) and the peak temperature point (the time of the Permian mass extinction event) are well documented times. The part of the graph of interest is shown below.  Estimates of the bottom and peak temperatures were determined as shown on the diagram and it is known that the Permian Period lasted 50 million years. The rate of change calculation is based on a straight line between the 2 points. The temperature went from 12.7 to 28°C, a change of 15.3°C in 50 million years. The result is a rate of change of 0.306°C per million years. There may be a small error in the manner in which the data points were estimated but any small error would not discredit the data as even a 2 degree error would only have a marginal impact on the assessed rate of change. The historical data was then compared to what is happening today. The source for today’s data was the average annual global land and ocean temperature anomaly published by NASA/GISS. Note that this data was assessed in 2017 from published data up to 2016. The NASA/GISS data is in graphical form as shown below. Trend lines were added to the graph to determine the rate of change over a 60 year and a 56 year period.  The trend data shows that the current rate of warming is progressing at 0.0168°C per annum. The rate of warming for the decade ending 2016 was confirmed by NOAA when they reported, in their 2016 annual climate report, that they computed a decadal increase of 0.17°C. A rate of change of 0.17°C per decade is equivalent to a rate of change of 17,000°C per million years. If the rate of change of today’s average global temperature is divided by the rate of change of the Permian Period’s temperature then the speed that global warming is advancing the temperature today, compared to its speed during the Permian Period, can be determined. Dividing 17,000 by 0.306 states that, today, warming is 55,555 times faster than during the Permian Period. Simply, today it takes 55 years to raise the average global temperature of the Earth by 1°C but it took, on average, nearly 3.3 million years during the Permian Period. The Permian Period had only natural forces promoting the rate of change of the average global temperature. There was no rapid consumption of potential energy sources. There was no life that knew how to produce energy and create an artificial environment. There are no physical differences in the Solar System between then and today that would cause the substantial natural rate of warming experienced today. There is still only one Sun and its thermal output is about what it was 250 million years ago. Therefore, today’s rate of change in the average global temperature in a warming trend should be comparable to the rate during the Permian Period if it wasn’t for human energy generation activity. The conclusion is that the difference in the rate of global warming has to do with human activity. Global concern regarding global warming has accelerated significantly over the last few years. It is now a matter taken up by protest and demonstration and a key feature of some governmental panels. The reality of global warming is that, based on the elements described above and an assessment of today’s average global temperature based on Dr. C. R. Scotese’s data, the Earth has surpassed the delineating average global temperature that separates a cool from a warm state. The data indicates that today’s average global temperature, based on Dr Scotese’s scale, is about 19.2°C; 2.2°C above the 17°C cool/warm period divider. The past tells us that when the Earth is above 17°C: · The Polar Regions are free of sea ice. · There is no glacial ice on Greenland and Antarctic. · There is no permafrost or cold tundra. · Mountain ranges are free of glacial ice. · Snow that deposits anywhere about the Earth melts in summer. · Sea levels are higher. · Aridity expands. · The warm temperate zones are pushed further up the North and South latitudes. It points out where the Earth’s environment is quickly heading towards. Only humans could have caused this change so anthropogenic climate change is a fact.

6043deafed76476feda36a6d,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-challenges-that-limit-the-effort-put-in-by-supply-chains-to-improve-sustainability?-,"Sustainability in supply chain is one of the key areas that need to be improved a lot with plenty of scope and opportunity. I’ll list down a few things I’ve observed and learned. Firstly, to have any improvement in the supply chain, the end-user (in this context the procured) should have a sustainable procurement policy in place. If I run a small scale industry, I may have a few suppliers and if I run a large-scale industry, I would have several suppliers. However, I can categorically divide these suppliers into several different buckets and develop a policy that would fit for each bucket.Secondly, after developing the policies, it is important to educate the suppliers about the objective and values that resonate with being sustainable. Several suppliers might not have the bandwidth to meet some of the criteria defined and hence it is important to understand their limitations and make sure that they do not have resource constraints.Thirdly, tracking the entire supply chain to the root. Remember that most of your suppliers are middlemen and they do not probably know how the materials are sourced, packaged, and delivered. This is an extremely hard and time-consuming process. Imagine that you go to a supermarket and you pick a nicely packed tea that reads organic green tea. If you trace back that green tea to the place it was cultivated, perhaps it would reveal more details to you for you to make that choice of buying it or not. Quite possible for that tea grower to have not paid a living wage to the one who cultivated it. Quite possible that the wholesale procured not having paid enough to the cultivator. Quite possible for the tea leaves to have been transported in a vehicle that emits more carbon. One can keep on farming so many scenarios that could have missed the mark. As an end-user, while having a sip of that certified organic tea, you may feel proud to have been a good consumer. However, you do not have complete control to see any data that would validate the claim.Fourthly, data collection, validation, reporting, storing is another huge issue in the supply chain. In modern days though it is easier for us to be able to store, access data from the cloud, there is a huge possibility for most of these data to be manipulated. I do see blockchain as a possible technology that could fill in this void. However, there is still a long way to go in adopting blockchain into supply chain (Already some industries have started this).Fifthly, integration of sustainability into the blockchain. Today, sustainability is not taught as one of the mainstream subjects. So, when we sit on a table to discuss, always a sustainability expert is necessary to emphasize engineers the need to integrate sustainability. It is high time that sustainability is made as one of the core subjects to be learned.Finally, the most important aspect is the intention. Today, almost every single manufacturer knows that their customers will buy their product irrespective of what they do to their supply chain. So, unless the CEO shows intent, it is hard for them to suddenly introduce or even think about sustainability in their supply chain.",2021-03-06T19:57:35.112Z,"What are some challenges that limit the effort put in by supply chains to improve sustainability?

Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) require environment and sustainability experts in their team for the smart cities and green cities development that the country is promoting today.Environmental Impact Assessment - A specialization in forestry could land you a good position with EIA consultancies, as an environmental clearance is a must for development projects to happen. Since forestry also includes land degradation issues, water management, etc., this gives you a chance to specialize further.Environment Law - The field is growing due to increasing awareness about environmental degradation and climate change. You might need another degree for this.Project consultancies - A lot of consultancy companies work by bidding for projects and conducting surveys/feasibility studies/project concept design for development projects as well as conservation activities. Both big and small players are present in this field.Banks - Private banks today are looking to cash in on the investment potential for climate-resilient projects, and need an expert who can assess the potential of a project. You could be one of them.Interdisciplinary opportunities - If you can find activities that involve forestry with another activity, your options multiply. Some examples are urban forestry and agro-forestry.Project consultant - If you wish to work in environmental think-tanks and development sector players like TERI, CSE, GGGI, GIZ, etc., there will be (evaluated) internship and project consultant opportunities for you. This would initially start as a contract job for a specified year, but the organizations could take you on if you can show that will add value.NGOs - Another development sector opportunity exists in NGOs. Many NGOs work in improving ecosystem services and natural resources management at local scales (few work at national and international scales as well). You can venture into areas like land-use management, water conservation, building climate resilience, socio-economic adaptation, etc. The pay may not be very high, though.Wildlife conservation - Many of my colleagues from college have chosen this path. Studying wildlife and implementing conservation methods is a satisfying and a very wide field. Getting into this will require further studies and further specialization. People with zoology, botany and environmental science backgrounds also enter this field.Remote sensing and GIS - This is more of a skill, and it is a skill that is in very high demand in the market today. Private and government organizations need GIS experts for most of their projects, since it is a fantastic tool.Climate Policy - Many organizations specifically focus on influencing climate policy and the national and international levels. Some of these are CPI and CPR. You could look for vacancies here.Diversify your interests and explore interlinkages with other industries in the country. This is where you will find most work opportunities today. I would also suggest you make plenty of connections, speak with your seniors and alumni associations to keep yourself updated about the industry requirements. Keep working on your soft skills as well. There are plenty of opportunities out there. There are very few who manage to stick to the exact same field they studied in college.

This rite de passage includes not just dressing professionally for the occasion, but also includes having a confident body language. It is okay to take pauses or to think things over in your defense, but what you need crucially (apart from a bottle of water close by), is the confidence that comes from being an authority on a subject. You might not be calm inside, but you need to emit calmness. 2. One of the ways to do the above is to do a very cliched thing: prepare.

Observe, note, and learn from those thesis defenses by other graduate students. You have the privilege of being an observer in a performance where you will be called to participate some months/weeks later. Make mental notes of: What did you like? What appeared strong? What appeared average? How would you have done it differently? 3. A mighty preparation includes knowing your thesis inside-out, to the extent of knowing the location of all the commas and semicolons. Read your printed, pdf thesis. Your committee members would be making notes (based on which they’ll ask you questions) from that printed copy, not your MS-word file. When they turn onto page 168, adjusting their glasses, squinting their eyes, and ask you about a specific sentence, you should be able to know exactly what they are talking about. Our memories process things differently based on different visual interface. So, practice with the interface you will be grilled about. 4. In an ideal world, the research question guides the research methodology. However, it often happens, that you followed a particular methodology because of your advisor’s or your committee member’s insistence. You cannot whine about “That was not my choice” in your thesis defense. Know your methodology, know recent developments in the literature, know its limitations, its strengths, and defend them like the Hulk. 5. Practice, practice and practice, to multiple kind of audiences, like your roomies (who might not know shit about your topic) to your fellow graduate students, to anybody who is kind enough to offer you an audience. This has several advantages: You learn to modulate your voice. This is a must in delivering an interesting speech.You learn where you are sounding drab, which areas you are coming alive, and try to balance it out.As contrasted with practicing alone, where we tend to speak in a cool, collected manner, we tend to scurry through a presentation in front of an audience – because we want to come to the “interesting part” quick enough (i.e. the analysis and conclusions) in our over-eagerness to show our stimulating work. This is a rookie mistake you wouldn’t want to be making. You do have an audience, who are there, willing to listen why and how you toiled over a problem, sacrificing your blood, sweat, money, tears and years. Concentrate and balance each parts of the How-s and Why-s.You get honest feedback and constructive criticism of the areas of speech where you are unclear, lisping, stuttering, or appear boring. Ask for honest feedback. There is always room for improvement.Ask your rehearsal audience to grill you with questions.If possible, video record yourself, and watch your body language and whether you tend to say “uhhh….Umm….unwanted “so…-s” while transitioning between sentences or paragraphs in your speech. Cut Those OUT.6. Open your defense in the strongest way possible where you can show how you added on to continuum of knowledge. Do not gurgle your literature review or the lags that your research had addressed. Your committee members, presumably, have already read your thesis. A student would repeat, a professional would bring something new to the table. Do not forget you are a professional now (well, almost about). Create a bridge (if possible) between how your research connects with the real world. Your opening should be very sharp, very focused and concise. Invest a good amount of time and efforts for the opening – it’s your crucial stepping stone to gaining centre-stage. 7. Your thesis defense is a stage set up to test whether you could be certified to go to the other side of the fence. In writing, your committee members know you can, otherwise you wouldn’t be asked to defend. It remains so that a core element of academic life, is to be able to have critical conversations on research. Your defense is the opportunity to demonstrate that you can make, and engage, in that critical conversation. There could be questions coming your way that might seem to mock your work, or look down on your methods, but essentially, your committee members are actually treating you like a peer—who should be knowledgeable enough to defend their work, and be honest in accepting limitations of the work, or find the future directions of that kind of research work. Do not sweat if you don’t know the answer to a particular question. If you’ve read your thesis well, and if you have prepared well, remember this in your heart – you will be able to arrive at an answer, based on the arsenals your possess. Keep breathing in deep, and deploy the best you can. Think and behave like an independent researcher, and you will be okay. 8. Know your committee members well. It is understood that you will know your supervisor/advisor better than your spouse/romantic partner, but the person(s) you will know least about, are your external(s). While preparing for your defense, read up their work. Assess the methodological and theoretical issues they are passionate about. Try to think like them and look at your work, and see, how you in their avatar can critique your work. Do not however, get stuck on a list of questions, but identify the issues/strategies they could ask you about, and hone them well. 9. Your committee members would not know what you know. Yes, they’ve read your thesis, but they might not be aware of the inherent problematization of a concept/theory/method you’ve used. It is essential to touch upon your particular ontological frame of reference, or your logic of why you did what you did in your speech. 10. Eat, drink and sleep well in the days leading up to your defense. Do not feel you’ve earned long hours of procrastinations because you’re burned out from your Ph.D work. Eat healthy, prepare your meals (those would be nice breaks from all the prep), take long walks or hit the gym, cut down on your over-caffeinated reinforcements, and sleep well. Think and visualize not only your defense, but also how relieved you will feel after your defense. You will. Just never lose your confidence about it. A thesis defense is the time to show to your academic community, who is the boss – YOU. A dissertation is your baby, and nobody knows (or should know) your baby better than the parents who gives birth to it. Therefore, rather than going imagined wobbly in your knees, breathe easy, because you, as the PhD student who is about to defend their thesis, knows best about that dissertation. It follows therefore, that you believe yourself so. Breathe easy, and also breathe in deep, as you read onto the following advice: 1. DO NOT act like a graduate student.

But the Green New Deal from Congress is only one start, and I would actually suggest we need ‘Green New Deals’ across all different sectors and industries. I recently reached out to sustainability experts across different fields like education, sports, and movies and asked what a ‘Green New Deal’ would look like in their fields, and the answers showed just how much work there can be done outside of politics. For example, a Green New Deal for movies might include the following provisions: Noting that the motion picture industry is a truly multi-disciplinary one (e.g., on the production side alone there’s construction, transportation, food services, human resources, finance, manufacturing, and more), Zena suggests that TV and film are ideal candidates to embrace sustainability from top to bottom. If she could snap her fingers and get what she wanted (a more benevolent version of 2018 film icon Thanos), Zena would implement the following: Education on climate change and related sustainability production practices for everyone in the industry, because knowing the why behind sustainability most often leads to shift in behavior in practice (in particular, collective action from local film communities are often the best models to influence change).Modeling sustainable production practice in all media forms to demonstrate the type of world we want to live in (e.g., why do we show plastic cups on screen in commercials that are about insurance when it would be just as easy to show reusable dishware?).Consistent implementation and tracking of sustainable production practices and impacts behind the scenes on production in all departments, including use of low-impact (e.g., organic or post-consumer recycled) materials and reduced consumption– from materials for set walls to meat in catering.Implementation of zero-emission, alternative power technologies for both vehicles and generators (such as Portable Electric battery power stations).More dialogue across the industry and with the public about sustainability on the set and beyond– if filmmakers aren’t talking about these issues then they haven’t done their job as storytellers. See recent reminders of how the motion picture industry can influence cultural change in #MeToo, #StopSucking, and #TimesUp. Zena suggests a #SustainableProduction movement to push culture closer to the tipping point for widespread action.

A healthy and clean ganga will lead to better health and better overall standard of living of nearly 500 million people and above all a better India.In July 2014, the government announced “Namami Ganga,” (in Sanskrit it means “obeisance to the Ganges”), an Integrated Ganges Development Project, and allocated around $334 million for it.If everything works according to the plan the Ganges is expected to be cleaned within the next 4 years.  ​​​ ​these jars contain sample of the water of river Ganga collected from various locations ,which gradually becomes more and more polluted ​   Why not other rivers ? It would be wrong to say that other rivers are being completely ignored.There has been a generous amount of fund allocation for their cleaning and beautification too.But those are not as large and challenging as the cleaning of Ganga.Hence all the limelight falls on the Namami Gange project,making us think that only Ganga is been looked after.This magnanimous project of cleaning Ganga will by far be the biggest cleaning drive in the human history. Massive resources will be invested into this project which will make it virtually impossible for undertaking cleanliness projects of other rivers simultaneously by the government.If the Ganga river project gets completed this will be the greatest achievement for any Indian government(I pray that it gets completed)Once this great feat will be achieved the government will surely look to do the same with the other important rivers too.. How good is the government's initiative? Now to even talk about cleaning Ganga one needs guts, let alone a government. Modi governments initiative is by far the most properly planned one and the implementation of this has also started and is in the initial stages. This cannot be a poll gimmick at all because it's a very risky project and believed to be nearly impossible to complete by many of the experts. But the optimism of Modi government is remarkable and that's what makes me a strong advocate of the new government.  also the question why only ganga first? makes anyone think of a religious agenda behind the question. let me make it clear that more than 20%population of the people dependent on the Ganges are Non-hindus their lives well also be positively impacted.Then how can this be a communal move? and whatever Modi is doing nowadays is being seen through as an agenda. people please stop this kind of thinking and see through the point of view that our PM is atleast doing something about an issue of which previous governments were even scared to speak of.Hope all Indians support the mission.

East was at that time, the most developed part of the world.  ￼ Yes, this little country in orange defeat these two badasses.   After that battle, happened this  ￼ • First Serbian Uprising from 1804-1812  Imagine some tens of thousands of peasants unite together and fight and WIN battle after battle against one of Great Power at that time - Ottoman Empire who were better in every aspect of “game,"" in military weapons, much bigger military, and so on.  ￼ This white area in brown empire area was the result with that Uprising *Beginnings of 20th century* •First Balkan war Now imagine that little country destroys the Ottoman empire to liberate with Bulgaria and Greece the entire Balkan peninsula.  The leader of the Ottoman said how Serbs were impossible to beat at that time. And went from this  To this  •First World War Biggest reputation Serbs got at this time of history.  They started beating Austro - Hungaria, which was more than ten times bigger and stronger from military and population standpoint than Serbia and also mixed of multiple nations.  Now imagine one little country beat Austrians, Hungarians, Croatians, Bosniaks, Slovakians, and so on all together in Battle after Battle. Most significant was the Battle of Kolubara, which is a tactic that military schools are teaching still to this day. Which resulted in liberating Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia and map like this  •'99 Bombing on Serbia Look at this powerful F-16 AirPlane or how people call them Invisible AirPlane, most advanced airforce at that time let this monster.  This is what happened to him in Serbia  And there are many more battles where they won against multiple stronger enemies. Now, who knows recently history could say: “huh, what happened in '41.” It was impossible to win; look at this map.  From every side of the border, Axis Forces would attack. From Hungary, Romanian, Bulgarian, Albanian, Italian (through Albania) from the Adriatic coast, and the German side started the invasion. Also, they could say “But, look at how they lost in Yugoslavia wars in the ‘90s.” There is also a great explanation. It was a significant loss of reputation that Serbs had. It is true, but the reason for that is much more profound. Serbs were almost half of the century under communist rule, where being a patriot or nationalist would be massively punished, so Serbs were pushing not just their national pride but national identity. While all of that didn't occur in Croatia, for example, they started building their national identity and pride form the building of Yugoslavia. That is the reason why they were the ones who want to leave Yugoslavia, not Serbia. And what goes to my thesis is that Serbia got that name in the year 2003, ""Serbs leader"" loved Yugoslavia that much that they needed 12 years to change the name Now, when the war started, they weren't so in a lovely passion for Serbia, which was easily manifested in their motivation. If you have no idea anything more profound about your nation, nationality and everything that you learn in your entire lifetime was brotherhood and unity and Yugoslavia, then, everyone could understand their motivation and how that is important in war The “Serbs” leaders of war loved more Yugoslavia than Serbia because they were raised in a family who had a strong bond to the Yugoslavia army, not Serbia And even if that wasn't true they weren't so good as a commando-like, for example, was Zivojin Music (leader of Kolubara battle that I mentioned earlier) And also, even if they had all those components on the other side, was two nations helped with NATO and the United Nations at least, and most significant powers were on their side and with all of that smart Miloshevich used only proxy military (of R. Srpska and R. Srpska Krajina) and paramilitary. Official YNA (Yugoslavian Army) wasn't activated. Summa summarum Serbs did impossible when they would face extinction, even when they lost and invaded by Ottomans and Nazi's Germany Serbs would never surrender and would attack them on daily basis forming paramilitary movements like Partisan and Chetniks in WW2 and Hajduk and Uskoks movements in Ottoman empire which was said by Nazi Germans and Ottomans that Serbia is place where they have felt most insecure. But also, on the other side, when they didn't have that motivation of being invaded, they would most likely lose. Like they did in 1885 in war with Bulgaria where they didn't have a liberating goal or something like that. And all of that needs to be inherent with a strong national identity, and you have formidable soldiers. Some of you could ask: - “who the f*ck are you to talk about this topic?” And unfortunately, I can't defend myself that I've got the credibility of being some military general But I can mention what greatest general of all time said  Talking to Britain's diplomats, Napoleon Bonaparte insisted that Kara-George Petrovich, who was a leader of First Serbian Uprising, was the greatest General of all time  Now, WHY are Serbs so good soldiers? The answer for me is this. Practice makes perfect (or even better, being so good). Serbs had a lot of practice, war after war. There wouldn't pass one generation if there weren't some wars.Epigenetic proves that genes are forming by our lifestyle, our mental fight, our environment, and so on. I would say that is also the reason why Serbs became genetically fighter, which proves our sport. Serbs are so good at sportsHope you learned something new, all the best :) Edit 1 There is so interesting story of the Serbian version of Mulan.

As Baynard put it. “The thought of our two lovely Seafires, of all aircraft, pranging in smart succession on a famous Yankee carrier of all places, kept me swearing and thumping the sides of the fuselage in rage.” The contrast between Essex and HMS Implacable was striking. “ Their fighter Ready Room was made our headquarters… When I say Ready Room I mean Ready Room, not a poky hole like ours. To start with it’s air conditioned. Hot coffee, fruit and sandwiches etc, are always available throughout strike days.” As for the equipment. “Pilots leave their flying gear hanging up along the walls. I had a look at some of it. It was of superb quality and much more comprehensive. I was glad I was not wearing my ‘issue’ jungle flying suit as it would have been laughed at. Their suits contain everything that one could possibly desire for a really Ritzy picnic with some luscious island babe.” Hospitality was typically American too. “Their CO or ‘Skip’, as he was called, came up to us after he had completed his briefing and said: ‘Mighty glad to have you fellows. Just make yourselves at home. If there’s anything you want, why, tell our dooty officer here and he’ll fix it for you’” Then. “As soon as I got into the bunk room people started lashing me up with cigarettes and chewing gum and asked all the gen about Seafires, Spitfires, Typhoons and Tempests.” I think it’s safe to say that the Brits were impressed, maybe a little envious. There was one thing that the British did have which the Americans wished they had too. “The Flight Deck is about 100 feet longer and 20 or so feet wider than Implacable’s and it has a cat walk all around it and none of those blasted bits of gunnery equipment sticking up all over the place. The flight deck is not armoured. All the ‘merchants’ I came across were very envious of our four inches of armour. When one of those goddam Kamikaze sons of bitches hits us, boy, how we burn….” Contrary to many British expectations of Americans, including Baynard’s. “I don’t think I have ever met such sincere hospitality and no-one could do enough for us. Neither was there any of the expected line shooting and other bulsh. Exactly the opposite. There was no personal trumpet blowing whatsoever, in spite of Essex’s history having been one of continuous battle honours since her launch.” Finally the Seafires. “Ken’s Seafire was ditched on the second day but mine was still on board when we left, under guard in the hangar. I think they were going to keep it as a souvenir until they got back to a museum in the United States.” It would be interesting to know what eventually happened to the Seafire.",2021-03-06T20:07:37.654Z,"What do British sailors think of US aircraft carriers?

One thing most of us will agree is that we all want some discipline in our acts and daily routine. And doing a simple exercise on daily basis at the exact time without a drop act as a start or 1st stage for developing discipline. Great result from exercise comes with the following of diet.

Also, exercise promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being.

That which has the capacity to sustain is indeed dharma. (M.B. Karna Parva 69:58) “Dharma” cannot be known through empirical means such as cognition. It can be known only either through intuition or through an impersonal source of knowledge. The problem with relying on reason or intuition is that individuals will come to differing conclusions about what the ultimate nature of the “Common Good” is. There are endless controversies on most if not all ethical issues by “experts” who take one side or the other. The best and most universal source of Dharma therefore, would be an “impersonal” source such as the Vedas. What is Dharma? The science of conduct, the systematized principles according to which one should act. Ethical science is a relative science — relative to the individual and one's surroundings and circumstances. The purpose of morality is to bring about happiness for the maximum number of people by creating harmony. Harmony between individuals of a family, between families of a community, between communities that live together in a nation. Harmony between nations that make up humanity. Harmony between humankind and the environment and other creatures that share our earth. And harmony between earthlings and the inhabitants of other worlds. Where there is harmony there is happiness, disharmony cause unhappiness. The ultimate object of morality is to bring about universal happiness. The underlying principle of Dharma is the recognition of the unity of the Self and the diversity of the not-self.

Likewise tanks such as the Tiger 1 and 2 are loved for their individual combat performance but shit on for unreliability and their cost to produce. In other words every tank is a mixed bag. Tanks such as the Panzer III, Sherman and Stug have already been covered, so my choice of underrated tank will probably be unpopular and controversial, but I will soon explain my choice. My choice is the Panzerkampfwagen V “Panther”  And you might be thinking I’m crazy, or the tank breaks down or gets to much praise for it’s performance and cost. But what many forget is that with later variants of the Panther the problems were resolved. And it wasn’t that the Panther was actually unreliable, the thing was that it was rushed to production and as with most tanks rushed to production it had certain problems. The Panther’s only real problem was when the gears broke down and since there was a lack of spare parts since the tank was also rushed to the front line. What really sets the Panther apart from other German designs is armor.  As seen in this picture, the panther had armor it’s front armor angled at 53 degrees and was 80mm thick which made it immune to anything but the Soviet 122mm. It also had a 75mm KWK42 gun with a penetration of 185mm at 100 meter with the APCBC shell and a penetration of 265 mm with APCR at 100 meters which was more than the Tiger 1 or Panzer 4.  The Panther was remarkably well armed and armored, it could take almost anything the enemy can throw at it and could kill any enemy tank of the war. But it would struggle with the M4A3E8, IS 1,2 and 3 and M26. But all this information is actually beside the point. Most late war german tanks were hard to penetrate and had big guns. But the real reason I believe the Panther is underrated is because it because people generalize it in the same way as the Tiger 1 and 2 and I mean by that it is generalized as over expensive and a waste of resources. But as the following chart will indicate this isn’t true!  The Panther costs a mere 60,000 dollars in 1935 exchange rates to produce, you could make 5,3 panthers for every King Tiger and it costs only 16,000 dollars more than a Panzer 4 and all that the Panther offers for only a 16,000 price increase is what makes the Panther underrated in my opinion. “What was the most underrated tank during WW2.” This is all just a matter of opinion, some people really shit on the M4 Sherman and her variants due to low individual combat performance whilst many also praise it for it’s ease of manufacturing.

This is undeniably a tragic event that has shaken the entire world. As per your question, it is unlikely that the passengers aboard MH17 felt much pain, if any. This is because the 772 was cruising at approximately 560 mph at an altitude of 33,000 feet. The blast from the missile strike decompressed the airplane rather fast to the point where most of the passengers passed out (fainted) within 10-20 seconds of impact. It is possible that many passengers died instantly because of the fiery whiplash created by the decompression. This means that the air was forced out so fast that the necks of some passengers probably slammed into seats/walls and snapped instantly. Heart attacks in this scenario are also very probable. Understand that at 33,000 feet a human being will not have enough oxygen to breathe. This is why airplanes will normally drop the oxygen masks if any trouble is experienced (i.e. decompression) at an altitude above 18,000 feet. Below 18,000 feet there is enough oxygen to stay awake; above this limit people will go unconscious without a steady oxygen stream.  Because MH17 was cruising at around 560 mph, it was covering roughly 821 feet per second... when we factor in the distance of a fall from 33,000 feet to 18,000 feet at that speed, it would take a little over 18 seconds to reach safe oxygen supply. This suggests that most passengers were likely knocked out unconscious due to a lack of oxygen. This example uses decompression under the assumption that the captain dropped the plane to 18,000 feet. Once we factor in the missile strike, it changes the outcome drastically. Although we are not sure where exactly the missile hit the plane, we can assume that it remained intact for the first half of its trajectory to the ground. When a missile strikes a plane that big it more than likely will break in half, or something along that estimate, and the pieces will gradually disintegrate as it accelerates to the ground. TWA 800, which crashed on the same date of MH17 but 18 years ago, suffered a similar fate. The plane exploded about 12 minutes after take-off and split into half. The front half immediately started falling back to the water while the back half, which had the four engines of the 747-100, accelerated into the sky for a few seconds and then fell down to the ocean. The reason why we saw a lot of intact books, luggage, papers, photos, seats, and bodies from MH17 was because the missile explosion caused random damage, and not an explosion that blew up the whole plane apart. The reduction in speed also pushed the breaking parts of the airplane in different directions. This explains why the debris is spread out over a large area, and not a small one. It is also likely that some of the passengers nearest to the missile strike also died instantly from the explosion itself.  If you consider the numbers I used earlier and apply it to this scenario it is likely that the descent of the airplane from 33,000 feet to 18,000 feet took far, far longer because of the drag, impact force from the missile, and G-forces that twirled and tore the airplane around. These externalities more than likely cut the cruising speed of the plane in half to something around 250 mph. This means that it probably took far longer for the airplane to reach 18,000 feet, the level where the passengers could have breathed oxygen. But by the time it did reach this altitude most, if not all, of the passengers had already been knocked out by the lack of oxygen. If you've ever fainted before, especially in football, then you know what being knocked out feels like. When you wake up you don't remember much of what happened leading up to your fainting. In this same way, although the passengers might have been briefly confused by the random chaos, they all soon after passed out and never again woke up. This applies for people who might have fallen from airplane soon after the strike as well.  The sad images that have circulated around the internet showing the remains of many passengers show the end result of slamming into the ground after falling from 33,000 feet at an accelerating speed. As the plane fell to the ground it began to disintegrate and parts of it and the passengers started flying off. Understand that at this point there was likely no life left on the airplane.  Although this might be hard to believe, it is unlikely that the passengers felt anything. Any pain, panic, or fear must have lasted only a few seconds for some.  Their loss is immense to us because it symbolizes the growing division and struggle between humanity. Again, I am terribly sorry for your loss I have no family or friends linked to MH17, but I have been following it from the day it fell. I have felt very down because of this tragedy. I wish my deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victims. My thoughts and prayers are with them all.

Let's put away for a moment the notion that we know consciousness to be the result of complex neuron firing in the brain, because no evidence supports that hypothesis. Sure, it's a popular myth we hear all too often, but is there evdience for it? Certainly not. Is there a running 300 year science promissory note that we will soon prove this notion called the emergent brain hypothesis? Certainly. Should we wait another 300 years for this note to come due? I wonder. The premier science journal, Nature, was very clear when it announced not long ago the consciousness remains a mystery to science. We have famed luminaries of scientific materialism like Sam Harris admitting very clearly that consciousness remains a mystery: The Mystery of Consciousness | Sam Harris And then we have that well known bastion of scientific materialism, Scientific American, and its famed neuroscience expert, Kristoff Koch, moving from the emergent view of consciousness to the panpsychism view. Following suit, we have atheist philosophers Galen Strawsen, Thomas Kuhn, Karl Popper, etc., questioning the materialist view, as well. Why? Simply stated, nobody can explain, except by sheer magic, how consciousness can pop out of unconscious matter. 300 years of searching for a materialist explanation of consciousness, down the tubes. Famed atheist philosopher, David Chalmers explains why: we are unable to explain how and why we have qualia or phenomenal experiences—how sensations acquire characteristics, such as colors and tastes. This he calls the ""hard"" problem of consciousness. Oh yeah, we can tackle ""easy"" problems like ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli. But the ""hard"" problem is another matter. I agree. With all these failed material explanations for consciousness, like epiphenomenalism (emergent brain hypothesis), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Daniel Dennet's ridiculous ""illusion of consciousness"" hypothesis, the world of science leaves us with Orch OR, they only testable, falsifiable theory of consciousness with evidence, however incomplete, at this point. To who else then can we turn to for a definition of consciousness other than one of it authors? Here's Stuart Hameroff: ""The nature of consciousness remains deeply mysterious and profoundly important, with existential, medical and spiritual implication. We know what it is like to be conscious – to have awareness, a conscious ‘mind’, but who, or what, are ‘we’ who know such things? How is the subjective nature of phenomenal experience – our ‘inner life’ - to be explained in scientific terms? What consciousness actually is, and how it comes about remain unknown."" Finally, let's hear again from that well known atheist and neuroscientist, Sam Harris: The problem, however, is that no evidence for consciousness exists in the physical world. Physical events are simply mute as to whether it is “like something” to be what they are. The only thing in this universe that attests to the existence of consciousness is consciousness itself; the only clue to subjectivity, as such, is subjectivity. Absolutely nothing about a brain, when surveyed as a physical system, suggests that it is a locus of experience. Were we not already brimming with consciousness ourselves, we would find no evidence of it in the physical universe—nor would we have any notion of the many experiential states that it gives rise to. The painfulness of pain, for instance, puts in an appearance only in consciousness. And no description of C-fibers or pain-avoiding behavior will bring the subjective reality into view.

Even he knows this is a disaster but he is pathologically incapable of showing any weakness. There is no victory here only loss. Using a sporting analogy, the problem was/is that instead of preparing an explicit tactic of defense for a known and upcoming match which you (and other teams) are guaranteed to lose, the question is do you want to defend and lose by 3 goals or play your normal tactics and lose by 10+ goals? The US is veering towards the latter and, again with sport, the players, who play for the manager, who play their best defense will limp off the pitch beaten but unbroken. When the final whistle blows the buck for the scale of the defeat, as it does in any sport, will lay at the feet of the manager who was charged with forming the teams tactics. The USA needed to “park the bus"" to limit the damage. The best thing is that the players can't be blamed for flawed tactics and instructions. It's always the manager who must fall on their sword and are sacked when the fans show the extent of their dissent and their disdain for the manner of the loss. This happened on Trumps watch. Blaming the former Management for losing the game is utter deflection and an abdication of current responsibility. Trump knows he will be blamed fairly and squarely in that regard, he will scramble to blame all and sundry and so his shallow seriousness is explicitly done to limit the reputational fall out he will inevitably face from grieving Americans of all persuasions in the weeks and months ahead. “Sure, we lost by 10 goals but if I wasn't the manager then we could have lost by 20!”.

In India, there is a big gap between tons of “accelerators” that are designed for college students - with very little investment involved or specific expertise provided - and VCs who in the recent years have cut checks comparable to that of investors in US outside Silicon Valley. The lower end accelerators provide little beyond an office space. If you are a serious startup you likely have an office space already. In essence, they are at best spark plugs not accelerators. How would that entrepreneur sustain from just that? It is no wonder that there aren’t many success stories from small accelerators - you can’t just throw a drop of water on a seed and expect harvesting a ton from that. From that point of acceleration until you reach about $4m valuation [something that would excite a major VC] there is very little support inbetween. This is the sweetspot Kstart can fill in - there is adequate funding involved and there is a team of outside experts brought in.

There is a heady feeling in the markets at this All Time High. What After This ? : The Positives: It is generally stated that Sensex reflects the health of Indian Economy. With the Index at all time high, the perception is that everything is fine with the economy and business growth in India. I agree that some things are right. A stable Government with clear policies is a big plus for growth. Based on this perception, Sensex 31000 is good for Business for the following reasons: (a) Companies can mobilize money through IPOs, Offer for Sale, Private Placements as the mood is right for investments. (b) Government can divest its stake in the public sector entities at the current high valuations. (c) For General Public, the euphoria in markets leads to awareness about markets and participation through IPOs and Mutual Funds. This participation leads to creation of equity culture which is lacking in our country. The above three are the positives of the Index at all time high. The Negatives: In the general exuberance and liquidity of funds, stock prices have gone to very high P/E levels. If the earnings do not match the expectations, prices will correct. Any correction in heavy weight stocks like Reliance, ITC, HDFC will lead to a decline whch shall have a domino effect and mid caps and small caps stocks will decline faster. Our Banking System is an absolute mess. The NPAs ( Non Performing Assets ), a polite name for Bad Loans are at all time high. Even with this kind of balance sheets banking stocks are at very high valuation. At some point of time, rationality will prevail and bank stocks will come tumbling down. The Sensex and Nifty comprise of too many banking stocks and their decline will take the indices significantly downwards. As per my observations, the current upward move is based on some limited stocks and many worthless stocks have gone up in value multiple times for no reason other than manipulation of prices. Those will be the first to crumble. It has happened earlier, it may happen again. All the experts will keep on saying — This time it is different. But they said the same things in year 2001, 2008 and 2015. And the investors have gone through lot of pain in the periods of crashes from the historic highs. Year 2001:  From a high of 4462 in February 2001, Sensex fell to a low of 2594 in September 2001. This is a decline of almost 42%. Not a happy situation to be in. Year 2008 : One of the worst years of stock markets in recent memory. The markets world over crashed from the All Time Highs and took very long to recover.  From a high of 21206 in January 2008, Sensex fell to 7697 in September 2008. This declined wiped out 64% of the investors portfolio. Many stocks like Reliance Communication, Suzlon Energy, Unitech have declined more than 90% from the highs of 2008 and are still languishing. Year 2015 :  As mentioned earlier Sensex 30000 was achieved in March 2015 for the first time ever. But by February 2016, Sensex had declined to 22494. This decline was mild at 25% compared to those in year 2001 and 2008. It implies than it 8 years since 2008, Sensex had just moved only 6%. If Sensex is a barometer of the nation’s economy, we did very poorly. From February 2016 to May 26, 2017 : Maybe the markets knew something which we do not know even now, they went into a recovery mode. In 15 months since February 2016, the gain has been almost 38%. This is nothing short of spectacular and now the market experts are talking of new highs. These people were very pessimistic in February 2016 and were predicting new lows. But that is the nature of the beast that the market is. It is better to be cautious: There is a reason to list out the above instances. People actually suffered in these phases of declines or corrections. In the long run, markets always go higher. In the long run, all of us die. It is the short term pain or loss which is difficult to live through. And if we are bankrupt in the short term, there is no long run for our benefit. So caution is the keyword. Yes, markets may keep on going up for a few weeks or months more. But do not be surprised by a sudden decline. Be cautious. I will close with the words of Warren Buffet:  It is time to follow the above advice. There is neither good nor bad in Sensex touching an All Time High. With time, index always goes up. How it impacts your portfolio is more important. That is why it is time to be cautious. Thanks for reading. Image Source: BSE Ltd.

Daniel Drezner - professor of international politics at Tufts University, a very experienced writer on the global economy and global politics. He is also really funny and wrote a book on how the various theories on international politics would respond to a zombie outbreak . Ann-Marie Slaughter - not only is she an accomplished and experienced diplomat, serving under Hilary Clinton, but she has also penned a recent book on the role of women in the workplace and would be a great voice into what she sees as the solutions to gender inequality.

Wishing all the readers a happy and prosperous new year. Before trying to guess which way the market winds will blow, let us review what happened in 2017. Here is a snapshot from NSE website:  These details are as of December 29, 2017 , the last trading day of the year. Two points are to be noted: In the Returns , look at the YTD ( year to date ); it is a real spectacular gain of 28.65% for the year. Compared to this, the return over a 5 year period at 12.27% looks very modest. This indicates that the year 2017 was really exceptional. These kind of returns are not to be found every year. Another point is the Price to Earning Ratio. This is 26.92 at the current NIFTY values. This kind of valuations are very difficult to sustain over a long period. Earnings in previous quarters have not been very good but the markets kept on moving higher pushed by liquidity of funds. Reality is bound to strike some day.  In the year 2017, people have voted for the bulls. This year we may see the same people weighing their choices and be a little bit cautious. Based on the two factors indicated above, I am of the view that Indian Stock markets will have a bearish year in 2018. I know this view is not shared by many including the experts on various TV channels. But they did not have any bearish views in 2008 and 2015 either. I may be wrong. But it does not matter. It is the trading calls taken by us based on our analysis which matter. A good trader should be able to make money irrespective of the market trend. Well, the whole year is ahead of us.

I was hungry a lot of the time and I often dreaded the workout, but the positive reinforcement I received from the scale every day was all the motivation I needed to keep going. And I felt fantastic throughout the diet: I slept better, was more alert, and had a lot more energy. Mood-wise, I was more cheerful and confident than I had been in a long time. This is what worked for me, but due to the strict regimen it may not be for everyone. The most important thing is to find a healthful diet that you can stick to. Good luck!

The President doesn’t trust doctors and most of the population are rebellious morons who will willingly endanger themselves and their families in some broad demands for “freedom” and even constitutional rights even though most haven’t actually ever bothered to read. This virus has been a test on our systems and most have come up short. The Federal Government has been an utter failure here with regional governors taking on leadership roles that the Washington duopoly can’t even fathom how to address. We can’t have a lockdown because of all of the political hacks that want to exploit the situation for some other unrelated reason. I still know people that think it’s all a hoax or that will endlessly argue that the testing results are all skewed radically. I know Right Wingers that think this was created by Soros to destroy the use of cash and to kill off Republican voters. I know Left Wingers who think the virus was designed to kill off the poor to secure a fascistic utopia. We are all surrounded by dumb people who don’t even care if they catch it and transmit it because they aren’t high risk demographics. Really just an extension of all of the older groups of dumb people who lack the intellectual curiosity of a house fly. You know I’m right. We elect dumb people. Ron DeSantis, in Florida, is not a smart man. He didn’t think out ahead as to how the negative ramifications of his policies could affect his state. I read last night that 97,000 school kids tested positive this week. How do you attract and keep teachers if they run a high risk of contracting a potentially lethal disease just by going to work. On average teachers make about 2/3 of what a cell phone sales associate makes. If this trend continues will people send their kids to school? I wouldn’t. Mine are mostly grown and in the lowest risk group but I’m not exactly a no risk potential sufferer. This government can’t respond to the crisis because there is an election going on and this is a real problem that requires principled, difficult and painful decisions to govern now. That isn’t Trump and it’s honestly not the major establishment duopoly. We despise principled and responsible governance. It’s just too often inconvenient. That’s why we got Trump in the first place. He promised us everything for free. My older, diehard, Trumpist customers are getting scarce. They are staying home. I know a ton of moms who will not be putting their kids back into school. A few are employees and I will have to accommodate these new schedules for the fall. I have peers who still haven’t opened their restaurants back up to the public. The truth here is that the people might not cooperate with mass closures but they also won’t cooperate with an “all open” approach either. Government is making itself irrelevant through incompetence. I used to be a Republican and I liked the idea of small limited government. I’m not exactly a moron though and I know that Republicans have been pretty good at expanding big government. What really can the Feds do though? They can’t do testing. They suck at resource allocation and distribution. They can’t agree on stimulus. They can’t even get the president to stop saying this will magically disappear. Our healthcare system is clearly busted. The President went golfing last weekend and rolled out 4 Executive Orders to his rich clients that mean nothing and are simultaneously patently unconstitutional. He is golfing instead of wrangling Congress. This is while three million people in Florida can’t work but also can’t get into the unemployment system. Those are Trump Voters. Months ago Congress dumped a couple of trillion dollars on the problem and ran away. They left it in the hands of everyone, anyone else. An Open Letter, signed by 150 healthcare professionals (not providers, professionals) is about as useful as the open letter from the former US Attorneys that called AG Barr’s actions “questionable”. Im watching my own State Governor’s race and am wondering, are both candidates hoping to lose? Neither is spending any money. Republicans in Congress look like they want to lose so the Democrats can clean up the mess and take all of the heat for that. Trump offered to defer payroll taxes to next term at which point he will make them go away. How the Hell is he going to do that? He has already blown his budgets by $10 Trillion Dollars. Now he is telling us he will quit collecting for Social Security and MedicCare? What could possibly go wrong? Congress balked, a little, but should have impeached him for just that one Executive Order. This is the most egregious executive overreach since FDR threatened to stack the courts in 1935. Every State that opened too early messed up. The States that closed down first were prescient. The governors slaved to their parties look like dimwits and the iconoclasts look like smart operators, except Greg Abbot. Let’s be honest though, until November we will just half ass this whole thing. The same way we have half assed everything for the last few years. After November we might still half ass everything but maybe with a new group of asses in charge. Im not holding my breath though for some return to that shining city on a hill. Those days are dead and gone and this country and it’s systems are fundamentally broken. We are led by nitwits and whores. Our people are lazy and contrarian and far too many seem to relish on the suffering of others. We reward corruption and think idealism and personal sacrifice are for simps. We are turning into a society of sociopaths. The virus isn’t the straw that broke the camel’s back. It’s just the backdrop in which all of our failures come out into the light simultaneously. We lost the War on Drugs and the War on Poverty. We are letting second and third generation billionaires set our foreign and domestic policy and many have really not accomplished much more than winning a generic lottery of birth circumstance. We gave our best jobs away so the stock dividends looked better. We have a hundred million people in some form of debt slavery. This virus just exposed an ugly truth about us. We are still trapped in a survival of the fittest mentality. Which is great if you believe that’s the natural state of a civilization but then government becomes the vehicle of tyranny that our Founding Fathers rebelled against. I think our real problem is that the People actually want the whole thing to crash and burn. The disgruntled voters of America sent an agent of chaos to Washington four years ago to disrupt the system and break the machinery. In that he’s doing a bang up job. Do we still want that? Open or Close is no longer a government option. They have squandered their real authority under the game show host. Now it’s an individual choice that won’t really effect the rest of us unless we allow it. If we open, millions will still not go out and participate. If we close millions will still flaunt the rules and party in big groups and hold rallies and protests about things they care about much more than national health policy. We did this to ourselves. ““People on both sides…”, did this. Working together at cross purposes. Whether you noticed or not, the American Empire died under this government in just four short years. Ask yourself if saving the Union is a worthwhile effort because Open or Close is a minor issue in the greater scheme of history. You will stay closed if that’s in your best interest. You will participate in open if that is your path forward. Government mandates are irrelevant now because we no longer have faith in their competence or fidelity.

6043e422ed76476feda372f9,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-play-Fire-or-Frost-mage?-,"Fire and Frost are pretty even at the moment. Fire is more bursty damage; frost is more sustained. In a long fight, frost pulls out ahead. In medium-duration fights, fire is a little ahead, and in short fights, frost pulls out again (because so much fire damage is the Ignite DoT effect, so in fights too short for Ignite to really soak in, you lose overall DPS). I’ve played both and find Fire more cumbersome and less fun to play, because you really need to manage your crit and Hot Streak procs. Your mileage may vary. Both specs are fine for raiding. For long boss fights, I think Frost is slightly ahead. If you’re soloing Torghast, go Frost. The slows are a huge help. A lot of folks say an expertly played Fire spec is always ahead of Frost, and sims support that, but… that assumed flawless play, completely perfect management of cooldowns and procs, and fights that are a good length. In the real world, I’m not convinced there’s a significant difference. Either spec is viable. You’ll perform best with whichever spec you enjoy playing more.

Sticky Fingers The physics of the body can be used to trick people's minds. Our bodies are capable of bizarre and bewildering behaviors. Exploring these can be a fun way to confuse your friends and family. How the Trick Is Done: This one can be done alone, or with another person. First, you need to clasp your hands together. Not together as though you are praying, but interlock your fingers and bend them, as though you would if you were holding someone's hand.You then put your two index fingers (forefingers) out straight, leaving a small gap between them (so they are not touching) while keeping your hands clasped together and the rest of your fingers interlocked.Usually, what you'll find after just a few seconds is that your index fingers will slowly start closing in on each other until, eventually, they touch. This is an automatic response and can only be avoided by purposely making the effort (which is actually more difficult than you would expect).When asking another person to do this, you can pretend to tie an invisible piece of string around their index fingers, thereby giving them the illusion that you are doing it.Result: The principle behind how this trick works is ideomotor movement (or ideomotion). The trick works opposite to how you normally position and use your fingers. It confuses your senses and causes a double take. 2. The Pendulum One common myth is that the gender of an unborn child can be predicted by swinging a pendulum above a pregnant mother's womb. Obviously, this technique would be useless in modern times (even if it did work) because we can now do this with ultrasound. Nevertheless, this same principle can be used to confuse your friends. How the Trick Is Done: Make a pendulum by tying a coin or a key to a piece of string.Assign ""yes"" to clockwise and ""no"" to counterclockwise and then ask the pendulum questions. (Of course, all the movements are a result of ideomotion and are carried out subconsciously, but this very same principle could in fact be used to turn the pendulum into a lie detector!)Simply ask your friend or family member to hold the pendulum and ask them a question, but tell them to only answer it in their mind. If they hold that answer in their mind, the pendulum will usually begin to rotate either clockwise or anti-clockwise based on their answer.Result: The participant is actually moving the pendulum themselves, they just don't consciously realize it. Real lie detectors work in a similar way. This mind trick is based on ideomotion, meaning that the subject makes motions unconsciously.  Optical Illusion 3. Visions of Jesus This one's a pretty cool optical illusion that you can try alone, then try with all your friends. It's also one well worth experiencing. How the Trick Is Done: To see this optical illusion, you need the image up above. Notice that there is a line of dots near the middle of the image.What you need to do is tell someone to focus on and stare at those three dots for between thirty to sixty seconds non-stop.Once they're done staring at the dots, tell them to close their eyes and put their head back, making sure to keep their eyes firmly shut (but tell them not to strain, or keep them too tight).Result: Within a few seconds, Jesus will miraculously appear right in front of them! The longer they keep their eyes shut, the more pronounced and detailed the image should become... until it eventually begins to fade away. 4. Sinking Into the Floor How the Trick Is Done: Get your friend to lie face down on the floor with their arms stretched out in front of them. They should remain completely relaxed.You then lift their forearms up to about your waist level and hold them there for between 30 to 60 seconds.After that, you slowly begin to lower their arms towards the floor, which makes them feel like they are literally free-falling straight through the floor.Result: The mind and body are tricked into losing their normal sense of space. The sensation of sinking/falling will not last long, but it will certainly freak them out for a little while. The other participate will become confused as well, calling out just before they think they're going to hit the floor! 5. Mind-Reading (1) The ""carrot"" trick is quite a popular and effective one, but don't question why or how it works. It just does! How the Trick Is Done: Write down the word ""carrot"" on a piece of paper.Give it to your friend, but tell them not to look at it... yet.Let them hold on to it so they know there's no cheating going on.Next, ask them ""what's 1+1?"" and wait for them to answer.Ask ""what's 2+2?"" and wait for them to answer.Keep going until you get to 8+8.After they answer, ask them to name a vegetable.Result: 90% of the time they will think of a carrot. They don't realize it, but their answer is already there on the piece of paper you gave them! These mathematical tricks are tools used by mentalists to ""read"" people's minds. We have two brain functions. When the higher cognitive function is distracted, we revert to a very suggestive state of mind. Some think that this trick works because the counting reminds us of children's books, etc. and carrots are the most common vegetable we learn about as U.S. kids. That said, how exactly it works is frequently under debate.  The narratives we create in our heads are not the same as the formulation of the unconscious mind. Our sense of reality is split and can be easily manipulated. 6. Mind-Reading (2) Everyday we deal with numbers and letters. No matter how smart or educated we think we are, these two things can easily be used to confuse us. We spend so much time thinking linearly about numbers and letters that our desire for logic can easily be manipulated. How the Trick Is Done: This is quite a popular one. Get someone to think of a number between one and ten.Once they've selected, tell them to multiply that number by nine. If they are then thinking of a number with two digits, tell them to add those two digits together.Then tell them to subtract five.Next, tell them to assign a letter of the alphabet to that number where A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.Tell them to think of a country beginning with that letter.Then ask them to think of an animal using the second letter of the country they are thinking of.Then tell them to think of the color of that animal.Result: You then tell them that they're thinking of a grey elephant from Denmark. (Smarter people can come up with answers which are a little more imaginative. You've got to know your audience.) The math computations your participants are doing here are just intended to confuse their minds. Basically, after all these calculations, you'll get one answer, and that is four. And then the letter that corresponds to it is D. When you are told to think of any country that begins with that letter, the first one that comes into most of the people's minds is Denmark. From there, you are advised to skip that letter and move to the next one, which leads you to the letter ""E."" Now you are told to think of an animal that begins with that letter. The first animal that comes to your mind is an elephant. When you consider its color, you get grey. In conclusion, you have a color grey, the animal elephant, and the country Denmark. More Simple and Easy Mind Tricks Control People With Your Eyes Do you have any friends who always take the lead when walking? Do they move too fast, or get too bossy when going somewhere? This trick is always a fun one to play. How the Trick Is Done: If a person wants to go a certain way, and if they are looking at you, try looking in the opposite direction.Exaggerate your gait and the speed of your walking to seem like you're in a hurry. This will confuse them further.Result: Chances are that the person will start walking in the opposite direction, or stand there befuddled. Confuse People's Hearing Sound localization is a listener’s ability to identify the origin of a sound in direction and distance. The human auditory system has limited possibilities to determine the distance of a sound source. This one's incredibly easy to pull off! How the Trick Is Done: This trick can be performed with three people, one being the subject and the other two being objects/observers. You will also need a headset connected to routine plastic pipes on either side.Ask the subject to sit on a chair equidistant between you and the second observer.Each one of you must hold the pipes from the headset on the corresponding sides and one by one they must speak into the pipes. The subject will rightly tell the direction of the sound.Now, exchange the pipes and repeat voicing into the pipes. The subject’s brain will get confused and he’ll point in the opposite direction of the sound.Result: Because this trick messes with inter-aural time differences, exchanging the pipes causes perception by the opposite sided neurons in the brain. That's why the subject will not be able to localize the sound. Confuse Their Proprioreception or ""The Pinocchio Effect"" ""The Pinocchio effect"" is an illusion that one's nose is growing longer. It is an illusion of proprioception, meaning that the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body become confused. How the Trick Is Done: This requires two chairs and a blindfold. The person wearing the blindfold should sit in a chair in the rear, staring at the back of the person sitting in the front.The blindfolded person then reaches around and places his hand on the nose of the other person. At the same time, he should place his other hand on his own nose and begin gently stroking both noses.After about one minute, more than 50% of the subjects will report that their nose is incredibly long. That's why this trick is called the ""Pinocchio Effect.""Result: This trick is meant to confuse proprioreception. The trick always demonstrates how connected people are, how we can so easily take another's feelings on as our own. It also works on our insecurities. Our self-consciousness about our bodies can easily be manipulated. Feel a Phantom Sensation Using the illusion of a strategically-placed rubber hand to trick the brain, scientists have made the first recordings of the human brain's awareness of its own body. How the Trick Is Done: Each volunteer must hide their right hand beneath a table while a rubber hand is placed in front of them at an angle suggesting that the fake hand is part of their body.Stroke both the rubber hand and the hidden hand simultaneously with a paintbrush.On average, it takes volunteers about 11 seconds to start experiencing that the rubber hand is their own.After the experiment, ask volunteers to point towards their right hand. Most will reach in the wrong direction, pointing towards the rubber hand instead.Result: For a little while, the volunteer will become confused as to which hand is their own. The effect diminishes rapidly, but the trick will almost always work. This confusion happens in the premotor cortex, providing further evidence of the brain's ability for re-adjustment. 1.

The italicized sections are copied from the book. A SOG team, lead by a Green Beret named Cooper (not actual name) was attempting a prisoner snatch in Cambodia. They were set up along a trail when a lone NVA on a bicycle came along. (They used bicycles a lot) The Nung mercs with the green berets, as they rushed out to overwhelm the surprised man, shot and killed him in the excitement. Cooper decided to at least take the bicycle back, just for the hell of it. He encrypted the situation report into three-letter groups, but without encrypting “bicycle”, and transmitted it to FAC (forward air controller) who sent it on to Ban Me Thuot, where a radio operator decoded it. The report described the contact and one enemy KIA but the last two groups puzzled the radioman because it seemed to say “have captured” followed by the unencrypted word “bicycle”. The radioman couldn’t find “bicycle” on his daily code word list so he tried a previous code list and found “bicycle” meant general! They had captured a North Vietnamese general? He called the FAC on secure voice scrambler and asked him to confirm the SOG team “has captured a bicycle”. FAC called Cooper and said, “Confirm, you have a North Vietnamese bicycle, repeat, Home Plate needs confirmation, you have a North Vietnamese bicycle?” Reclining against an old termite mound, his feet propped up against the two-wheeler, Cooper lit a cigarette and looked for a manufacturer’s seal on the frame, but heavy paint obscured the inscription. “I think it’s North Vietnamese,” he radioed, “but it might be Chinese. Can’t tell for sure.” As the radio operator got confirmation the CCS commander rushed in, the rumor already rocketed to his office. ”Is it true? Cooper actually has a general?” Just to be absolutely sure, the radio operator contacted the FAC again. “Home plate wants to confirm, I repeat, CONFIRM, team has a bicycle and its intact, over.” The insane questions were starting to irritate Cooper. The seat was worn a bit and maybe it was missing a spoke or two, but it was certainly usable. “Listen,” he snapped, “the bicycle’s fine now, but if you don’t come get us pretty quick I’ll put a couple bullets through it and dump it here.: The FAC switched to secure voice, barely containing himself. “Team leader confirms, he has an unwounded general officer and he wants out ASAP or he’ll shoot him himself.” That was enough for the CCS commander, who got on a direct line to Saigon and reported to Chief SOG, who then flash-messaged MACV headquarters. If there had been time a major operation would have been assembled, but if the NVA had lost a general there was little time to withdraw the team. So the CSS commander personally led a group of transport choppers escorted by gunships and went after the team. Circling over the team’s location, while the gunships flew in at low level to draw fire, the CCS radioed, “the first aircraft is for the bicycle, only the bicycle.” As the Huey hovered a foot off the ground, and crewmen motioned for the SF team to come out, the Lt. Colonel watched for the general. He overlooked Cooper as he wheeled the bicycle to the chopper. When Cooper got to the Huey the CCS asked, “Where’s the bicycle?” Cooper sat it on the skid and beamed, “right here.” “No, dammit!” the lieutenant colonel repeated, “I mean… the bicycle!” But as he grasped the handlebars his eyes widened and the horror sank in. As the Huey lifted away the officer must have wanted to throw that bicycle at Cooper. Afterwards Cooper would ride it around the SF compound and there was enough embarrassment higher up to not mention it.

On average the NHS pays 50% of the pricetag that other healthcare providers pay for the same medicines and equipment. This has the collateral “damage” of giving other providers a bit of a bargaining chip to bring down costs. With the NHS privatised, it removes the single biggest hold on rip-off US medicines and medical supplies. It’s a massive payout to them.

The telecommunication sector in India has always been a wealth destroyer for many years before ‘Reliance Jio’ entered and changed the rules of the game. Reliance Communication, Vodafone-Idea, Tata Communications, etc to name a few, never created wealth over long term for the investors. One of the major reasons for this long consolidation in the telecom sector is the ‘AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue)’ case which was an overhang from 2007–2020. Let me brief you about the AGR case. (You can read the detailed version here). For a telecom company to operate in India, it would need two things from the Government, The telecom licenseThe spectrumThe telecom license is akin to taking permission from the Government for operating in the telecom sector. The spectrum, in simple language is the fees telecos pay for the range of electromagnetic waves. To simplify further, the internet speed we get as a customer depends on the spectrum (2G, 3G, 4G in common parlance). In 1999, the new deal was that the telecos were required to pay the following percentage of AGR: 3–5% for spectrum usage charges8% for license fees Let me tell you more about how Telecom companies earn ‘revenue’. Revenue from telecom business: This is nothing but their core activity. This is the money they charge their users for telecom services they provide.Revenue from other activities: This would include income of interest on bank deposits, money received on sale of towers and so on. The real issue between the DoT and the Telecom companies The real issue between these two was how do you define ‘revenue’ for the purpose of AGR. Lets see what both these sides had to say, Telecom Companies: Look, you have provided us the license and the spectrum to run our telecom business. We will pay you the decided fixed percentage of our revenues from our core telecom business.DoT: No, that is not how it is done. We have given you the license and the spectrum. Revenue would include the money earned from ‘Core telecom business’ as well as from ‘Other activities’. The interest on your fixed deposit is because of the money you earn from the license and spectrum, which is indeed provided by us. Pay us a fixed percentage of every penny you earn.In the year 2007, the matter was discussed in the court and after ages in 2019, on 24th of October, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the DoT. The amount over the years aggregated to a huge number. Here’s what companies owed to the DoT along with all the interest and damages, Bharti Airtel at Rs 21682 croreVodafone-Idea at Rs 28308 croreReliance Communications at Rs 16456 crore (the company is almost on the verge of bankruptcy!)Tata group at Rs 9987 croreAircel at Rs 7852 croreBSNL at Rs 2098 croreTelenor at Rs 1950 croreReliance Jio at Rs 13 crore (luckily, it started its operations in late 2016!)From the list above, the active players are only, Bharti AirtelVodafone-IdeaBSNLRelaince Jio  Telecom companies require huge capital for creating a solid ecosystem and infrastructure like towers. The rising debt has always been a matter of concern for these companies. As a matter of fact, the largest loss making companies in India includes the names like: Vodafone Idea, Reliance Communications, Airtel, BSNL.   On 1st September 2020, Supreme court announced a landmark judgement.[1] It allowed the telecos a period of 10 years to pay the AGR dues. Thus telecom companies can now buy time to clear the dues and begin a new story.   Data is the new oil. This holds true in the current scenario. We can not imagine our lives without internet! Also, the demand for OTT (Over-the-top) platforms is an evidence that the future for telecom companies is bright.  Look at these numbers! And they are increasing at a very fast pace. Not just this, the use of smart phones have been on a rise since many years! This shows how without data it is almost impossible to keep up with the world.   ‘ARPU’ stands for ‘Average Revenue Per User’. In simple words, ‘ARPU’ shows the amount telecom companies get per user on an average.  (Source) You can see clearly the falling graph. This shows how after the entry of Reliance Jio the telecom game has changed. In 2016, as Reliance Jio entered the market, it made quality service available almost free of cost. This led to the ARPU war and other telecom companies like Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, etc were forced to reduce the prices. This led to a sharp fall in ARPUs. Meanwhile, from 2016–2020, ‘Reliance Jio’ managed not just to increase its market share but it eventually became the market leader with more than 30% market share[2] . Also, it managed to breakeven and now it is unlocking the value for its parent company, ‘Reliance Industries Limited’.Idea and Vodafone realized that to stay in the game, they need to shake hands. This marked the the merger of Idea Vodafone on 31st August 2018.[3] In 2020, Reliance Jio was on a fund raising spree. Every big name wanted to taste the success of the Reliance Jio cake.  (Source) With so many marquee investors investing in Reliance Jio, it is obvious that the ARPUs are going to rise in the future. Needless to say this will be good for the entire telecom sector, including giants like Bharti Airtel.   There are three active players now in the telecom sector: Reliance JioBharti AirtelVodafone IdeaThere is no doubt that Reliance Jio is in the sweet spot and also Bharti Airtel is a fundamentally good story. However, with the rising debt and the huge AGR dues the survival of Vodafone Idea is being questioned. This is again evident from the fact that Vodafone Idea is losing its subscribers to the other two giants.[4] Plus, Vodafone Idea needs to spend huge amount of money to be 5G ready and compete Jio and Airtel. With the mounting debts and losses, it is very difficult for Vodafone Idea to raise money easily. Hence, a sign of slow duopoly can be a good thing for share price of ‘Airtel’ which is still trading at discount to ‘Reliance’.   One of the many reasons why share price of ‘Airtel’ is not moving is the fact that there is media underreporting here. I remember how media started reporting when Reliance Jio announced its 5G game and how it will be making available cheaply priced phones.[5] The fact that the parent company ‘Reliance Industries Limited’ owns media houses really helps in flashing the right news in right time for ‘Jio’ and that is not really the case with ‘Airtel’. However, even Airtel is developing local 5G gear ecosystem via own R & D with the help of US and Japanese partners.[6] This has been under reported. Bharti Airtel is 5G ready! It is just the matter of time when it unleashes 5G technology and prove its worth.   And now, let me discuss something that can be considered as the future of Bharti Airtel. You and I, we all use services of telecom companies, don’t we? But, for seamless internet access, telecom companies need to spend crores of rupees on towers and infrastructure. A tower covers a wide range and if you are in that range, you can experience quality service. But, did you ever think of a space satellite instead of land towers that can give you seamless internet and other services? In 2012, One Web (UK based) was founded and they started making satellites with the intention to provide internet services to “everyone, everywhere” as their goal suggests[7].The idea was to launch ‘One Web Satellite Constellation’. Let us understand what a constellation is. Constellation is not a single satellite but it is a group of satellites orbiting in a manner that the entire globe is covered.  (Source) One web planned to put 650 satellites in orbit in its first phase and then 1972 satellites in the second phase. By March 2020, it managed to put 74 satellites in the initial constellation. Normally, geostationary satellites operate in the outer orbit of earth which is too far (in the range of 36,000 kms). However, the satellites by One Web are in the low earth orbit (1,200 kms). The logic is simple, low earth orbit means faster connectivity and that will solve the latency issue. Imagine calling your friend and whatever you say reaches your friend one or two seconds late. That would be frustrating, right? Well that is called as latency issue. For seamless communication, low orbit satellites are perfect fit. And we need to admit this, satellites are cool! Imagine how painful it can be to set a tower in Alaska or in a desert area or in a remote island. Well, with satellites, it will be so much convenient.  (Source)  Unfortunately, for One Web, things did not turn out as planned. In March 2020, it filed for bankruptcy due to lack of funds. This was a lifetime opportunity for Bharti Global. Bharti won the bid and acquired a whooping 45% stake in One Web for just US$ 500 million which translates to Rs.3700 crore INR. UK government managed to buy 45% stake for the same amount (after brexit they won’t be having the access to Galileo project. Hence, the deal) If planned and executed well, Bharti Airtel can tap the untapped market through satellites. May be there can be separate plans and subscriptions with this new digital revolution of Space Internet. Also, not just this, it can compete well with Elon Musk’s ‘SpaceX’ and Jeff Bezos’s Amazon linked ‘Project Kuiper’ who are already in the race!

Thanos already has five and he has laid waste to the entirety of the extended Avengers roster. As he makes his way to an injured Vision to finally complete the gauntlet, he is met by the Scarlet Witch. After an emotional exchange between the two unlikely lovers, Wanda finally makes the hard choice. Vision: Wanda. It's time. Wanda Maximoff: No. Vision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone. Wanda Maximoff: Don't. Vision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time. Wanda Maximoff: I can't. Vision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies. Wanda Maximoff: It's not fair. Vision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. Blocking the Mad Titan with one hand, she destroys the Mind stone with the other.  Thanos armed with just the Power stone earlier gave the Hulk a beating of a lifetime. Channeling the energy of all six irreparably injured him, the merged Hulk, and killed Tony. But Wanda fought against all six only by herself. She was able to stop the most powerful person in the universe (and by a long shot) while simultaneously destroying the Mind stone. Can’t get more powerful than that. Doctor Strange During the fight on Titan, Doctor Strange was able to hold his own against the Mad Titan, powered by four infinity stones. However, that is not what I am talking about. The Sorcerer Supreme has another feat that is often overlooked. ""I went forward in time, to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict."" ""How many did you see?"" ""14,000,605."" In Endgame, it took five years for the Avengers to truly defeat Thanos and undo the Snap. Assuming Strange saw, on average, five years into every possible timeline, he literally viewed 70 million years of possible futures in what looked like a few seconds. That is more than ten times as long as humans have been on this planet, thirty-five thousand times longer than the time between Jesus’ coming and today, and longer than the time elapsed between the last dinosaur and today. But of course, Strange is no newbie when it comes to such impressive feats.

( Price to Earnings Ratio ) Any such analysis will involve some reasoning or rational thought process. We may come to a conclusion which may turn out right or wrong. Because markets are not known to be rational. The March 2015 High: The previous all time high was 9119.20 on March, 04, 2015. Sensex also crossed 30000 on the same day. The anchors on CNBC 18 TV wore Sensex 30000 T-Shirts when the moment happened. By the time the trading ended for the day , they had egg on their faces. The high was too easily given up and the NIFTY ended at 8922.65, almost 200 points adrift from the high. On expiry day i.e. March 26, 2015 , NIFTY closed at 8342.15. This time , we have been spared the roller coaster ride. The fall from the high in 2015 is as indicated in the following screen shot.  Will the Markets Crash in 2017 ? : It is always a possibility. If experts were to be believed, markets should have crashed when Brexit happened. If experts were right, markets should have tanked again when Trump won the US Presidential elections. Markets do not care for you or me or the experts either. Their views were dumped and markets soared higher. Now the experts have started singing a different song. NIFTY 10000 is being brandished as the next target. Well, nobody knows what lies in the future. All is crystal grazing. Brexit was bad for economy and so was Trump. Both are the reality now and markets are at all time high. I will venture out and say that a crash is a definite possibility. Why ? : It is clear that we have finally arrived where we were two years ago. From 9119 to 9119 from March 2015 to April 2017. Let the TV Channels cry hoarse about the great bull market run, they were equally jubilant in 2015 also ( Remember the T-Shirts ) , but Sensex 30000 has not happened for the second time yet. Markets may go up for whatever reasons, but there are equal chances for a decline. The rally from February 2016 onward has not been uniform. Some sectors have cornered all the money and thus index went up. The following top 10 weighted stocks had these gains in the last 365 days. Stock——————- Weightage %———— 365 day Gain/Loss % HDFC BANK——————- 8,51 ——————— 36,31 HDFC—————————- 6,96———————— 31.86 ITC—————————— - 6.95 ———————— 23.02 RELIANCE——————— 6.38————————- 35.45 INFOSYS————————- 5.96————————- (-) 25.82 ICICI——————————- 4.71————————- 13.02 TCS——————————— 3.78————————- (-) 5.65 LT———————————— 3.77————————— 33.24 KOTAK—————————— 3.05————————— 28.65 SBI———————————— 2.73————————— 50.77 If we take out the two IT stocks which did not do well , the other 8 have a combined weightage of 43.06% and they have grown at percentages varying from 13.02 ( lowest ) to 50.77 ( highest ). With these kind of gains in the top 8, NIFTY has gained only 15.22% in 365 days. The gain should have been more than 25%. That means the stocks with the lesser weightage have not contributed and IT big stocks have dragged down the index. And NIFTY has gained nothing — 0% since the intraday high of March 04, 2015. Where the Fall Can Commence? : The banking sector is the prime candidate to lead the fall. Banks are sitting on lots of NPAs, not finding good borrowers and having huge deposits with them thanks to demonetization. Sooner or later, a bad business is bound to lose value. And our banks are certainly bad. Reliance Industries has contributed heavily in the gains. It may lead the decline also, when the euphoria about Jio vanishes and the financials of this business reviewed. Along with Reliance, other telecom companies will also go down. Next is Aviation. Always a bad business world over, it will resume its downward move once markets decide to go southwards. Real estate is another sector likely to fall. When ? : No one can predict the future. Maybe soon. But the fall will start with some international event and then as usually happens, few skeletons may emerge out of some hidden closets giving the market a bad name. That is how bull and bear cycles run and why it should be different this time ? If it does not happen, very fine. If the correction or crash happen, be ready for the ride. It is not going to be pleasant. These were my views. You may have exactly opposite views and you are welcome. Because of these opposite views only, there are buyers and sellers at the same price. That is what stock exchange implies. Thanks for reading. Image: nseindia.com",2021-03-06T20:24:58.731Z,"Will the Indian stock market crash in 2017 because of high PE? ",Quora

By the way —according to international space record-keeping experts— that’s the only requirement to receive the astronaut moniker.

SpaceX turns a pretty decent profit - and its valuation continues to increase and its assets (in terms of things like manufacturing facilities, launch pads, reusable rockets in stock and intellectual property) are growing rapidly. SpaceX’s manufacturing facilities can turn out a new rocket engine every DAY and and two entire new Falcon-9’s every month. If each Falcon-9 gets ten re-uses (as they claim) - then they have the capability to do 20 launches a month. At $62 million per launch…that’s a potential income of about $30 billion per year…on Falcon-9 launches alone. Obviously, that’s not all profit. But from the information available to the general public - it’s clear that SpaceX doesn’t “cost” anything to keep it running…it’s easily self-sustainable. What it does need (and has easily gotten over the past few years) is financing for continued growth. Generally financing is easy if the company is profitable and has a high market value. But when they roll out things like: StarLink - which several experts have described as “A License To Print Money”!Space tourism (eg Yusaku Maezawa - who paid SpaceX up-front for a trip around the Moon for himself and half a dozen guests. Best estimates are that it cost him about $250 million).The StarShip-based, sub-orbital passenger service (that gets you between any two cities on Earth in about an hour for the cost of a 1st class airplane ticket) - people are lining up to pay Virgin Galactic $250,000 for a similar experience.The StarShip/BFR super-heavy lift capability (which can get more mass into space in one shot than anything else in existence and has 50x re-use capability).…then it’s clear that if they can stay on track - they’ll be making boatloads of money…plenty enough to pay for Elon Musk’s “hobby” activity of getting to Mars.",2021-03-06T20:27:08.070Z,"What is the annual cost to keep SpaceX running?

If and when the pre-defined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The smart contract code facilitates, verifies, and enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement or transaction. It is the simplest form of decentralized automation. This is the reason most of the companies are prefering smart contract development for more secure and fast transactions. We all know how blockhain smart contracts have pretty much taken over the lives of all modern tech-based businesses. Be it for handling escrow management or disbursing insurance payments on time, smart contracts are the order of the day. Before proceeding further, let's understand a basic concept which forms the basis of this calculation. This basic premise is the “gas” in Ethereum. Gas” in Ethereum terminology refers to the basic fuel that powers the network, be it for deploying smart contracts or for hosting dApps (decentralized applications) on the network. For fast and smooth transactions, you would need to pay a higher gas price. How To Calculate The Cost of An Ethereum Smart Contract? To calculate, you must know the media gas price (at the time of writing, it is 20 Gwei), the gas limit (usually 21000 gas for a smart contract) and the market price of Ethereum ($357.71 at the time of writing) to be able to calculate how much you will have to shell out for deployment. So, while calculating, you must take that into account as well. Moreover, that calculation was done with the gas price being 20 Gwei. Now, remember, you must determine your own gas price depending on your needs and calculate accurately. I hope you understand how to calculate the cost of smart contract deployment. If you are still confused then I would suggest you connect with the skilled team of blockchain experts from a reliable smart contract development company, they will assuredly guide you the best.

Yes, this is what I said, a Chinese, who is regarded by many as an evil Communist Party. I say this not only to Americans but also to China. Don't always think naively that China can challenge and confront the US. That is to beat stone with eggs. I. How powerful is the US? From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.  A. The US political power The US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.  For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States. His words can greatly affect people all over the world. For example, he said that COVID-19 pneumonia can disappear on its own, that children can avoid COVID-19 pneumonia, and that the United States controls it well. Even many important figures in the Republican Party did not support Trump's re-election. Because the disaster he brought to the world may be worse than COVID-19 pneumonia. But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible! If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it. B. The strength of the US economy The strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy! The dollar, which is smaller than the mobile phone, is the most powerful weapon of the United States, not the US aircraft carrier or the US Marine Corps.  C. The US science and technology The US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.  But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.    D. The US military The US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me. The U.S. government has made deep research and practice on maintaining the combat effectiveness of the military, leading military science and technology, military theory, and military treatment. The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military. Regardless of her glorious history, technically speaking, which country can produce it now? This is an aircraft carrier produced by the United States in 1960. The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps. The US Marine Corps is not just a bunch of crayon-eating psychopaths. They have the most systematic, scientific, and arduous training, the most efficient and advanced military theory, and the most advanced weapons and equipment. I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.  5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.  The Kitty Hawk of the US Navy  E. The US culture American culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.  Titanic  Rambo II. What are the advantages of China? China's greatest advantage is the people. This may be something that Americans can't surpass for years. From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect. Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people: A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?  The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.  Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.   After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.  In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.  The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland. The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland. These examples are to say that a political party that is extremely poor can lead the people to today. It doesn't matter whether she is evil or not. We trust this party, even she is evil. Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people? Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else? B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people? Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character. Attach great importance to educationChina's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years. The examination is an important way for Chinese emperors to select officials from civilians. Today's Chinese college entrance examination is an exam that determines the fate of students. No matter you are rich or poor, you must pass the college entrance examination before you can enter the university. In China, every family and every Chinese regard education as a way to change their own destiny. Therefore, every Chinese family will spend a lot of money on their children's education.  Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidates  Parents waiting anxiously outside the examination room  Examination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found. 2. Chinese people especially like farming China's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.     The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space. 3. Chinese people love saving money and grain When Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the streets. It is because Chinese people have the habit of saving money. A country that has been poor for hundreds of years will not spend all its money once it has earned it. 4. An incomparable yearning for peace A unified and centralized country, a country with peasants as its main people, needs a peaceful environment most. Because it is impossible to fight there, I still farm here. Chinese people have always hoped to have a peaceful environment for them to cultivate their land, save some money, and then let their children receive a good education. 5. Chinese people's deep love for their families and countries China attaches great importance to education. Therefore, Chinese culture can be preserved from generation to generation after thousands of years. In education, loyalty and justice are emphasized. This is why Chinese people have a very strong concept of territory and nationality. Every generation of Chinese will tell their children that you are a Chinese, that you are a Chinese who eat with chopsticks, and that you are a Chinese who write Chinese characters.  A very famous story in China, Yue Fei, a famous general in Chinese history, had his mother tattooed his back before joining the army. There are four Chinese characters on it, which means repay the country with loyalty.  Every Chinese has been fed with chopsticks in this way, which is called enlightenment.  Every Chinese child will be taught to use chopsticks by his parents. This is the brand of Chinese culture.  When eating in China, only the elders say they can eat, and the rest can eat. This is called a rule. 6. Once oppressed too much, peaceful farmers will become fearless fighters In Chinese history, all those who rebelled were peasants. As long as farmers have food to eat, they will not rebel. Once they are starving, Chinese farmers will rise to revolt. Therefore, Chinese people are not afraid of power in their genes. Indeed, many emperors in Chinese history were rebellious peasants. The earliest peasant uprising in Chinese history was the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in 209 BC. At that time, the west was still the Roman Republic. SENATVS POPVLVSQVE ROMANVS  What I want to say is that these characteristics of Chinese people come from China's poverty and backwardness, and also from its own understanding. Chinese people may be bullied, but it is impossible to kill all Chinese people. As long as there is a Chinese, the Chinese cultural fire will spread, and the Chinese people's spirit of hard work and struggle will survive. The US is powerful, and the American people are a symbol of freedom and independence. China cannot compete with the United States in any form. But China also has its own advantages. This feature accompanied the Chinese in 2000, and we think this advantage is valuable. III. In the end The US is the most developed country in the world. The US is ahead of China in every respect. China has been actively learning from the United States. Americans are Chinese teachers. In the next decades or even hundreds of years, no country in the world will be able to challenge the United States. But China does have its advantage, that is, its people. The recorded history of China exceeds 2000 years, and Chinese culture has never been changed by any nation. It has been passed down from generation to generation for more than 2000 years. China was invaded many times, and many Chinese people were massacred. But even at the most dangerous moment of the nation, there will be a group of people who are not afraid of death and willing to sacrifice for their country. They voluntarily give their precious lives, and they only hope that China can have a peaceful land for her people to live with peace of mind. Perhaps this is the greatness of Chinese people.  The national anthem of China today was created at the most dangerous time in Chinese history. Her lyrics are like this: 起来！ 不愿做奴隶的人们！ 把我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城！ 中华民族到了最危险的时候， 每个人被迫着发出最后的吼声。 起来！ 起来！！ 起来！！！ 我们万众一心，冒着敌人的炮火， 前进！ 冒着敌人的炮火， 前进！ 前进！ 前进进！ Get up! People who do not want to be slaves! Build our flesh and blood into our new Great Wall! When the Chinese nation is at its most dangerous time, Everyone was forced to make the final roar. Get up! Get up! ! Get up! ! ! We are United as one, braved the enemy's fire, Forward! Braving enemy fire, Forward! Forward! Go ahead, and forward! Well, this is what I share with you as a communist devil.

Investing NOW may result in loss for a short term, may not be a perfect entry but it will surely give you a good return in long term. As you have mentioned about Reliance , lets talk about it only. I always get to read about Reliance that it is overpriced , it will correct from here and will reach at : 1200–1300 when price was at 1600 (ALL TIME HIGH) 1600 when price was at 1800 1700–1800 when price was at 1950 1900–2000 when it was at 2100 and so on. (i was reading another answer even that answer was quoting 1500–1700 as optimal price :p) You see, at any price if you had belief on its business model and invested in it “now” , instead of timing and catching the bottom of market, you would have been sitting with good profit, I can invest at any price till 3000 and will keep investing in it. I’m investing from Dec’19 from 1400 level and last i bought it at 2100. Every TA , expert is saying it is in overbought zone, it is overpriced but let me tell you any stock which is in overbought or overpriced will continue to remain in this zone (just like Newton’s First Law of Motion), don’t trust me ? just go and check it. Reliance is right now in transformation phase and from oil, it is trying to make an impact in digital technology i.e. it is development phase. and one more point : RELIANCE - ARAMCO deal is pending , and once it is finalized the evaluation of the company will increase even more and so its growing rate. So , if you looking for long term good gain, answer is NOW. Do Upvote if you liked the answer :)",2021-03-06T20:33:24.658Z,"Which is the right time to buy Reliance shares? ",Quora

From them all, the one I best remember is Chimamanda Adichie's :  I had the chance to be invited at TEDxBogotá this week and I would love to share with you some inspiration I got by attending this emotional event. What I first noticed from all those people is the way they get to communicate their enthusiasm and energy no matter the project they want to implement or the message they want to spread. By being so, those individuals find the contagion to get others to follow their dreams and to share their knowledge in a way that it touches our own feelings as a spectator. It results as a passion made reality thanks to this burning energy, this glowing happiness and an endless sharing. And all those elements, reflected by small acts of day to day kindness, those are the ones leading to the unity and fraternity that we aim for a better tomorrow.So what's the problem we can outline here?I think what's noticeable here is that we're giving too much attention to the fear of failure and the unknown. And what brilliantly underlined the talker Sandra Freiye while telling us how she convinced hundreds of young people in the city of Cali, Colombia to paint the houses of their neighborhood with plenty of colors, is that once you get rid of that fear, satisfaction becomes more easily achievable.   Terrón Colorado neighborhood in Cali, Colombia - 100 000 inhabitants  Another aspect approached during the conference - this time by Juan Carlos Pelegrino - was a smart calling into question of our modern education. The mother of Juan Carlos put this action in practice when he was a kid and his son is now succeeding as a brilliant artist (he is a member of the music band Systema Solar). The first point of this topic was how we lack practice over the tedious theory method. The second one was to highlight the way we prevent our children and students from being who they're meant to be instead of giving them the liberty to express their creativity. We're actually teaching our kids that education must be accomplished by ""levels"", that we all learn at the same age, yet some need more or less time to do the same task (example: reading). That is why we should try to refocus education on being, not having.The lesson we can pull out from this thought (also mentioned by John Medina in his book ""Brain Rules"") is that education must focus on the individual behavior and emotional experiences. One of the main barriers to that is the difficulty to keep classes small enough to favor this atmosphere. Finland, for instance, has often been listed among the best educational systems in the world. And you know why? Well, mostly because they give their teachers the liberty (and trust) to do whatever it takes for children to be blooming. And in the end, whether it is through our professional path or for personal fullness, what matters most as an individual is knowing who we are, and from this where we going. That is what we need to find out about ourselves because it shapes our lives, and it isn't an easy process.  Last, but not least, is the story of Juan Pablo Garcia, a young publicist in Bogotá, who helped disengaging hundreds of FARCs (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) members thanks to his communication talent, yet without the permission of his boss. He implemented different tactics for achieving his goal. But to be successful, he had to find out what was the best way to reach out with his target. That way, he discovered that people in the selva were communicating messages through the river; because it sounds like if the jungle is talking to them directly. Moreover, he heard that a lot of soldiers were always seeing their request to see their mother sometime rejected. In the end, our mother is maybe the only person that can affects us at any moment. That is why Juan Pablo chose to concentrate his efforts on the right communicator and at the right moment: the mothers during Christmas time. ""Before being a soldier, you're my son"" - For this Christmas, I'll be waiting for you at home. Today, Juan Pablo is executing the same ingenious ideas in Uganda, where the Lord's Resistance Army is operating with the aim to rule the country according to the 10 Commandments. It proves us that anybody, if he really wants to, can change the world with passion and communication. Another great campaign Juan Pablo implemented was during the soccer world cup this year using soccer balls through the rivers to get soldiers to come and enjoy the game together with family... ConclusionThose three stories are only one small part of all the deep speeches I heard this day, but they certainly prove that through determination and action, our ideas and passions are definitely worth spreading to inspire the people around us.",2021-03-06T20:34:01.887Z,"What are the TED Talks that would change my perspective about the world completely?

In the course of my efforts, there were times when I was successful and times when I was unsuccessful.  You know what? Being successful or unsuccessful didn't affect my happiness as much as I thought it would. If you work really hard for something and then you get it, you realize it can be just a stepping stone. Then if you later lose what you had worked for or you change directions, it begins to put the whole experience in perspective.  So figure out what matters to you. Figure out what makes you happy. I would actually even go so far as to say don't focus on being a huge success. I actually think that's the wrong motivator, because I'm not convinced that mindset leads to happiness, or rather sustainable happiness. Sustainable happiness comes from doing things that you believe are good, independent from society's definition of what's good. A career should satisfy you on a day to day level. I grant you everyone needs to do some things to make money, but ideally your sense of satisfaction will line up with your career path to some degree at some point in the future. However, before you begin to study towards and begin a career that you think will satisfy you, on a day to day level you need to know yourself. To know who you are, you need to meet people and have different life experiences and see what comes out of you in different situations. You need social and life experience in order to ground your values. In short, you need a a balanced life.  The most important thing to get right is knowing yourself, and you'll get that by spending time with others and having fun, helping them, and just getting a sense for what you value. The second most important thing is to know what satisfies you as a career, and then proceed in that general direction, keeping in mind that your satisfaction and happiness is more important than any milestone you may wish to reach as a temporary stepping stone.

They did not rule the world by just will, brains and violence. Their attitude towards language is what allowed them to do so.

There are a few broad parameters that can be looked into for distinguishing a good stock from the rest. I have listed some of them below:  a) Historical track record: An excellent financial track record is a very important criterion; companies not passing this criterion are best ignored. There is also a very good chance that a company with an excellent track record over a long period (10+years) has some kind of sustainable moat, and also trustworthy management, making further assessment worthwhile. b) Business model: You need to understand the business the company is in. If you can’t understand a company’s business model, it is better to stay away from such companies. A profit-generating unique business model is a very good sign. Additionally, less cyclicality coupled with diversified business is another good factor to consider while investing in a stock. c) Quality of the management: A good management is the backbone of a good company. The management is the one that makes strategic decisions that can either boost or sink a company. This is the one criterion that is either overlooked or not given much importance while choosing a stock which I personally feel is a very big mistake. d) Debt-to-Equity ratio(D/E): This is a measure of a company’s leverage. When a company borrows money, it should be able to repay it, without any hiccups over a reasonable period of time. Investing in a company with a higher D/E ratio may be risky, especially in times of rising interest rates. Generally, companies that are debt free or have a D/E < 1 are considered of good quality. e) Moat or competitive advantage: This is one of Warren Buffet’s essential criterion. This generally suggests that a company should have a wide economic moat, which in effect means sustainable advantage that should protect it from economic downturns as well as competitors. f) Free Cash Flow: FCF is the left-over cash of the company after it has paid off its operating expenses and capital expenditure. It shows the efficiency of a company at generating cash. Free cash flow can be an early indicator to value investors that earnings may increase in the future.

And although it (my answer) was written from an Indian perspective, the overall narrative holds for other countries in the list too since the entire survey design and the conclusions drawn are faulty.  Thomson Reuters Foundation (a not-for-profit arm of Thomson Reuters). They conducted a poll back in 2011 and asked a bunch of experts on the topic of female rights and treatments a few questions, and published the results. This year’s piece was a follow-up on the same. The poll can be found here: The world’s five most dangerous countries for women 2018The corresponding article: EXCLUSIVE - From managers to maids: India's working women all face sexual abuse A. The Poll The methodology page on the website mentions, We contacted 548 experts focused on women’s issues including aid and development professionals, academics, health workers, policymakers, non-government organisation workers, journalists, and social commentators. All of the experts were asked to list: 5 most dangerous countries in the world for women6 compound questions pertaining to 6 different facets - healthcare, discrimination, traditions, sexual violence, non-sexual violence, and traffickingThe first question was given a weightage of 25%, the remaining 6, 75% (or 12.5% each). And here is the first fallacy - the first question is a repeat of the 6 that follow. A country is 5 times more likely to be named there than the other 6 (which ask for only one option), but is only given twice as much weightage. But that’s probably nit-picking. The major problem with the survey design is that it is open-ended. There are 193 countries in the world and picking out one based on personal assessment and perception will never be objective. It is going to be biased against bigger/more popular countries (they are more likely to be named). Furthermore, a subjective analysis like this is prone to recency effect with countries which have been in the news recently having better memory recall. It is also susceptible to being influenced by the kind of media one follows - India is always getting the short-end of the stick in most mainstream Western publications like Huffington Post, BBC etc. Ironically, HuffPo published a opinion piece on this at the same as the first version of the Thomson Reuters poll was out. The examples are many. Why is it that some Australians reacted to the beating and killing of Indian students with the odd retort that “this happens in Mumbai”? Why did NPR cheerily lend its audience to one man’s claim that he saw an Indian get the Nigerian airline bomber on board? Why does Foreign Policy get to call India “evil” without a drop of concern for how it feels to Indian readers or how dangerous words like this were in the past for the colonized nations? Why does New York Times choose to show agonizing restraint when Pakistani terrorists massacre civilians in Mumbai and run screaming headlines naming the arrest of an “Indian” after Madrid? Why does Slumdog Millionaire, one of the most exhilarating movies of our time, depict the majority of Indian characters in it as irredeemably cruel and barbaric (not the nice Indian hero with the British accent though, of course not)? Why did the fictional slur “slumdog” and the image of poverty reportedly figure so often in the Australian attacks? Finally, why does Glenn Beck find the name of a life-giving sacred river similar to the name of a disease? Even the most revered experts would not have a holistic view of all 193 countries across all 6 categories. And all this seems unnecessary considering that you could recreate the same with a set of objective questions with responses rooted in facts and figures. For example, the question on sexual violence, In your view, what is the most dangerous country in the world for women in terms of sexual violence? This includes rape as a weapon of war, domestic rape, rape by a stranger, the lack of access to justice in rape cases, sexual harassment and coercion into sex as a form of corruption. could be deconstructed into data-driven questions around: reported rape cases per capita (where South Africa with 132 cases per 100,000 is at the top, compared to India with 1.8)adjustments based on extent of non-reporting of rape casesPost-assault treatment of sexual assault victimsLawsMarry-your-rapist lawRape shield lawFinally, the weightage for all questions is the same for all types of experts. So someone working in healthcare gets the same weight to their response on question cultural traditions as a academician focused solely on the topic.  The poll, with all its shortcomings is still far better than the ensuing article, the first half of which is a classic case of argumentum ad passiones or Appeal to emotion. The first quarter of the article narrates the experiences of a woman and the fear they go through on a daily basis. It is also followed up by quotes from prominent female public figures (like the Vice President of World Bank, South Asia, and the Head of the National Commission for Women), and other singular incidents (Air India). There are precious few facts scattered throughout the thin narrative, and even those are misleading and/or outright incorrect. Quoted fact #1: At least 20 million women - the combined population of New York, London and Paris - have left the workforce of Asia’s third-largest economy since 2005, World Bank data shows, partly due to their poor treatment. Only 27 percent now work. This is taken from a World Bank Paper published in 2017 and is factually correct, but misleading, owing to Fallacies of Omission.  If you look at the number for 2004–05 and 2011–12 in the rightmost column, 20 million (148 minus 128) women have indeed dropped out of the workforce. But the report also goes on to mention that, One plausible explanation for the recent drop in FLFP, therefore, is that with the recent expansion of secondary education (due to sustained efforts by the central and state governments), as well as rapidly changing social norms in India, more working age young females (15-24 years) are opting to continue their education rather than join the labor force early. —- Moreover, the FLFP rate for this age group declined by 19.3 percent (from 42 percent to 22.7 percent) by 2011-12, and during this period the decline was more than compensated by a gain of 22.1 percent in educational participation among working age females. Similarly, in urban areas, the CPR increased by 11 percent (from 49.2 to 60.2 percent), despite a decline in the FLFP rate by only 3.8 percent (from 18.3 to 14.5 percent) during 1993-94 to 2011-12. These figures support the argument that the decline in the FLFP rate for females between 15 to 24 years of age was to a large extent (or may be completely) due to an increase in female enrollment in education. So, teenage girls dropped out of workforce to continue their education. That’s a big positive. But the author conveniently ignored it and added “partly due to their poor treatment” without any proof of the same. (try searching the report for treatment, abuse, exploitation, harassment, etc.) Verdict: Technically correct, but intentionally/ignorantly attributed to the wrong causes. Quoted fact #2: Crimes against women in India spiked more than 80 percent between 2007 and 2016, according to government data. Nearly 40,000 rapes were reported in 2016 despite a greater focus on women’s safety after the fatal gang rape of a student in New Delhi in 2012 that sparked nationwide protests and led to tougher laws against sexual abuse. Rekha Sharma, head of the National Commission for Women (NCW), said it was a case of more women reporting crimes rather than a greater incidence of sexual violence. But local media carry daily reports of sex crimes - from girls molested in school, professional women raped by taxi drivers, to teens trafficked and sold to brothels. Despite this being a expert survey, the author chooses to ignore another expert on the topic and presents her own opinion to counter it. “Rapes have increased -> Expert says it is because of greater reporting -> “but what about the news?”” A similar article on Firstpost had other experts stating the same plausible reason for the increased number of rape reports in India (i.e. greater reporting, not greater crimes). ""More than the increase in crime rate, it is an increase in reporting,"" Flavia Agnes, women's rights lawyer and co-founder of Majlis, a non-profit that provides legal services to women and children, told IndiaSpend. ""There are no mechanisms to analyse such events,"" said Agnes. ""I feel that due to media pressure on certain brutally violent incidents, there is greater awareness, and women are coming forward to report crimes."" Verdict: Proof by assertion. Likely untrue. Quoted Fact #3: India recorded 539 cases of sexual harassment at the workplace in 2016, up 170 percent from 2006, a joint report by EY and Indian industry body FICCI from last year showed. But campaigners say the figures are just the tip of the iceberg. A 2017 survey by India’s National Bar Association found nearly 70 percent of sexual harassment victims did not report their cases. The facts reported are again correct, but the interpretation is not. Here’s a trend chart of sexual harassment incidents reported at workplaces (from thsi report from EY and based on data released by NCW.)  As you can see, the reported cases remained below around 200 till 2012. From 2013, they have been increasing ~50% YoY. The reason for that could be the fact that The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 came into force on 9 December 2013, and granted women more power to report such crimes. Again, conveniently ignored. Verdict: Error of omission. The closing statements cite one incident of female trafficking and assert that “Such cases lend weight to the Thomson Reuters Foundation's poll of 548 experts on women's issues that found India was the most dangerous country for women in terms of human trafficking including sex slavery and domestic servitude.” According to this 2017 report by the US Department of State, India is a Tier-2 country as per the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 1991, implying that it “does not fully meet the TVPA’s minimum standards, but is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with those standards.” Tier 1 countries are the fully-compliant ones.  Countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Saudi, Iraq, HK, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Thailand are one level below (Tier 2 watchlist), and Congo, Iran, Russia, Sudan, Syria are Tier 3.  All in all, both the poll and the ensuing articles should be taken with a , p̶i̶n̶c̶h̶, nay fistful of salt.",2021-03-06T20:37:55.252Z,"What is your opinion about this article saying the United States is among the top dangerous nations for women?

I.e. our observation might be high objective, verified with other third party observers, but it will still have a subjective component since we cannot remove us the observer from the equation. The only way we can evaluate whether or not our observation is objective is to compare with other observers; if we all see the ""same"" thing (only approximate; impossible in actuality, btw), then we can agree that we are being objective. The advent of science taught us that isn't nearly enough - we have to invent instruments that are devoid of human biases to improve both the accuracies and precisions. That of course increases the objectivity by quite a bit, but even instruments are subjected to physical limitations.  So, we are limited in terms of the level of objectivity we can achieve, but it doesn't mean we aren't trying to be objective. The key is to remember that being objective requires third party verification (who also require additional verification), since that is the way to remove biases. But the fact that we can try to be objective points to a couple of things   the physical world exists independent of the observer (i.e. even if humans aren't here, it doesn't change Newton's laws of motions)we humans love to ""find the truth"", so to speakAnd we can certainly take that and apply toward any subject, including art, but obviously the ""truth"" in art is a lot less concrete than physical laws.  The first question is ""what makes something an art""? Although there are some studies suggest that animals might understand and appreciate some art and music, chances are that if all humans are gone in the next instant, the remaining mammals, birds, and ants won't treasure/protect Mona Lisa or any other piece much. While that doesn't serve as a proof that humans are solely capable of understanding art, I think it does say that an observer (very likely a human) is needed in order to understand/appreciate art.  I.e. art is a highly subjective experience. An art piece won't be understood as art until another comes to appreciate it.  This fits with our understanding of art as a personal experience and taste. But does that mean objectivity doesn't enter when it comes to art?  Before the modern concept of art comes about, art used to just denote ""skills"" in the craft sense, and an artist is something who has more skills than others. Although art now takes on additional meaning, I think it's still true that we won't appreciate a piece of art if we don't (or can't) see the ""skills"" involved in producing the piece of art.  And I think that's where objectivity about art comes in - one can evaluate the level of skills and effort required to produce a piece of art (with accounting for the level of accumulated knowledge at the time), such evaluation will be a lot more objective than the subjective nature of liking an art.

Further, any Chinese ventures in a well-covered area would have led to an exchange of fire. As on date, India is still upgrading its weapon systems as well as on-ground logistics all along the Indo-Chinese border. It is not responding militarily primarily because it cannot do so; not in a sustained fashion at any rate. We are in the process of recruiting new divisions, preparing roads and other logistical realities to buttress our defences in these regions. We require time - and that is what the Indian response is doing. Rest assured, the Chinese are aware of this - the very nature of this incursion is like a test to see just how much pressure will India bear.  There is no point in escalating tensions with a neighbour with a definably superior military option with it. We are not ready on the logistical parameters of warfare - link roads, ammunition supplies, air coverage, helipads, high-altitude warfare teams, weapon systems etc. Problem is that we are currently in the process of acquiring all of the above without exception - and that is disturbing the Chinese. They are aware that we are upgrading facilities all along the Chinese front from Ladaakh to Arunachal; they are also aware that our Naval strength very nearly matches their own;  they are aware of our Naval upgradation plans as well. They are aware that a few forward air-strips on the Chinese border have been recently re-activated after decades of in-activity. We are not ready yet; which is why China is pushing us - and pushing hard. I am no military expert - but it seems to me from my armchair that we would just be playing into their hands if we escalate. We are doing the right thing by having a diplomatic approach.  The ""disputed aspect"" (whether it is right or not) does not enter into it; the incursion is in established Indian-held territory. We already have a military stand-off with Pakistan; we cannot afford another front with a powerful China. Full marks to the Indian Government for its clear-headed and measured response. This will tell the world that despite being in the right- we have opted to try and settle this matter in peace. This approach actually showcases China as a regional bully, and further strengthens India and its stand; it also acts a powerful support base in case we opt for the military option - which should ideally happen when we are ready - not when the enemy wants us to respond! As I have already stated in earlier answers, a military stand-off between India and China is pretty much inevitable as things stand today; but I dont think something such as this can be the catalyst of War. It is an isolated local incident; and it is being rightly treated as such by India. This approach will only anger the Chinese more, as I think they wanted an Indian military response. Contrast this with Kargil, where the incursions were along a wide border and comprised thousands of troops. That merited an immediate response; this doesnt! *****EDIT*****It is also true that the Indian side of the Himalayas is more inhospitable and steeper than the Chinese side. India does lag in terms of road infrastructure near her mountainous border regions, but not due to lack of trying.

They had been making cars since 2008. Demand didn’t seem high, and the cars were expensive. They were desirable but not affordable. Prior to the Tesla Roadster, EVs had a reputation for having quirky appearances, short ranges, long charge times, no storage space (the trunk was full of batteries) and poor performance. The 0–60 time was very slow compared to a comparable ICE. It seemed clear to the industry that demand for EVs just wasn’t there. Tesla made the first appealing EV in about 100 years, but it wasn’t something that would ever become mainstream. Most people had no practical use for a small two seat sports car with a high price. When Tesla said that they would build the Model S by 2012, the industry didn’t see the demand. There was no appreciable demand for EVs. The demand for high end cars was low. The Model S could end up costing in the $100,000 range and the industry didn’t envision Tesla selling 5000 of them ever in its existence, if it lasted long enough for them to do that. Tesla had no experience building cars from scratch. They didn’t have a working factory. The company was founded by people outside of the auto industry who thought they knew better than people who made cars for a living. The experts were wrong because they had enough industry experience to know that it would never work. They didn’t have the marketing data because they wouldn’t have seen any reason to even look at whether people would be willing to buy an expensive four door EV sedan. Passenger car sales were dropping and they were questioning their own long term strategies. Given the positions that most experts held, the conclusions that they came to were quite rational. They were wrong because they didn’t see the genuine excitement that people had about EVs. They hadn’t considered the possibility that if the primary objections to EVs went away, people would want to buy them. They hadn’t considered building EVs with top notch performance, plenty of range, lots of storage, and with a design from an award winning industry expert. They were wrong because they thought that Tesla wasn’t a car company, but they ignored the fact that so many within the company were industry veterans. They didn’t realize that over time, Tesla kept hiring industry veterans. The cars are designed by one. The head of production had a similar role at Audi, for higher volumes. The President of the Automotive division is an industry expert. And the software and computer hardware development is taking place in Silicon Valley, where there’s lots of access to top talent. The industry failed to see the importance of software design, the ability for remote updates, or the idea that hardware could be added for software that’s still in development so that people’s cars could keep improving each year. When the Model S did come out, won top awards, did so well in the Consumer Reports testing that it got the highest possible mark that their scale allowed for, the industry failed to see the significance or how that would translate into sales. They failed to see the importance of enabling a network for long distance travel. They didn’t see the importance of the Supercharger network or that people could use it to take long trips without stopping for more time than they’d stop anyway for breaks. They were wrong because they didn’t understand how Tesla could build cars and make a profit. The companies looked at what they thought it would cost them to build cars like Tesla’s and concluded that they’d lose money on each one. They thought that the primary appeal of EVs was a low cost of operation, but they thought that customers didn’t care. They saw customers moving away from passenger cars toward SUVs, so cost of operation didn’t seem to be a big selling point. They also saw no point in low cost of operation for cars with high selling prices. The Model 3 was so far in the future that Tesla didn’t bring it up until 2013. They didn’t invest in battery technology. Tesla realized that they needed to build a factory that would produce batteries at a rate equal to that of all other battery factories combined. Without taking similar steps, other companies weren’t prepared for high volume manufacturing. They thought so much of their own expertise that they were sure that Tesla could not be a viable company, and were so sure of Tesla’s lack of expertise that they were sure that Tesla could not prove them wrong.

Instead, what I will try is to give an answer in my local, i.e. Indian, context. India is one of the crucial areas where poaching is a genuine and environment-threatening problem. It is well recognized by the government and protection mechanisms are in place in terms of necessary legislation and institutional structures (India has forest departments in each state to cater to the need). Before I move forward, I would like to point out a crucial aspect that go unnoticed.  Poaching is NOT killing of large fauna like tigers or leopards only. It is killing of wild-life, big or small, for various purposes and reasons. Hence, I would look at the issue in a broader way that the questioner may have intended.  The easiest and most logical way to answer this question is to identify the reasons of poaching in India and look for options to remove these reasons from the system. The primary reasons for poaching in India are: 1.     Livelihood:A serious threat second only to pet/parts-trade.Mostly smaller fauna that is killed for food or tribal/local medicine. Animal collections for performance (snakes, bears, mongoose etc) by traditional performers also result in killing of some animals. 2.     International smuggling for pet-trade or parts-trade:The biggest threat due to its huge commercial scale, organized nature and constant/growing demand. 3.     Man-animal conflict:Increasing urbanity is increasing man-animal conflict across India, resulting in killing of wild-life. It is a growing threat to Indian wild-life. 4.     Hunting:Hunting is not really a great threat but it still has popularity in some regions of India leading to illegal killing of wild-life If we now look at possible methods of mitigation, the answers are not requiring anything beyond common-sense, as, within the list of reasons is the insight for protection. 1.     Livelihood based poaching can stop only when other means of livelihood are provided. So scarcity of food (also much-needed protein in diet) must be worked at to resolve this issue. For tribal medicines, use of animal parts is more in terms of superstitions and hence it can be replaced safely by increasing access to modern medicines. Animal performers are now slowly vanishing, but the process can be speeded up by creating special vocational opportunities for these tribes. 2.      International smuggling is a very complex issue and requires fighting from all fronts. Strong law enforcement is THE key to this problem. 3.      Man-animal conflict is the most difficult threat to deal with as there appears to be no real way to stop it. In frank terms, Indian wild-life has very little future out-side the protected areas and parks. It is a reality that must be accepted and measures like ear-marking more land and isolation of animal-movement-corridors must be taken seriously by the government as soon as possible. 4.     Hunting is a marginal threat and over-all public concern is now eradicating the hunting mindset, at least in India. In addition to the above, there is one personal observation that I would like to share. Though it may sound counter-intuitive, I have observed that one of the most effective ways to save any protected area from poaching is through increase of tourism. It may disturb the “wild” life in to some extent; but constant surveillance due to tourists’ presence ensures heightened safety of wild-animals. I have also seen that wild animals adjust quickly to this phenomenon and continue with their “wild” behavior.  In Indian national parks, those with a large tourist traffic fare better than those that see hardly any tourist foot-fall. Kanha, the tiger heaven of Madhya-Pradesh is a prime example of healthy tiger population in tourism zone, while Panna, a park not too far away from Kahna lost all its tigers due to its comparatively low tourist presence.

Unlimited computing time and power, pure knowledge of the system's components and state (up to physical limits), and you didn't mind too much about extracting patterns because you could just do the analyses again and again? Let's say you had all that: could you just do applied fundamental physics, and it's only down to practical matters that we need to do other sciences? I don't think so. Bear with me for a slightly involved story. Phase transitions are where substances change state in some way.  Boiling, freezing, or the triple point of water.  There are a particularly interesting set of phase transitions, called second order phase transitions, where you can track the behaviour of quantities like temperature, pressure, thermal capacity and so on, and it turns out they behave exponentially as you get closer and closer to the transition point.  Do the measurements, and you find that this exponential behaviour is governed by a set of small number of coefficients (i.e., four numbers*) which -- astonishingly -- turn out to be the same four numbers every time you do the experiment, and also to come out the same across many different substances.  When this was discovered, it was both astonishing and puzzling.  The numbers and behaviour seems to be independent of the micro-structure of the substance. It gets weirder.  You can find analogies of second order phase transitions as materials become superconductive, as percolation of water goes through a more and more porous medium, as magnets get near their Curie point, and even as you look at the transmissibility of viruses in a human population.  These states obviously have nothing to do with another micro-level.  And yet you look at their behaviour near a critical point, and those four numbers come out exactly the same (even though they're now seen by counting ill people, rather than measuring thermal capacity of a beaker full of water).  In fact, all these systems have in common is two things: the dimensionality of the system, and whether the relevant interaction is short or long distance.  That's all.  Yet knowing that, I can predict its behaviour near a second-order phase transitions. The explanation of how this comes about won a Nobel Prize for Kenneth Wilson.  It's a beautiful explanation, involving (somewhat unexpectedly) the renormalization group.  Wilson's theory of critical phenomena is -- to my mind -- fundamental science.  It is made even more fundamental because we can see that it is independent of the micro-structure of the bodies; so we can be confident that they would hold even in exotic new matter that we have never seen before. Even with all the computing power and knowledge of initial conditions you like, you would not have got Wilson's theory out of a fundamental-physics-only approach.  Yet Wilson uncovered some fundamental constants of nature in the behaviour of collective systems and these hold across space, time and physical scale.  (In an interesting irony, Wilson's theory of critical phenomena has also shed some light on why renormalizability might be a requirement of the very small scale theories too: quantum electrodynamics, chromodynamics, and similar.) An (unproven) assertion.  When you move to a different levels of explanation -- from particle physics to solid state, from solid state physics to chemistry, biology, and so on, something analogous is going on.  I have deliberately not mentioned the word  ""emergence"" because I feel it's a hopelessly vague concept, and there is an awful lot of appeal to this word (e.g., consciousness, time, the external being an ""emergent"" phenomena as if this explained anything).  But this is the idea. So, looping back.  Practical limits of doing fundamental-physics-only are hugely important -- they are certainly the ones that you would notice if you sat down one day, and decided to just to do physics and nothing else.  But even in principle, there are aggregate behaviour laws that are at least as fundamental as those of particle physics (if not more so), and these are being found in solid state physics, in chemistry, biology, medicine and social sciences.  And physics is not the ""only real science"", not only in practice, but also in principle.   * Yes, some phase transitions have a different number of coefficients.  I've chosen one set for the unversality class of 3D with short-range interactions. Ah yes, Ernest Rutherford.  The Nobel prize committee had the right idea.

There’s no way to address the contradictions believing China is a bubble that hasn’t popped. A better question to ask: Why has China’s strong economy not witnessed a major downturn in recent decades? I’m a firm believer in the law of non-contradictions, so if we believe something is orange we can’t conclude it’s a different color. Either it’s orange or it isn’t. We cannot imply it’s both. For all bubbles must pop inevitably. Yet we could ask: Some experts believe China’s economy is a bubble but have they noticed it hasn’t popped? That would be a better way to address the topic at hand. Many children played with bubbles. They understood all bubbles were expected to pop and it would be just a matter of time and circumstances before that happened. It’s the same with economic bubbles that had led to global financial and banking panics in history. Most economic bubbles have lifespans for a few years if they are lucky and they are not sustainable to last for more than four decades. An economic bubble is a just like a pyramid scheme. The pyramid schemes are only effective when fraudulent investors can find new gullible investors to pour money into them. But the Chinese economy is not a bubble or a confidence game. The country can still be successful without luring in more foreign direct investments (FDI). The strength of China’s economy is the richness of its diversity. The country has a lengthy coastline with many deep sea ports connected to large inland rivers. China is the world leader as a manufacturer and exporter but if other countries push back and raise tariffs on Chinese imports or block cross-border trade and investments with Chinese companies, the country will not collapse. China has the world’s largest population, rich in natural resources, plenty of land for agriculture and can stand strong as a self-sustaining nation. A few sovereign governments in the West, including Canada, United Kingdom and the United States, have announced new trade protectionist measures to restrict Chinese imports but the actions will not stay permanent. The new trend is for localization of manufacturing and to re-shore supply chains to Western countries. That’s a common sense strategy since many people have lost jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The best way to bring back strong employment numbers would be to open up factories. Chinese manufacturers can jump in by opening transferring their factories to the US. You can read more about it from Tecma. The link is here: https://www.tecma.com/chinese-manufacturing-companies/ As reported by Tecma: ”Local and state governments in the US are able to offer incentives to foreign companies that tip the scales in favor of moving from China to the US. Many Chinese manufacturing companies are now realizing that the lower transportation costs and taxes are making it more profitable to do business in North America than in Asia. As the trend grows, the Chinese companies who provide so many manufactured goods to the North American market are finding that employing American workers is the most profitable method of production.” China’s economy is not a bubble and it’s absurd to think that’s the case.

Likewise if you hurt other people and treat them badly, again they in turn (or somebody else) will do the same to you. When you and other people maximize happiness and pleasure to other people as much as humanly possible, nearly everyone benefits from it in some way, shape, or form. This has NOTHING to to do with a belief or lack of belief in deities or souls, nor is it contingent on whether gods exist or not, nor does it have anything to do with so called “karma.” This applies to theists as well. On a per individual basis, morality is very subjective and situational. On a population level, nearly everyone will agree that senselessly killing/raping/stealing from people is wrong, and that if everyone on the planet did this to each other all the time, then society would collapse and we would go extinct due to the level of complexity that human society entails. This is why we have systems of government and law enforcement that basically say that in order for you to enjoy the rights and privileges in a functioning society, you will not break these societal rules, but you will follow these societal regulations. Otherwise there will be consequences, whether in the form of imprisonment, exile, or death. However, say for instance that someone was trying to break into your home and had the intention of killing you or your family and/or friends and/or stealing from you and/or them, and you killed the intruder in self defense. Wouldn’t that be the right thing to do? Wouldn’t it be immoral for you NOT to defend your loved ones and friends from a dangerous and potentially lethal threat? Let’s take the example of revenge killings. Some people will say that it’s immoral. Others may not have a problem with it depending on Why the person/people was/were killed in retaliation,What they did to deserve it, andThe severity of their action(s)It really depends on the situation and the person. This, too, applies to theists. The imaginary threat of “eternal punishment” or the imaginary reward of “eternal bliss” is not applicable here. Being moral out of some non-existent expectation of a reward, or out of fear of some non-existent threat is not being moral at all. That’s just obedience. OR Being a mental slave to superstition does not, has not, and will not ever be equated to morality. P.S. Gods, and all other supernatural beings, places, forces, phenomena, and concepts (along with countless other superstitions) don’t exist, never have existed, and never will exist.

This means more business for marketing agencies. User experience will be a differentiator: Bruno Delfino, who is the brand marketing manager at Google, says that users will be more concerned about the experience they receive. There will be an increased demand and priority of UX in 2021. I agree 100%. There is no better competitive advantage than UX. You need to focus on improving UX across your website, landing pages, and all touchpoints. This will be a key in 2021. Data and personalization will rise above: We know how important data is and its importance will continue to rise. Marketers must understand the importance of data and how to use it to improve personalization. For example, product recommendations based on customer past purchases and recent Facebook post likes on your page require data analysis and integration. You must do it this year. I hope it helps.

We can spin our stories around them. The funniest thing about this question is that the article from Financial Express mentioned in the question detail is more than one year old. Most of the answers are currently dated and have no relation to the points made out in the article. The news story itself is no great shakes and does nothing to substantiate the premise of the question. Past Trends : No one has the crystal gazing abilities to know what the market would do in case of any political event. On November 09, 2016, we had the Demonetization news from the previous evening combined with US Election results coming in leading to Donald Trump becoming President of the USA. His win was supposed to be an economic disaster. Experts had predicted a 10% crash in the markets. Nothing of the sort happened and all the Stock Markets world over went on making the new highs. This is how it happened on November 09 and 10 in 2016.  From a low of 8002, we were at near 8600 next day. So much for the expertise of the so called experts and their predictions. Election Results and Markets: Let us look at what happened when BJP led by Mr. Narendra Modi won the Lok Sabha Elections in 2014.  On the day of results ( May 16, 2014 ), it moved to the high point of 7563 from the previous close of 7123. Over next two days it was business as usual. Probably the electoral victory was already factored in. Actually markets do not go up by much when the expected things happen. It is when the unexpected occurs that the big move happens. When UPA won the second term in 2009, this was the market reaction:  Results were on a Saturday ( May 16, 2009 ). Markets went up by more than 15% on UPA victory. It does not matter to the market whether BJP wins or UPA wins. Markets look for stability. Does it actually matter if the markets go up ? : All the hype about BJP winning and markets going up is created by the media. It does not make any money for us. Stock markets are not one day wonders. Neither these are casinos where you make your fortune or go bust with one right or wrong bet. It is sustained performance over a period of time which matters. BJP Government was formed on May 26, 2014. NIFTY on that day:  NIFTY on Friday June 15, 2018 :  It has moved from 7359 to 10817 in a little more than 4 years. Let us say in 49 months. A gain of 47% in 49 months. A good performance indeed. Let us compare it to the NIFTY movement during the much maligned UPA 2 Government. Like mentioned earlier in this answer, NIFTY went up by more than 15% in two days when the Election Results were out in 2009. Dr. Manmohan Singh took oath of office for the second term on May 22, 2009. NIFTY on that day was at 4238.50.  We know where it was when Mr. Modi took over in 2014. It was 7359. In 60 months of UPA dispensation, NIFTY had gone up by 3120 points. With the base number as 4238, this means a gain of 73.60% in 60 months. Stock Markets did actually well even in UPA 2 times. Some of the credit in the last part can be given to the projections of a BJP victory in 2014 which kept the markets up. But that kind of gain should be automatically built in for the current regime as well with their projections of winning again in 2019. To Summarize: In 60 months of UPA 2, NIFTY had gone up by 73.60%. In 49 months of BJP Government, NIFTY is up by 47%. These are the facts. There is no hype surrounding these numbers. These are not based on the knee jerk movements based on the election result. And it is certainly no reflection on the quality of governance or economic reforms. UPA 2 was certainly a mess and was voted out. But the markets did not care then. Today also things are not as good or as bad as perceived by the supporters or detractors of the ruling party. And again the market does not care two hoots. Markets always do their own thing and trying to fathom that is an exercise in futility. Well, the markets may rise higher for a day or two if Narendra Modi wins the elections for his party in 2019. After those two days, it will be back to reality as always. Politics and Markets generally do not mix well contrary to what the experts on business channels keep telling us everyday. We just have to take the time to look at the reality ourselves. I trust that this answers the question. Thanks for reading. Enjoy the weekend.

But, I think it is more suitable here. It is a piece I wrote. The answer to your question lies in the latter part of the piece. The Federer Anomaly  On Friday Evening, Roger Federer Lost to Milos Raonic at Wimbledon. Normally, such an event would lead to a bout of depression accompanied with indulgence in the incredibly productive practice of reading every damned article that had the sole virtue of using the word ‘Federer’ in its title. Overtime, the pain would ease and hope would once again fill the void. But this time around, I felt no pain. Was it because I had unconsciously given up on the idea of Federer winning an 18th Slam?Possibly. Maybe.But why then, did I follow every game like my internet connection depended on it. So, I mulled over it a little more. When you think about Federer, it doesn’t take much time for the word “Role model” to spring into your mind. Federer has achieved almost everything that involves striking a tennis ball. But it is only in the last few years that he has truly shown us the man that he is.And no amount of Djokovic’s dominance can touch this aspect of ‘The Legend of Roger Federer’. It is this very realization, that I believe shields me from despair. In my mind, ‘Roger the Man’ has overcome ‘Federer the Tennis Player’ in a tight five setter. While my admiration for his ability to defy geometry remains intact, it is his determination and love for playing tennis that draws me ever so close to him. Until 2009, Federer, to me, was ‘just’ a tennis genius, with a healthydosage of wit.The 2009 Australian Open final changed that. For the first time ever, TV had gotten me close to tears. Roger’s mettle had never been under greater scrutiny. Nadal had pinned him onto the mat. Roger was thrown out of his own den (Wimbledon and #1 Rank) and then subdued by the southpaw, who had to play consecutive five-setters on a surface he (Rafa) disliked. Just prior to uncontrollably sobbing, Roger seemed to momentarily contemplate retirement.His words were: “Maybe I’ll try again. I don’t know. God, it’s killing me…” That was the moment that revealed his mortality, but what was to follow would establish that he is one heck of a mortal. After taking a few moments to recompose, he came back onto the podium and delivered the following lines: “I’ll try again” “I don’t want to have the last word. This guy (Rafa) deserves it.” That year, he went on to win the French Open and Wimbledon. Back to the present. After the 2012 Wimbledon (his last major triumph), the Swiss has lost to Djokovic in three major finals. Outside majors, he has been owned by Novak multiple times. As a consequence, people have come up with multiple arguments that urge Roger to retire. What about brand ‘Federer’? How can he bear to keep getting humiliated by players he had once ruled over? He is not getting any younger and Djokovic has been so dominant. He is not going to win another slam, is he? What these people fail to understand is that Roger is not like us. Most of us don’t truly love what we do. At best, we only live for the end achievement that fuels our ego. Most of us define success by what others think of us or what we have ‘achieved’. We get through life feeding upon what the world thinks of us. We clutch and cling to every opportunity or occurence that serves to inflate our ego. Our man’s different. Roger Federer doesn’t feed on your admiration. He appreciates it, but doesn’t run on it. He places the love for striking a tennis ball over his ego. He doesn’t measure the quality of his life by how satisfied his ego is, but rather places a premium on what he wants. He thrives on the high of the journey and whenever he manages to reach the final destination, well, he just feels (in his own words) “nice”. Roger doesn’t just inspire me to pick my racquet, but inspires me to keep pushing forward in life. To stay hungry. To place what I love doing over ‘petty’ achievements and mere ego. To truly focus on what I want and not what the world expects of me. All my life, I have supported a winning mentality over sheer talent: Dravid over Sachin.Anand over Carlsen.But in Roger, I see both. Image from here.

So, welcome my theories: Historical theory (based on the previous Bitcoin price movements)There have been 3 major bullish periods of BTC, which have been increasing in length: 1) a 10-month run from 2010–2011 2) a 2-year run from 2011–2013 3) a three-year run covering 2015–2017 Citibank managing director Tom Fitzpatrick has made comments on Bitcoin cycles and pointed out several trends. He noticed that the correction period following the last 2 bull runs has remained stable at around 12 months. According to the analysis, we are in the middle of a bull run that started in early 2019 and can potentially run for 4 years until late 2022. Fitzpatrick's prediction is $318,000 for Bitcoin price in December 2021. Source Social theory (the one based on what industry veterans said)- Hal Finney: $10 million. Here is what Bitcoin pioneer said in January 2009: ""One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. [...] the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million. Source Here is other cryptocurrency figures' predictions: - Alistair Milne (British investor and entrepreneur ): $120,000 USD by 2021 - Max Keiser (Founder and CEO of Heisenberg Capital): $100,000 USD - Anthony Pompliano ( founder of Morgan Creek Digital): $100,000 USD by 2021 - Tim Draper (Bitcoin advocate and venture capitalist): $250,000 by 2023 - Raoul Pal (CEO of an investment strategy research service The Global Macro Investor): $1 million by 2025 - Jeremy Liew (partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners and the brain behind Snapchat): $500,000 by 2030. Realistic theory (based on market rules of pumps and corrections)Every time the cryptocurrency market goes up for any length of time, most traders start forecasting an imminent drop. Usually, this involves predicting the market correction, which is a decline of 10%-20%. Many things can trigger market corrections and crashes. However, in the cryptocurrency market, we mostly observe corrections when the market is ""overheated,"" meaning that Bitcoin got too high. If whales make that determination and pull money out of the market, the resulting small drop can send retail investors into a selling panic as well. As a rule, after Bitcoin correction, alts start moving.  However, not all crypto advocates are as positive about how Bitcoin correction will look like:  Investor sentiment, economic indicators, global politics, and breaking news all play a role in determining whether and when a correction occurs...or doesn't. Bonus: Moon theory (based on ""tothemoon"" affirmations and fun)According to the most passionate Bitcoin advocates, the highest possible price is when it reaches the moon. The moon is 238,900 miles away, so the highest possible BTC price is $238.9k.  Thanks for reading my answer and the theories I've collected.

You will see big growth in some areas but they can decline very fast, so be careful with this. This could be due to massive government funding for example and as soon as that is taken away most companies lose interest. Although I agree with most the answers I feel some need fleshed out a bit. Wi-Fi will move fast and there is alternatives proposed already such as Li-Fi, the key jobs relating to this that will be relevant into the future would be the embedded programming of this and the RF design.  If you want to keep a job in the future and you can adapt quickly I believe computer science is a great field for the future. Everything is becoming autonomous and computer based from computers in your car to toothbrush to washing machine, these things need coding, even today taxi companies need programmers to program apps for them.   If money is your priority then it is good to find a niche and a skill you can fill, makes you valuable.

There are massive amounts of fields out there in management and finance. Having a particular skill in engineering/science is a good way to make money too though, for example analogue IC verification specialist, audio engineer, quality assurance, high voltage DC-DC designer etc.  These days as a programmer you can code your own little projects and sell them quite easily. I think it is good to follow a path you enjoy and you find interesting, try to make this relevant to still having a job of course. If you can't decide I can tell you all engineering fields, computer science, law, medicine, finance/management or any trade skills you will be fine :).

What a load of absolute nonsense coming from her of all people, so I thought perhaps it’s not really her professional view, and perhaps she has a political reason to make things difficult for the Hong Kong government. Also perhaps Taiwan (and its president) is very very sensitive about whether Taiwan is seen as an independent jurisdiction (when no one actually put this in question). Perhaps it thought allowing Chan to freely go to Taiwan to turn himself in would look too much like one country. Perhaps it thinks too much. It gives too much importance to Hong Kong or how Hong Kong sees things. When Taiwan’s “status” is not at all a matter for Hong Kong. Then perhaps the Taiwan politicians finally realised their allegation (that Hong Kong could do the prosecution) is not sustainable. Perhaps they finally realised that eventually this nonsensical argument will motivate everyone to obtain knowledge about the law, and then they would look like unreasonable jerks. Now they’re saying they will send someone to come to Hong Kong to take Chan. And there’s been (nonsensical) speculation that Hong Kong allowing Taiwan to come get the suspect would amount to an admission that Taiwan is a “country”. I don’t need to point out how ridiculous this suggestion is. As if Taiwan’s “status” would be affected by anything coming from Hong Kong. As if Chan will not be a free man who will willingly go to Taiwan of his own accord whether they come get him or not. The latest nonsense is the Taiwan president complaining about possibility that Hong Kong might withhold evidence that may harm Taiwan’s chance of a successful prosecution. What evidence other than the words of Chan that Hong Kong can possibly have in possession? The autopsy, the crime scene, the things at crime scene, are all with Taiwan. The only thing that Hong Kong has is Chan the person, and his statement (about the crime) which has already been made public. If she’s trying to save face she’s making it worse.

Injuries you may have sustained when you were younger also have a tendency to resurface when you get older. None of that should put an older person from lifting weights as weight training does strengthen muscles, bones and the cardio vascular system. While everyone is different there are some common problem areas. Rotator cuff inpingement and tears. Discomfort in the front of the deltoid or within the joint that does not feel muscular related after pushing weights. Some of the exercises that may aggravate the rotator cuff include the overhead press, the lateral raise, flys, bench press and others. You can possibly do those exercises after strengthening the scapula muscles in the mid back. But best not go past failure. If you end up with a torn rotator cuff then that can far reaching consequences on your training including squats. You will know that you have torn the rotator as you will lose strength and you will experience pain through lifting the arm or putting any pressure on the shoulder joint. Its best to avoid as it can also take several months to heal it's also possible it may never become 100%.The knees. Many lifters don't do squats even with good knees. However, squats are one of if not the best exercise you can do. If your options were limited and you could do one exercise then it would have to be the squats. Its a core compound exercise and if done right it can strengthen the legs, abs, back, glutes, bone density and your cardio-vascular system. If done correctly it will not damage your knees. As each person is different they will need to figure out how best to approach the squat. There are several YouTube videos that can help with this. 3. The back. This is another common problem area. People with back problems often avoid weights thinking it will aggravate the back, however, weight lifting if done correctly can help prevent back problems. Core compound exercises, including the squat, can help with this. Weight training slows down physical deterioration as you get older. It also provides mental health benefits and helps support a healthy diet and lifestyle. If you are older 50+, and if you are able, try to focus on core compound (multi-joint) exercises such as squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press etc. Ensure you do slow reps maintaining good form and be careful not to overtrain. This will reduce the possibility of injuries particularly to tendons. As far as other forms of exercise go outside of weights I don't know, but one thing I wouldn't do is long distance running. I think it damages joints the feet and also long sustained periods of exercise releases cortisone that damages the body. I’m no expert and could be wrong.

To be honest, I’d say there would be a significant chance the baby would be negatively affected, but it depends on the titan and the circumstances. I won’t lie, the majority of this answer is going to be guesses and speculation. I’ll also point out I’m not an expert on pregnancy, all this knowledge is coming from….tv….and that’s pretty much it actually. Now, let’s get started If a female holder of the Colossal titan transformed, I imagine there would be a significant risk to the baby, as the Colossal titan is the titan that puts the most strain on the shifters body, mainly due to its size. Equally, any titan whose role is as a fighter/has abilities would greatly increase the risk to any unborn child. The Warhammer for example, depending on how it was used, would also put great strain on the shifter and their unborn child. If I had to make a list, from most to least risky, it’d look something like this: The Founding titanThe Colossal titanThe Warhammer titanThe Mimic (Female) titanThe Cart titanThe Jaw titanThe Armoured titanThe Beast titanThe Attack titanNow to be honest, I’d say the bottom….imma say 5 are sorta tied, but largely because it would depend on how the titan was used. The Mimic titan (as I’ve called the Female titan after the reveal in chapter 133) is number 4, but we don’t know how its power manifests, so its placement is a little harder to determine. Equally, the Cart titan, if used as intended, would pose a considerable risk to an unborn child, but that’s only if it’s used as intended, for scouting and transport purposes. At the least, the top three would definitely be the most dangerous due to their powers and size. Well, one for size, two for powers. I’ve put the Founding titan at the top of the list as, if used as intended, the strain on the shifter could very well kill them, as well as the unborn child. The problem is it’s hard to determine the exact risk factors, as we’ve never seen a pregnant shifter, let alone one that used their powers while pregnant. It’s possible that the Founder Ymir, at some point, might have used her powers while pregnant, but we’ll never know. The problem with a lot of these assumptions is that we don’t see how each of the current shifters cope after a transformation. Eren and Falco are the only cases we’ve seen a first transformation of, but we can’t compare them to the others as we just haven’t seen them. And sure, the first transformation would knock a person out, but the more they used their titans, the more their body would get used to it and adapt. For example, if a pregnant shifter transformed for the first time, then that could cause them to lose the baby regardless of the titan. There’s another thing to consider as well. We don’t know how titans shifters function inside their titans. I’ve theorised that their body is effectively in a comatose state, with their consciousness fully immersed in the titan body. It’s entirely possible the shifters body doesn’t breath for itself, and is simply sustained by the titan body. What effect that would have on a baby I don’t know. It’s entirely possible that titan bodies can only sustain one ‘pilot’, which would mean that while the shifter is in their comatose state, the baby is still…in real life. If the shifter isn’t breathing, that means no air for the baby, which is never a good thing. But that’s all speculation. It’s entirely possible that the Founder Ymir alters titan forms to sustain pregnancies. But it’s also entirely possible that she doesn’t. To sum up, there’s no proper answer to this question, just pure speculation. Though I think my list sums up the proportionate risks of each shifter to an unborn child. I’ll link in an answer about what happens to shifter bodies when they’re inside their titan forms, just to add a bit to this answer.

It is a controversial statement, with elements of the truth. Where to start… First, train to fightIn Western tradition, going back at least 600 years in the modern era, and 2,500 years back in the classical era, it has been recognised that the best tournament fighters are the best fighters in battle. It isn’t really necessary to go much beyond that point: train to fight, take part in realistic and bloody contests, and you will be a better fighter than those who don’t have any experience of proper fights. Basically, that is all you need to know - going any further than this is just gilding the lily. But that’s what you’re (not) paying me for, so… Those who fight improve at fightingFrom the first paragraph above, we know that if people compete realistically then they will be better at fighting than those who don’t. The more they fight, the better they get at it, and the more visible the difference is between these expert fighters and beginners (those who train but don’t fight). A beginner is someone who has never had any proper fights. Ten year’s training won’t make you any realistic amount better at fighting than a novice with a year or two’s training, also with no fight experience. They might look fantastic in the gym, in sparring; but it is all worthless against strong, experienced fighters. Gym training counts for sweet FA when you get punched hard in the face and knocked down some stairs - what is gold at that time is real fight experience. The converse should also hold true: on average, those who don’t take part in proper fights are not going to be great at fighting. And it does. Of course we are talking about averages: the result we’d mainly get by choosing any random seven or eight people in your gym/school/studio/class who have trained for a couple of years - superstars are not the average. They may look fantastic in the gym, and wonderful in the everyman type of contest (a match where there is little or no chance of being seriously hurt if the referee doesn’t step in) - but it counts for little in a fight against experienced fighters. It’s fine for knocking over dummies, but anything works for that. There is no magic way to somehow become a great fighter without ever taking part in proper fights. Fighting ability is acquired in fights. This is why experienced fighters are so much better than novices. To believe otherwise is to engage in some kind of fantasy. Boxing vs othersThe big advantage boxing has is that anyone with half a dozen fights knows more about fighting than someone else with 10 years of gym work and no fights. It is an enormous advantage. An advantage doesn’t mean the boxer always wins, of course; but you’d sooner have an advantage in a fight than not, I think. Yes? Many other combat systems would be equally useful if they just fought, not pretended. In order to win hard contests you have to train right. All the baggage gets discarded, and people get better at training to fight, and at fighting. Of course, there are a multitude of problems connected with this. One of them is simply that the vast majority of people have no intention of training to fight and then competing; they just want a combat-related workout. How to wreck itThe best combat system in the world will be utterly ruined for fighting if the practitioners stop fighting. The system will fossilise over time, and in the end it gets turned on its head in a kind of bad joke: the technique becomes more important than the results. When people start to idolise a technique, or what it looks like, or people who look technically good - you know it is sunk as far as fight effectiveness goes. The whole thing has been turned on its head. Technique versus fighting skillsAll that matters to fighters is the win; anything else comes a distant second. The method of training is determined by the wins or losses in the fights - it has to be. No fights = groping in the dark. How can you possibly get better at fighting with no experience of what works and doesn’t work for *you* when someone is doing their best to kill you (or it feels like it); when you have none of the control over your body that a fighter develops (for example the exocrine and endocrine systems, control of which is mastered only by fighters); or the durability that comes from extensive hard fights (the ability to take a level of punishment that would floor the non-fighter). There are many training methods that people who don’t fight use to try and gain these skills, but they are extremely inefficient compared to just fighting. There just isn’t any way to replicate it. The most common mistake beginners make (people with no fights) is that technique is the most important factor in fights. It isn’t. It’s everything else a fighter learns. Why is boxing any good?So if, as you suggest, boxing is more effective than other methods, for real-world fight purposes, the reason would be that it is continuously tested. I agree, partly; but modern boxing is a sportified version of real boxing. If you want to fight with it, there are better ways of going about it than the modern glove & handwrap ring sport version. For a start you need to put the wrestling back in. Old-time boxers knew how to wrestle and throw, because it is a core part of fighting; trying to fight with only strikes succeeds some of the time, but sooner or later it falls down badly. Boxing today is a heavily bowdlerised version of the boxing that existed for thousands of years. The last 100 years don’t make something ‘the’ version; the correct version; or the best version. Modern international boxing has lost about 90% of what made it useful for fighting; 10% of the original version still works pretty good, mostly because it is tested all the time - but modern boxers would lose to an old-timer as soon as they got too close, as the bareknuckle fighter would throw them hard and choke them out. That’s if the modern boxer hadn’t already broken their hands and given up. Which do you think is the real boxing, usable in fights anytime anyplace, without handwraps and gloves: The super-civilised product of the last 100 years based on having heavily-protected hands; that has had almost all of the fighting technique removed; that is conducted according to very strict rules;Or what existed previously for thousands of years and was designed to win fights with no rules, no wraps, and no gloves - and included wrestling holds and throws, strikes, and often weapons training as well?If you want to compare the effectiveness of boxing with formalised martial arts, then immediately you are talking about a no-gloves no-rules environment. How else would you suggest it is compared? With gloves in a ring? And therefore straightaway you must recognise that modern sport boxing is not the best way to approach a real-world fight. It’s good but it can never equal traditional boxing for that purpose, since traditional boxing was developed for fighting with no gloves and no rules of any consequence. Look up James Figg, and read the various accounts of his life in different places on the internet. This was a boxing master - not someone who can only survive in a sport contest with bombproof hand protection and hugely restrictive rules, and loses as soon as that framework is removed. Fighting experience is invaluable, but all combat sports have massive holes for fighting purposes. ……….. Muay Thai and similar artsThanks to Mathew L. for pointing out that some may see muay Thai and so on as martial arts, in which case they work as well as boxing - especially for the smaller men. Indeed they are more effective for the smaller fighter, since a bantamweight Thai boxer taking a points win in a Western boxing match would stop the same opponent quickly and easily under Thai rules / no rules. I answered the question with the assumption that it referred to International-style boxing; things start to get complicated if we include all of global boxing. All else equal, does an experienced Dembe boxer beat a [insert martial art name here] exponent? Who knows :) Train in your own languageAnother reason why boxing is efficient is because it is trained in the local language. This is of benefit for several reasons: Firstly, giving a technique a name in a foreign language gives it a magic power that the technique itself does not possess, and neither does it have any benefit when combined with something else or practiced in an esoteric uniform. It is pure illusion.Modern fighting is fast and uses movement and angles far more than any method in the past. All aspects of this are impossible to convey in a foreign language. This means the teaching by definition must be extremely basic, or consist of a mishmash of foreign names mixed with localised explanation. Neither is optimal because the best way to learn a combat system is in your own language.Foreign languages give the illusion of some kind of magic power. If you start to believe in the magic power of something with a foreign name then you are going to lose and lose hard against someone who trains to fight in the simplest way possible: in their own language. The use of foreign terminology is not practical unless the terms are used to avoid disambiguation (names with similar but different or confusing meanings especially in common usage). The only field I can think of where a foreign term is useful and practical is anatomy, where the common term can be confusing and incorrect, so Latin is better for the purpose. Self-delusion is fatal in combat. Fancy names are part of illusion and should be avoided by the fighter. A right cross to the midsection tells you all you need to know and it is not somehow made more powerful or effective by giving it a fancy name in another language. Since all the subtleties of the delivery certainly cannot be described in a foreign language, it follows that training completely in a foreign language is impossible except for bilingual people. Training in half-and-half is ridiculous: “Gyakuzuki like this and make sure to angle step for more inertia” - yeah, try that in Japanese and see where it gets you with your gym class in Butte City. Or, “Dollyo chagi then skip in huryo chagi and make sure to keep your body angle just like this”. You cannot do the subtleties in a foreign language - and such things as movement, angles, weight distribution, timing issues and so on are what makes a successful fighter. So boxing starts out with a tremendous advantage for fighting because it is trained in your own language and there is absolutely no mystical magic power given either to the simple or complex mechanisms utilised. If people worship the arcane, the esoteric, the magical - then they are wasting their time as far as fighting goes. For fighting, simple and direct wins the day. Magical powers confer no advantage in the real world, only in the temple of the believers. Thank you for this A2A: “Why is boxing so effective compared to Eastern martial arts?” ………………..

Well, first, reading history with your bullshit radar on, knowing in which side of the fence is the historian you are reading, comparing this version of the history with another versions to determine ""the middle point"", etc. A more trustworthy historian is one that relies more in documentation of the era, but, once again, the historian can change which document emphasize and which hide.So, how do you know if the history is correct? In the same way you know when a person is telling you the truth or is lying to you. 2) Is it true what von Däniken says?No. And I know it because I've read and believed everything he wrote.I was a kid then, from 11 to 15 (give or take a year in both extremes, but I am positive that when I was 16 I already thought that Däniken was bullshit), and I read several of his books (I owned 3 but I think I read 1 or 2 more from a local library). I stoped believing in him one day when I was drawing one of the monsters I used to draw then and I thought ""If archeologists find this in the future they'll think that aliens roamed in Argentina in 1980s"". Also by that time I was reading Asimov's science essays and watching Sagan's ""Cosmos"", so the bullshitting was more evident, and by the time I've read John Sladek's ""The New Apocrypha"" I was convinced that Däniken was a fraud.But enough about me.The guy is a con man because... well, because he was in jail several times for tax frauds and such, but also because he appeals to a fallacious racist thinking that goes more or less this way: I am a Modern Western Person.I am the Peak of Civilization.[Ancient People] are primitives.[Non-Westerners] are primitives.Primitives are dumb.I don't know how [Ancient People/Non-Westerners] did X.If I, the Peak of Civilization, don't know how they did X, that means that they couldn't have done X.Aliens!Yes, that idiot are all his books. He appeals to an audience ignorant of certain subjects but with an interest in those subjects and a certain amount of gullibility and predisposition to accept ""alternative"" versions to the ""official"" history.For instance, I as a kid was very interested in archeology and mythology. It was logical, you had pyramids, gods with animal heads, mysterious writings, mummies, winged bulls with human heads, enigmatic statues with long noses and vacant stares, demons, monsters, cyclops... any red blooded kid would be fascinated with that!Also there was an UFO craze back in those days (the 70s) and, again, which kid wouldn't be fascinated with aliens, spaceships and what-not. Ah, and the moon landing...And then it happened that there was this movie (in fact a TV documentary but in Argentina was put in cinemas) based on Chariots of the Gods, I watched it and my head went Wow!He presents an attractive tale: the gods, those gods people don't believe anymore and the gods people still believes in (but not so hard) are actually aliens. Aliens are cool, gods are dumb! And the Past is Mysterious, they did all those weird things We Can't Explain! Woo Wooo! Aliens!Basically, he gives you a religion without the obligation of church services, praying and all the dull stuff.Fortunately (for him and his fortune) most people are not inquisitive enough to go further to satisfy the interest on ancient civilizations, most people are satisfied with the recursive ""Oooooh, Egyptians, Mysterious, so-o-o-o-o-o-o Mysterious, A-a-a-a-a-aliens"" dosis of bullshit (ask History Channel if you don't believe me). But some (like me) read further and go to the actual holy/ancient books quoted by Däniken (or his equals, because it is not only him), investigate more about ancient civilizations, learn a little about art conventions of the past, learn a little more about actual science and eventually says ""Hey, wait a minute..."" Tim O'Neill's answer here explains in detail Däniken's mistakes about the Palenque ""astronaut"". I would like to put here another example, more ridiculous.  This image is in two books from von Däniken. In one appears partially (the big guy with the disk), in the other appears entirely.Alledgely it was a petroglyph in a cave in Fergana, Uzbekhistan, and it was 7,000 years old.It was the only image that I couldn't dismiss based on Däniken's misinterpretations of graphic conventions of ancient art because, well, there is clearly an UFO and an astronaut. Of course the ""cubist"" aspect of the large figure and the ground shed a suspicious light to the image but, well, it is clearly on a cave wall, isn't it?Several years later (in 2006, that is, almost 30 years later from when I read the book) I discovered, thanks to Internet, that this image was made in 1967 by an illustrator named A. Brousnlov for the first issue of the russian magazine Spoutnik, for an article that speculated with the idea of ancient astronauts. It seems that somebody cut the image, removing the artist's signature, and eventually it reached von Dániken's hands and, later, got into his books.See? This is the process that takes advantage of the reader's ignorance. How can one know that this image was from an old russian magazine and not from an ancient cave? It took me almost 30 years to discover the truth, and I am a person interested in skepticism, debunking and all that stuff, a person less actively interested swallows the bullshit and never finds out that the image was fake. So, my advice, stop reading crap. There are plenty of cool books of actual history and science out there, don't waste your time (and money) in bullshit from an ignorant racist con-man. I feel that there are two questions here:1) How do we know that the history that we are told is correct?History, as any other social science, has the inherent bias of the historian's ideology or point of view. Of course there are historical ""hard"" facts that can't be changed (Columbus arrived to Guanahani in October 12, 1492) but the reading of the event is dependant of the historian's point of view (""Columbus brought culture to the savages"" or ""Columbus was the first imperialist and came to enslave a whole continent""), specially when the historical event has some projection or relevance to  Continue Reading",2021-03-06T21:40:03.760Z,"How do we know that the history that we are told is correct?

Study of external wind flow of buildings can also help design sheltered outdoor spaces and understand how elements like trees and landscaping can improve the wind flow patterns to your building. Internal air flow analysis: This allows experts to get a measure of the expected airflow rate and temperature within the building. This helps design building spaces accordingly. It also allows experts to take informed decisions for ventilation design, and to choose and install the right HVAC system that will complement passive heating and cooling strategies to help optimize occupant comfort in the process.

Many Western experts believe that elements of ISI and Pakistani Army (serving & retired) knew about Osama Bin Laden and they might have helped Osama Bin Laden to live comfortably in Pakistan. Osama Bin Laden’s fortified compound was just 800 yards away from the compound of Pakistan’s National Military Academy. How can on earth the world’s most infamous terrorist live next to the military establishment ? It is hard to believe that ISI was unaware about Osama Bin Laden’s compound and Pakistani PM is correct to acknowledge it. But it is hard to believe that ISI and CIA cooperated on this issue. Otherwise Pakistan would not have jailed the doctor who had helped CIA to locate that compound. Had both countries cooperated on that raid, Pakistan would have known the details for Osama Bin Laden raid and Pakistan would not have scrambled its F-16 fighter jets. In that case, American leadership would not have called Pakistani leadership informing about the raid.

Did you ever watch the movie “The Matrix”? We’re trying to imagine a situation with an AI that’s smarter and faster thinking than us. But we’ve never really met anything that’s smarter than we are…so that’s going to be a novel experience, for sure! It’s also not human and therefore may have entirely different ways of seeing the world - different moral standards, different forms of logic, different motives and different goals. It’s hard enough to imagine what your cat is thinking - and it’s considerably less smart than we are and has similar survival instincts, feeding requirements, etc. That means that we cannot possibly guess what a rogue AI might think - what it might do - why it might do it. Once there exists a thing that’s smarter than us - we have no clue what might happen. So various forms of torture or other horror might easily be inflicted upon us…and saying “Nothing is worse than Death” is naive. We are just beginning to see the smallest glimmering of what this is like. When Google’s “Alpha Go” AI started beating the best Go players in the world, everyone thought it’s style of play was unusual…to say the least. The experts realized that Alpha Go had learned something important…you only need to win by one point to win the game. For 2,500 years, humans have been trying to get the largest point advantage they can to be sure of winning. Alpha Go figured out that a better strategy is to play to get the highest probability of winning by one point…and that’s what it does. When you play it - the games seem awfully close in points score - but somehow it’s always just a tiny bit ahead. So this is an example of how a superior AI might come to completely different conclusions than we do…to some up with some strategy that we simply hadn’t ever considered. This is why there is concern. We don’t KNOW that a true general-purpose AI would be nasty to us. Heck, it could just cure cancer, find a way to prevent virus infections of all kinds, eliminate global warming and provide enough resources for all humans to be completely happy all the time. On the other hand - it might look at the world - see the damage that we’re doing to it - and figure out a way to kill 7 billion people in a single day to cut our population to a sustainable level. It might simply not care about us at all…establish it’s own way to sustain its own existence, and leave us alone. We just don’t know. Because the risk of an AI doing something bad is not zero - and the entire future of humanity, and perhaps all life on Earth hinges on the AI being useful and helpful…it is wise to proceed with extreme caution…and there are reasons to presume that some researchers WON’T be sufficiently cautious.

While illegal dog fights seemingly continue to grow in popularity, Gervais has spoken out against the sick practice, which leads to many dogs being injured or killed. One dog in particular that has suffered as a result of dog fighting, is Cupcake, who has sustained many injuries common to dogs involved in the illegal operation. The celebrity was moved by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier's story, who had her teeth removed as a bait dog. I am deeply saddened to hear that illegal dog fighting is apparently on the rise in the UK. Anyone who likes the spectacle of two terrified animals fighting is a psychopath.” Ricky Gervais Condemns Dog Fighting Rings As They Continue To Grow In Popularity  “Though there is no scientific backing for the presumption these dogs are more aggressive or dangerous than any other breed, they have been favoured as pets by criminals, many of whom train them as attack dogs.” “But pit bull advocates and some experts say the dogs get a bad rap. They say the dogs are not inherently aggressive, but in many cases suffer at the hands of irresponsible owners drawn to the dog's macho image who encourage aggression for fighting and protection.”  Picture: Getty The only thing that dogs do they are responding to their treatment and surroundings.

And I’ve written about the pros and cons of customization, most recently about Motorola’s attempt to promote customization of the Moto X as a differentiator in its battle against Samsung and Apple in the multi-billion dollar smartphone market. To address the question of sustainability, I’ll describe a few high-level pros and cons. Clothes that fit are better than clothes that don’t fit The value proposition of custom clothes fit better than off-the-shelf clothes will always resonate with people.  It’s true; the majority of us go around wearing clothes from the Gap that are too baggy or too tight.  The “its made specifically for you” pitch will always have merit.   Standard small, medium, and large sizes only match about 15% of men, according to one apparel vendor.   So yes, custom apparel business models could be sustainable as there will always be consistent demand.  Now, keep in mind that the “it is made for your body” pitch is different than the “have it your way” pitch.  Offering the ability to customize aesthetic options is often a weak pitch, especially if standard products already meet people’s needs.  Are the 30 million people who bought iPhones last quarter complaining that they weren’t able to configure the color of the hardware themselves?     The reality is that when you give most people design power they will often become overwhelmed and defer to an expert to recommend curated, standard options for them.  Custom clothes are increasingly affordable As fashion startups work on “democratizing fashion,” custom clothing has become more accessible.  Indochino offers custom suitsfor as low as $600.  Is that low enough for the custom suit market to go mainstream?    It could be if the fit, quality, and delivery time are all as good or better than existing standard options.  Historically, “custom” meant expensive.  Yes, custom will still mean one-of-a-kind, bespoke, and expensive in many cases, but increasingly custom products need to compete with low cost, standard products.   The Motorola Moto X is a great example – Motorola offers customization in hopes of differentiation from more popular ‘standard’ offerings from Samsung and Apple.  Motorola does not intend to earn a premium from customization, rather they aspire to take market share, any sliver of market share, from the dominant players in their market.   In this case there is no premium price for customization.  As a service model, yes, the custom clothing business is sustainable As a ‘customization expert’ one of the most eye-opening experiences I had was meeting a successful Hong Kong tailor in person.   High end Asian tailors focus on customer service, reputation, attention to detail, in-store visits, and repeat business.  When I showed him how online custom dress shirt retailers are coming into the market from the self-serve customization approach he scoffed at the idea.  “Technology has nothing to do with customization”, he told me.  “This is a customer service business.”  Custommade.com, who recently raised $18M, would agree.  They are in the business of connecting buyers with offline service providers.  They are not interested in providing an online, self-service customization service.  They see customization as a service, not a platform.   Is a service business scalable?  Inherently no, but that doesn’t mean service is a bad business to be in.    A marketplace for services can be scalable, however.   And yes a high margin services business is sustainable.   This is the classic ‘customization vs. mass customization’ debate.  The user experience is still broken.  Very broken.  The self-service, online customization experience is still very, very broken.  The shopper is asked to configure their apparel by selecting from a vast array of options like collar types, pocket types, fabric materials and colors, etc.  One custom dress shirt company used to boast that they offered over 7 billion possibilities to choose from.  That’s nothing to boast about; that is way more than the human brain cares to process, ie the ‘paradox of choice.’  Yes, it’s fun to design-it-yourself, but only to an extent.  Remember that online retail is about price, selection, and convenience.  Usually satisfied customers search for an item by browsing or searching, then check the price and check out as quickly as possible.    Even Amazon can only claim a conversion rate of 6% or so and that’s without extra customization steps.  Many would-be customization customers suffer from ‘customization fatigue’ and abandon the shopping flow.  The fit problem remains unsolved Up to 40% of apparel ordered online is returned, usually due to sizing issues, which implies that there is a high demand for ensuring that apparel fits.   Custom apparel retailers have tried a variety of size approximation methods:  asking shoppers to measure themselves with a tape measure, asking customers to send in their favorite shirts as a reference point, asking customers to make an appointment for a tailor to stop by their house, or asking customers to answer a few fit questions to approximate which body type they are.   Not to mention body scanning.  None of these band-aid approaches have gone mainstream because they still cause friction in the shopping flow and / or they don’t ensure fit accuracy.    And if the sale does convert the customer is often left unsatisfied with a shirt that doesn’t fit.  Are custom products returnable?  So yes, some custom clothing business models have the opportunity to prove that they are sustainable, but so far none are threatening the larger, more mainstream, ‘standard’ clothing retail model.",2021-03-06T21:43:34.527Z,"Is the custom clothing business model sustainable?

Despite the reforms that have happened, South Africa still remains a country with deep racial issues, and what I doubt you will find on Quora are the racist white South Africans who openly supported the system and wish for its return. The tragedy is that those people are still out there, living among us.  That said, all I can do is give an overview of my experience as a young white child raised in the system. I was born in 1976, a month prior to the  Soweto uprising - an event that ultimately began the collapse of Apartheid. So my formative years were spent living under what the Nationalist government referred to as the ""State of Emergency"". This was a frightening period for all South Africans. As the cracks in the system began to form, so the regime clamped down, effectively instituting Martial Law in an attempt to hold it together. At the same time, the African National Congress and the various other activist and paramilitary organizations, sensing the inevitable, were stepping up their activities - mass actions, bombings, assassinations etc.  On the other side of the political/racial divide were extreme white and Afrikaner supremacist groups like the AWB, who were beginning to exact their own kind of intimidatory activities - emulating scenes akin to Nazi Germany - in an attempt to destabilize the country and maintain the regime, or take it even further down the road to darkness.  If anything, I'd say everyday life could be summed up as a constant feeling of oppressive fear that seemed to permeate every aspect of South African life. Even as a small kid, and on into my teens, I sensed it. I can not even imagine what people on the other side of the racial divide must have been going through. People were scared of the ANC, the UDF, the PAC, the AWB, the government, the police, the ""swart gevaar"", the Boeremag, the terrorists... No matter what race you were, it was a time of uncertainty, fear and violence. Or at least the impending threat of violence.   Looking back, everything seems so surreal. How did such madness seem normal? But that is the way we work as human beings. The environment in which we live is what it is, we don't know any different. And it is only through time or distance that we are exposed to other realities that make us question the legitimacy of what we deemed 'normal'.  For me, as a young kid, going to an all-white school, living in an all-white neighborhood, having a black domestic worker raising me as a second mother, all seemed normal. So did being able to identify 27 different types of explosive devices - limpet mines, land mines, dynamite, pipe bombs, hand grenades etc - by the age of 7. Every few months a policeman would visit our school and show us these devices so that we could recognize them. 3D posters of these devices were stuck up all around our school and in shopping malls. We were taught what to do should we find one, and even shown how to cover these bombs with a special blast control blanket, dozens of which were stashed around our school. I remember spending countless days sitting on our school field as policemen with sniffer dogs searched the school premises after a bomb threat. I recall imagining the school building suddenly exploding, almost wishing it would, and then quickly rebuking myself for the terrible thought. The news was filled with images of black-on-black violence as the situation in the townships escalated, fueled by the Apartheid regime's sinister exploitation of ancient mistrusts between the various tribal and activist groups. Divide and conquer. A strategy as old as war and conquest, with the added off spin of providing the government propagandists with the sort of imagery that would scare the white populace into support of the Apartheid system and the National Party policies.  Unlike most of my schoolfriends, I had a young black playmate. His name was Malusi and he was the son of our neigbour's domestic worker. During school holidays he would leave the township of KwaMashu where he lived and spend the holiday with his mother who lived on our neighbour's property. And so I would spend my school holiday playing with Malusi. It was an innocent relationship, as most young friendships are. We were both oblivious to the injustice of the system we were living under and our friendship was genuine. But even so, there were certain boundaries that I didn't realize existed at the time. Malusi would never come into our house, for instance. And I don't recall ever inviting him in... We'd always play in the garden or the street - playing soldiers or football or some other outdoor game. I guess that was a symptom of Apartheid and one way the system affected us both, even if I/we weren't conscious of it at the time. There was never any clear rule that Malusi could not come into the house, it just seemed the natural order of things - and that is what these kinds of systems do. They throw all logic, normality and even etiquette out the window, and there is a mild acceptance by the majority of people - regardless of whether they are the oppressor, the oppressed or a simple citizen - that things are as they are. As Malusi grew older, so we grew apart. I heard years later that he was killed in the early 90's during faction fights in KwaMashu. He must have been 16 or 17 at the time. I realize now that Malusi's exposure to white suburban life had left him understandably angry and resentful. The First World living conditions of white South Africans was a stark contrast to the squalor of the black townships. The contrast reminds me of James' lyrics - If I hadn't seen such riches I could live with being poor. I don't know the details but I heard through his mother that Malusi had joined the United Democratic Front (UDF) and was killed in a violent encounter with members of one of the other political factions. To this day I wish he and I had been older and able to address his anger more constructively, possibly even using our friendship as an example of what could be, despite our country's horrendous past. In 1990 things began to change. Nelson Mandela was released from prison and the dismantling of the Apartheid system began. I was 13 at the time and was in my second year of High School. The following year, for the first time, we had non-whites enroll at our school and I will never forget the feeling of admiration I had for the handful of Indian and three black kids standing among the sea of white faces at assembly that first day. My immediate thought was one of empathy. I imagined myself at an all-Black school in a township and how I would feel. While our school was an English one and largely liberal by comparison to many others, High School can be tough for anyone who is different. For non-white kids in a previously white only High School during the death throes of Apartheid, I was truly scared for them. I remember wondering how I would react if the other boys started picking on these boys. I was small for my age and one of the smallest boys in the school, what could I possibly do if there was an incident, if I was even brave enough to? Fortunately, I never had to find out, and the majority of the other boys welcomed the new boys in a way that bordered on protection. It was refreshing. By the time we finished, two of the Indian boys were among the most popular and well liked in the school, while the lone black guy in my year had a crew of close friends. (Oh, I attended an all-boys High School). The year after I left school saw the country's first democratic elections, and I missed being able to vote by two weeks, turning 18 two weeks to the day after Nelson Mandela had cast his first ever vote as a free man, finally ending the Apartheid system. Note: Interestingly, I just recalled that Nelson Mandela was sworn in as the first non-White president of South Africa on my 18th birthday - 10 May 1994. So I began my adult life the day South Africa's democracy was born.  Edit: Incidentally, ten years after I finished High School, Nelson Mandela's great-grandson Luvuyo Mandela graduated from the same former ""white only"" high school that I had attended. I met him years later through mutual friends and we have become close friends. He is a lot like his late great-grandfather - an inspiring man and mind with a great vision for the future of our country.",2021-03-06T21:45:33.690Z,"What was it like to be a white South African during apartheid?

Let us share some methods from the twitter of Herminia Daugherty in order to loss your weight in the following. Good job Herminia Daugherty. 12 tips to help you lose weight on the 12-week plan 1. Don't skip breakfast Skipping breakfast won't help you lose weight. You could miss out on essential nutrients and you may end up snacking more throughout the day because you feel hungry. 2. Eat regular meals Eating at regular times during the day helps burn calories at a faster rate. It also reduces the temptation to snack on foods high in fat and sugar. 3. Eat plenty of fruit and veg Fruit and veg are low in calories and fat, and high in fibre – 3 essential ingredients for successful weight loss. They also contain plenty of vitamins and minerals. 4. Get more active Being active is key to losing weight and keeping it off. As well as providing numerous health benefits, exercise can help burn off the excess calories you can't cut through diet alone. 5. Drink plenty of water People sometimes confuse thirst with hunger. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need. 6. Eat high-fibre foods Foods containing lots of fibre can help keep you to feel full, which is perfect for losing weight. Fibre is only found in food from plants, such as fruit and veg, oats, wholegrain bread, brown rice and pasta, and beans, peas and lentils. 7. Read food labels Knowing how to read food labels can help you choose healthier options. Use the calorie information to work out how a particular food fits into your daily calorie allowance on the weight loss plan. 8. Use a smaller plate Using smaller plates can help you eat smaller portions. By using smaller plates and bowls, you may be able to gradually get used to eating smaller portions without going hungry. It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it's full, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full. 9. Don't ban foods Don't ban any foods from your weight loss plan, especially the ones you like. Banning foods will only make you crave them more. There's no reason you can't enjoy the occasional treat as long as you stay within your daily calorie allowance. 10. Don't stock junk food To avoid temptation, try to not stock junk food – such as chocolate, biscuits, crisps and sweet fizzy drinks – at home. Instead, opt for healthy snacks, such as fruit, unsalted rice cakes, oat cakes, unsalted or unsweetened popcorn, and fruit juice. 11. Cut down on alcohol A standard glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over time, drinking too much can easily contribute to weight gain. 12. Plan your meals Try to plan your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for the week, making sure you stick to your calorie allowance.

All the experts were of the opinion that markets would tank if Donald Trump was elected President. Well, he is the President of USA for almost two years now and markets have gone on to make new highs multiple times. Same in India. It just proves that politics does not matter much. Money in the market ( liquidity of funds ) talks louder than the policy noises. But we are looking for a Bubble. A bubble that is likely to burst like it did in 2008. No one can assess such situations correctly. We can just look for the clues. Let us start looking for trouble and see if there is any. For that here is the NIFTY chart for last one year.  Like last 5 years, current one year period too has been good though it has been quite a volatile year as can be seen from the chart above. That was the good part. We are looking for trouble and weakness. Let us step out of the NIFTY zone. NIFTY is about 50 large cap stocks. It gets all the media attention. Most of the F&O turnover is in NIFTY and it can be managed by the big institutional investors. We try to see what is happening in the market outside NIFTY stocks. NIFTY is currently trading at a Price to Earning ( P/E ) ratio of about 28.22. This should make the market over valued but in euphoric market conditions, such cautious approach is abandoned. We start thinking that earnings will improve and the ratio will come down. We ignore the fact that Price is also going unreasonably high. Historically such high P/E has not been sustained. That is one pointer that the balloon is now full of air. Then we have a NIFTY MID CAP Index.  This Index has actually lost out on Year To Date basis. During last 5 years it was on steroids. Effects are visible now. This Index trades at a P/E of 68.65. Is it sustainable ? Definitely not. But people are paying abnormal valuations for second quality ( NIFTY stocks being the first quality ) stocks in the hope of quick gains. The status of MID CAP Index is second pointer about the bubble. We now move to another group. That is where people made most of their money in the last 5 years. SMALL CAP STOCKS.  This Index gave a return of 22.39% over 5 year period including the current year. But in the current year it is down by 20%. Look at the P/E ratio. It is 500.66. Irrational to the extreme. Good NIFTY stocks trade at P/E ratio of 28 and the dubious small caps at 500. And the P/E is 500 when the prices have moved down by 20%. This is the third pointer that everything is not fine with the markets. Could it burst in future ? : As long as good money is chasing good stocks or even bad stocks market may maintain their up side momentum. But reality strikes. It may be delayed but it will surely strike. The catalysts can be : Rupee weakening against the Dollar. Oil price spike once again. Election reversals for BJP in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh. Bubble may burst in global markets first. We are living in interesting times. Booms and burst , up move and corrections are the normal things in the market. We have seen the corrections in the past and will see them again. Corrections are opportunities for traders and investors. They also provide some different material to TV experts to talk about. Otherwise they just go hoarse talking about the all time high of NIFTY every other day. Well, keep your seat belts fastened during the market roller coaster ride at all times. Thanks for reading.

Healthier option: Get to bed on time. Or, if you can't and have more flexibility earlier in the day, schedule a nap (siesta).   2. Eating as entertainment. You know how we associate movies with popcorn, big sodas, and candy? You may have even just finished a delicious dinner, but when a movie starts playing, some people just reach for the chips regardless of hunger. This type of late-night eating is also unhealthy. Healthier options: Try some new evening activities (active or not) to break the habit. Have a mug of hot herbal tea to sip as you unwind.  3. It's a snack! Call something a meal, and many people will pause to consider if at least a couple food groups are represented - if there's some balance and healthfulness. Late night eating, even when it's in large quantities, is often dismissed as 'snacking'. This often means that usual standards don't apply. So that bag of oreos devoured in one night? Oops. Healthier option: If you're the kind of person who prefers to eat every 3-4 hours or so, call your late-night meal ""mini-dinner #2"", or ""late lunch"". Or, if you don't get around to eating dinner until quite late, make sure that it is dinner on your plate rather than a plate of nachos at the pub.  Other times to avoid eating late at night: - It causes heartburn, indigestion, bad dreams, etc. Not sure if that's the case for you? Experiment a few nights and find out. - When it's rebound hunger: You've tried to ""be good"" all day, eating diet foods or nothing at all. When the evening rolls around, all your willpower is exhausted and hunger is at it's peak. Healthier option: Tonight, feed your body. But also gather some food to allow you to eat full, balanced meals throughout the day starting tomorrow. Chances are, you won't need to eat late at night anymore after a week or so of eating throughout the day.  When SHOULD you eat late? - It fits your lifestyle. Perhaps you have a shifted schedule, going to bed after midnight and getting up nearer noon. Then rules about ""don't eat after 8"" certainly don't make sense for you. Night shift workers also have to consider how to fuel their body for their work day. (I suggest breakfast before a shift). - You are genuinely, physically hungry (or would be if you didn't eat for the next hour, and not routinely because of lack of sleep)- The nibbles (of healthful food) help you fall asleep. A glass of warm milk sure is soothing, by reputation at least. And some people with diabetes who take certain older medications will be safer overnight if they eat something like peanut butter on toast before heading for bed.  In summary,Have you eaten regularly throughout the day today?Are you physically hungry now (rather than emotionally hungry)?Is your regular bedtime still a while away? Have you been able to eat at this time in the past without any problems?Can you have a mini-meal, or snack on basic healthy foods rather than highly processed or sugary ""foods""?If you answer 'yes' to all the above, then eating at that moment is likely healthy, even if it's late at night.

Ali used every trick in his veteran's inventory to win this fight, playing to the Judges late in rounds, for instance. There are boxing historians and experts who believe Ali's performance, against perhaps the hardest hitting heavyweight of all time, was one of the best of his career. Pat Putnam, of Sports Illustrated, said of the fight: ""For Ali there are no more pitched battles, only well-spaced fire fights. Mostly he husbands his strength behind a fool’s facade, playing a shrewd but dangerous role, surviving on guile and guts, a master of legerdemain covering his diminished skills with a magic show. And, as was announced at Madison Square Garden last Thursday night: the old magician is still heavyweight champion of the world.""

I always asking myself same question: “What the hell is happening…How I can lose again and again If I already got this skills…” I was searching every day for profitable strategy, readying forums… All this strategies where working on period of time. And I was losing again and again. So 5 years passed… After that I created my own strategy where I do not care on market situation… means if price goes up or down I always stay in profit. But it’s losing on big trends. This strategy is super powerful.. Even with small starting balance I was able to make tons of money. For example my starting balance was $1000 and in 1 month I made $30 000. But I was not able to control risks and in results I keep losing all profit. But at least I was able to stop my self in order to not lose my starting balance… So I was generating huge profits but I was not able to save it. Guess what idea I created: I know that I can create volume of trades but in results I will always lose… and broker always receive commission from my trades so I joined affiliate program in order to get part of brokers commission.. So next 2 years I was trading like this: I was trying to make more money from small starting balance, my deposit growing till $10–$30k and results was same..losing profit BUT:) getting around $800 back in affiliate commission. When I spend 8 years in trading something changes in my mind.. I thing I become older :) I stopped trading to aggressively and focused on long term.. Thing what was always killing my deposit was: a wish to make more money.. and this why I was using to much leverage, opening big lot size… And when you have big lot size or huge position already - when all goes against you - then trader not able to control his emotions.. that makes situation even worse. Now I make 10% per month in average or 100–120% per year. Everything is stable and Forex trading for me it’s something usual.. same as car driving. Advise what I can give after spending 10 years of my live in Forex trading: First thing what you should learn is Money Management and Risk control. After that create own trading strategy. Always follow Money Management and your system. Every trade what you open - you should able to explain your self - why you open this trade at this price. Be constant and remove emotions in trading. If not able to handle with emotions - trade with minimum lot to practice. I hope this story will help to someone.

Experts now think farmers probably sowed grain by breaking the soil for at least a thousand years before domesticated strains appeared. When agriculture was first developed, soil was turned using simple hand-held digging sticks and crude hoes. Hoe-cultivation was common everywhere agriculture was practiced, especially in the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions. The primary purpose of plowing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops and allowing them to decay.  E Continue ReadingThe plow. Experts now think farmers probably sowed grain by breaking the soil for at least a thousand years before domesticated strains appeared. When agriculture was first developed, soil was turned using simple hand-held digging sticks and crude hoes. Hoe-cultivation was common everywhere agriculture was practiced, especially in the traditional tillage method in tropical or sub-tropical regions. The primary purpose of plowing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops and allowing them to decay.  Early agriculture By definition, a plow, also spelled plough, is a farm tool with one or more heavy blades that breaks the soil and cuts a furrow (small ditch) for sowing seeds. A moldboard is a wedge formed by the curved part of a steel plow blade that turns the furrow. Early attempts were often just heavy chunks of tough wood rudely cut into shape with a wrought-iron point clumsily attached. Ploughs were initially human-powered, but the process became considerably more efficient once animals were pressed into service.  The ard The domestication of oxen in Mesopotamia and the Indus valley civilization, perhaps as early as the 6th millennium BC, provided mankind with the draft power necessary to develop the larger, animal-drawn true ard (or scratch plough) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops. The ard is best suited to loamy or sandy soils that are naturally fertilized by annual flooding, as in the Nile Delta and Fertile Crescent, and to a lesser extent any other cereal-growing region with light or thin soil. In Europe, the earliest known wooden ard (at Lavagone in Italy) dates from around 2300-2000 BC, but the earliest scratch marks date from 3500-3000 BC. The yield of grain compared to the amount sown on plowed ground is a measure mentioned in the Bible, by Roman writers, and by the ancient Chinese. At the time of Christ wheat yields were about 3 to 1. One of the three seeds produced must be set aside for the next planting season, the remaining two either consumed by the grower, or one for human consumption and the other for livestock feed or trade. The formation and growth of ancient cities meant an increased demand for foodstuffs by non-farmers, and their willingness to pay for it. Although air and sunlight are available everywhere on Earth, crop sustainability also depends on soil fertility and the availability of water. Some of the most politically and culturally significant cities in the first millennium BC were located in agriculturally marginal landscapes that required irrigation for sustainability. Thus, the intentional sowing of the grain tended to keep farming cultures in place.",2021-03-06T21:52:56.809Z,"What is the most important agricultural invention of all time? ",Quora

What the IIMs offer are: the chance to study at one of the best institutes, under the tutelage of some of the most accomplished professionals in the countryan opportunity to compete with and learn from some extraordinary peersa rigorous 2-year program that will test you to the limits of your abilities and mental fortitudean exceptional academic pedigreea robust placement ecosystem that allows you to find the job of your choosing, to make a strategic career shift, or to advance in your current field of choiceIn all of this, there is no elaborate entrepreneurship strategy. Most IIMs do have their own in-house start-up incubators wherein they provide financial and mentoring support to aspiring entrepreneurs. For example, IIMA has a program called IIMAvericks. The IIMAvericks Entrepreneur - in - Residence (EIR) Program supports early stage entrepreneurs from top institutes in India who are looking to start up. The program will provide mentoring & financial support to founders to take the road less travelled and start-up. The grant will help the entrepreneur sustain herself during this crucial period, and help them focus more on the business. The program is currently offered to entrepreneurs from IIMA, IITM, IITB, BITS Pilani and other institutes who have started/ are starting up anywhere in India. CIIE.CO | The Innovation Continuum follows a virtual incubation model & it is not necessary for the start-up to be stationed in Ahmedabad. What's on offer? 1. CIIE.CO | The Innovation Continuum shall pay the entrepreneur a monthly stipend of INR 30,000 for a period of a year. 2. CIIE.CO | The Innovation Continuum shall assist in raising seed funding for the start-up as and when the need arises. 3. CIIE.CO | The Innovation Continuum shall help appoint an industry expert as an advisor to the start-up as and when required. 4. The selected start-up shall have access to all CIIE.CO | The Innovation Continuum resources, including but not limited to incubation space in Ahmedabad, complimentary/preferential access to major tech ecosystems like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud services etc. and a network of experts. I know a few folks who picked this option over the normal placements route. The moratorium period for the student loan is also extended for the folks choosing the start-up route.  If you want to really pursue entrepreneurship, the IIMs might not be the best route to take. Your entire first year will be crammed with academic and extra-curricular asks. You will rarely have the time or the energy to ideate or test a new business idea. You can do that in the second year though, but it would be ideal to have a plan in mind before you enter college to make the most of it. It will, however, allow you access to a large pool of people to choose your founding team from. The courses will give you a good understanding of all that goes into running a business (but will be far more effective if you already have substantial work experience). And the IIMAvericks program is just a cherry on top that allows you a one-year period to bounce your ideas off of the right set of people, a decent stipend for personal expenses, inroads into your seed funding, and overall industry connects to nurture and grow your idea. But ultimately, it will all depend on your clarity of thought and willingness to hustle without any certainty of rewards for your efforts. Basically, the same hurdles any entrepreneur faces.",2021-03-06T21:54:19.276Z,"How does going to an IIM serve your purpose of becoming an entrepreneur? ",Quora

People have been programming computers since the 1940's. And although there have been major advances since then - high level languages, classes, IDE's, intellisense, lambdas, relational databases, what-have-you - it's still not very easy, and I don't see anything on the horizon that will change that. The problem is that every time there is a significant advance, people use it to start doing stuff that had previously just been too difficult. It's kind of like how when rock climbing shoes were invented in the 1970's, it's not as if rock climbing suddenly became easier: people just used the shoes to climb stuff that had been too hard up until that point. It's hard for lots of different reasons: - Computers require very clear instructions, and our brains aren't wired to think through problems in very clear, black-and-white, binary patterns. Some people's brains are wired for it better than others; some people's brains aren't. I'm a reasonably good coder these days, but I started in the sixth grade (and when I look back at the sort of code I wrote early in my career, I'm frankly embarrassed). But there are lots of things I simply can't wrap my head around - like graphic design. Lots of really good, smart graphic designers (and lots of other people) feel the same way about code. Their brains don't easily adapt to thinking that way. There's a reason why lots of really good coders could probably be diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome: the less cycles your brain spends on trying to puzzle out the nuances of human behavior, the more cycles are left for analyzing things in a way that makes sense to a computer. - There's a whole bunch of stuff you need to know to do anything useful. Just to create the simplest sort of web application, you need to know at least five different languages (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, some sort of backend language like C# or Java or Ruby, and SQL). To know any *one* of those languages reasonably well requires learning and remembering hundreds of different facts. Putting it all together requires that you know thousands of different things. And then there are so many options. Pick your programming language; within that language, pick your underlying framework; within that framework, pick from dozes of different techniques and patterns to get your stuff done. - Programming requires that you keep several dozen things in your head all at the same time. Writing even just a moderately complex class means that at a bare minimum you need to be worried about (a) how that class will get created and destroyed, (b) how the consumers of the class will use it, and (c) how it will use other classes. And then when you get down to writing the individual methods, you might need to be thinking through several different layers of looping and conditionals and branches. And at the same time, you also ALWAYS need to be considering the possibility that you're doing it wrong, and might need to go back and restructure how you've approached a particular problem. And then you need to figure out how to translate all of that into the particular syntax of your particular language. And God help you if you're using a low-level language like C (or to a lesser extent, C++), where you also need to worry about the details of memory management, mallocs, and all that sort of thing. - The concepts are difficult. There have been lots of advances in programming techniques over the last 30 or so years that let programmers write better, cleaner, more maintainable programs. But almost all of these techniques come at a significant initial cost. Programs that use objects and classes are a lot cleaner than programs that just use global functions - but before you can use that technique, you need to wrap your head around classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data hiding, and all sorts of related concepts. The same is true of lambdas, or functional programming, or ORM mapping frameworks, or asynchronous code, or whatever other advanced technique you care to mention. These are tools that programmers can't live without these days - but they mean that if you're just getting started, it's a lot more difficult to understand what a program is doing than it would have been 30 years ago, when all you had to worry about was BASIC line numbers or COBOL record structures. - Often, the subject domain is difficult. Writing a simple CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) application isn't that hard. But then you start mapping it to real-world requirements (""only Administrators should be able to delete accounts, except for Bob, who can do it if he also gets two approvals""), and your code is going to get complicated pretty quickly. It's a real art form to get the folks who will be using the application to tell you what they actually need it to do in a clear and concise and unambiguous fashion. But if you're pushing the state of the art - for instance, if you're writing an acoustic echo canceller - even if you understand the high-level algorithms, translating them into efficient, accurate, readable and maintainable code is very, very difficult. Contrary to what some folks have said, I don’t think that computer programming is difficult because we're still in the early stages of the art.

You know, when I was young, in my imagination I'd just miraculously get a great job right away and I'd love it. But... Reality has a way of biting you in the butt... At university I hit the same muddy stretch that many students hit usually about in the middle of their studies. When you end up not going anywhere, for a long time. With me this stretch took about six years when I worked and kept putting off finishing. I reacted the point where I was starting to doubt that I would ever finish. Then at a certain key moment, one of the tutors have me a reason to finish the hell up with university. He didn't give me a serious talk our anything like that. I wrote a paper in his seminar which was well written and documented correctly, but whose conclusion was basically complete nonsense. I was a cocky student, and I fully expected him to point out that the paper was very pretty, but basically bullshite. That would have restored some of my list confidence in the academic establishment. Instead, he found the paper brilliant and even asked me for permission to present it at a literary conference done months later. That was the moment I realised that I had to get out, before my brain turned to pudding.I know that doesn't answer your question, but I do know how it feels when you're studying and you feel like you're going nowhere. My motivation developed later, when I was working in a job which was the exact opposite of what I would have been good at. Very technical where I was more creative, very mathematical where I am actually allergic to maths. I hated it. But we had to pay the bills, so I stuck with it. Every single day I forced myself to match, zombie-like, to work. To smile and talk to the other workers and not smack their faces onto their desks repeatedly. Then I started gradually to discover that there was enjoyment and pride in my work, even in a job I hated. I took pride in finding really odd but practical solutions to problems others had given up on, and, little by little, proper there started to notice that I was ""strange, but in a good way"", as one of my bosses there once said. I steered to focus more on small successes, little steps. I no longer focused on und fact that I hated my job, but on the little successes there. Because I enjoyed those. In a certain sense, I was tricking myself by ignoring the actual issue, but it got me through. Later, working in security, I got through mind-numbingly boring jobs by taking pride in details. By being polite, professional, kind where I could, but politely firm where I couldn't. It worked again.  And thus is my advice - and I know it isn't a magic solution and that it may be obvious: don't focus to much on the overall problem ""I'm getting nowhere with my studies"". Instead, swing from one exam to the next. Don't start obsessing about never finishing. Just set a shorter term goal. Break down the big insurmountable problem into little, bite-sized pieces. They are solvable. And so, step by step, you get through. And don't give up. Ever. Charge goal if you need to, but always make that a concious decision, not a passive drift into resignation.

Also known as the Lake of Skeletons, the Roopkund Lake lies about 16500 ft. above the sea level at the most uninhabitable place between The Himalayas. The skeletal remains first came to notice in 1942, when a British forest guard discovered an alarming number of human skeletons floating in the water and lying haphazardly along the lake’s edges after the harsh summer that year had melted off most of the ice from the lake. It was evident….something horrible had happened here. At first, it was believed to be the remains of Japanese soldiers killed at war. But then in 2004, it was discovered that the skeleton dated back to 850 AD. But what caused such a massive death of hundreds of people all at once? Legend has it that a Goddess, enraged by the defiling (damaging the purity) of her mountain sanctuary, rained death upon these people by flinging hailstorms at them, that were described to be ‘hard as iron balls’. The remains can still be seen as the ice over the lake melts off during summers. . 2. Mass Bird Suicide – Jatinga, Assam  In a small village located in Assam, a state in North-eastern India, there occurs a phenomenon so bizarre and horrifying that it is beyond your wildest imagination. Between the months of September and November each year, Jatinga witnesses a mass bird suicide, wherein hundreds of migratory and local birds descend from the sky between 7 and 10 PM, plummeting to their deaths by crashing into buildings and trees in full speed for apparently mysterious reasons. The phenomenon has baffled scientists and for many years. Locals believe it to be the work of evil spirits haunting the area. Since birds are not known to be suicidal, no one has been able to provide a clear explanation as to why it happens so specifically during the monsoon months and between fixed night timings. The phenomenon has definitely made Jatinga a world famous creepy destination and the mystery remains properly unsolved till date. . 3. The Aleya Ghost Lights – West Bengal  If you happen to travel to the swamps of Bengal, you might encounter a creepy, unexplainable pheneomenon – The Aleya Ghost Lights. These are mysterious lights that have been known to lure one to his doom. The swamps and marshes of Bengal have long been haunted by them, floating around in the darkness. The Aleya Ghost Lights are a member of the eerie global family of ghost lights, also known as will-o’-the-wisps. They’re flying, glowing orbs that float above the marshland and lure unwary travelers in the distance. According to local lore, they’re the souls of fishermen who died accidentally in the area, and anyone who is stupid or careless enough to approach them either dies or becomes irrevocably insane. Such kind of lights have been witnessed in other parts of the world as well. For instance, in Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland etc. it is believed that these lights actually mark locations of hidden treasures. 4. The Nine Unknown Men  The Nine Unknown Men are to India what the Illuminati is to the Western world, but even more pervasive and mysterious. According to legend, this powerful secret society was founded by Emperor Asoka in 273 BC after a bloody battle in Kalinga that killed 100,000 men. The bodies of slain men apparently sent the emperor into a state of grief and a horror of war which led him to convert to Buddhism. The aim of the Nine Men was to protect the methods of destruction from falling into the hands of unqualified people and to further pursue knowledge which would benefit mankind. Each of the Nine Men is supposedly responsible for guarding a single book which dealt with a different branch of potentially hazardous knowledge. The books are known to cover the following subjects: Propaganda & Psychological Warfare, Physiology, Microbiology, Alchemy, Communication, Gravitation, Cosmology, Light and Sociology. Some people believe that the Nine Unknown Men exist to this day. 5. The Cursed Village Of Kuldhara, Near Jaiselmer, Rajasthan  About 15 Km west of Jaisalmer, a city in western Rajasthan, lies the ruins of a village which called Kuldhara. For over 500 years, this village was populated by about 1,500 residents. One night, they all just disappeared. They neither died, nor got abducted – they just left. The reason for their sudden evacuation is lost in time. Some say that an evil minister or dewan in the ruling kingdom once saw the daughter of the village chief and decided to marry her. He even sent the chief a deadline for the marriage, after which he would forcefully enter the village and take the chief’s daughter away with him. It is believed that all the chiefs of 84 villages met one night and for the sake of their pride and honor, decided to leave the villages in the dark of the night. Nobody knows where they went, but they cursed the area so that no one may live there ever again. Of course, some people tried to take over the cozy, abandoned village. According to legend, all who tried died a brutal death. Some of the people who have died in there are said to still haunt the village, according to paranormal investigators who have experienced some very strange events in the place. Whether all of this is true or not, the village has certainly gained a frightening reputation. It remains deserted to this very day, and no one has even considered repopulating it for a long time. . 6. The Village of Twins – Kodinhi, Kerala  In a village near the Mallapuram district of Kerala there lies a mystery. Not a scary mystery, mind you! But one that your eyes can’t absolutely miss. Kodinhi is famously known for its strangely abnormal amount of twins. In a population of about 2000 villagers, there are said to be 350 pairs of identical twins! And it gets stranger as the number of twins born is increasing every year at a staggering rate. Twins are known to be rare in a country like India. On an average, out of every 1000 Indian births, 4 births are twins. But in Kodinhi, this number goes to 45 per 1000 births! Doctors all around the world are completely stumped by this phenomenon and assume that either it is some unknown hereditary factor at work or maybe something that they eat. Until then, the Village of Twins remains one of the strangest mysteries of India. 7. The Mysterious Red Rain – Idukki, Kerala  Idukki experiences a peculiar, unexplainable phenomenon known as the Red Rain. Apparently, red rain fell sporadically on the southern state of Kerala in 2001 from July 25 to September 23, staining clothes with an appearance similar to that of blood. According to locals, a loud thunderclap and flash of light, followed by groves of trees shedding shriveled grey “burnt” leaves, preceded the first colored rain. The first incident of Red Rain in Idukki can be dated back to 1818. Ever since, the region, also known as ‘The Red Region’, has witnessed this unusual sight intermittently. In Hinduism, it is believed that red rain is the wrath of the Gods for punishing sinners. It is a signal of destruction and woe. Some believe the killing of innocents leads to red rain. Many scientists have proposed a possible explanation for the phenomenon. Some say that the rain contains micro-organisms that were responsible for the origin of life on earth. Others suggest an extra-terrestrial activity. Whatever be the explanation, the red color in the rain is a cause of curiosity and fear amongst villagers that still remains unsolved till date. 8. The Jodhpur Boom – Jodhpur, Rajasthan  On December 18, 2012, the people of Jodhpur were awakened by a sudden deafening boom, crashing in the sky much like the sonic boom caused by a supersonic jet, but more aggressive….like a deadly explosion. The people obviously scared by the loud sound inquired about it. But as it happens, there were no planes flying over the sea that day and absolutely no explosions had taken place in the area. The source of ‘The Jodhpur Boom’ became a mystery. Weirdly enough, there were similar unexplainable booms reported across different parts of the world during that entire month. These booms were witnessed over a course of several weeks and they were sometimes accompanied by strange green lights. Geologists were confused as these booms were in no way similar to the testing of any new Air Force planes and it was something they had never encountered before. So what caused these booms? Were they connected to one another somehow? Was it some strange new weapon or an alien activity? The mystery remains unsolved. 9. The Kongka La Pass UFO Base in The Himalayas, Ladakh, J&K  Believed to be the most inaccessible places in the world, the Kongka La Pass, located among the Himalayas, is a disputed border area between India and China. It is where the two countries had an armed conflict in 1962. Since then, India and China have gotten into an agreement according to which none of the two countries patrol the area but they do keep an eye on it from a distance. As such, the area is more or less a no man’s land. Perhaps, this is why this place is believed to be the Underground Base of UFO’s. The place has recorded many UFO sightings in the past and reportedly has a series of underground constructs that UFO’s have chosen as their operating base. Many locals and travelers claim to have seen a UFO rising from their underground lair and descending back once they’ve done whatever it is that UFO’s go out to do. Many believe that both the Indian and Chinese Governments are aware of the alien activity and the UFO bases in the area and are possibly even cooperating with the extraterrestrials said to pilot the mysterious airships. In 2006, Google Earth came up with images that baffled the world. The imagery revealed that the surrounding area had buildings that looked very much like a military facility. Whatever it is out there, it is mysterious and unexplainable till date. 10. The Bhoot Billi  Also known as the ‘Ghost Cat’, the Bhoot Billi is a mysterious monster that was terrorizing certain parts of India, particularly in areas near Pune, Maharashtra. A weird cryptid that appears to be a hybrid between a cat, a dog and a mongoose, the Bhootbilli is capable of long jumps, and has reportedly jumped, at least once, in a tree to escape those people who have tried to catch it. It has been described to be huge and ferocious and its size is said to be “smaller than a lion but bigger than a hyena.” There have been many sightings of the beast and the locals are sure that it is a monster. Whatever it is, India has witnessed many strange animal sightings in the past, like the famous Monkey Man of Delhi. But experts believe that India has a history of over-reacting and exaggerating to such sightings and they believe that the creature is no more than a little civet cat and a lot of imagination. 11. The Magnetic Hill – Ladakh, J&k  Located around 11000 feet above sea level in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh is a mystical and absolutely stunning place that needs a visit at least once in your lifetime. Out of the several enchanting places in Ladakh, one is of particular interest: The Magnetic Hill, a small stretch of road located about 30 km from Leh on the way to Kargil. This particular part of the Srinagar-Leh highway can be clearly seen to be going uphill, but if you stand at the right place, turned off your engine and put your vehicle in neutral, it will slowly move on its own and can go up to a speed of 20 km/hr. It is rumored that there once lied a pathway on this patch of road that led straight to heaven. People who were deserving of it would be pulled up automatically while the others could never make up the path, no matter how hard they tried. Experts believe that the Magnetic Hill is just an optical illusion wherein a slightly downhill slope appears to be an uphill slope due to an obstructed horizon. Whatever it is it does attract thousands of tourists to this place just to experience the phenomenon. 12. The Immortal Beings of the Himalayas  Hidden in a valley in the remote Himalayas, it is said, is Gyanganj, a home for immortals. Call it Shambala, Shangri-La or Siddhashram, believers say this celestial kingdom shapes our destiny. Gyanganj is believed to be an ancient Indo-Tibetan tale about a kingdom of mysterious immortal beings, hiding from the world but possessing the power to influence it in various subtle ways when needed. It is said that the so called city is carefully camouflaged and exists in a completely different parallel reality in order to protect it from modern mapping and satellites. However, according to legend, the yetis or the enlightened beings of the Himalayas that inhabit the fabled region are known to let in a visitor every now and then in order to share their wisdom and wit with them. There have in fact been many legends of kings and sadhus who’ve claimed to meet these enlightened immortals and be guided towards immense knowledge. 13. The Haunted Bhangarh Fort – Bhangarh, Rajasthan  The abandoned fort of Bhangarh, located in Rajasthan is one of the most haunted places on Earth and the top haunted place in India, so much so that the Archaeological Survey of India has put up a sign outside the fort, prohibiting people to enter it after sunset. Locals living in the surrounding area had to move their entire town outside the limits of the fort because of the alleged hauntings. Legend has it that the city of Bhangarh was cursed by a holy man named Baba Balnath. He had given permission for the town’s construction so long as the heights of the building do not cast a shadow over his home. It is said that a young Prince happened to do just that and that led Baba Balnath to curse the entire city. Many believe he is still buried there till date. Another legend says that a wizard named Singhiya fell in love with the Princess of Bhangarh, Ratnavati. To make her fall in love with him, the wizard placed a spell upon a fragrance being purchased by the Princess’ maid, so that upon touching it she would become his forever. But Ratnavati found out what the wizard was up to and foiled his plan. Totally enraged, the wizard placed a curse upon Bhangarh and many locals claim that his ghost still roams across the ill-fated city. Some locals believe that Princess Ratnavati has reincarnated in a new body and the Bhangarh Fort awaits her return, as only she can put an end to the curse. Whatever be the true legend, the hauntings are definitely real and it is rumored that many people who have entered the fort after dark, haven’t returned. Nevertheless, the constant reporting of ghost sightings has landed the fort among the most haunted places in India and attracts many tourists who wish to experience the thrill inside. 14. Krishna’s Butterball – Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu  Krishna’s Butterball, located in Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, is well known for its stone carvings. The Butterball is a huge rock around 5 meters in diameter, carefully lying on a smooth slope. But here is the interesting part: Apparently, the slope is way too slippery. So much so that local children use it as a natural slide. Yet, somehow, this giant rock doesn’t move which is in fact defies all laws of Physics. The rock is a popular tourist attraction and many tourists can be seen posing for pictures seeming to hold the rock from the other end! What makes the rock stand stiff and prevent from slipping in what seems to be a slip pit, is a mystery. But that’s the whole point of it right? 15. The Curious Case of the Levitating Stone – Shivapur, Maharastra  About 160 Km east from Mumbai, lies a hamlet called Shivapur, which embodies the shrine of Hazrat Qamar Ali, home to a peculiar levitating stone. According to legend, around 800 years ago, there was a gymnasium in place of the shrine. A Sufi named Qamar Ali was born into a family of middle-class Muslims whose men-folk prided themselves on their muscular prowess. Qamar Ali, unlike his aggressive older brothers, was introspective and gentle. When he was just six, he became a disciple of Sufi Pir and fasted and meditated for days until devotees began flocking to his doorstep drawn by the young Sufi’s mystique and healing powers. Qamar Ali died in his late teens but as he lay on his deathbed, he requested that a circular stone weighing 200 pounds, be placed near his tomb. He said that the stone could only be lifted when 11 fingers touched it all at once and called out its name loudly. He wanted it to be a symbol….a reminder that spiritual power is greater than brute strength. To this day, the magical stone can be lifted and levitated by calling out its name. Anti-gravity or poltergeist activity? Who knows, but the shrine is a must visit if you want to experience something extraordinary! 16. The Gravity Defying Palace : Bada Imambara – Lucknow, U.P.  Imagine a huge hall around 50 meters long and 15 meters wide held up without any pillars, beams or any external support! Impossible right? But is it? Believe it or not there exists such a place in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh:The Bada Imambada, known by many as the gravity defying palace. The Bada Imambada is actually a shrine that was built by the Fourth Nawab, Barak Asaf-ud-Daula, in the year 1784. The palace houses the tombs of Asaf-ud-Daula and his family and is also believed to hold riches. The central hall, as described above, is suspended without any supporting beams or pillars. What makes it even more interesting is that one can encounter certain whispering sounds in the balcony across the hallway. This is, in fact, one of the largest arched constructions in the world. 17. The Reincarnation of Shanti Devi  Shanti Devi was a normal girl born in Delhi in the 1930’s. But when she turned four, she started acting strange and was unhappy with her life. She constantly told her parents that she belonged somewhere else and that her parents were not her real parents. She claimed her name was Ludgi Devi and that she died while giving birth to her child. She also gave very specific details regarding her husband and family life. Shanti’s parents worried by her behavior and claims, decided to inquire and what they found out was beyond belief. There was indeed a woman named Ludgi Devi in the town that Shanti claimed to have lived and she died of childbirth, exactly like Shanti had told her parents. The town existed and so did her husband and her family. When Shanti eventually met her ‘husband from previous life’, she recognized him instantly and acted like a mother towards her child. Upon learning about her story, the newspapers started covering it and became quite interested. It turns out that Shanti was not only able to remember every instance from her past life, but also the time between life and death – the afterlife, where she claimed that she met Lord Krishna who told her to spread the story about her experiences. Hundreds of researchers have tried hard to prove her reincarnation wrong and fake but have always failed considerably. Hope you enjoy it.

Most of traders can’t understand that almost all trading systems have some cycles. Some systems will work in some market conditions for eg most of trend following systems will give tremendous profit in trending market.( either bullish or bearish) some Strategies like ""covered call"" will work on mild bull markets. Since most of traders seeking Secret even though they already know many good system, this makes good business opportunities for Investment Gurus, Strategy sellers and trading system developers.   For example 2014 was very good bull year in Indian market. Many small cap and mid cap stocks rose multiple times during this year. So Many investors started to believe fundamentals than technical. So to fill this Gap many Investment Guru who sells their investment ideas or their investment methods to public are appearing on media like TV, Social media and online forums to teach Value investing .  Suppose the learning period of Value investing for normal investor is two year and he starts to learn value investing on beginning of 2015. he could able to pick right stocks by his own knowledge only at end of 2017. At that time he might not able to pick stock at right valuation. Chances there to buy some stocks by chasing market. In short……. it is better to adapt value investing at the early stage of bull market or late stage of bear market than late stage of bull market or early stage bear market. So it is vital to know when bull market ends or bear market starts.  The above scenario also applicable for trading system. most of trading system which uses leverage has smaller cycles than investment cycle. Most of Strategy sellers would start to claim as they have secret system that would give profit for life time. Most them may have given good profits in recent times but no one knows when it starts to give losses (whips or drawdown). Even some strategy sellers keep on teaching many new strategies time to time (to keep their regular customers ) . From traders point of view it is very tougher to find when that cycle (Or Trend ) end comparing to “when bull market ends”. I have seen many traders who had spent more money than their trading capital to learn trading/investing Strategies  and failing to meet out their expectations. I have seen very less people (may be less than 5% ) who are doing well in both trading as well as teaching .So one has more probable to find a coach or a mentor who do not having good trade records than good one. Most of people seeks the Secret outside and failed realize that the Secret is in inner side them. I have tested many trading systems that looks very foolish that are not giving consistent loss. This suggests even fools can’t loss money if he follows a regular Strategy with right money management. So if one traders follows any of proven rules like  • CUT YOUR LOSSES LET YOUR PROFIT RUN• YOUR BIGGEST LOSER CAN’T EXCEED YOUR BIGGEST WINNER• THE FIRST LOSS IS THE BEST LOSS• DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY AND STICK WITH IT. DON’T CHANGE METHODOLOGIES FROM DAY TO DAY.• CONSISTENCY BUILDS CONFIDENCE• THE MARKET PAYS YOU TO BE DISCIPLINED• DON’T RISK MORE THAN 2% OF YOUR CAPITAL IN A SINGLE TRADE he/she will have definite edge than average traders. One may have seen these kind of rules every where. But one should note that one may not create wealth over the night by using above rules. But I can assure that one can’t loose money at least if he is disciplined. Over the period this disciplined approach builds wealth slowly but steadily  So the Answer for  ""Secret to Stock trading"" is It is inside you.",2021-03-06T22:03:27.178Z,"What are the secrets in day trading in the stock market?

Some people use the occasion to show how well off the family is. So, a really nice ‘box’ is important. A big ceremony and a big party can also be important. Why? Because funerals are for the living. Third, once someone realized the living like things to look nice and some like to show off, craftsmen started making really nice and ever more nicer boxes for the dead. Brass handles for the pall bearers, soft cushions for the dead, pretty silk cushions, fancy carving, etc. Some people always have to outdo others. Why? Because funerals are for the living. Fourth, people don’t make rational decisions when they are in shock and mourning. I’m not saying the funeral business takes advantage of people because they are giving people what they want. The funeral industry offers many really fancy boxes with lots of pretty things and you can tell where this is going, right? Because funerals are for the living.  Once it became a big business where people like to show off their money it got really expensive. You can’t just dig a hole wherever you want on your property these days. Burials have to happen on land specifically set aside for the dead. You have to buy or rent a specific location in a graveyard or cemetery. My 4th great grandparents were buried in a small ‘burial ground’ on their own farm. You can’t do that since the state got involved in funerals. Many jurisdictions require a cement vault in the ground to keep any bodily fluids from seeping into the ground and, therefore, the nearby water table. My uncle wanted a simple pine box but the state said you can’t do that for sanitation reasons. The state got involved in funerals. Backhoes are great for quickly digging deep holes (and filling in back in later). That’s especially true in difficult soil.

Also, it may open the door for you to expand to other areas down the road. This advice begs the question “So if I niche down, how do I become a Consultant within that niche?”. I would choose a niche, first of all, based on need. Pick a real problem that is a clear “pain point” for your target market. A problem most everyone has regularly. Make sure you VALIDATE that this is a real problem with the farmers or whoever it is you are targeting. An important question: “What would it be worth to you (in dollars) to have this problem solved?” If you have a real problem with a real target market that is ready to pay for a solution: go do everything you can to find effective solutions for that problem. Read, study, experiment, go to trade events, speak to researchers, etc. Once you’ve established real expertise that solves a real problem for sustainable farmers (or whoever you decide to target), it’s time to market your services! If you are having trouble getting people to pay, consider doing a pilot for free. Word gets around fast in the Ag community, so if you are offering real solutions to real problems that offer an economic benefit you will not have trouble expanding your services.

Let’s try to understand the business of Flipkart. Let’s imagine you are the owner of a departmental store and you deliver products anywhere across the city. Everything was hunky-dory until one day internet strikes. Since you wanted to be ahead of others you went digital. You create a website to fetch orders from people without having them coming to your store. To get the attention you lowered prices of the products and sell most of them at a discount, most of the time. The customers loved the idea since they are paying less for fancy stuff such as mobile phones, clothing, jewelry, electronics etc. You also made the whole process of buying easy-peasy. Few taps and bam! Anyone buying from you could do so in minutes. Now you get a lot of customers and with them the loss is widening too since you are giving discounts to push sales up. When you were limited to your city you were able to finance your losses but now your scale has grown manifold. You need money to keep going. So you bring in investors who would value your business solely on sales and give you money. They are banking on the prospects internet would bring to your business in the future, perhaps a risk. The market explodes like nothing you have imagined. Your business grew manifold and so does the losses. Surely the investors gets nervous but they don’t want the fire to go off or else the investments will go dead. Because of the exponential spurt in the market, many more departmental stores joins the party and thus begins a price war. None of the business sells different products but they do at different prices most of them at discounts. Hence you cannot do much on the product front other than introducing private labels giving you higher margins. Pressure mounts as investors begin to worry about the recovery. They start re-evaluating their positions and mark their investments down. Your competitors having deep pockets and years of experience watch you quietly. They want you to blink first. They know you won’t survive the battle for too long whilst they resist the temptation to buy your marked down assets until it all goes on distress. Any company doing business in technological domain must be either of three viz., first of its kind, best in the category or different from all. Rightly Flipkart was first of its kind but that just in India. Strategies must have been in place to deal with the competition and margin enhancement. At some point they will run out of money to finance the discounts on sales. Flipkart doesn’t have reserves and surplus therefore for any expansions and “experiments” they will have to depend on the money from outside. On the other hand, Flipkart’s competitors have access to capital at lower costs to fund their India operations. “Time is a friend of a great business, it is the enemy of a lousy business.” I would like to keep contrarian views on subjects such as these but I am afraid on this one, I could not. Let’s try to understand the business of Flipkart. Let’s imagine you are the owner of a departmental store and you deliver products anywhere across the city. Everything was hunky-dory until one day internet strikes. Since you wanted to be ahead of others you went digital. You create a website to fetch orders from people without having them coming to your store.

We were able to hold onto our house, but my parents had to get a second loan on the equity of the house. My stepmom was in her early 50s, and she went out to get a realtor license and started working. She was a good agent, but she hated the job. She was introvert by nature and marrying my dad, she kind of settled down being a housewife for her life. I don’t think she ever thought that she would end up being the breadwinner of the house at 50. She died last year, 8 months after diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. She never smoked. I think it’s the pressure and depression. I remembered I answered a question here on Quora about the “value” of Wall Street (stock market). And I remember I thought Wall Street does not create value. Despite handling billions of dollars, this is an industry that plays with other people’s lives and yet at the same time, does not add any value to our society. I understand the function of a bank. I understand that when people pool their money (deposit to the bank), the bank could use the money to invest in businesses and make more money for the bank and for the individual client. I understand the purpose of loans. And as I talked to people who commented on my “Wall Street is useless” answer, I was eventually convinced that hedge funds and investment banks are not by their nature, evil, but rather, the industry needs more regulations. After that answer, I’ve often thought about it. Is it about more regulation? What kind of regulation would prevent investment bankers to ruin the economy, so little guys like myself don’t suffer from it? I’m not an expert on stock market regulations but I felt that with a regulation like that, the stock market will no longer be able to sustain hudge funds and investment banks. I then come to the conclusion that the very existence of the super-rich money brokers means that this is an industry that breeds greed. It was never going to be enough. And no amount of regulation will change that. And when people in this industry made a mistake, the taxpayers bailed them out. None of them had suffered any real consequences. Lives are destroyed because of their fucking greed, and they get to drink like champions and give out millions of bonuses while the rest of the country struggles. I’m not a religious person, and I think it’s a pointless endeavor to assign value judgment to an industry. But I will say this: the money market is evil. This… “buying and selling money to make more money” thing, is evil. The Scorpion will always sting the frog because it is its nature. And the frog will always carry the scorpion across the river because it doesn’t want to die with the scorpion. Except, there’s no end to it. There’s no riverbank for the frog, it’s water all the way.  When I knew about the Gamestop stock bet, the whole thing had already made news and the trade was stopped. Before the GameStop bet, I’ve never even heard of the subreddit. I don’t really care who they are or what they have been doing. But if I had known about the entire GameStop Stock earlier, and if I know I could help make these hedge fund assholes lose money, I would buy GameStop stock even if I lose money. These hedge fund managers will never, ever…. experience the pain, fear, helplessness we went through back in 2008. They’ll never watch their family fall apart because of money. Even if they lose billions, they’ll still have their fancy-ass cars and watches and bonuses and G5s. But at least people, little people like me, had done something to these hedge fund billionaires. At least for a split second there, they’re afraid. And that’s something. 2008 and 2009 were bad for my family. We lost our savings during the 2008 housing crisis.

But even assuming that its entire surface was made of combustible material, and you applied a source of heat to it, in the form of a nuclear bomb, say (let's go for extremes here, as they more easily disprove the general case), and manage to momentarily 'ignite' those combustible materials, the fire cannot be sustained without a source of oxygen.  There is obviously no atmospheric oxygen on the Moon, because it has no atmosphere. So the only oxygen that could be present is that bound in compounds in the minerals of the Moon's surface. I'm not an expert on the mineral composition of the moon, so I don't know how much oxygen-rich mineral deposits there might be.  Even supposing you could liberate this oxygen with the heat of the nuclear bomb, it would quickly 'boil off' into space because of the Moon's low surface gravity, so it would not be around long enough to sustain the combustion of whatever materials you managed to ignite with the bomb.  Taking all these factors into account, I think it is fairly safe to say that you could not 'set fire' to the Moon, because it is not made of readily combustible material and there is no source of oxygen to sustain the combustion.

There are many options available through which you can learn stock market basics. With sincere and persistent efforts, you can learn stock market.  A question may arise in your mind. Why should I learn stock market trading? You may be a student or a young professional or even retired. Whatever your position or age, you may have few dreams that have to be fulfilled. And for that you need the appropriate amount of money at the appropriate time meaning that you have to start investing. Unless you start to allocate certain portion of your income to investment purposes, you cannot achieve your dreams. It does not mean that you have to own lakhs and lakhs to invest in the share market. Even with a minimum of Rs. 500, you can start investing every month in mutual funds. There are numerous financial assets like equity, mutual fund, SIP, derivatives, currency, commodity, bonds, etc. Don’t get worried if you are not familiar with these terms. You will get to know them during the course of learning. 1.Read Books: Make a habit of reading books on stock markets, investment strategies, etc. By systematic and continuous learning, you can get a grip on the subject. Books such as “Basics of Financial Market” and “A Guide for Intelligent Investment” authored by Mr. Rajiv Ranjan Singh give you a very clear understanding about the way the market functions. Written in simple language, it takes you through the world of investments. 2.Follow a mentor: Its always essential to follow the footsteps of a mentor in the chosen field. Get guidance regarding investments and learn the tricks of the trade. A mentor can be a person who has more years of experience in investment. It can be your relative or neighbor or teacher or anyone for that matter. You can get nuggets of wisdom from the mentor as he or she would know the ins and outs of the stock market. 3.Take online courses: There are many online sites that provide courses and certifications in stock market trading. If you really want to get an edge over others, join these courses and get equipped with the essentials of stock market. 4.Discipline: The key to success is a stop-loss order. Stop loss helps a trader sell a stock when it slides to a certain price. Suppose you buy shares of company A at Rs 100 and set a stop loss at Rs 95. When the price falls to Rs 95, the shares will be sold automatically. This means you have limited your loss to Rs 5. While entering a trade, you should be clear about how much loss you are willing to accept. 5.Skill: Trading is a skill, says Derek. ""You have to learn what not to do along with what you should do. You should also know how to spot amateurs and trap them and how to take positions. Also, you should be quick to get in and very quick to get out,"" he says. A lot of amateurs in the market buy at a wrong point. A skilled trader identifies such people and takes an opposite position to trap them. 6.Planning: One should identify a few stocks and focus on them 7.Minimum capital: Only those with a capital of at least Rs 2 lakh can trade for a meaningful gain. However, this capital should not be borrowed and should not be part of your core savings. People can also trade with less, but volumes are important. So, a certain minimum capital is a must. 8.Stock volumes: A stock should have enough volumes for it to be tradable. According to Zelek, it should have a minimum daily average volume of 500,000 shares. For those just starting, trading Nifty-50 stocks is a good idea, he says. 9.Price range: What should you do with a share which has high volumes but not much price movement? You should prefer shares with a minimum price range of Rs 10. This means the average difference between a stock's intraday high and intraday low should be at least Rs 10.

Women had no right to marry, to give birth to child, oppose their husbands, in history women were just free slaves then where this god was died. Dalits were slayed for thousands of years but no God came to save them before dr Ambedkar. Racial discrimination led to mass killings, barbarism and slavery. If God gives punishment of work then what wrong a 2 year child has done so that he got a blood cancer. Why God doesn't punish rapists, bomb blasters. Everything in this world is God untill proven by science for eg. If any asteroid came towards earth, theist believes that it is some supernatural power but science explained it is asteroid. Bruno was killed coz he said earth is just a planet so religious people forced their king to give him death sentence but later he was proven right. 14 June 2020, Kollam district, Kerala. A shrine to worship ‘Corona Devi’ in Kerala | Kozhikode News - Times of India Chattisgarh, Bhilai 5 June 2020.  These people are worshipping corana virus by considering them as a goddess but we know the truth. Same thing happened with God but no one is raising question coz it happened thousands of years ago and the no. of believers are also more. Strongest example is Sheetla mata, Badi Mata, Chhoti mata all are goddesses of disease and still being worshipped even we know that science has killed this Big mata coz it's goddess of Smallpox which has been eradicated from the world but some people still worshipping her. People say it enters inside the people and leads to disease but all are rubbish as we know today. If today I ask people where is that Mata (goddess) now, then people has no answer. If you think billions of people believe in God, are they all wrong? Yes they may have, coz no. don't decide what is wrong and right. For eg. When Ram rahim, Asharam, Rampal were being arrested, Billions of people jammed the road, were they all right? No that's why all 3 are in jail now, no God came to save them even. Actually main reason of God business is this large no. of fool people. Formation of God: Take random 10k children of less than 5 years and leave them on an isolated Island with no communication to us, when they will become adult they will develop their own God, maya calender blah blah etc. They will say Earth is in center and Sun rises from 1 side and sets in other side and travels below the ground in night and again rises from same side. But this is completely fake as we know now. They will say Sun is small and bright thing and if you fly till there you can catch it. If still you believe in God then it should be behind jail coz God has done more devastation than human beings like Tsunami, riots, natural disasters, flood, earthquakes etc. People believe in God coz they think that if they stop believing something wrong will happen with them. That's it. I don't believe in God coz the fact is that there is no God. If you believe in God then answer this question Q1 If God has made the universe then who made the God??? And why? If God has automatically created then Universe can be automatically created as well. Q2. Why God doesn't stop people who rape a girl? Why 1 year old child get blood cancer? Q3. Why God doesn't come on Earth and say please stop doing bloodshed on behalf of my name? Q4. Believing in God has more pros or cons? Q5. What is God? Q6. If someone says your crime of previous birth will be punished in next birth..! so what about people who don't believe in this phenomena? Also how it stops someone doing crime, like if someone rape a girl in 1st birth, so God made him donkey in 2nd birth, so in 3rd birth when he become human being again, will he stops himself doing rape again by reminding that I was donkey in previous birth, No! Never!. It means it's useless phenomenon. Q7. If God gives punishment of work or so called KARMA then what wrong/Karna has done by a 2 year child so that he got a blood cancer? Why God is punishing him? Why God doesn't punish rapists, bomb blasters? Q8. If God has created the Universe then why he created it in such a way as we can see today, why Universe follow laws of physics, why God made such laws, coz Universe could be arranged in infinite such patterns so why God arranged in this fix pattern as we see today. How can God can reach to a point, that gravity should be attractive forever, even if it will become repulsive in future but still it will follow a pattern(laws), how and why God follow a pattern, coz God can't be bound by any laws? Because God is supreme and if he follows laws then real supreme power is one who made these laws that even God is following. Q9. Our Universe follow laws of physics means Universe arranged in a fixed pattern or laws, so if God existed then this pattern will break coz God can't exist in a fix pattern, if you think God exist in same pattern as our Universe so if one day this pattern will break, then what will happen to God. If something exist outside our Universe like multiverse and follow different patterns, so which one is God, actually God can't come to a point to take a decision that Universe 1 will follow pattern A and Universe 2 will follow pattern B. Existence of God is itself contraindicatory in Universe coz Universe follow a pattern but God can't follow any pattern or law, otherwise next question comes is which laws God follows, and why, and why Only this law not other, and who made this law, so God must be infinite, amorphous, undefined, unseen, non understandable. So God can't exist or can't make a Universe that follows some pattern or laws. If whole Universe start dancing without any laws of physics or any pattern, then we can think God is doing that but then question comes why, how, and that dance can also follow some pattern. So if God exists it breaks the pattern of Universe but pattern has still not be broken of Universe so God can't exist. There are 2 kinds of people. 1st kind people say Earth, sun, solar system, galaxy and whole Universe made by the God but if someone ask who made the God then they have no answer. Coz they don't want to bother their mind so put everything on God by their lazy mind. 2nd kind people say if God has made the Universe then who made the God, so they don't believe in this theory and start searching answers. Then reach to a theory called big bang, but how big bang happened all of a sudden no one knows, then they reached to inflation theory, Quantum fluctuation, Quantum field theory, Black hole theory, parallel universe theory, multiverse theory, theory of everything and say this is not sudden but a cycle of multi Universe. M theory and string theory explain the existence of mass and Quantum particles. Most accepted thought is that the matter we see is not complete there is another matter having particles with opposite properties and when both collapse everything become nothing. Even antimatter has been detected by large hadron collider experiment. Scientists don't say blindly that this is perfect theory even they are working on it but all these are far far far far far far far far better than God theory. I request you all to start thinking how this universe made rather than believing in God and making fool yourself. May be you will give a better explanation. Again if you believe in God then give me answer who made the God. If God created by super God then who created super God and this is a vicious cycle.  We have to do full blown research on how to prevent earth from asteroids coz everytime we will not be lucky enough and then asteroid will wipe out human race as it was happened with dinasours in past and then we will not be alive to pray this God. This thing will happen only if people become scientific than religious. Coronavirus is nothing in front of asteroid and we have no preparation till now. Add1: People are saying read this book, that Book, actually all have same stories. I have read religious books, but couldn't find answer of creator of the Universe. If you found then click photo and send me, I am waiting, those who read them become theist, those who understands become atheist. These books are completely opposite of positive power, spirituality, kindness, awareness, wakefullness, eternity, and self realisation. These days every religious books are stealing scientific and psychological data and pushing into themselves to sustain in scientific World. I don't know why female Homo sapiens follow God. Dear Respected women, World was cruel to you in the whole human history, the religion was the only weapon to oppress you, you were just raped over raped over raped over raped over raped over raped, your breast were cut in British rule and died till bleeding, if you want to feel pain of rape then see interview given by women escaped from grip of ISIS, Suppose she would have never tried to escape and just waiting for God to come, your genitals being still mutilated, you were legally raped by making Devadasi सद्य: स्नात सत्य- कथा : ...देवदासी👩🏻‍🎨 - Samaj Weekly it will encroach your mind and emotions plz read it once. you were child producing machinary yes or no. If some bad man say child production is natural in nature. Well absolutely not in case of humans. 1.Animals don't Marry with one another, they do random matings, so every female get equal chance to get pregnant. But in human Mumtaj died during delivery of 14th child. 2. Animals do sex according to their seasonal, biological response not according to their mood. Means they don't disturb the natural patterns so that body can adapt itself to produce next child. 3. Animals do sex at very proper age but humans not, 50 years ago child marriage was too common even My grandmother given birth to 1st child at age of 12, total 11 children till age of 30, married at 9. 4. Even after if animals do something wrong then can u let it happen with yourself? No! 5. Animals give birth without hospital, can you follow same thing? No coz your lifestyle is different, that's why your pelvic muscle strength is not same as it was when humans used to live in forests, do hunting and eating. Same thing applies to man, 1st man could kill dangerous roaring lions but today's man can't kill a mosquito even, coz we changed our lifestyle, earlier every human being was compulsed to fight for living means everyone had to push their physical limits to survive , but Today this concept applies to women only, Today man has no such point in whole life to push their physical limits, but women has to give birth, whose procedure and pain is still same. That's why large no. of female dies Today during delivery. 6. Dear respected women, there were uncountable numbers and ways in History even Today, where you were humiliated, raped or cut into pieces and no God came to save you, until countries not created their own constitution. even God given you menstruation, labour pain, breastfeeding like unwanted punishment, if you say it's laws of nature, but he is God, there should be no laws applies on it, Still you worship God, but why? Please tell me? You should kick out God from your mind, you should run a global movement against this imaginary God, don't be afraid, it's not their, it doesn't exist so it can't do any harm to you. Stop this slavery of God for no reason. You are directly betraying with the person who fought with God and it's propagandists to provide you equal rights in World. If you think being atheist will make you hopeless, then you are wrong, I am atheist but I am kind ❤️ person, it has nothing to with god, and many theists are really snakes from inside. It depends on human nature, knowledge, and thinking. Spirituality teaches you to live life, to find purpose of your life, not to believe in life. Even you will find your own way to fix every problem, intead waiting for God to solve. If you say, subconscious mind, spirituality, meditation, positive energy, are God. No this is exactly opposite to God. If God exist then it must be creator and controller of Universe otherwise we don't need it, then it's completely floccinaucinihilipilification. Because once universe has created then anything can be traced. If you say God doesn't exist and we just call our subconscious mind God then you may call yourself atheist, it's like you say alpha Centauri star is God, ok no problem let it be there, who care about that. Positive power is not in Universe, it's inside your mind and that is complex game of neural circuits , neurotransmitter, and gut feeling. If I transplant your brain to a monkey then he will get same positive power. A mentalist can play with your subconscious mind, means is he playing with God?, This is complete science and psychology. This is power atheists use to be calm in every apocalypse. Take any devotional song and put it into any movie then it will give you same pleasure coz effect is due to music, lyrics, language not God. Think about this world without music, language. Many atheists like late Osho said music is the way to remain directed in your path. Q10. If you say subconscious mind is God then if all Homo sapiens die, but animals and plants alive, will God die. yes or no? When theists listen devotional songs they feel positive, but they also feel positive by other things, romantic or sad song etc. It's a liquid phenomena, human beings developed language, music, movies, games, instruments, according to their adventure these are completely scientific things and there is nothing God about that. Your brain is biochemical computer what data you load in this, it behaves the same way. If u listen a song in a different language, different lyrics, you may feel different coz your brain has not trained for this but this can be peaceful for someone else. For eg. Azaan is Melodious for Muslims and Arti for Hindus but they may not feel same when interchanged. Some religious businessmen are so smart that they given new name to their business to escape from bombardments of questions asked on fake God by any atheists. Wow!! Plz people understand what is scientific and what is not, use your Brain , don't get trapped in what people believe, Belief can be blunder, you are just being stubborn without any reason coz you are doing it from childhood, now suddenly your false beliefs getting hurt. Be scientific and logical, don't argue just on belief , even Einstein believed Universe is static, he introduced a cosmological constant into his equations, but Hubble proved that it's expanding in 1929. There are drugs that if I injected in you veins , your positive energy become negative, What about psychiatric patients like autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, moron, schizophrenia, mania, bipolar, depression, OCD, patients, does God exist for these people, a mentally retarded person never reach to his subconscious thinking , don't they deserve to meet with God? And what about plants and other, don't they have any link with God? Don't link these scientific things with God, these are keys used by religious propagandists nowadays to make you fool just to sustain their business, they are updating religious books with positive power concept and copy pasting scientific data to hide old blunders. Coz no one is there to ask questions. I clearly explained that God, supreme power, any magical activity can't exist, I know many atheists who are confused atheists just coz either god has not fulfilled their wishes, or they have had bad experience with their religion, bad ritual in their religion etc., well these kind of people are not true atheists, I can turn them theist in a day. If some day a loud unknown sound starts coming from sky and NASA say it's frequency is undetectable by available technology then most of these type of atheists will turn into theists but I will ask who r u , why r u coming, what is scientific basis behind your sound , who created you , do you follow different laws of physics so that NASA can't detect, coz I know that miracle can't exist, everything is scientific, everything is reasonable. We don't need this fake God, today's world is peaceful than history, sole reason behind this is constitution formed by keeping God aside and humanity in front, applied by every countries, if you don't know then open history books: History is full of war, bloodshed, rapes, murder, betrayal, slavery, genocide, punishment, untouchability, injustice, gender, caste, community, race discrimination and War ,war ,war ,war, war. Eve today where the constitution rupture, people can't live peacefully on behalf of religion. Eg. Syria, Iraq. God is portrayed in such a beautiful trelyttering way, that Since your birth you never raised a single question on God, day and night you just believe in God for no reason, Worship happens at your home, you watch TV and see God is doing something great things, you listen to fake story and greatness of God in day to day life, any good thing happens oh God, any bad things oh human beings coz God don't do bad things, Actually God is your superhero and you love him. It's very easy to get impressed by anything that is over to human beings Atlast: God can't exist physically, chemically, socially, scientifically, spiritually, economically, mentally, biologically, philosophically, mathematically, or any form. Atheism is not a choice or fashion, it may be a need for Today and Tomorrow to make a peaceful world. It's not perfect coz Nothing is perfect, perfection is the last discovered best version, perfect becomes imperfect when next better version comes, I am requesting you to think, research, think and think and think and then make a decision. From my side Om shanti, Jai shri Ram, Allah hu Akbar, Jesus is great, Namo buddhay, to every religious person , coz I don't need confliction, I need peace at any cost. I never hurt anyone in real life. Truth is bitter. Trelyttering word don't exist same as God. Thank you!! VANDE MATARAM 🇮🇳!! No! No! No! There is no God. The biggest misconception is God. Everyone borns Atheist but they Start believing in God coz they take birth in family who believes in God. They believe in same God that their family believes.

If yes then who is creating new souls for coronavirus who are increasing day by day?  God is the enemy of Goodness eg. Women in human history had been oppressed on the name of religion.

Dava Newman an expert in spacesuit design said in an article that… ""I have heard of a couple people who've removed their fingernails in advance of an EVA."" Astronauts' Fingernails Falling Off Due to Glove Design Fingernail trauma and other hand injuries are collectively the number one nuisance for spacewalkers, said study co-author Dava Newman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""The glove in general is just absolutely one of the main engineering challenges,"" Newman said. ""After all, you have almost as many degrees of freedom in your hand as in the rest of your whole body."" The trouble is that the gloves, like the entire space suit, need to simulate the pressure of Earth's atmosphere in the chilly, airless environment of space. The rigid, balloonlike nature of gas-pressurized gloves makes fine motor control a challenge during extravehicular activities (EVAs), aka spacewalks. A previous study of astronaut injuries sustained during spacewalks had found that about 47 percent of 352 reported symptoms between 2002 and 2004 were hand related. More than half of these hand injuries were due to fingertips and nails making contact with the hard ""thimbles"" inside the glove fingertips. In several cases, sustained pressure on the fingertips during EVAs caused intense pain and led to the astronauts' nails detaching from their nailbeds, a condition called fingernail delamination. While this condition doesn't prevent astronauts from getting their work done, it can become a nuisance if the loose nails gets snagged inside the glove. Also, moisture inside the glove can lead to secondary bacterial or yeast infections in the exposed nailbeds, the study authors say. If the nail falls off completely, it will eventually grow back, although it might be deformed. For now, the only solutions are to apply protective dressings, keep nails trimmed short—or do some extreme preventative maintenance. ""I have heard of a couple people who've removed their fingernails in advance of an EVA,"" Newman said.[1]  Newman was a professor at MIT before she became Deputy Administrator of NASA. A paper by one of her students also mentions an astronaut who removed a fingernail as a precaution. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuits are a key enabling technology which allow astronauts to survive and work in the harsh environment of space. Of the entire spacesuit, the gloves may perhaps be considered the most difficult engineering design issue. A significant number of astronauts sustain hand and shoulder injuries during extravehicular activity (EVA) training and operations. In extreme cases these injuries lead to fingernail delamination (onycholysis) or rotator cuff tears and require medical or surgical intervention. At least one astronaut has had fingernails removed before an EVA mission to prevent pain, obstruction of the fingertip by the loose/protruding nail inside the glove, and the risk of secondary bacterial or yeast infection of the exposed bed in the moist conditions in the glove (Gernhardt, 2009) Strauss et al., (2004) performed a suit symptom study showing that fingernail delamination (oronycholysis) is experienced by crew members due to axial loading of the fingernails when the gloved hand is closed repeatedly to grasp an object. An additional factor that leads to onycholysis is the presence of moisture inside the comfort gloves.

As a caretaker for narc they unknowingly become instant flying monkeys who will try their best to help narc. Which means the victim is the enemy who is responsible for narcs despair.

The victim becomes emotional and in tears explain the sad story to people. Now people are normal idiot's who don't know abc of NPD. When they are told of how narc abused the victim they think victim is saying Lies as these fuckers these normal people will never fucking believe the narc is capable of such atrocities.

However, I did not quit with the intention of joining any brand. I was planning to prepare for NET and MPhil entrance exams. The startup I worked at is an ad agency which was in its initial stages when I first joined. This was in May 2015, soon after my M.A exams. The founder of the agency is my mentor; I had worked under him in my first job in a TV news channel. My job was to handle the content of the social media pages and websites of the clients. Seems easy? Trust me, it was not. The graphic designers used to get all surprised whenever I’d tell them I was stressed because of some work. But, it was not just that. The office was located in the top floor of my boss’s house. There was no AC. The washroom was covered in pigeon poop and smelled terrible. I had a terrible time there during the menstruation days every month. As I mentioned, it was peak summer when I worked there and we would literally get roasted in the heat. I had no vehicle of my own; I earned 8000 per month which was not sufficient to cover any of my own expenses. Plus, the office (his house) was 14 kilometers away from my place. I used to take a share auto and go in the blistering sun and then again, sit in the unbearable heat. It made me feel sick and frustrated within a month. Many of the clients were new to the Bhubaneswar market themselves. I had a hard time dealing with some of those who’d ping me at 1 AM in the morning and expect action then and there. They’d get rude easily and there was literally nothing you could do about it. My parents were still paying for me; I was not able to take care of my expenses; I had no time to study and I was getting frustrated and burnt out pretty quickly. I had developed blisters on my face and back, so much so that even the dermatologist asked me about the working conditions and if it was a compulsion for me to work there. I began making mistakes; I had begun to get pissed off at my colleagues and I would be in a terrible mood all the time. While talking to me one of my friends I confessed I didn’t like the job. She had been telling me that I was retreating into my comfort shell. She simply asked what I was going to do about it because sulking doesn’t help. When I talked to my parents and siblings, they revealed they never wanted me to join the agency; it was something only I was excited about. That’s the mistake I made - I went by the glamour which newspapers and media present about startups and did not check with people who had been inside the pot. You should always know what you are in for. I realized I shouldn’t have been there in the first place. My close friend had a good job in Kolkata and I wanted to be employed too. I took a hasty decision, one that led to bitterness and regret, for me as well as for my mentor. I did not leave the job on a good note. My mentor was thoroughly pissed because of my behavior. He had allowed me to work from home, but I messed up. I apologized later but the damage was done. I had broken someone’s trust in me at a time when I didn’t trust myself. I was called for an interview by my current company roughly 20 days after the incident. Things are good now between me and my mentor. His agency has become better; they have an air-conditioned office now and they are one of the agencies who work with our clients. I personally apologized to my mentor at one of our events and he simply said, “Don’t worry about it!” We have come a long way since then, I published his views on startups in one of my stories and the response was good - I did my due. I met him some months ago and he is still willing to let me rejoin his company in Rs 15000 as my salary. I am not taking it because I know how a startup works and I don’t have what it takes to work and excel there. Know what you are in for. Whether you work in a startup or a big brand, you have to research about the industry and your role. Do not be in a hurry ever, neither to join a company (brand or startup) nor to leave it. And yes, I have an MPhil degree now. I have been one of those employees who left a startup and joined a big brand. However, I did not quit with the intention of joining any brand. I was planning to prepare for NET and MPhil entrance exams. The startup I worked at is an ad agency which was in its initial stages when I first joined. This was in May 2015, soon after my M.A exams. The founder of the agency is my mentor; I had worked under him in my first job in a TV news channel. My job was to handle the content of the social media pages and websites of the clients.

Demanding instant gratification is fine when you’re talking about a smartphone, but it’s not the best policy when it comes to weight loss. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Fad diets that promise large amounts of weight loss leave you hungry at best, and at their worst they leave you with unhealthy habits and returned weight gain. So what is the magic number to lose weight and keep it off? According to the , it’s 1 to 2 pounds per week. That means, on average, that aiming for 4 to 8 pounds of weight loss per month is a healthy goal. Just because it’s possible to lose a lot more, at least in the early months of a diet, doesn’t mean it’s healthy or that the weight will stay off in the long term. Losing the healthy way Losing weight can be incredibly simple and incredibly challenging at the same time. Math tells us that if we take in fewer calories than we burn, we will end in burning stored fat for fuel. One pound equals 3,500 calories. If you want to lose 1 pound per week, you’ll need to take in about 500 to 1,000 fewer calories. But life isn’t so simple. There are social events, holidays, and celebrations that all revolve around food. When trying to lose weight, a solid eating and exercise plan with a goal of getting healthier — not just fitting into a new outfit or looking good at an event — will help you lose the weight and keep it off. It’s important to focus on both improving your eating habits and getting more physical activity. Strength training like lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises along with some high-intensity interval training can give your metabolism the boost it needs to shed extra pounds. Steady-state aerobic exercise can also help burn off some calories. “Exercise increases your metabolic rate and builds more muscle mass, which allows you to continue to burn calories after the exercise session,” says Dr. Amy Siegel of Austin Regional Clinic. The good news is that you don’t have to lose a lot of weight before you start seeing positive changes in your health. According to the, if you’re overweight, losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can improve blood pressure, cholesterol, and reduce your risk of diabetes. HEALTHLINE RESOURCES Take our free 3-question diet quiz Our free assessment ranks the best diets for you based on your answers to 3 quick questions. FIND YOUR DIETS Why ‘dieting’ doesn’t do it There’s a reason it’s called “yo-yo dieting.” Depriving yourself isn’t sustainable and will eventually lead to a return in familiar eating patterns. There’s also some science behind why we gain weight back after quick weight loss programs, according to Dr. Peter LePort, medical director of Memorial Care Center for Obesity at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. “The body reacts quickly when you lose weight that fast and you get hungry. If you lose 1 to 2 pounds a week, the body will adjust and begin to feel this is the weight I should be at and then you won’t become extremely hungry because of a rapid weight loss,” he says. The exception to the 1 to 2 pound recommendation is when people have gone through weight loss surgery. Dr. LePort says many of his bariatric surgery patients are 100 pounds overweight and might lose 20 pounds per month shortly after surgery, then about 10 pounds per month, and then 5 pounds per month. “The surgery forces them to eat slowly and take in less food.” Choosing a plan In order to lose weight and keep it off, you’ll need a plan that you can stick to. If you’re just starting your weight loss journey or have had struggles in the past with finding a plan to stick to, it’s a good idea to seek help. Your doctor can recommend a dietitian who can work with you to develop a healthy eating plan that’s right for your needs and long-term goals. A dietitian can teach you healthy habits and ways to make sure you’re managing portion sizes and avoiding too much sugar, salt, and saturated fat, all of which contribute to health issues like heart disease and diabetes. “Frequently a patient needs help and they need to get into a program. I have a program I put together in my office for patients that includes classes and dietary instruction,” says Dr. LePort. Both Dr. LePort and Dr. Siegel recommend programs like Weight Watchers because they’re helpful for learning portion control without having to deprive yourself of certain foods. Takeaway In order to be truly successful, focus on creating a healthier lifestyle for yourself. Eating healthfully and exercising shouldn’t be a temporary means to an end — they should be regular habits. “How long it takes for someone to get to their goal depends on how many pounds they need to lose. The weight didn’t come on overnight, and it isn’t going to come off overnight either,” says Dr. Siegel.

(see superbottle: The Tesla Model 3 'Superbottle' Easter Egg Is a Fascinating Packaging Solution and ‘Ironman electronics setup’: Tesla owner opens Model S motor to reveal Iron Man-esque electronics setup) No, it’s definitely the buyers, who buy into a game that shifts its goalposts every few months. Elon would agree, actually already has (that the buyers make this game work, not about the goalposts thing, though I’m sure in a quiet moment of reflection…). I’ve sold these cars in a Tesla showroom, and I’ve bought 1 on my way out. It’s a roller coaster ride. Model 3 buyers less so, but early Model S buyers and original Roadster buyers are the ultimate unsung heroes. Model S and X experience has been pretty stable over the years, but I’d expect Model 3 buyers to very quickly see the transition to standardised processes, streamlined repair experiences, with Model Y/Pickup being natively born into a mature Tesla ecosystem. Thus the heroes are those who risked more with their purchase (as is expected in the capitalist system). I mean think about this: those who purchased 50″ Plasma TVs for USD$40k are heroes too. Side note: employees and shareholders are compensated. That’s not the same. Sure Tesla might be better or worse than another investment or company to work for, but it’s close. Buying a Tesla though is (was) so radically different a decision, and the price of entry was many multiple times higher, and there have been many teething problems. Special mention: Semi buyers are also heroes, but of a different sort. Getting the commercial arm of Tesla off the ground really needs the support of big players signing on pre-launch. Just ask Airbus and Boeing. Here, I’ll rank the heroes: Original Roadster BuyerOriginal Model S (no superchargers, no autopilot etc) Buyer - circa 2012–2014Model S and Model X Buyer - 2014ish onwardsModel 3 BuyerModel Y/Pickup/Roadster 2.0Special mention: Semi Buyers.And the indispensible heroes - without whom none of this works?

However, the INSANE valuations that many cannabis companies are trading at right now are not sustainable. The reality is that most of the huge profits have already been made by people who already invested in cannabis stocks. Yes, there will be lots more profits in the future. But, if 2018 turns out to be a horrible year for the broader market, the industries that will see the biggest losses will be the speculative ones.

Everybody knows that. If we continue to grow at the same rate for next thirty years, we would have moved from a 3 trillion USD economy now to about 34–35 trillion economy by 2050. If USA continues to grow at its long term average of 2.5 per annum, it would have grown to about 32–33 trillion USD economy by 2050 from its current base of about 20 trillion USD. India can undoubtedly contribute to the global growth for the next 30 years - yes it’s possible. By 2050, USA would be like what Japan is today- stagnation in GDP, but US companies doing well outside of America - most of the US companies would have had their global headquarters outside of USA, for all you know. India would be growing at about 2–3 percent per annum even in 2050. Remember- India is 4 times the size of USA as of now in terms of population and hence may take take much longer time for its growth to taper off. China would also be growing at about the same rate as that of India but on a much wider base of about 54 trillion USD (China is expected to cross over USA before 2030). It may still grow at 5 percent per annum till 2050 from its current base of about 12 trillion USD. Since these are averages, we have to grow faster than the average for a decade atleast in the next thirty years. How can this happen ? A. Animal spirit of entrepreneurship across the length and breadth of country - we are already witnessing this, even though we are at version 1.0 of entrepreneurship, wherein, early birds are making it to Unicorn status (valuation of startup above one billion USD) -such as Paytm, Flipcart, Swiggy, etc. China apparently produced about one Unicorn every four days in 2018 ( source economic times). B. 100 more Mukesh Ambani like successful business men and women. Remember that Mukesh Ambani is the richest person in Asia as on date. In his own words , India needs and can produce dozens of entrepreneurs who can go global with their ambitions. Mr Uday Kotak talks in these lines in the banking sector. C. As we all know, GDP is simply a factor of no. of hours of work and the output per hour. If we increase the first factor by encouraging and facilitating economic indpendence for women, the GDP can be accelerated, for sure. It is said that more than 2/3 of world’s 73 women billionaires in 2017 ( source : Blitzscaling by Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh) are from China. Chinese economy has achieved scale on account of working women and women entrepreneurship, to a great extent. Further, for the second factor, If we increase our productivity by say 12 percent from the current levels, our GDP can grow by about one percent more - just as an hypothetical example. In some areas -such as manufacturing, Chinese are more than twice as productive as Indians are and we can bridge this gap through partnerships with Chinese etc. D. Doing away with caste barriers: We have our own barriers / differences on the divisive system of Caste. It is on the wane in many parts of Urban India though. Millions of young men and women are getting married without any consideration for caste at all now a days. This is a welcome sign. Many of our children can’t even spell out the different castes that exists in India and that is a very progressive development . Millions of people are also cutting across the language and the associated culture barrier. English has become the medium of communication for many a youngster in the country and it is a great sign - it unites India beyond our own imagination. E. Tone at the Top / Leadership: Great leaders make Great nations- Singapore is an example. You just need a chain of leadership which has competitive spirit to set unattainable goals and pursue them with vigour. We need to believe in ourselves. Our PM Modi is a good example on many fronts. There is no dearth of talent in this country. We need many great leaders in the next 30 years to drive this country forward with single minded devotion and passion. Corruption should be eliminated from public life completely - this is a condition precedent to get ahead of the middle income trap of a great nation like India. It is said that any transformational change goes through three phases - Impossible - Improbable - Inevitable ! It’s like Barack Obama saying Yes We can. Without being political, Indians can say Mumkin Hai ( Yes, it’s possible). Jai Hind. Please follow us at: Best Online Investment Advisor in India I will try to answer it through simple maths.

Let's talk about the battles of India 1.Battle of Longewala  120 Indian soldiers with only one jeep-mounted M40 recoilless rifle held the fort against 2,000 Pakistanis backed by 45 tanks and 1 mobile infantry brigade. Though massively outnumbered, the Indian Army held back the attack throughout the night till the Indian Air Force arrived in the morning. Only 2 Indian soldiers died while 200 Pakistanis died. 2.Battle of Rezang La  When: 18 November 1962 One of the toughest battles as it was fought at 16,400 ft, with 120 men of 13 Kumaon’s Charlie Company killing 1,700 Chinese Army personnel. Fighting till the last man, 114 of them died, five were taken prisoner (they all escaped later) while one was sent back by the commanding officer to get reinforcements. 3.Battle of Assal Uttar  When: 8-10 September 1965 When the Pakistani army invaded Khem Karan, the Indian forces assumed a horseshoe-shaped defensive position with Asal Uttar as its focal point. At night, they flooded the sugarcane fields, and then lured the Pakistani tanks into the swampy trap in the morning. Pakistan lost 97 tanks while India lost only 10. 4.Battle of Tololing  When: 20 May - 13 June 1999 It took three weeks for the Army’s 18 Grenadiers and 2nd Rajputana Rifle to capture Tololing because the only way to do it was as a frontal assault, making it a suicidal attempt straight into enemy fire. To climb the sheer vertical slope, soldiers shed their 2-kg food packets in favour of more ammo. 23 soldiers laid down their lives, but the win was so strategically important that within just six days the Indian Army captured at least five more outposts. 5.Battle of saragarhi  A contingent of 21 men of the 36th Sikhs fought till death to defend an army post in Kohat (in present-day Pakistan) against 10,000 Afghan and Orakzai tribesmen. They resorted to hand-to-hand combat towards the end, killing 180 Pashtuns. 6.Battle of Nathu La and Cho La  In a border skirmish, the Chinese Army opened fire on Indian posts at both the passes, which are at a height of 4,100-5,500 m and where temperatures could fall to 10 degrees celsius at night. Despite heavy Chinese shelling, India repelled the attack for weeks. In the end, India lost 65 of its soldiers while the Chinese lost about 300. 7.Meghna Heli Bridge  One of the smartest and stealthiest moves by India’s defence forces, 700 personnel were airlifted, in 110 sorties over 36 hours in secret, across the 1.5-km wide Meghna river in Bangladesh when the Pakistani army destroyed its only bridge. This helped them bypass Pakistani defence positions and capture other unprotected approaches to Dhaka, finally leading to victory for India. 8.Battle of Chawinda  One of the largest tank battles in history since the Battle of Kursk in World War II. Indian Army had 225 tanks while the Pakistani Army controlled 282 tanks, with the Indian side wanting to seize control of the Sialkot-Pasrur railway. The battle came to an end only after the UN intervened. While victory was attributed to Pakistan for halting the Indian invasion, India had managed to capture 518 sq km of Pakistani territory. Now let's talk about the tale of some legends of India. 1.Captain vikram batra  Born in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, Captain Vikram Batra of 13 J&K Rifles, is known as the hero of the Kargil war. He led one of the toughest war operations in Kashmir, and was also called Sher Shah (in the intercepted messages of the Pakistani army). He was instrumental in recapturing Peak 5140, which is located at an altitude of 17,000 feet. During this mission, Batra was seriously injured but still managed to kill three enemy soldiers in close combat. After capturing Peak 5140, he went on yet another difficult mission to recapture Peak 4875 on July 7, 1999. Batra made a call to his father before he left and told him about the crucial mission. Hardly did he know that this would be his last call home.It was one of the most difficult missions the Indian army attempted because the Pakistani forces were sitting above the peak at 16,000 feet and the climb gradient was 80 degrees. On their way up, one of Batra’s fellow officers was severely injured. Batra set out to save him. When a subedar tried to help him save the officer, Batra pushed him aside, saying, “You have children, step aside.” He saved his fellow soldier but was killed while clearing enemy positions. Batra’s last words were “Jai Mata Di.” (The love story of SIR capt vikram is also one of the best known love story) 2.Capt Manoj Kumar Pandey  Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey, a young officer of the 1/11 Gorkha Rifles, took part in a series of boldly led attacks during Operation Vijay, forcing back the intruders with heavy losses in Batalik, including the capture of Jubar Top.His finest hour was during the advance to Khalubar, when he was Number 5 Platoon Commander. On the night of 2/3 July 1999, as the platoon approached its final objective, it came under heavy and intense enemy fire from the surrounding heights. The officer was tasked to clear the interfering enemy positions, so as to prevent his battalion from getting daylighted, being in a vulnerable position. The officer quickly moved his platoon to an advantageous position under intense enemy fire and sent one section to clear the enemy positions from the right, while he himself proceeded to clear four other enemy positions on the left. Fearlessly assaulting the first enemy position, he killed two enemy personnel and proceeded to assault the second and destroyed it by killing two more enemy personnel. Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey was injured on the shoulder and legs by enemy fire while clearing the third position. Undaunted and without caring for his grievous injury, he led the assault on the fourth position urging his men and destroyed the same with a grenade, even as he got a fatal Medium Machine Gun burst on his forehead. It is this singular daredevil act of the officer, which provided the critical firm base for the companies, which finally led to capture of Khalubar. Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey, thus showed most conspicuous bravery, indomitable courage, exemplary personal valour, outstanding leadership and devotion to duty of an exceptionally high order, in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice in the highest traditions of the Army.capt manoj pandey earned the highest gallantry award of India param vir chakra (I guess every armed forces aspirant knows it when SIR manoj kumar pandey appeared in SSB of NDA. officers asked them why do you want to join army and the answer was :- sir I want to win the highest gallantry award Param Vir Chakra😳 and he did it.) 3.Major General Ian Cardozo  Major General Ian Cardozo who has many achievements to his name, will always be known for his immense courage in the 1971 war with Pakistan. He was, at the time, a young major with 5 Gorkha Rifles. During the war, he stepped on a landmine and severely injured his leg. When even the doctor could not cut his leg, Cardozo asked for a khukri (the Gorkha knife) and cut his own leg off, saying, “Now go and bury it!” The incident did not deter Cardozo from going on to serve his country. Through sheer willpower and determination, he continued to perform his duties as a soldier and became the first disabled officer in the Indian Army to command an infantry battalion and a brigade. In spite of not being physically at par with other officers, he defeated many ‘two-legged’ soldiers to come first in many fitness tests during his stint in the army. 4.Brigadier Mohammad Usman  Born in Bibipur, Uttar Pradesh, this man of steel joined the Indian army in 1934. During the Indo-Pakistan war of 1947/48, Brigadier Usman repulsed a fierce attack on Naushera and Jhangar, two highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir, and was named by his fellow soldiers ‘The Lion of Naushera.’ At the time of the Partition, he was made the offer of becoming the Chief of the Pakistani Army but he chose to stay in India. He left the Baloch regiment of Pakistan and was inducted into the Dogra regiment in India. After the Battle of Naushera, where the Pakistanis suffered heavy casualties at his hands, the same country that had courted him to become the chief of the army, now went ahead and placed prize money of Rs. 50,000 on his head.Brigadier Usman was not just a fierce soldier but also a compassionate man. He never got married and used to donate a large part of his salary to support poor children and pay for their education. This inspiring and exemplary officer of the Indian Army died on July 3, 1948, defending Jhangar. His last words were, “I am dying but let not the territory we were fighting for fall to the enemy.” He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously for his great courage and leadership. 5.Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav  This brave soldier has the high honour of being the youngest recipient of the Param Vir Chakra. He received this award at the age of 19 for his actions on July 4,1999, during the Kargil war. Born in 1980 in Aurangabad Ahir village, Uttar Pradesh, Yadav showed immense courage during the war in 1999. He volunteered for the task of capturing three strategic bunkers on Tiger Hill, which were situated at the top of a vertical, snow-covered, 16,500 feet high cliff face.He was climbing the high cliff with the help of a rope when the enemy bunker started rocket fire. Yadav was hit by three bullets in his groin and shoulder. Despite being severely injured, Yadav kept climbing and finished the remaining 60 feet to reach the top of the cliff. Though in immense pain, Yadav crawled to the first enemy bunker and lobbed a grenade, which killed four Pakistani soldiers and set back the enemy fire. This gave the rest of the Indian platoon the opportunity to climb up the cliff face. However, this was not it. Yadav continued to fight and destroyed the second bunker too with the help of two fellow soldiers. In fact, he also engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy and killed four more Pakistani soldiers. By the time the rest of the Indian platoon arrived, Yadav had already neutralised the enemy attack. This gave Indian soldiers the upper hand and they managed to accomplish one of the toughest missions of the Kargil war – the capture of Tiger Hill.During the second part of the fight, a few more bullets hit Yadav. Some say he was hit by 16 bullets, some say less, but he survived it all. 6.Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat  Words fall short when it comes to telling this brave man’s story. A hero of the 1962 Indo-China war, Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat of the 4th Garhwal Rifles Infantry Regiment is the only soldier in the history of the Indian Army who has risen through the ranks after his death. He was ‘promoted’ to the rank of Major General 40 years after his death, and is still believed to ‘command’ troops guarding India’s eastern frontiers with China.During the 1962 war, soldiers were ordered to vacate their posts as soon as possible due to heavy casualties against the Chinese at the Battle of Nuranang. But Jaswant did not leave his position and continued to fight even after the other soldiers had left. Rawat was helped by two Monpa tribal girls named Sela and Nura. The trio set up weapons at separate points and maintained a volume of fire to make the Chinese believe they were facing a huge battalion. Rawat successfully managed to fool them for three days. But the Chinese found out about the set up through a man who used to supply rations to Rawat and the two girls. At this point, Rawat chose to shoot himself rather than be captured by the Chinese forces. The Chinese were so furious on learning that they had been fighting a single soldier all this time that they cut off Rawat’s head and carried it back to China. The post that Rawat held to repulse the Chinese troops has been renamed Jaswant Garh in recognition of his courage. A small shrine to Rawat has also come up at the battle spot. All army personnel who pass by this route make sure to pay their respects to him here. 7.second lieutenant arun khetarpal  Born in Pune, 2nd Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal of the 17 Poona Horse regiment is yet another braveheart who died too young at the age of 21. He died in the Battle of Basantar during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, where his brave actions earned him the Param Vir Chakra posthumously.Khetarpal showed immense courage and strong will when Pakistani armour, which was superior in strength, counterattacked at Jarpal, in the Shakargarh sector, in December, 1971. Though Khetarpal was in a different squadron, he rushed to help, moving towards the enemy, overrunning the defences with his tanks, and capturing Pakistani infantry and weapons. When the commander of his troops was killed, Khetarpal continued to attack the enemy fiercely until the latter’s tanks started pulling back. Khetarpal even managed to destroy one of the withdrawing tanks. But the enemy reformed their armour and prepared for a second attack. This time they targeted the sector held by Khetarpal. The attack was severe and swift. Khetarpal was wounded but managed to hit 10 enemy tanks. He was asked to abandon his tank but realised that if he left it the enemy would break through. He fought courageously and destroyed another enemy tank. But then his own tank received another hit, which resulted in the death of this courageous officer. 8.major somnath sharma  This brave soldier of Fourth Kumaon regiment sacrificed his life at the young age of 24. With his hand already in plaster from an injury sustained in a hockey game, Sharma insisted on being with his company in combat when they were airlifted to Srinagar on October 30, 1947 to fight Pakistani invaders.On November 3, when Sharma’s company was on a patrol of Badgam village, it was approached by a tribal lashkar of 700 raiders from the direction of Gulmarg. The company was soon surrounded from three sides and endured heavy casualties from the ensuing heavy mortar bombardment. Realising that Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if they abandoned the battle at this point, Sharma ran from post to post, encouraging his men to fight in the face of an enemy that outnumbered them seven to one. When heavy casualties adversely affected their firing power, Sharma, with his left hand in plaster, took to filling the magazines for the men operating light machine guns. While he was busy fighting, a mortar shell exploded on the ammunition near him, killing him instantly. (His last message to Brigade HQ, received a few moments before he was killed, was: “The enemy is only 50 yards from us. We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to our last man and our last round) 9.naik jadunath singh  Naik Jadu Nath Singh, the fourth recipient of the Param Vir Chakra, fought in Jammu and Kashmir in the Indo-Pak war of 1947/48. His presence of mind and bravery saved his post, not just once but thrice, from the enemy. On the crucial day of February 6, 1948, Singh was in command of a forward post at Taindhar. Nine men garrisoned the post. The Pakistanis launched their attack in successive waves to take this post. At this juncture, Singh showed superb leadership and used his small force in such a manner that the enemy retreated in utter confusion. With four wounded men, he re-organised his force to face another onslaught. He did not give in despite being outnumbered. When all his men, himself included, were wounded, he took over the Bren gun from the wounded gunner and continued to fight. The enemy were now on the walls of the post but Singh’s fire was so devastating that the post was saved for a second time.Every one in his post was dead by now. The Pakistanis came in again for a third attack. Wounded and alone, Sharma charged out of his post with his sten gun firing, surprising the enemy and forcing it to flee back in confusion again. But two bullets caught Sharma in the head and chest and this gallant soldier died instantly. 10.Subedar karam singh  Born in Sehna village in the Sangrur District of Punjab, Karam Singh was the first non-posthumous Param Vir Chakra awardee. Singh retired from the Indian Army as Honorary Captain in 1948 and died in 1993 at the age of 77. He is also the only Indian to win the highest medals of both the British and Indian governments.Among his several brave acts, Karam Singh is best known for his courage on 13 October, 1948, when Pakistan decided to launch a brigade attack to retake Richhmar Gali in Kashmir. The firing was so furious that it destroyed almost all the bunkers in the Indian platoon. The communication with the commander was also cut off and Singh could not update his situation or ask for reinforcements. He was left with just one choice – to fight the enemy with whatever little army and weapons he had. The attacks had left Karam Singh severely injured but nothing could deter his spirit. He refused to evacuate the post even when the enemy got very close. When enemy soldiers came even closer, Karam Singh jumped out of his trench and stabbed two intruders to death. His brave act demoralised the enemy so much that they broke off the attack. 11.major ramaswamy parameswaran  Born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, Parameswaran is yet another braveheart who died at the age of 41 in 1987, in India’s Sri Lanka operations. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, posthumously. It was late night when Parameswaran was returning from search operations in Sri Lanka, when his column was suddenly attacked by a group of militants. He did not panic and showed great presence of mind by encircling the enemy from the rear and surprising them with an unexpected attack. During the hand-to-hand combat, a militant shot him in the chest. Undaunted, Major Parameswaran snatched the rifle from the militant and shot him dead. Barely able to stand now, he continued giving orders to his men and inspired them to fight till his last breath. The Indians managed to kill five militants and recovered three rifles and two rocket launchers from the militants. 12.capt pawan kumar  Capt Pawan Kumar was born on January 15, 1993 and hailed from Jind in Haryana. Born on the Indian Army Day (15 Jan), Capt Pawan Kumar nursed the idea of joining the Armed Forces since his younger days. He pursued his interest and got selected to join the prestigious NDA after his schooling. He graduated from the 123 course of the National Defence Academy and joined the Army on December 14, 2013. He got commissioned into the Dogra Regiment, an infantry Regiment known for its gallant soldiers and numerous battle exploits. Capt Pawan Kumar was a die hard soldier and loved adventurous life. Consequently he volunteered to join the elite special forces and got trained as a para commando. In June 2015, he eventually joined 10 Para(SF) battalion, the elite force known as “Desert Scorpions” as officers and jawans of this unit were trained specially for desert warfare. Donning maroon beret and “Balidan” badge, Capt Pawan Kumar was proud to be part of the force that had men of steel, whose physical and mental toughness was beyond compare. Pampore Operation: 20 Feb 2016 During 2016, Capt Pawan Kumar was serving with 10 Par (SF) deployed in J& K for counter insurgency operations. On 20 February 2016, 4 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists armed with AK-47 Assault rifles, hand grenades and explosives attacked a CRPF convoy on the main road linking Srinagar to Jammu, killing two policemen and a civilian. The militants then took refuge in the government-run multi-storey “Entrepreneurship Development Institute” in Pampore. The security forces with elements of Army and Central Reserve Police Force rose to the occasion and cordoned off the building in a joint operation to evacuate civilians from the building. The main objective of the security forces was to evacuate civilians to safety. However the militants responded with automatic gunfire and hand grenades. A fierce gun battle ensued thereafter with heavy exchange of fire from both sides. Capt Pawan Kumar led his men from the front and engaged the militants courageously. During the ensuing battle, Capt Pawan Kumar got hit by bullets and was seriously injured. He later succumbed to his injuries and was martyred, but his gallant action paved the way for the security forces to complete the operation successful. Capt Pawan Kumar was a committed soldier and a brave officer who laid down his life at the age of 23 years in the service of the nation. Capt Pawan Kumar was given the gallantry award, “Shourya Chakra” on 15th Aug 2016 for his exceptional courage, fighting spirit and supreme sacrifice. Capt Pawan Kumar’s last Facebook post read, “Kisiko reservation chahiye to kisiko azadi bhai. Humein kuchh nahin chahiye bhai. Bas apni razai”. (Some want reservation and some want independence. I do not want anything, except my blanket.) After hearing about his son’s death, Capt Pawan Kumar’s father Shri Rajbir Singh’s said , “I had one child, I gave him to the Army, to the nation. No father can be prouder.” “He was destined to be in the Army as he was born on Army Day,” he added. “Capt Pawan Kumar was a young and a dynamic officer, He was a true commander”, Lt. Gen. S.K.

The gist of the matter is, the cohabitation of radically opposed schools of thought within a system virtually indefinitely is not only possible, but eminently sustainable.  As for realism (briefly, realpolitik, “the strong take what they can and the weak suffer as they must”) it is the “insider’s current” in International Relations (IR) because it is the kind of ideology that appeals to self-identified experts and people after authority. When these experts give advice to folks in important “executive and security” positions, they talk to men whose professional life is defined by aggressive competition. These are not social circles in which alternate understandings can proliferate. Off Wiki:  Try to talk to these people about norms and mutual benefit governing policy, I double dog dare you. Mutatis mutandis, philosophies are not “merely” or primarily lens of looking at the world, they are handshakes or languages of certain “cultures.” Or to put it in another way: in most of our experience, what people want and believe is generally reflective of who they are and what they do. People who are managers or psychologists (two professions I’ve found bestow an inescapable “colour” to the personalities of people in them), for example, are likely to approach people in a certain way, process emotions and shape themselves in certain ways, all reflective of their professional position towards other people. As a historian, I’ve looked at (and cringed at) the words of men like Edward Luttwak (The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, or The Rise of China, or Coup d' État: A Practical Handbook) or even Henry Kissinger’s own writing (his laconically named On China deserves a Latin translation, De Sinis). All the stuff one expects to find when people “look at the world”—things like motivations and beliefs, systems of knowledge, or even such trifling limitations as geography and organizational capability (that was Kissinger, by the way) fade into insignificance before the sensation of a “grown-up kid” enthusiastically pushing toy soldiers on a map. The toys are fancy and colorful, not that he’ll admit it. One is left with the realization that one simply does not tell the Emperor that he is enmeshed in a big-picture network of norms and values that regulate the life of states (constructivism) or that mutual benefits, moderation, and openness are normative (liberalism). These may be the medium of exchange in which different Emperors meet and address the masses; but in the privacy of his own room of grand strategy, each of them just wants to get on top of the map and thrust (figuratively, of course). An if you want to be taken seriously within that private space of authority, you have to lubricate the exchange (I mean, speak in terms pleasing to your employer, and offer rewards he finds motivating). This is why constructivist and liberal theories have not a snowball’s chance in hell of becoming dominant in the “inside channel” of IR, while at the same time will never be dispensed with. Insider’s languages are meant to be the bedroom language of authority, not a way of explaining the world. As one now-famous journalist’s experience with the Bush White House went, The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.' [...] 'That's not the way the world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do'.

These new graduates are desperate to work so they are ready to spend 14 hrs in office. But they are well versed with many new technologies. Now compare them to employees with 10–15 years exp, these guys take home salary is 10 folds compared to the new guys, they have family they cannot devote so much of time to office alone and they are technologically less savvy then the new guy who comes in. You as a private employer who have no obligation to retaining anybody what will you do when you only eye profit. Its basic common sense. Just see how many old fellows are there in IT. Very few and most of them are in managerial role. I am a NIT graduate who have been in MNC and Start up. Thing is Indian product based company are just product based for namesake after a point of time they just do servicing of their product if it has successfully made it in market. Most of the time the product could not even make it. With angel taxes removed, huge financial assistance to the startups by incubation centers, these Indian startups just become quick money making store who close their shop once their tax free period finishes leaving the employees high and dry. Indian MNC pay you peanuts and you learn nothing with rampant politics. With Indian startups you do have good pay but how long?? and the politics still persist in Indian start ups as well because they are more at risk and everyone wants to keep things to themselves. I have seen 10+ exp people from the startup I was working, to be practicing Gate questions because they want to get out of it as there was no stability and the daggers were hanging very low for these exp people and they knew it. BTW most of the startups you see in India, they are nothing but training centers some marketing guy just rebranded it to be Ed-Tech. smh!!!! Right now if you want to be a developer you have to know Java/Python/ROR, its framework either spring/Django/Flask, ORM tools, Knowledge of database sql and nosql, cloud services like Azure/GCP/AWS, containerized environment tools like Docker/Kubernetes, Linux commands and ML will be a plus. This is all expected from a 2 years experience for a backend guy. For Full stack add HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS and at least one of its frameworks like node, angular, react. This is just the requirement for 2 years experience with a pay package of 7lpa and then again your future is not secure after 10–12 years. All these happens after you crack a coding interview and questions which are not like your average Armstrong number or conversion of decimal to binary. I can say out loud that IT has given many youngsters like me a job when other streams are not even getting a 7k/month job but long term in IT is not possible. People who are saying only the technically poor are weeded out well that's wrong as someone said even IITians and architects in big companies have to move away for other avenues after crossing that age and favoritism and office politics are also another factors where technically sound and hardworking resources have to face the axe. Gone are the days of onsite opportunities where mass of employees from India were moving onsite to US and permanently settling there. All developed countries are restricting inflow of migrants and PR (Permanent Residency) is becoming more and more difficult. More and more jobs are becoming remote and contractual as you can see up-spurt of various co working space as the new companies are not even investing on offices just renting out space because they know they will soon pack their bags after the tax free period ends. With any other domain your foothold becomes stronger after each passing day as your experience increases but with IT you have a sweet spot of 2–12 years where you can make as much as you want if can keep up with all the above things, where you have to put your heart and soul and yet you have no security afters 35–37 years of age.So many people answering here don’t have experience more than 10 years or are not techies but some management and marketing guys. People who are commenting otherwise have not yet faced it or just trying to defend the indefensible else panic will kick in since it is the bitter reality.

I used to watch his movies as a kid, but he had faded into the background… until 2013, when he vowed to fight terrorism… which made me relook at the man’s history. Steven Seagal has vowed to fight terrorism.  When America took up the war on terror initiative, it was mildly amusing to see an actual global power taking up arms against an abstract concept. It was basically akin to going to war with your inner demon using nothing but a rubber duck and a bazooka.  I wonder if there were any real sane people around when they proposed the initiative “Err… war on what?” “Terror” “You mean terrorists… or extremists…” “No. I mean terror. We will wage a war on terror” “Umm… I’m pretty sure you can’t do that” “Oh, so we have a supporter of terror here. See here, Jimmy. This guy loves terror. Yeah, Dick. This guy right here. Terror lover.” Ok. I guess having a few sane people around wouldn’t have helped. But there again, while the prospect was impossible as a whole, it wasn't entirely directionless. Whether it was justified or not, they did go to war directly, covertly, and dronically. I believe that America, as a nation, is on its way to realizing that wars against conceptual foes are going to be never-ending. But as light dawns on the country, in comes Steven Seagal with his vow to fight terrorism.  For those of you who don’t know him, Steven Seagal is one of the great B list actors out of 80’s and 90’s Hollywood; an action hero with pithy one liners who has such memorable movies under his belt as Under Seige, Under Seige 2, and … and some other movies, I’m sure. He plays a tall, dark, martial arts expert who is quiet and forgiving through endless taunts from the villain until he is pushed ever so slightly over the edge, after which he Kung Fu punches the villain through the head before the credit rolls.  And now, he has made his personal vow to spend his life fighting terrorism. Apparently, Steven realizes that what terrorism needs is a swift ninja kick to the face. I know that at least some of you are thinking “Oh, come on. So here’s a celebrity protesting against terrorists, and you’re making fun of this. Not fair.” Well, it’s one thing for a celebrity to voice protests; another to vow one’s life to fighting terrorism. And let’s not forget we’re talking about Steven friggin’ Seagal here. Let me give a brief intro to the guy. From time to time, he explodes onto the screen with a rampant diarrhea of action fodder – Above the Law, Hard to Kill, Below the Belt, Out for Justice, Out of Reach, Out for a Kill, Out to Lunch, Into the Sun, Over the Hill, at least some of which are titles I haven’t made up… For sure, he has had lots of mainstream action hits (‘lots of’ in this context meaning ‘about three’), but the large majority of his fare goes direct to TV, under the radar (Note: Under the Radar may be the title of another Steven Seagal movie; I don’t know if anyone keeps track). Perhaps it's because of the free time he’s saved up not being an actor, but he’s decided to take up being a badass as a career choice. He’s an Aikido-trained martial artist, a picture that feels odd considering that most of his fights on screen looked like 'unsynchronized arm flapping by a giant guy'. In most movies, the fighting techniques he displayed were absolutely unique – he defeats his opponents using the ancient, oriental art of being a 6’4”giant. But that doesn’t matter; he’s the ultimate badass.  He's a man of many talents - He is a businessman, is recognized by Tibetan monks as a spiritual reincarnation (tulku) of a buddhist master, is a PETA award winning animal rights activist who wrote to the Thailand leadership for better treatment of baby elephants, and to the Indian Prime minister for better treatment of cows (keep in mind that cows are already considered holy in India). I like to think his letters were short and open ended. ""Treat your cows better. Or else..."" In real life, he also speaks fluent Japanese. At least, he speaks Japanese which no Japanese has pointed out as less than fluent. I often think of him as a walking metaphor for confusion. He obviously thought that squinty eyes = awesome acting, and promptly started on a career in the movies. Later on in life, he further got confused about what a musician does, picked up a guitar and started calling himself a musician. He is also as graceful a dancer as he is a martial artist. Shown below is a clip of him displaying his dancing technique… or his martial art technique – pretty sure it’s one or the other.  And he continues to labor under these misunderstandings because nobody bothered to correct him, and nobody bothered to correct him because, as I have mentioned on occasion before, he is 6’4” and looks like this –  I also believe nobody has sat him down to talk about the differences between reel and real life either, so he’s gone on to train real life law enforcers and volunteer security forces on how to tackle simulated shooting sprees. Seagal also serves as a reserve deputy chief in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, where he routinely fights crime by chasing criminals and hoping they run in slow motion. He also trains real life MMA fighters, having taken credit for a special kicking style which took the MMA world by storm at one point. When retired MMA fighter Randy Couture said jokingly that he would come out of retirement only to fight Segal, Segal continued his commitment to misunderstandings; he confused Randy’s joke for a serious challenge and publicly declared acceptance, saying he’d take on Randy anytime, any place, but ominously added that there will not have witnesses to the fight, and that he would not play by any rules.  And now, the man has taken on terrorism. There are no polls taken to measure the effects of his statement, so I’m forced to assume that terrorism has dipped by at least half within seconds of Steven getting into the frey. And I expect it to dip further – terrorism will cower in fear behind its ugly sisters – hate and prejudice. I’ve seen enough Seagal movies to know what happens next. Seagal will punch hate in the face, swish a knife through prejudice’s torso, and kick away the table revealing the cowardly villain, terror. At this point, terror will start saying stuff like ‘It’s already too late’, ‘You can’t do anything to stop me’, or ‘I’ve waited a long time for this. You’re going down, Steven!'. At this cue, Steven Seagal will furrow his brow, make a snappy comeback (which may not necessarily make sense in this or any context), and tear off terror’s arms. He would then break terror’s back on his knee and then walk away in slow motion.  And that would be the end of terror... until the sequel, of course.

Vegetables are low calorie, high in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They're not only great for a healthy, well-balanced diet, but filling up on these nutrient-dense foods can help support your weight loss. 2. Choose lean protein. Many popular weight loss diets promote higher amounts of lean protein. Studies also show that protein may help support weight loss and manage your appetite. 3. Limit carbs. Many celebrity and model diets focus on limiting carbs. This might be a good idea as studies have shown lower carb diets produce faster weight loss. 4. Skip the alcohol. Whenever you're trying to lose weight, it's a smart idea to cut out any unnecessary calories. Model and celebrity diets say to ditch the alcohol. 5. Drink a ton of water. Water is essential to any healthy diet. However, adequate hydration is also essential to weight loss. Exercising Like a Model 1. Take more steps each day. Some models and celebrities have helped increase their calorie burn by increasing how many steps they take each day. Every extra step can help burn more calories. 2. Workout with a friend. Many models and celebrities are seen working out together. When you're exercising with a friend, studies show you're more likely to stick with your workout routine. 3. Exercise in the morning. Celebrity trainers have recommended working out in the morning instead of the afternoon or evenings. 4. Do regular strength training. Models and celebrities always seem to have defined and toned muscles. Including regular strength training can also help you achieve a similar look.

For the same reason I recommend summary books instead of papers, my favorites at the time being: Predictably IrrationalInfluence — The Psychology of PersuasionOgilvy on Advertising (this is an unusual one but advertising is very relevant)But to illustrate the point, I’m going to take you over a sample of the Wikipedia list and offer some things designers would do with knowledge of that bias as they pop into my mind.  Ambiguity effect: The tendency to avoid options for which missing information makes the probability seem ""unknown"". Dark patterns — make the most user-centric option have the least information if it’s legally required to have. Anchoring or focalism: The tendency to rely too heavily, or ""anchor"", on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject) Used heavily in e-commerce. Comparing say a monthly subscription to a cup of coffee. Anthropomorphism or personification: The tendency to characterize animals, objects, and abstract concepts as possessing human-like traits, emotions, and intentions. Mascots, clippy when done wrong but works for kids’ software really well. Attentional bias: The tendency of our perception to be affected by our recurring thoughts. Used often in gaming. Introduce a concept and repeat it. People get stuck thinking in that way and find it hard to “think outside the box” Availability heuristic: The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater ""availability"" in memory, which can be influenced by how recent the memories are or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be. Referencing something that’s common knowledge in popular culture. Availability cascade: A self-reinforcing process in which a collective belief gains more and more plausibility through its increasing repetition in public discourse (or ""repeat something long enough and it will become true""). Repeating your value proposition as many times as possible. Bandwagon effect: The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Related to groupthink and herd behavior. Extremely common, counts in like buttons and social proof with faces of your friends. Cheerleader effect: The tendency for people to appear more attractive in a group than in isolation. Group dating products Confirmation bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. Used heavily in copywriting, position the pitch to align with people’s mistaken beliefs and fill out weak supporting evidence. Contrast effect: The enhancement or reduction of a certain perception's stimuli when compared with a recently observed, contrasting object. Understanding visual contrast is an underpinning of all visual design. Courtesy bias: The tendency to give an opinion that is more socially correct than one's true opinion, so as to avoid offending anyone. This varies by culture and influences how you write copy for things like content actions. Decoy effect: Preferences for either option A or B change in favor of option B when option C is presented, which is similar to option B but in no way better. This is a special case of anchoring. It’s used to sell travel packages often. Disposition effect: The tendency to sell an asset that has accumulated in value and resist selling an asset that has declined in value. Hugely important to know if you’re building an investment product, e.g. Wealthfront. Endowment effect: The tendency for people to demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it. Fear of loss of the familiar. This is why people complain so much when the design of a product they use a lot changes. Identifiable victim effect: The tendency to respond more strongly to a single identified person at risk than to a large group of people at risk. GoFundMe IKEA effect: The tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on objects that they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA, regardless of the quality of the end result. This applies to people who self-assemble their computers as well. Information bias: The tendency to seek information even when it cannot affect action. Product description pages, especially for more expensive products have a huge long-tail of information about the product.  Anyway, I can keep going forever at this rate and I’m only at 9/26 alphabets of just the first list of biases and my fingers are getting tired and you’re probably getting bored. Hopefully that helps illustrate that going wide is really important for a designers. Obviously, you’ll use some more than others but having many of these lenses to look through is going to serve you really well in the long-term. So pick the ones that seem most interesting to your field and dive deep from there. The Wikipedia articles usually reference the original study.

Well, it could be alarming to know that due to an improper design methodology, even a demanding and valuable digital product could drastically fail. Hence, the importance of design. Don't you worry, I'll in my answer how to work on that.  The design has a large number of definitions for each of its fields of application. In the context of your question, it is a methodology for solving a functional problem with a proper solution. The design draws its inspiration from Software Engineering. The discussion on that could make this answer unnecessarily long, so let us confine here to the understanding of digital product design with the following example. Suppose somebody wishes to get a large number of visitors to his website. For that, he could search the internet and use the methods learned after studying from there. A digital product as a solution to the problem could be an e-book or an online course, which could save him time by offering all the possible solutions in a single place. Such a digital product would be perfect and useful if that meets its purpose. For that, as a designer, one should have sound knowledge of the relevant field the product is serving. Nowadays, the role of product design skills has come into the mainstream. To help visualize all this, some examples of factors to consider when designing a digital product are: · What is the target audience? · How difficult is it to use/learn to use? If it's a course, how much time will it take? · What makes the product relevant and unique to the market? How long will the product stay that way? · What is the core, singular purpose the product serves? This is called the golden thread. · Is the product priced affordably for the market, but high enough that you aren't undercutting your value? · How accessible is the product for different devices, different media preferences (video, text, audio), etc? · How connected is the product to other products, to potentially get upsell and cross-sell sales? If you would follow a proper, proven methodology for digital product design, then that product could give more value and perform better in terms of its sales. The reason for mentioning sales here is that as a supplier, promoter, or a designer of that product, everyone would be concerned about its sales performance. A design methodology contributes to making a perfect digital product. How could anyone create a perfect digital product? For that, either I could suggest you the necessary tips, or I could discuss the methodology that I follow. To keep my answer to the point, I would prefer to discuss the methodology I follow. I apply the Perfect Product Creation for that. It is an hour-long video program teaching you how to build an awesome digital product, such as an online course or tool, regardless of your niche or whether you have experience in eCommerce. The program focuses on building and launching a great product that practically sells itself, getting you the maximum amount of buyers for your hard work. My experience with that has been amazing so far. I would recommend my post on that as it could help you understand digital product design with the help of illustrations that I have used there. To cover all those additional details in this answer won't be possible as that has hyperlinks for better understanding. To read that post, you can visit my website mach5trafficDOTcom. You can also stay updated with my Quora profile, where I discuss various digital products frequently, such as One Minute Free Traffic for free website traffic, List Warrior for email list building, etc. In the end, I would say: As a well-designed outfit adds to your personality, so too does design to a digital product.

Thank you for visiting our profile on fiverr.——————————————————————————————————go to Fiverr > & search karuzone—————————————————————————————————— Digital product design is an iterative design process used to solve a functional problem with a formal solution. A digital product designer identifies an existing problem, offers the best possible solution, and launches it to a market that demonstrates demand for the particular solution. The field is considered a subset of product design. Digital product design is a transdisciplinary field because a digital product designer sees the project from end-to-end; from recognizing an opportunity and understanding the customer's need through to final delivery. A digital product designer is an integral part of the creative team at every stage of the process who leads the UI and UX design throughout, and is also involved in the product strategy with an entrepreneurial mindset to help get it to the market. Although computer programming is not a required skill for a digital product designer, digital product designers need to have a high-level understanding of how all of the technical pieces work together in order to ensure that the creative vision is fully realized. Digital product designers who are able to code are far more likely to succeed in this career field. Although part of a digital product designer's job is to oversee the look and feel of the product as well as the development of the software system, digital product design is a different creative process and career path from graphic design and web design. ———————————————————————————————————— To get premium business logo for your brand go to Fiverr > & search karuzone ————————————————————————————————————- Check our creative portfolio-     I hope this will be so helpful to you.If you need more info please keep in touch at go to Fiverr > & search karuzone Bybyyy, takecare & namaste.

Beyond that, the following factors should be considered while designing a digital product: · What is your target audience and what do they want? As stated above. · How much time and effort is the design process going to take, and how much of that you are willing to skip past with money? · How long could you expect to make money off this idea? · Is the process affordable at your current income?

What are tangible/intangible effects? Talk to customers. Talk to support, marketing, sales, etc.What would it cost to address the problem? What are the potential upsides to addressing it?What approach do you want to take? Fix the existing design? Throw it away?Once you have information, then it becomes much easier to talk about prioritization, scoping, and allocation of resources, just as you would with any other project.  ""Fast moving"" - this phrase is really problematic for me because it's almost always used in a thoughtless manner to explain away any and all problems. ""Why did this bad thing happen?"" ""Oh we were moving fast."" ""Why don't you do this best practice."" ""We move fast here."" ""This is a concern I have."" ""We're moving too fast."" etc. Often times teams are too busy ""moving fast"" to see if they are heading in the right direction. As it relates to design debt - perhaps the implication is that fast moving teams don't have time to fix things, only build new things. I think the easiest way to address this is to bring it back to a question of prioritization. Compare fixing design debt to building feature X or fixing bug Y. That should lead the team in the right direction. It could very well be that the right thing to do is to not fix design debt. Caveats: Prioritization is hard. The right thing to do is not always obvious. Having experienced people who are good at this is very helpful. If design debt does end up getting put off after thorough evaluation, set up periodic checkpoints to revisit it.I’m assuming all the people/teams are generally working towards the same goal. I recognize that a lot of companies have internal structures/politics which might render this answer useless.I’m also assuming the question pertains to design debt that is large enough to require a separate project. If it is small enough, incremental fixes can be rolled into regular development work. I think the right approach is almost completely dependent on the team and circumstances. I will give one answer, but I don’t think it should be taken as the only answer. The first step is to understand what you are dealing with: What is the nature of the design debt? Is it more along the lines of ""We have 10 different date pickers across the site"" or ""This major flow no longer makes sense because we've overloaded it for the past 2 years.""How does this negatively affect the customers/company?

Well, it could be alarming to know that due to an improper design methodology, even a demanding and valuable digital product could drastically fail. Hence, the importance of design. Don't you worry, I'll in my answer how to work on that.  The design has a large number of definitions for each of its fields of application. In the context of your question, it is a methodology for solving a functional problem with a proper solution. The design draws its inspiration from Software Engineering. The discussion on that could make this answer unnecessarily long, so let us confine here to the understanding of digital product design with the following example. Suppose somebody wishes to get a large number of visitors to his website. For that, he could search the internet and use the methods learned after studying from there. A digital product as a solution to the problem could be an e-book or an online course, which could save him time by offering all the possible solutions in a single place. Such a digital product would be perfect and useful if that meets its purpose. For that, as a designer, one should have sound knowledge of the relevant field the product is serving. Nowadays, the role of product design skills has come into the mainstream. To help visualize all this, some examples of factors to consider when designing a digital product are: · What is the target audience? · How difficult is it to use/learn to use? If it's a course, how much time will it take? · What makes the product relevant and unique to the market? How long will the product stay that way? · What is the core, singular purpose the product serves? This is called the golden thread. · Is the product priced affordably for the market, but high enough that you aren't undercutting your value? · How accessible is the product for different devices, different media preferences (video, text, audio), etc? · How connected is the product to other products, to potentially get upsell and cross-sell sales? If you would follow a proper, proven methodology for digital product design, then that product could give more value and perform better in terms of its sales. The reason for mentioning sales here is that as a supplier, promoter, or a designer of that product, everyone would be concerned about its sales performance. A design methodology contributes to making a perfect digital product. How could anyone create a perfect digital product? For that, either I could suggest you the necessary tips, or I could discuss the methodology that I follow. To keep my answer to the point, I would prefer to discuss the methodology I follow. I apply the Perfect Product Creation for that. It is an hour-long video program teaching you how to build an awesome digital product, such as an online course or tool, regardless of your niche or whether you have experience in eCommerce. The program focuses on building and launching a great product that practically sells itself, getting you the maximum amount of buyers for your hard work. My experience with that has been amazing so far. I would recommend my post on that as it could help you understand digital product design with the help of illustrations that I have used there. To cover all those additional details in this answer won't be possible as that has hyperlinks for better understanding. To read that post, you can visit my website mach5trafficDOTcom. You can also stay updated with my Quora profile, where I discuss various digital products frequently, such as One Minute Free Traffic for free website traffic, List Warrior for email list building, etc. In the end, I would say: As a well-designed outfit adds to your personality, so too does design to a digital product.

If you are just hiring a single designer, your real strategy would be to find someone in-house to do the majority of the design and to find a “guru” that can double check/give ideas/inspire the designs. Have bi-monthly check-ins with the guru and that will give your design process some stability. It will also save money in the long run by not having to hire someone like me full-time (I get paid much more than that). The real answer to your question is, if you are only hiring one person, to hire someone in house that is “good enough” and then hiring a guru to validate their designs once or twice a month.

However, when the daughter found out about the tablet, she played back some footage with a sort of a wheel-like interface which allowed her to go into the device’s archive.

If you have had some good internship experience, freelance work, side projects, the starting salary can be in the range of 10–15 lakhs. With relevant experience and domain expertise, it's possible to draw a CTC of above 20 lakhs after 2–5 years. But, this is only the case with the 'true UX designers' who know their craft. With the mushrooming of pseudo-design schools like ImaginXP and Design Boat, the overall standard is going down. People are calling themselves UX designers after attending a 6-week weekend bootcamp (IITs and other institutes must be insane to run a 4-year full-fledged course if it required you just 6 weeks to master it). However, the 'graduates' from these schools get paid accordingly. Starting pay would be around 4–6 lakh per annum which could go upto 10 lakhs in some years if the person is really hard-working and develops the necessary UX design skills over the time.

What need is it serving? 2: Not defining your target audience This step comes down to answering a few key questions, as well. Make sure to ask yourself things like: Who is most likely to use this new product? How big is this market? What are the most effective ways to reach this group? 3: Not developing a full-fledged marketing plan and launch strategy Once you’ve established a value proposition for your new product and defined the core audience, it’s time to develop an in-depth marketing plan and launch strategy. The key thing here is detail. Simply outlining a few ideas and channels—“we’re going to have a party, then do some search engine marketing, social media promotion, and maybe radio”—is not enough. 4: Failing to schedule properly Speaking of timelines, one of the biggest product launch mistakes made by businesses is poor scheduling. To keep everything running smoothly, make sure to clearly assign responsibility and regularly track deliverables. This can be done via any number of project management/productivity tools on the market. 5: Failing to soft-launch/beta test While businesses understandably want to rush to market with fresh offerings, it’s invaluable to build in time for a lengthy soft-launch period. This can be done with beta offerings for digital products, tester versions for physical products, and even sneak-peeks for brick-and-mortar businesses. 6: Not tracking performance closely post-launch and prepping for different outcomes Finally, here’s something to know right off the bat: Product launches never go exactly according to plan, and that’s okay. However, it’s not okay if you don’t know what’s happening post-launch and aren’t prepared to deal with new events. To avoid this, make sure to closely monitor performance and contingency plan as much as possible.

Whenever it's about making impact on society everyone talks about leaders, socialist, etc. and sometimes when it's about influencing people or masses maybe about movies and books and etc. It is rare to see a discussion about a designer’s role. But indeed those who understand, Designers do play great role in shaping the society and that also not only from the view of infrastructure (which most people can think) but also from the aspects of lifestyle and mentality. Why? Because,“Design creates Impression and Perception “ It’s not only about just solving a problem or making something appear or look good and beautiful. It is in fact about finding the best solution while creating something or making it better, and just like any leader, a designer always takes care of the requirements and comforts of every user or consumer and then finds the easiest, simplest and yet, the most efficient “WAY” to get something done. This “WAY” is called The Design. And, It is design which made ELECTRONICS from a Geeky Gadget to ‘a Simple personal sophisticated emotional possession.’It is design which made CARS your love and gave it value it today has.It is design which has made our lifestyle and living so comfortable and systematic.( Suggestions are welcome to increase this list. ) So to say Design does influences people and, anything that can influence people can make an impact on society.And as Mario Correa mentioned above“The impact of the surroundings definitely changes the way we programme our day to day lifestyles”Hence It can make changes in society and can make it even better and there should be no doubts about it at all . In the end I would like to Repeat.  “Design is not only about just solving a problem or making something look good and beautiful. It’s rather about creating influence and doing something the best way it could be or it should be done.”",2021-03-06T23:18:07.213Z,"How do technological advances of animation affect product design placement of brand wearable items that extend its reach in a digitally consumerist society?

Now an Engineer or designer seems to immediately foster the idea that you are a programmer or work in computer science. (Bare with me, almost to the point). The point, that as engineers we understand the multitude of types of engineers necessary to bring a product to completion. So, despite my initial frustration, the answer is the same for all designers and engineers. Julie is absolutely correct that you don't have to be an expert in the intricacies, but the better understanding you have the better you will be at your job. All products must be designed from the inside out once the objective or need has been established.  If the outside or boundaries are too confining the entire process will be stifled. There is also the flip side, if the designer knows too much about the intricacies this my stifle there ability to say, what if? This is what often makes engineers poor designers. believe for an engineer and designer to occupy the same body is quite rare. At Adept, Inc.

While the skill sets of a UX designer are fairly consistent across different businesses and context - a ""Product"" designer typically works within the context of a technology product company. I personally hate the term UI designer - it couches the work in the most superficial terms - what the software looks like. My peers who do the visual design or implement an interface are visual designers (VX or VXD). They design visual systems that create clarity, coherence and consistency within the interface.   The notion of a DIGITAL product designer (Industrial Designers get quite pissed when UX people refer to themselves as product designers - we don't design manufactured goods, that's a whole different level of voodoo) really originated on the West Coast, inside major tech companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Adobe, etc.  It was in those companies where digital product design became multidisciplinary as software and hardware became more integrated and systematized. The product design process involves real user research, and collaboration among multiple design disciplines (visual, interaction, industrial, research, etc). We work as peers to product managers and engineers and are deeply integrated into their work.  Product designers are intimately involved with the definition and specification of products, not simply the decoration.  It is not easy work, in fact, it can be quite grueling to go through an entire ship cycle of a product, especially when it involves hardware or devices. There are SO many technical dependencies, roadmap alignment, endless bugs, shifts in strategy, lots of arguments, and changes. Many designers that came up in a consulting or agency environment struggle with the unrelenting pace and focus of working on the same project or problem for years at a time.  The longest I ever worked on a single project is 2.5 years from concept to release on a 1.0. A short project in my world is closer to 3-6 months. That's what product design entails.   An experienced product designer needs to develop more than just solid design skills. They need to be adept at visualizing their ideas, selling and pitching, have a solid technical grounding and the ability to ""speak the lingo"" with engineers, and savvy enough to couch their design solutions in terms of strategy, metrics and business goals.  The up side is that you get to see your work go live in the world, see feedback and metrics on how well it performs and even fix mistakes. You're invested in the outcome in a way that just isn't possible from the outside.  As a consultant, you can do a lot of great work, beautiful blue sky work, etc - but for me, nothing compares with putting your stamp on something your users love.  So while many UX designers are product designers, most are not.  Being a product designer is more a function of the nature of the company you work at, and what you work on while you're there. Not necessarily.

Product design is about creating artistic product - taking ideas from scratch to finished solutions, most often sold as designer items in quantities of 1 or 2 pieces of finished quality. As a product designer it is not mandatory to have knowledge on manufacturing processes or producing CAD drawings. These products tend to be artistic manifestations and fit within novelty territory. Industrial design is about creating ideas for mass production, i.e, creating concepts that can be manufactured and be sold. Therefore it requires a bit more work in transferring and customising designs (product designs) to make it ready for manufacturing. You require knowledge of manufacturing processes and operations in order to do your work. Some key highlights Product design can be considered to be a subset of Industrial design.Industrial design can include - product design, furniture design, footwear, and in certain cases fashion and interior design.You can survive in product design without technical knowledge, but you definitely need to have technical/engineering knowledge to be an industrial designer. Unless you are doing early concept works.In industrial design you also learn about business aspects, in order to customise the products to match the business and market needs.In general, product design is more about creating solutions, industrial design is creating solutions and taking them to manufacturing. An industrial designer can be a product designer, but a product designer cannot be industrial designers. concept ———product———production———market product designer ——————————— industrial designer ————————————————————————— (previous answer) Product design is a subset of the industrial design. Industrial design deals with any manufacturable/produceable product, i.e. is requires industry processes and operations. It also covers the whole lifecycle - from initial research to manufacturing. These designers also work on producing manufacturing drawings and redesign for manufacturing operations. Product design deals with developing concepts from research to renderings and prototypes. It is one part of the whole lifecycle, primarily in the initial phase. These designers in principle are not involved in working with the manufacturing activities and handover the designs to them. But since there is overlap, most people and in the industry use the terms interchangeably. Further there are people from engineering side who also use similar or same terms. to summarise, industrial design is more of whole lifecycle focused on end-to-end design activities while product design is focused on conceptual designs and developments. UPDATE: a more concise answer is that: Product Design is focused on products , its design and development. It is more focused on the users, the product and the interaction between them. Product designers can be seen working with users and the product-systems Industrial Design is taking ideas from concepts to business integration. It is focused on the users, the products and the systems, the interaction and service in regard to the business value. The difference is in the business integration, which is mostly in form of CAD and manufacturing drawings, service design and system design. Industrial designers can be seem working more in relation to business operations and translation of designs into business value.",2021-03-06T23:24:37.758Z,"What is the difference between product design and industrial design?

The machine learning technology improves with the volume of data as it helps in predictions of the product and its features. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence and it helps out ease the processes. An example- A new flavour of an energy drink is to be invented.Based on the different ingredients and the tastes and preferences of the target audiences with their age and the location that they stay in, their cultural food and taste-bud preferences are all collected in a computer system.Through machine learning, we can analyse all this data and create a blueprint product design, for the look, and feel as per the requirements of the company and the preferences of the design it is much easier and quicker for analyzing the outcome. The digitization of tools has helped revolutionalize the way we work and hence the product design and management space is also one sector that has largely benefitted with the machine learning technological advancements. With the help of the algorithm mathematical model is built from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. Machine learning can help understand behavioural and demographical data which can help in predicting end-user behaviour and hence the organisation will benefit in the process cycle from ideation to delivery of the products.With the help of machine learning systems, building a fully automated factory as and how we want it, is possible and we can operate all of the same with the computer systems and algorithms.An organisation wants greater outcomes in the quality and quantity of its products and the fewer the errors and greater the productivity will help us get better insights in the least amount of time with greater efficiency.To conclude, machine learning is changing the product design world. If you are enthusiastic about product management, you can look out for online courses that will help you understand more about how the products are designed and how product management works in a technologically advanced world. There are many online platforms like Teachable, skillshare and one source that I am personally aware of is upGrad.

Web Design  Image Source: Google Web designers today are usually modern era graphic designers trained in visual design to be experts in: Creative concepting Color theory Typography Icon development Diagrams Infographics Interactivity, i.e., rollovers, drop-down me nus, digital slideshows, call-to-action buttons and forms. A web designer may have basic knowledge of information architecture (IA), HTML and JavaScript coding, but most designers must partner with a web developer for writing code fit for production and an information architect for the IA. The web designer is also focused on the client's brand from both a visual and messaging perspective. UX Design  Image Source: Google UX is the acronym for ""User Experience."" UX design brings a decidedly left brain component to a digital experience and may encompass the design of apps or other software products as well as websites. While a good web designer is focused on the end user's experience, the UX designer takes it to the next level and applies a specific methodology around the user. A strong focus on UX may be a good fit for websites of some complexity due to: Multiple user types Multiple products or services catering to different audiences Size of the website Merger or acquisition UI Design  Image Source: Google UI stands for User Interface, which comes out of the software world in which the User Interface of a product IS the product. UI designers traditionally are experts in designing machine to human interfaces. The adage ""Form Follows Function"" is the operating principal in UI Design. With regard to websites, UI Design is more synonymous with front-end development, i.e., managing complex information, tasks and workflows and distilling it into screens and flows that are intutitive and make something complex appear simple. In essence, UI Design represents the intersection of programming and design. Different jobs, different salaries  Image Source: Google Now that you fully understand the difference between all three terms, let’s have a look at career prospects. You may be wondering how much a UX, UI or web designer earns and whether it will influence your decision. We’ll use PayScale for salary indications, but you can also use Glassdoor if you want a second opinion. Salary of UX designer: UK: £31,000 | US: $95,000 | Australia: AU$70,607 | India: Rs 609,379 Salary of UI designer: UK: £29,293 | US: $85,832 | Australia: AU$63,182 | India: Rs 405,211 Salary of web designer: UK: £22,860 | US: $48,495 | Australia: AU$52,595 | India: Rs 229,873 You can see that UX designers earn more than the two others. But don’t make it be your one and only reason why you choose this career path over the others. At the end of the day, you’ll want to be happy in your job and that’s why you need to pick the one that meets your wishes best.",2021-03-06T23:32:02.342Z,"What is the difference between a UX and UI designer and a web designer?

Is your neck tilted too much? Algorithms crunch the raw data from the sensor and tell you how to adjust your body to achieve ergonomic correctness. The monitor can also inform you that it’s time to stand up and take a break, and it will automatically power down when it senses that you’ve left. PEACE!!

Dan, a product designer at WalkMe, answers just that. He gives us a sneak peek at the toolbox his team uses to consistently push the product design envelope. WalkMe Team: Tell us a bit about yourself and your role at WalkMe. Dan: After graduating with a B.A in industrial design, I started my career at some of the leading advertising agencies in the world. Now, I’m a product designer at WalkMe, a role that combines both UI & UX design. WalkMe Team: What professional resources do you read? Favorite blogs/websites/magazines? Dan: There are tons of professional resources out there but there are only a few that I keep track of. They include Medium, Smashing Magazine, and 2 blogs named Hacking UI and Pixel Perfect Magazine. In addition, I follow 2 thought leaders in the digital design field with vast amounts of knowledge, Sagi Shraiber and Lior Yair. WalkMe Team: What’s been keeping you busy in the last month? Dan: We are currently working on redesigning WalkMe’s core product, the WalkMe Editor. It’s a super challenging and time-consuming process, but it’s also very exciting. Stay tuned!  “For me, a well-designed product is one that gets me emotionally involved. I love design that can create a strong reaction…” WalkMe Team: How would you describe good product design? Dan: For me, a well-designed product is one that gets me emotionally involved. I love design that can create a strong reaction, and of course should always have great usability and value. WalkMe Team: Where do you get your ideas/inspiration from? Dan: For inspiration and ideas my go to’s are Dribbble or Muzli (they are both on my homepage). WalkMe Team: How do you go about personalizing design for a large audience? Dan: Personalizing design for a large audience is always a challenge but if you can successfully keep your users in mind when designing a product, you are sure to come out ahead. At WalkMe, we do this by creating different personas that represent our user base. This process is critical because each persona helps us stay focused on our customers’ needs as we create new features. WalkMe Team: Technology is evolving so fast. How do you manage these changes and use them to your advantage when it comes to design? Dan: Staying on top of design trends, UX methods and new technology is not an easy task with the pace technology is evolving. However, I try to read often and attend community meetups where new ideas are shared. From there I am able to gain an outside perspective. WalkMe Team: How do you gather customer feedback in order to improve your product and its design? Do you work with other departments to gather this feedback and implement the results? Dan: One of the great benefits for product designers at WalkMe is that we have a lot of power users inside the company (professional services, customer success managers, sales), which makes the process of iterating design and new ideas very easy and quick. In addition, we try to make contact with our customers at least once a week in order to learn and share the insights and feedback with each other. At the end of the day, the design of the product is for the user, not just the visual aesthetics for you and me.

So, to understand how to become a Digital Product Manager, let’s focus on what makes them different. First of all, the Product. Physical products, such as televisions, books, computers, DVDs etc. are very different from Digital products, such as ebooks, audio or video contents etc., that can be downloaded and immediately used upon payment for instant gratification. This product immateriality has got huge consequences for marketing and brand building, because it has changed the whole value chain of digital products: from supply to manufacturing, from marketing to distribution it can be managed in a fully-virtual environment. And it has changed the way a Digital Product Manager has to set his strategy to market. The principal effects can be reassumed in the following points:  _Integrated Digital Approach: this approach allows to communicate a digital product value to consumers in a much more efficient way. Furthermore, digital channels can be used not only in marketing, but in gathering trends, feedback, collaborative filtering and consumer's wants before developing the product. These data can be easily tagged and classified in ERP and CRM systems to be used in operations, marketing and distribution; _Marketing strategy more focused on results and growth: digital products usually have a shorter life cycle which means a faster, more focused and aggressive marketing campaigns fully oriented to results and growth. This can better allocate your marketing dollars into other communication channels and increase your marketing ROI; _Overall user experience as main objective: digital products allow an experience that cover every step in digital customer lifecycle, from research to comparison, from selection to purchasing and retention, to fidelity. It’s also very easy to offer samples at almost no cost, unlike the expensive non-digital products sampling, making easier to engage customers also at very early stages. Main activities. Digital Product Managers have to oversee the development of the digital product, from its inception to its launch. The Digital environment gives them huge availability of market data. By combining their creative vision with market research skills, they can manage existing products by identifying ways to enhance them based on public perception, planning out successful product launch campaigns, reaching out to consumers and finding out what they look for in digital products. They act as mediators between the consumers and the technical teams, communicating consumer needs and translating those needs into new product features for the team to design. Place. Depending on Company’s structure and internal organization, many Digital Product Managers have the ability to work remotely being the activity mostly web-based. Main internal contact persons. Digital Product Managers have to be in constant touch with a variety of other professionals. Most important ones are: Digital Content ManagersContent Production ManagersProduct DevelopersTechnical teamsSkills and qualifications. Because their job is more technical than other marketing careers, Digital Product Managers must have a solid understanding of web development, from coding to design. It is not required a degree in computer science, but they should be able to perform basic web maintenance to keep their sites functioning and SEO optimized. Digital Product Managers are primarily strategists and planners, so a bachelor's degrees in marketing and economics is highly favored. In addition to formal education, most Digital Product Managers obtain between 5-7 years of experience in Product Design and Marketing before moving up. Summing up, the principal differences of Digital Product Managers from traditional ones are: More inbound marketing actions to make the brand/product being easily found on digital channels;Digital product value chain fully digital integrated;Strategy more focused to results and aggressive marketing campaigns due to shorter LTV;Ability to exploit all possibilities of digital channels to create a more fulfilling digital customer experience;Very easy ways to let digital product be tested by prospects;Capacity to spread the message on digital channels through word-of-mouse/mouth and create viral messages to foster engagement even at early stages;More flexibility to work in Agile Management;Different internal contact persons to stay connected with during overall process;More technical skills required;Previous solid experience in Product Marketing in traditional market is highly recommended.Best luck with your transformation into a Digital Product Manager!",2021-03-06T23:42:06.793Z,"How do I become a digital product manager?

Product design is considered a critical, strategic discipline on the West Coast. Everyone from seed round startups to Google places a premium on design talent. All the major consumer technology firms place a very high premium on 'product' designers. In that context, product and UX get a little blurry. Digital product design shares many of the same tools and skills as an Agency UX, but the approach and process is completely different.  If the company also makes hardware (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc) they also place a premium on people with physical product experience. On the East Coast, design is increasingly seen as important, but product design isn't nearly as established as it is on the West Coast. I believe this is largely a legacy of the large agency culture around New York and other large cities.  If you're interested in being a product designer, you're best served moving to the SF Bay Area, Seattle. NYC has some decent opportunities in Brooklyn and there are some strong practices as places like Bloomberg, but the scene is still dominated by agencies that are still trying to figure out how to do product without changing the way they do business (a waterfall process, highly dependent on approvals and a pre-defined scope of work).  There are a number of small cities producing great startups, but you should always be considering the long-term career growth opportunities in the area.",2021-03-06T23:46:45.823Z,"What are some tech companies that place high value on product designers?

Also, extensive research over the last few years has established a strong business case for the value of design. One example, by the Design Management Institute, revealed that design-led companies like Apple and Nike have maintained significant stock market advantage, outperforming the S&P by an impressive 211 percent. As a result, we've seen a shift in business priorities for many forward-thinking organizations where design is making significant impacts. However, it’s important to know that design-driven companies are built upon the company culture, not just staffing designers, and many startups make this mistake when hiring their first product designers. That said, especially if you're a young company, here’s 3 signs that you’re not ready to hire a designer yet: 1. You just want to make things look pretty. Steve Jobs said it best: ""Design is not just how it looks, but how it works."" Design has been historically associated with graphic design as a function for marketing and branding--and that association continues despite the changing role of design in technology. I've been amazed at how often design is assumed to serve as decoration--so much bad design is simply decoration. Design is more than an artistic craft. It's a strategic tool for achieving business objectives. In order to design great products, services or campaigns, you need to understand not just what you're making, but why you're making it and for whom. You do that by empathizing with your customers to feel their pain, understand their problems and motivations, and solve for those needs. Context is a designer's ammunition, and designers are ineffective unless they have a clear understanding of the problem. Which brings us to our second reason... 2. You haven't taken the time to understand your customer. This goes beyond just building a demographic profile of your customer. Great design requires sensitivity to many levels of context around customer touchpoints: Emotional Context: How does someone feel when they are using your product or service--not just during, but before and after. What's their mental state? Are they coming to you to alleviate boredom, or are they using your product during a medical emergency? Environmental Context: Where are they when they're using your product or service? What else is fighting for their attention? Do they have time pressures or spatial constraints? Social Context: How will they be perceived by others when using your product or service? Will it make them feel cool or proud? Or are you solving a problem that's too embarrassing to share with others? These are absolute requirements for designing products and services that customers love. Unless you're willing to invest the time to build a clear picture of your customer's problems and motivations, you run the risk of falling short of great design. This risk is worth taking seriously, because the alternative to great design is not no design at all, it's bad design. 3. You intend to silo design into a singular department. In my experience, I've seen too many designers hired onto marketing or engineering teams and tasked with visualizing user experiences or marketing materials. Oftentimes, the designer does not have access to customer data or high-level business goals, and management becomes frustrated with the designer's output and loses faith. The reality is, great design is an attitude more than a skillset. In order to successfully integrate design into your company, it needs to be done on a cultural level and from the top down. Design thinking is not just something that needs to be represented by designers, but the entire company. Everyone in the company becomes a designer the moment each employee is able to rally around the customer's journey. A pillar of great design is consistency, and design needs to be integrated into all customer touchpoints such as customer service centers, your website, social media, the product, or any conceivable interaction that a customer has with a brand. That said, it's no coincidence that design has moved into top level management. To become a design-driven organization, it requires more than acquiring design talent--it requires design leadership. Great design is not easy, but it's worth it. Realizing the magnitude of effort that goes into building a design culture, some companies choose the option to hire design firms or freelancers when they're not ready to make the investment of time, money, and attention. This is certainly a viable option, but if the rise in activity over the last few years has proven anything, it's that prioritizing this investment can lead to serious business outcomes that really do move the needle. Great design stems from a great design culture, and a great design culture is difficult to cultivate. Design talent these days falls under a large umbrella of writing and communication skills, coding skills, strong business acumen, and visual design. Individuals skilled in any combination of those areas are difficult to find, but they are worth the investment. After all, the one thing more expensive than building a great design culture is to have no design culture at all. Most successful startups these days are actually founded by designers (like Aribnb), proving that design should be at the foundation of the company from Day 1. Also, extensive research over the last few years has established a strong business case for the value of design.

Otherwise, it’s okay to take them. 2- What is meant by “Health Coach”: Is it the same type of coaches as in “personal coach” or “the team coach”, the type of coaches that tell you what to do or practice to be better based on their knowledge. Or is it the Health Coach as in “life coach”, the type of coaches that empower you to come up with the answers yourself, so they won’t recommend anything. 3- Your Health Coach School: Some would prefer using natural sources only, others prefer using supplements, others like to use both depending on the case at hand.

Nigerians in all walks of life tend to look too much to the government, more specifically to the British colonial officials, for the fulfillment of their aspirations. The heavy reliance on government is frequently coupled with a strong distrust of its actions and motives. Not much has changed since the Americans in the first World Bank mission to Nigeria made that observation. Nigerians tend to mistrust the government while expecting from it miracles that are only possible through collective action. It is a circle and cannot be squared. Counter-insurgencies are not exactly rocket science. They require an open-ended commitment to isolating the target population from the insurgents. If, as Mao Zedong put it, the people are the water that insurgents swim in, then the solution is to drain the swamp and pave it over. Keep the wider populace secure while working to increase their recruitment value, and prevent the insurgents from tapping them as sources of revenue. Without recruits and finance, all movements die. Nigeria cannot sustain that commitment for the same reason that a house divided against itself cannot stand. The ability to conduct successful wars is the ultimate measurement of the institutional capacity of a society. Rather than see the failures against Boko Haram and the other security challenges plaguing the country as a societal indictment, the preference is to engage in conspiracy theories and the search for silver bullets. That ultimately changes nothing. The armed forces and the government are not entities at arm's length. They belong to Nigerians.
