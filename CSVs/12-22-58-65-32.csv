There are a few training schools but they only offer courses in Chinese, I bet (which is great if you are a Chinese speaker). You can have a look at these two websites for your own reference: 游戏开发培训【GA游戏教育】| 爱游戏 爱学习 火星时代教育 | 中国艺术教育高端品牌 Instead, have you ever thought of learning game design online? That’s what I’m currently doing and there are plenty of affordable resources. I’d like to recommend these courses I’m following if you are keen to consider the self-learning option: Learn game design with Unity 3D engine and in Udemy ($15): Unity Course: Learn Unity 5 at Your Pace on UdemyLearn how to use Unity engine with free tutorials in Unity3D.com: Unity - Learn - OverviewLearn game design in edX for free (they usually offer online courses provided by universities and you can get a certification by paying a little amount of money, usually around $40. However, learning is always offered freely if you don’t need a certification): Video Game DesignIf you want to learn a programming language then the app called SoloLearn is a great addition and i’s available for android and iPhone. They offer courses for C#, C++, Swift, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript, CSS, HTML, PHP, SQL. And it’s all free.  All these recommendations come from my personal experience because I’m also quite interested into game design and I found them very valid.

Slow, yes, but it worked. So if it can run whatever software you’re using to animate, it is good enough. With about 4 gb RAM you can run flash & animate just fine, exclusively, so no chrome or other ram-hogs in the background, all integrated cards can deal with 2d animation software just fine. In my experience what you’ll need is just a large amount of storage, mostly for the composition and video editing parts, the raw files can easily end up occupying 1gb+ plus of memory. SDD can probably help since you can use some of that as partial ram memory, but it is far from mandatory. Just get something you know can Run Adobe Animate (new name for flash) and a graphic tablet, these can go in all prices, no real need to buy anything that is past the 200$ price mark if you’re working on a laptop. This is a silly test, but think about it like this, if it can run League of Legends it can run what you need for your film. 4gb+ of ram at least, it is the bare minimum you’ll need.Try to aim for at least 1 tera of memory to make sure you can save and back up your projects constantly.At least have a basic integrated card, but a decent cheap ge-force is better.This will not be the fastest system, but it will work just fine if you just want to work on films and not run “Far cry 5″ or whatever newest game comes up. 3",2021-03-06T16:36:23.422Z,"What are the minimum features requiered in a laptop used for designing and 2D simple animated films?

Toei was the first production house to create something similar to Disney's works. It is still known today for anime like “Dragon Ball” series. Soon ,Tezuka started his own anime production house, that did not have the same resources as Toei. He used cost-cutting methods that destroyed anime forever. The main focus was on beautiful still frames (similar to the manga they were inspired from) and not on smooth movements (unlike disney). This inspired all the anime production houses to follow the same. There have been anime with smooth animation and high production value, but these are more an exception than the rule. This is the reason we see anime with subpar animation and mind blowing visual styles and aesthetics. Disney, on the other hand, focused on movements and pioneering animation (even if it meant sacrifice of realistic visuals). They basically wrote the book on animation. Even today, Disney brings us animation methods and styles that brings you wonder like a child looking at the moon for the first time. As far as 3d animation is concerned, Pixar was the first to produce a feature length movie that changed the playing field forever. Japanese studios have been using 3d since the 90s but 2d is still the to go because budget. Moreover, anime being mainly inspired by manga and games, visual novels, they have to follow visual styles that is already set. There is also difference between the barbaric ways that the anime production staff is treated in contrast to the disney workers that have work schedules similar to other workers in the western world. Here is where the only difference that matters lies : philosophy and culture. The circumstances that led to the conception of western and Japanese animation were just so different that the result was just as bizarre to both the cultures. In recent times, western and eastern animation industries are getting inspired by each other that we might soon see a new style of animation that will be an amalgamation of the contrasting methods.

CGI is hugely labour intensive business. And the primary cost is manpower. Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia cost more than their cell-animated equivalents would have done. Huge effort has gone into designing the background world. Architecting individual buildings. Designing vehicles, crafting characters. Painting every pixel of every surface by hand. The garbage bag in this image might have taken more artist time than the entire background of the image from Dalmatians. Each individual car certainly would.  It’s not about availability of artists. If there were secure careers in hand-drawn animation, there would be plenty of animators happy for the work. The analytical and artistic skills needed to walk a rabbit on a computer-screen are actually very similar to the skills needed to do it by cell animation. I think the main reason for the transition is simply quality. The new process allows a studio to create a better-looking and a better performed movie with these tools. Great art needs iteration, and it’s easier to iterate in this digital space than in the hand-drawn space. A weak bit of digital animation can be refined. Some additional keyframes can be added, the performance can be sharpened, retimed, the lighting can be changed, the camera can be repositioned. With a hand-drawn solution, you simply can not move the camera, or shift a light. You literally have to go back to the drawing board. So, what is cheaper is not creation but iteration. More iteration can happen and that means that a better product is attainable at the end of the schedule. Pixar introduced a notion called “plussing”. That meant not stopping when the shot was adequate. The sequences, scripts and performances were improved and improved until they was as good as it could possible be. It’s the ability to create a product with such high quality that drives studios towards this form of animated film-making.",2021-03-06T16:49:42.313Z,"Why has Disney stopped doing hand drawn animated films?

I did a lot of research and 4 applications seemed to be the ones people gravitated to the most: 3D Studio MAX, Cinema 4D, Houdini, and Maya. From my research Maya was probably the most capable at doing character animation, but most of my work is industrial animation so that aspect wasn’t important. Houdini was fairly high-end for my needs. I needed a good, all-around modeler and animation package, and it came down to 3D Studio MAX or Cinema 4D. 3D Studio MAX by far has the larger following. It also has the largest library of commercial models available. It also has a large number of plugins and other kinds of add-ons you can get. But I work in a Mac OS environment and have a fairly powerful Mac Pro. Getting 3D studio MAX would involve spending almost twice as much as Cinema 4D since I would also need to buy a new computer to use it. I bought Cinema 4D in November and have been teaching myself how to use it since then. I have had no trouble finding hundreds and hundreds, of tutorial videos for using a variety of techniques. So I’m a little incredulous when you say “there is no videos on youtube (how to move your character ,make it jump ,turn ,stand up in cinema 4D)”. I just don’t think you looked hard enough. Since November, I went from zero experience with Cinema 4D to producing a fairly technical industrial animation that shows fluid dynamics and physics involved in oil well drilling. But there was a huge learning curve. Even with my two-plus decades of experience it has still taken me months to get up to speed in C4D. I understand all the concepts and theory of what needs to happen, but every application has their own interface and methodology. Just getting to know my way around C4D was daunting at first. But you have a really good tool with Cinema 4D. You just need to stick to it. Without any kind of guided learning (i.e. structured lessons taught in a classroom) you are going to learn how to do what you want, but it will take much longer than if you took a class specifically designed to teach you what you want to learn. There are easier applications that will let you get up and running quickly, such as Poser. But with Poser, even though you can do most of what you describe wanting to do to do right out of the box, it will be fairly limiting. For animation, it’s a one trick pony. You’ll still need to bring it into a program like C4D to do any kind of decent rendering. Two weeks is nothing. I don’t know what your goals are but if you want to learn how to be an animator you’ll need to spend a lot of time with it. Besides modeling, texture mapping, lighting and rendering, you’ll need to learn how to rig a character, and how to set limits, and understand how to tune it so your animation doesn’t look like a cheap video game. There are a lot of resources online just for C4D, both paid and free. Besides Youtube, there’s Lynda.com, Cineversity, and GreyscaleGorilla.

In 2008 The Clone Wars came out. These episodes are the last pieces of Star Wars lore produced under Lucasfilm that is considered canon under Disney.  Rebels came out in 2014. This is the first major exploration of the Dark Times in canon and incorporated a some of the old Expanded Universe lore (like Thrawn) into the new canon.  Forces of Destiny started in 2017. Like the first Clone Wars series, it consists of short cartoons and 2d animation. It tells short stories from all time periods of Star Wars lore.  Resistance is the latest cartoon. It takes place prior to The Force Awakens and came out in 2018.  *EDIT* Thank you Kevin Baker for mentioning this one in the comments. Galaxy of Adventures is another series of short cartoons, like Forces of Destiny.  Now, we do have a few honorable mentions. The Star Wars Holiday Special, released on TV in 1978, featured a short cartoon with the first appearance of Boba Fett. The rest of the special is awful (so bad Lucas vowed to never release it) but the cartoon is decent.  Star Wars Detours was going to be a comedy show that lampoons Star Wars.

The competition is really high in UX design, and nobody cares about the NID tag. Just look at the profiles of young designers/interns at top tech companies and startups, and you will hardly find any NIDians. There are always exceptions. If you are highly passionate about a field (for example, footwear design under industrial design, or publication design under graphic design), you might get placements in niche companies. However, you need to specialize early by building a focussed portfolio and bagging internships. For masters, the placements are good enough (around 12 LPA) in fields related to UX/UI design (information design, interaction design, digital game design, strategic design management). Still, it’s way less than what some skilled designers are getting as freshers without NID degree, just on the virtue of their excellent portfolio. Other than that, masters in graphic design might get you some decent salary. Also, don’t buy that 72 lakhs placement bullshit. That was a one-time event years ago in textile design.

Sometimes it was just a description of the current action (John leaves the house) or it was of the dialogue (“Hmm…it hasn’t moved”) or both. Then I numbered them and found that, in the end, I would have to make 38 animated shots. Then came the animation. I used Clip Studio Paint Pro, which, although it costs money, is still not the ULTIMATE version of the software, so I had to do each shot in the two seconds, or twenty-four frames, that I was allowed. This felt like a hassle, but I think it was beneficial because it made the animation easier. I made 38 1–2 second gifs. Most of them were choppy and not-well-drawn - I don’t think I ever sold the “moving images” thing - but making gifs allowed for breaking the animation into easier-to-handle pieces. Then there was voice-acting. I did enlist my brother’s help for this, but I could have done the audio on my own and kept with the “alone” thing you were asking for. Using Audacity and iMovie, I spliced my many, many audio clips and gifs together. Finally, I edited down the dead spots, the fuzzy spots, the too-short spots, and added sound effects + background music. And then I had it! A minute-and-a-half long animated short, done in about two weeks by working several hours a night. It was a LOT of work. I do not recommend trying to animate in two weeks. (and now it’s on YouTube) Pretty rough around the edges, lot of room for improvement, but I can’t help being kind of proud of it. So basically, what you need to do is script, draw, voice, and edit. Start small! I made up the process as I went along because of the time crunch I was on, but there are plenty of ways you can get some animating practice in before jumping in headfirst!

It was an easy way for me to get into Castlevania without having to navigate the overwhelming selection of games for consuls that I don’t have. Holy hell. It deserves its 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I'm not familiar with the Castlevania games, but on its own, the series was really good. I thought the storyline was done well, and the character development was also done really well. I could sympathize with every major character except for Carmilla and the bishop (he totally deserved to get his face bitten off). I know that the story is a mix of several games (Dracula’s Curse, Symphony of the Night, and one other one to supply Hector). I can’t judge them as adaptations, but knowing that, I think they were expertly woven together into one story, with enough interesting character subplots and dynamics to keep it going (Dracula’s despair, the corruption of the Church and how that effects Trevor, Sypha, and Dracula, the vampire politics, Hector and Isaac’s backstories, Alucard, etc.). The setup is great, the conflict is simple but it makes sense, and we get to see the conflict from both sides. I actually really liked all the vampire politics! I know that the games themselves are mostly just a Belmont fighting monsters through Dracula’s labyrinthine castle, so much of the drama was added, but it felt natural. From my uninformed perspective Netflix succeeded in making a good drama series out of a video game franchise! In fact, if I hadn’t known it was a video game, I probably wouldn’t have guessed… except for a few key things. A lot of the fight scenes felt very, very “Boss Battle.” Trevor meets a cyclops while exploring, fights it by himself, and advances the plot. Then he has to fight Alucard as the “final boss” for that season. When he’s in the (epically cool) underground library, he finds the Morningstar flail and gets a “level up” on his weapon, which seems to increase his ATK. Then he’s ambushed by minions, which he has to fight off himself. I’m not complaining, it’s just something I noticed. Sometimes I found myself thinking, “This reminds me of a video game. Oh wait.” The only thing I didn’t like about the series was that sometimes, the animation looked really stiff. I’m not sure if it’s just the Americanime style, but I felt like some of the walk cycles looked unnatural, especially on staircases. It pulled me out a few times. There’s also its iffy history, but I can forgive that. The series also was just a bit too gory for me, but every scene of graphic violence was made up for by Alucard. For every scene of disgusting carnage that made me want to cover my eyes, there was another scene with Alucard to cancel it out.  *siiiiiiiigh* Now I really want to play Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. But it's a PS1 game, and I have a PS3, and I'm already trying to get a PS2 to play Persona 4 (for obvious reasons), and my sister wants a PS4! So there's no way I'm getting a 1. But I don't have to! Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood were re-released as a collection (Castlevania: Requiem) about two weeks ago, for the PS4. So if my sister does get a PS4, I can play it. Sweet!

Don Kumaragamage There are a number of different techniques used for 2d animation in games. Quite often you will see animations composed of sprite sequences, though these day it is becoming increasingly more common to build characters out of components using a 2d skeletal rig, then animate the components. These techniques are often combined so that the components that are rigged are also animated frame sequences. As for how to implement them, Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, and After Effects are commonly used tools.

Grievous is designed to lose. Seriously, his fate was already written to be the villain that continually loses for the most part because he has to be scrap by the time the old trilogy comes around. In fact the prequels in general suffer from the “rofl-stomped villain” problem. We get badass new villains like Darth Maul, Grievous and Jango Fett only to have them die in a single film. Hell Dooku barely escaped death in Episode 2 when he was introduced (thank God), but was still quickly killed off in the beginning of Episode 3 (which I think was a wise choice given that the movie was really about Anakin turning to the dark side). But yes, Grievous was written to lose time and time again. Now of course Grievous killed tons of Jedi, anyone that wasn’t part of the main 4: Anakin, Obi-Wan, Mace and Yoda, really shouldn’t be able to reasonably stand against him for long. Kit Fisto and Asajj Ventress manage to fight him and even get the upper hand (which I find incredibly stupid), and that's because they really screwed up Grievous’ character in the Clone Wars tv show. In Clone Wars (the 2D animated micro series cartoon) Grievous was a fucking monster! He was a terrible, cold, calculating strategist and Jedi-killing terminator. Even in a setting where all the Jedi had exaggerated abilities and could slaughter entire droid armies practically by themselves, Grievous stood head and shoulders above just about everyone else. There’s also a comic strip drawn in the same style as the 2D cartoon where Grievous goes against Asajj and bounty hunter/mercenary Durge 2v1 and he knocks out both of them by himself with relative ease (which again makes it stupid how Asajj can contend with him in a duel in the 3D clone wars show).  He was so good even Dooku could barely outspar him (he still could and Dooku ultimately held Grievous’ leash at the end of the day, but it took great effort for him to do so. So yes, I think Grievous can realistically kill anyone with ease unless it’s Obi-Wan, Anakin, Mace or Yoda. But against one of those 4, yeah Grievous will probably lose every time.

But as a general rule—no. They are not better than Disney movies as a whole. In the earlier years of Dreamworks, they seemed to present themselves as a major competitor and bitter rival to the Disney Company. Even though movies like The Road to El Dorado weren’t received as well because of the adult humor (targeting a slightly older audience), it showed that Dreamworks had strong storytellers and animators on their team. However, The Prince of Egypt was a phenomenal success—a powerful story with beautiful animation and amazing music.  The film was nominated for MANY awards and won several. At this point, Disney knew that Dreamworks was something to contend with. However, since The Road to El Dorado didn’t make as much as they had hoped (though it still wasn’t considered a failure), and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas bombed at box office, they decided to take a different approach. When Dreamworks made Shrek, they used a disgruntled Disney employee to help them develop it and poked fun at the Disney company with several Disney-esque characters. Apparently, even the villain was designed to look like Disney’s (then) CEO, Michael Eisner. (By the way, Pixar later retaliated by making Gilbert Hugh from The Incredibles look like one of Dreamworks’ big wigs).  Shrek went on to also be a phenomenal success and saved the struggling Dreamworks company (which annoyed Disney and likely inspired them to more quickly drop their 2D animation department, accrediting the success to CG instead of original storytelling). From that point on there was a major shift in Dreamworks’ style. Dreamworks became more into the slapstick comedy films. Sure, there was obviously a nice dose of drama or heart-touching moments in them to round out the stories and make them stronger, but it was the slapstick which emphasized their works. Likely this was the result of feeling that they couldn’t compete with Disney on more sincere or beautiful works (especially because of the limitations of early CG animation)—so they chose comedy instead. For instance: A fanboy panda raised by a goose who stumbles into the role of Dragon Warrior (Kung Fu Panda)A scrawny, awkward kid with an embarrassing name (Hiccup) who trains a dragon—complete with a “How to—” book series title to add to the humor (How to Train Your Dragon)A snail that goes really fast (Turbo)A girl who gets transformed into a giant at her wedding and is considered a “monster” (Monsters vs Aliens)The dorky bad guy is actually the hero in this superman-esque satire (Megamind)A baby with the mind of a grown man and who stays a baby due to a secret formula is actually a business man trying to make it so people love babies more than puppies (Boss Baby)A lion, a zebra, giraffe, hippo, and mafia penguins try to escape into the wilds of Africa, but actually end up stuck on Madagascar after a shipwreck (Madagascar)You get the idea. Slapstick-comedies. That being said, while Dreamworks does have a few good titles (including underrated films like Rise of the Guardians and Megamind), they still seem to struggle to stay afloat. Shrek, How to Train your Dragon, and the Kung Fu Panda series have become the bread and butter of the Dreamworks company and kept them going, meaning sequel after sequel after sequel complete with cartoon series and specials. But as those franchises begin to dry up, having been milked for all their worth, it’s left them wondering: what next? Apparently, after last year’s 2020 release of a second Croods and Trolls movies, their answer is: More Sequels.  This is a dangerous sign of a company’s downward spiral. Even Pixar has begun to suffer because of sequels and made the announcement recently that they will be returning to original films. (It’s too soon to tell if Disney titles intend to follow suit, though they are releasing their first original Disney animated title this year after 5 years of nothing but remakes). Even more, some of Dreamworks’ newer movies aren’t being received as well as they’d hoped. Their strength is mostly in toy merchandising rather than the number of viewers. In some cases, these newer films are seen as a bit TOO slapstick, with movies like Trolls becoming the bane of some parents’ existence and being too immature or hyper for many adults to watch independently (whereas Disney and Pixar draws in both children and adults with their films). This leads to a greater likelihood that audiences will shift away from Dreamworks movies at the box office and toward competitors—like Disney. That doesn’t mean that Dreamworks doesn’t still have potential, but it means that they still struggle to compete with other animation companies and seem recently to be struggling with the basics of film: original storytelling.",2021-03-06T17:44:07.609Z,"Does DreamWorks put out better movies than Disney?

If you could give me some more specifics, I would be able to be more helpful.  I am new to Quora, but if you would like my help, contact me through them. In response to your second e-mail: I found it very frustrating that Quora wouldn't let me respond directly and independently to your second letter Giuseppe, so rather than not respond, I find I can only amend my first response.  Do you know how I might have responded directly to your second letter or to your profile?   All I can do is hope you'll get a notification of this amendment. Your project requirements are seemingly basic, so you may be able to use PowerPoint, Windows Media Center, and/or VLC Media Player, (which you may have had factory installed with Windows), they are all capable of producing simple animations as per your description, are easy to operate and have an abundance of tutorials available, and all can produce projects in a variety of video formats with sound. I have installed MonkeyJam, Animation EffectBox, PixBuilder Studio in addition to the afore mentioned, because I find them more compliant with classical animation procedures/jargon, and as far as I know, are all still freely available.   MonkeyJam is my fav', but the others have aspects/effects that the others don't, but they are all good tools to have on your desktop, all have an abundance of tutorials and forums available, but as previously mentioned in my first correspondence, you may want to spend some time and investigate what's newly recommended by Google and About.com.   Another suggestion for preparing your projects artwork is Paint.net.  I've found it to be very similar to GIMP and PhotoShop, but without the long start-uptime or heavy RAM dependence.

The fanbase is currently divided when it comes to Mappa taking over for WIT, two sides of the same coin colliding. As manga fans, you’d most likely be carefree about the animation as you’ve only experience the essence of the anime captured in graphic novels. As anime fans, it functions inversely as the mainstream fans have had a long lasting loyalty with WIT and would not be able to adapt to the new animation. The art style of Mappa is pretty good.  Most importantly, it fits the tone of the new chapters/events. Rotoscoping does not ruin the moments as it is a method that is scarcely used and is not seemingly distracting. It worked perfectly when Reiner was contemplating as it slowly zoomed on his face to give us his point of view. But in other places, it looked a bit off and was glitchy, especially that scene with Udo. The main problem is the overuse of CGI. I did not mind the Armored titan, Jaw titan and Beast titan being CGI in the first episode, the shader of the CGI matched the saturation of the background.  When it comes to their motion, Mappa did a great job in forming speed disparity between the different titans. The behemoths felt more sluggish as compared to the midgets like the Jaw or Cart titan. However, episode 6 was a step down. The Attack titan felt out of place, my guess is that he had lighting while the hand drawn characters and background did not, the Warhammer titan was fine due to the fact that it did not have incident ray surfaces. The simulation of the titans’ hair were too stiff and the Attack Titan looked like a lazy model. They removed and barely used the glowing effect of the titans’ eyes and their pupil/iris were completely white which made the models look average.  Additionally, the battle between the War Hammer and the Attack titan felted dimmed down in terms of contrast, not to a point where you could not see anything but to a point where you felt like they were in a confined space. The scenery felt more gradient, detailed and lighter when the titans were not shown.  The trailer was nothing short of false advertisement.  My guess is that Mappa had to animate the trailer separately as to “reassure” the fans that the animation was still going to be crisp and soothing but the trailer looked nothing like the anime and partially matched the style of Jujutsu Kaisen.  So, imagine what we would have gotten if any of these studios were given the time necessary to complete the show. The sad thing is that Mappa animators will now become defined by Attack on Titan just because of the incompetence of the executives who forced them to rush with the anime. On a side note, I’d also like to address the controversy with Mappa. The incentive to making an anime adaptation of the manga was switch more mainstream fans to the manga which is why the studio executives were being impatient. It is all about profit making from revenue. Mappa was the only studio willing to animate the show in a small time window. Even if Mappa would not takeover, WIT would have made it but it would have taken longer. Even if the manga might not receive as much profit as they were expecting, they would have still invented in the long-term production possibility of the anime closure because the mainstream is more profitable than the manga. My point is that we should not falsify credits, Mappa did not save the anime from a “potential shutdown”, it only managed to satisfy the increasing demand of the anime in a shorter time period. However, the fiasco of death threats being sent to the studio is truly mind boggling and should not be excusable. In my personal opinion, I was disappointed. We went from this:  To this:  Let’s be honest, some of us saw this coming. Mappa was working with two projects simultaneously and they had two years or less to complete the anime, so there was bound to be a crap ton of CGI. Overall, the animation is not that bad because it could have been worst. The fact that Mappa was able to make the anime despite all these issues is a testament to the hard work of the animators. Mostly, I care about the storyline and so far, Mappa has not yet to miss a mark in terms of realism and intensity. Spoilers for the post released episodes of Attack on Titan.

Most of us know that 3D animation is done on a computer, but what is 3D animation REALLY?  You can watch a video I made about this, or keep reading. What does it mean to make a 2D animation as opposed to making a 3D one? well, actually the making process is very different. For starters, to animate in 2D you need to be able to draw. everything you see in traditional 2D animation had to be drawn. Usually frame by frame. for a 3D animator, while being able to draw well is defiantly an advantage, it is not mandatory. When you’re animating in a 3D environment you move the character, kinda like a puppet, right there on the computer. Lets go into details: In 2D animation, you draw the first key pose, and then the rest of the key poses. You then draw all the frames in between them. But when we draw the character, we only draw what is seen in the shot. When a character’s arm is behind their back, we don’t draw that arm. If something is not shown, I don’t have to draw it. If a character closes their eyes, the eyeball does not exist anymore until I draw it again. This concept is one of the first big differences between the two types of animation. That’s because when you’re working in a 3D environment, all the parts of the character are always there. and you have to be aware of them, while in 2D you just draw whatever is seen and the rest does not exist. This concept gives a small advantage to 3D animation, because since the character is in a 3D space, you can change the camera after you animated the scene. In 2D, if you change the shot angle you will have to redraw the whole sequence, because you drew the character from a certain angle. When you animated in 3D you’re still considering the camera angle at all times, but its much easier to later change it if you need to.  Animating in 3D Ok, so we all know that animating in 2D means drawing a lot. But what does it mean to animate in 3D? how does it look like? well, lets see. In our scene, we will have a 3D model. That model is rigged, which means it is programed with all the right virtual bones and controls to make it as easy for animators as possible to animate. As you can see, this model has controls in every key position in its body. I can grab one of the controls and move it around. But that only explain how we can move the model, not actually animate. There it gets a bit more complex. Look at this window. This is called a graph editor. 3D animation is all about graphs and curves. Yeah, I know math and formulas don’t belong in an artistic thing like animation, but there it is. Now, you might be a bit overwhelm when I show you this, but these curves correlate to each controller. There’re actually multiple curves that correlate with each one controller, since we’re moving in a 3 axis system. So yeah, an animator spends a lot of time looking at graphs and curves. It’s actually a lot simpler than it reads here, once you start playing with it. We also have an entire course called Maya Animation which teaches you everything you need to know to be able to animate in 3D like a pro. Now we know about curves, but we still didn’t cover the animation process. Lets say we want this character to raise their hand. We’ll go to the first frame in the timeline and create a keyframe. A key frame is you telling the program you want the hand to be in a certain position at a certain time. Then we’ll go 10 frames forward in the time line and move the hand up. The computer then interpolates the difference between the first and second keyframes we made and generates the movement. An animator will repeat this process for almost all body parts for every keyframe, and tweak them for hours and hours. After a lot of animating, the graph editor would look like in the picture above. This editor is what animators look at most of the time, just like 2D animators look at their drawings. Frame rate Another difference between 2D and 3D animation is the frame rate, and what happens on moving holds. What do I mean by that? Well, in film we usually work with 24 frames per second. in 2D animation That means that there is a drawing every frame, 24 times a second. That’s a lot, but when there’s no big fast movement we can often settle for 1 drawing lasting for 2 frames. So there’re actually 12 drawings per second. This is called “working on 2’s”, because you’re making a change, or a new drawing, every two frames. When the movement is very still, we might even work on 3’s and 4’s. You see that a lot in Japanese animation and stop motion. Sometime they would hold the same drawings for many frames. In 3D though, it doesn’t really work like that. When a 3D character doesn’t move at all, even for 1 frame, it seams wrong. It seems dead. This makes it challenging to do a “moving hold” in 3D animation. A moving hold is used whenever you need a character to do nothing, but still feel like their alive. While in 2D and stop motion you can settle for a drawing every 3-5 frames, or even not have it move at all for a few seconds, in 3D we always have to keep the character moving. I hope this short overview gave you a basic understanding of what it means to animate in 3D as opposed to animating in 2D.

After watching ABC's Once Upon a Time, which concluded with its seventh season, and witnessing all the Disney princesses unite on screen for the first time, it got me thinking- and really wanting, a Disney Princess shared universe. If the appearances by the princesses is more than just a cameo appearance, I feel that we may finally get a Disney Princess shared universe, in a similar vein to how Marvel has its Cinematic Universe, and I want this. But I want it to be animated- because the first look we have is incredible of all the Princesses.  In this image released by Disney for their new film, Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2, we get our first looks at all the Disney Princesses- both official and not official, and they look awesome. Why this was such big news in the first place is because never before have the Princesses been on screen before in such a way, sure Shrek and the previously mentioned Once Upon a Time united them, but never this accurately. Also, they have never been voiced by their original voice actresses in the one film. Yes, all the original actresses are returning; Jodi Benson as Ariel, returning from The Little Mermaid, Paige O'Hara as Belle, returning from Beauty and the Beast, Linda Larkin as Jasmine, returning from Aladdin, Irene Bedard as Pocahontas, returning from Pocahontas, Ming-Na Wang as Mulan, returning from Mulan, Anima Noni Rose as Tiana, returning from Princess and the Frog, Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, returning from Tangled, and Kelly Macdonald as Merida, returning from Brave. That's an impessive line-up of characters. Now of course Snow White, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, from Cinderella, and Aurora, from Sleeping Beauty, will be in the film as well, but since their original voice actresses are no longer with us they will be recast- I am unsure as to why Jennifer Hale, who has voiced both Cinderella and Aurora in other media, won't return- but I guess Disney has their reasons. Additionally, Princesses and Queen Elsa, Anna and Moana will return in this film- however they are not yet official princesses, but will be returning non-the-less. Returning from Frozen includes Idina Menzel as Elsa and Kristen Bell as Anna, and returning from Moana is Auli‘i Cravalho as Moana. I am very excited to see all these princesses together. So lets go through them. I want to say, I love how they all look so accurate to their original designs. I was worried that Disney would alter their designs for the film, but no, Disney are going full out classic. Firstly we have Jasmine on the very left, and she looks stunning. Her hair and clothes look exactly like they did in Aladdin. I love the way she sits, and I love how she doesn't seem to be taking herself too seriously. I did notice that they darkened her skin tone a little, which I think is a great idea. I love how she is sitting on the Magic Carpet- it is a great callback to her famous song duet with Aladdin in Aladdin ""A Whole New World."" Next we have Snow White, the only princess with two names. Snow has always been difficult to pull off, as the character is only fourteen, but here she looks aged up slightly, and looks identical to her first appearance in 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I love her hair style, her clothes and especially her red cape she sports. She also appears to be quite elegant which I love, its very Snow White like. Snow was the first Disney princess, so I hope they show her some respect and maybe make reference to that fact. Next we have Cinderella and Pocahontas. Cinderella is mostly known, although it is unclear why, as the leader of the Disney princesses. I wonder if she'll retain that title in this film. But, I must say, Cinderella was the most plain of the princesses, and I finally was able to see- Cinderella and Elsa both look similiar in many respects. Both wear blue dresses and both have blond hair. They look really similiar in this image. But I loved how she was brushing Pocahontas' hair. Pocahontas has so much life in this photo, and come to think of it, being in this room would be totally out of her comfort zone, as Pocahontas usually resides in nature. As for Elsa, I love how similar she looks to her appearance in Frozen and I wonder whether she'll have her powers in this film. Her hair is platted, which helps distinguish her from Cinderella. I think including her here will be a great way to push the Frozen brand, as a Frozen 2 is expected to release next year. I also feel as though we may get a reference to Elsa being a lesbian in this film to help set up the potential plot point in the 2019 sequel. It could be done in a simple sentence. ""Hey Elsa,"" says one of the princesses. ""Where's your Prince Charming?"" Cinderella pokes her head up, whilst Elsa says ""I don't need no prince."" Its that simple. I loved Moana in the scene, she too would be very much out of her comfort zone. But she again looks great, identical to how she looked in her film. Rapunzel, Elsa, Anna and Moana all were originally in 3D animated pictures before their appearances in this film, which is why they aren't as talked about as much as some of the other princesses, whom of which appeared only in 2D animation. Moana's hair is stunning once again and her outfit is so in tune with her character. Anna appears unusually quiet in this scene, sitting in quite an elegant matter. She looks great too, although it really hit me at how dissimilar Elsa and Anna look. But Anna is being overshadowed by Belle, who is probably my favourite of the Disney princesses. Belle's hair, gown and to the fact she has a book in her hand and the way she is holding herself looks awesome. She basically steals the scene. I am so excited to see Belle in the film. Rapunzel is included in the background, distinguished by her long locks. We don't get that much of a good look at her here, but I initially didn't see her and though Aurora was Rapunzel, so I hope she stands out in the movie. Speaking of that, Aurora is at the front and I think the way they modernised her appearance was great. Aurora is often said to be the weakest of the Disney princesses, even Once Upon a Time played to this, and I hope this film can give her a true arc, that isn't to be asleep. Tiana is the final princess to appear in the frame, and she looks stunning, bringing her own style. She looks ripped right out of her 2D animated appearance and really shines through, despite being in the corner of the shot. Although they don't appear, Princesses Ariel, Mulan and Merida will all appear in the film, and since Disney was able to adapt these characters looks and clothing so accurately, I am so glad the princesses are sporting their classic looks and not some casual clothing, I am excited for their appearances. My anticipation for Ralph Breaks the Internet just went higher. I am excited to see our first looks at Marvel characters; Iron Man and Gamora, who will appear in the film, and C-3PO, R2-D2 and Yoda, from Star Wars, who will appear in the film. Judging from this, they'll be represented faithfully. The Disney Princess brand is about to explode!

A lead designer, the art director, would set the overall artistic style, making decisions on use of color, line weight, proportions, gesture, character, expression, etc. Environmental design would go hand in hand with the evolution of the characters, which after all must ""belong"" in the world being created. A conceptual framework is evolved and rules for the world are determined. For example, Winnie the Pooh used soft colors, the actual ""human"" character Christopher Robin was portrayed with more detail and realism than his imaginary friends, which were simplified with rounder curves and less detailing, and Pooh's own imaginary constructs, heffalumps and woozles, were even more rounded and less detailed. Color choices were also influenced by this conceptual framework: rules which guided design choices, in this case based on how far from ""reality"" a character was. The designers then construct a ""design bible,"" an often exhaustive book consisting of design frames (paintings of how individual frames of the final animation should look), model sheets (references of how characters look at different angles and under different conditions and emotions), blueprints of environments and sets, drawings of how effects and props should be drawn, and so on. Once the design process is sufficiently advanced, the lead animators start making choices for motion. How fast do characters move, are their movements sharp or fluid, does the character of their motion change in reaction to story or mood, etc. Story boarding, the layout of the entire film on paper via drawings, also begins. First storyboards are focused primarily on translating the events of the script into a story told over time. Choices begin to be made regarding pacing, how much time to spend on different scenes, and then shots, what angles and camera motions are chosen. The storyboards are assembled into animatics, videos of storyboard frames cut over time, and actors dialogue is recorded. The entire process is refined over and over throughout the entire production. A shot bible is made, which contains details on every shot of the film, how many frames must be drawn, what elements are drawn, who is involved and doing what. More and more people are hired and formed into teams. Schedules are made. Key animators begin drawing keyframes, important points of action, and inbetweeners draw the frames in between the keyframes to create smooth motion. Today much of this is handled with computers, but the idea of key animators handling the critical points and junior animators filling in the rest remains.  Layout artists and environment artists draw backgrounds and props. Ink and paint artists translate the rough drawings into final quality images. Effects artists add in elements like smoke, flame, water, energy, fractured objects etc. I'm keeping this fairly traditional, as a cel-based animation, in this description, because that is at the heart of all animation. But bear in mind CGI productions have their own variations: R&D teams, programmers, IT people, texture, lighting and compositing artists, and so on. But fundamentally the process is the same. As the film starts to come together teams start ""dailies"": group viewings of portions of animation. The animation dailies are reviewed, first by team leads and then dailies are held in which the director, art director, producers etc view the animations and give notes for changes or improvements. As the film evolves the director goes from watching and approving small chunks of animation to entire sequences, then scenes, and eventually the entire edit. A film has been born. This is barely touching on the broad strokes. The details are endless. Music and sound effects. Changes to dialogue. Releasing trailers. Funding. Managing teams and schedules. Handling the huge amounts of images, files, and communications. Computer networking, rendering technology and infrastructure. Photography, color management, maintaining continuity of the whole, quality management, catering, studio approval, test audiences, rating, distribution, contracts, payroll, parking and space requirements, it goes on and on. If you are starting with a story and screenplay the next step would be design. A team of designers would start with rough character sketches, and produce hundreds, more likely thousands, of variations, slowly honing in on a final design for each character.  A lead designer, the art director, would set the overall artistic style, making decisions on use of color, line weight, proportions, gesture, character, expression, etc. Environmental design would go hand in hand with the evolution of the characters, which after all must ""belong"" in the world being created.

In addition, you can adjust camera angles and sync your characters’ mouths to audio. There are also many tutorial videos available in case you need help or want to learn more about the software. People just starting out may not need or use all the tools in the most feature-rich animating programs, but advanced users require a comprehensive feature set that gives them a lot of control over their animation work. Whichever category you fall in, consider the following features: StoryboardsCreating an animated feature can be expensive and labor intensive, and planning your plot and animation before you start drawing saves time and money. During the storyboarding process, you can write the script, choose camera angles and draw quick sketches of scenes. Once you have the storyboard, you can present it to others for critique and make changes before you begin animating. You can also use your storyboard to entice people to collaborate on your project. Not all 2D animation software can storyboard, but you can purchase standalone programs to create your storyboard if this feature isn’t included in the application you choose. Character CreationThere are a lot of ways to create animated characters. For example, you may want to draw them on paper and import the drawings into your program, and not all software has this ability. Some animation programs have drawing tools so you can create your characters in the application. For more control over your illustrations, look for a program that allows you to customize brushes and has pencil, watercolor or felt tip drawing tools. In addition, it helps if the software lets you draw in layers so you can stack, cut and combine shapes to give depth to your characters. Other programs have premade pieces you can put together to create your characters, which is helpful if you don’t have an art background. AnimationDuring the animation step, you choose how characters convey emotion as well as how they walk and talk. You can create simple animations with minimal detail using almost any program. However, with more time and a high-end animation application, you can create very complex and realistic animations. “Rigging” is a term used to describe how you make a character move. You use rigging to decide how your character’s bones, muscle and fat move, and a bone-rigging tool is extremely helpful. With this tool, you can create skeletons inside your characters and objects, which helps you make them move naturally. This method is also faster than frame-by-frame animation. Some programs have sophisticated bone-rigging tools that create more nuanced and realistic movement. Onion skinning helps you create smooth motion. Programs with this feature can layer the previous and next drawings over the current one so you can see where you need to draw to create flowing movement. Tweening is a process used to generate images between keyframes, and it creates the illusion of motion. Some software automates this process and even lets you define how particular objects in images move and change by using interpolation.

So once you decide the above no matter which route you take, you will need to study up on the basic animation principles... There is a great book that every great animator will refer you to, the book is titled: ""The Animators Survival Kit"" a simple google search will yield the results. You can start with the simple bouncing of a ball which is the go to for getting started with animation, its like the ""hello world"" of programming for animaton. Scenogrophy Where you will likely be working on this solo for a while at least until you have the know how, the funds or something to showcase in order to find talented people willing to contribute to the project. You will have to look into scenogrophy to some extent to help you with your animated graphic for building better scenes improving your overall animations. Storytelling You may want to look into some general storytelling guidelines as a small piece of bonus material, it will help you when constructing your scripts for the animation and planning things out to engage your viewers, if you're a better storyteller than your viewers are far more likely to feel engaged with what they're watching and are far less likely to zone out or change to watching something else. Character Design Basics Character design rules exist based on how viewers perceive certain character shapes or stereotypes, this can be used throughout the design of your characters to help visually strengthen their personalities or roles in your animated show so that things flow. Look up some good character design for animation articles and get to reading, you will need to understand the basics to help your overall animated cartoon. There are an insane amount of very useful and totaly free resources out there for this so don't worry too much. Storyboarding If you're planning on making an animated cartoon of any sort, you 'will' need to storyboard it, many try to skip this step when they start out, others try to say that they won't need it as they are the ones animating, but I couldn't stress the importance of this process more. Through storyboarding you save a significant amount of time and get much feedback before you start animating and setting things up. It will help you plan out your animations and somewhat visualize your script before moving forward and you will be able to show this to friends and family to get some feedback on whether or not they will think it is funny/good depending on what you're going for. It's also just good practice to get into, don't worry if you're not a super awesome artist yet, the storyboards can be and should often be 'rough' anything that can visually communicate the characters and scene will work, make use of greyscale and white colours for points of interest.  Again, you can find so many online resources for this too so don't worry just try to take things slowly and don't try to digest it all at once. Management Skills Chances are, at some point you will or should want to take some help and get people working with you, for this you will need some pretty good management skills for managing both your project and the people or person you're going to be working with, this isn't as important early on as you will have so much to learn with regards to animation anyway but I felt this was a nice little extra to make you aware of. Marketing & Networking Once you've learned your animation skills. You will need to focus on networking and marketing your characters and the idea behind your animation, this is a very important stage, it should be something you start as you start your animation, not as you start learning of course but once you have built up the skills you need and learned to use the software you will be using to create your animations then you should pursue this. Usually social networks and reaching out to others in the indie scene of this industry will prove fruitful and help in many ways. General Business Skills If you're wanting to turn this into more than just a hobby cartoon series that you publish then you will want to brush up on some business related skills, how to formulate a good business plan, but again don't worry about this until you've tested the waters and know how to animate even on the most basic level and you know how to use the software, this way you will be able to build out a realistic scope of your dream animation and plan for it accordingly within your business plan for turning this hobby into a business that can be successful! Software You mentioned not having any funds available so the only real option you seem to have for a decent quality animation is ""Synfig Studio"" its a free and open source software that is pretty great and will allow you to learn animation without putting any funds into this.   Now I haven't given you a ""step-by-step"" guide of course but hopefully I've helped to fill in some blanks for you, with this you should have what you need to go and google things and find some valuable learning resources. Focus first on learning animation and the animation principles, then worry about the rest later. You can find many great talks on animation and getting started guides all over the internet, the book I referenced will be like a bible for animation though. Once you have these animation principles down look into learning the software you'll be using, which is most likely Synfig Studio, try to apply what you've been reading up on for the animation stuffs and follow some of the getting started tutorials on the software. This will take time but keep at it and things will pay off in the end!

Feel free to message me or leave a comment if you need any further elaboration on anything. I know some sections are brief but that is because you have a lot to learn before worry about the later things. Good luck with this!! I always love to hear about more people getting into animation and creating original content... Kind Regards,Patrick Griffiths.

Work is hard. Making games is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. Being able to see things to completion is a trait that is required to be successful and not completing high school would be a huge red flag. So the workaround would be to make your own games for a while (while working another job to pay your bills unless you have a sufficient cash reserve.) You’ll probably need to spend 5–10 yrs working on your own games (and releasing them) to gain enough skill that someone would pay you to do the job.

Depending on your learning speed this could be achieved in anything like a few weeks ....to a year. Step 1. Download Blender. (you can use these instructions with any other software as well)Don’t open it. Step 2. What kind of cool 3d stuff do you want to model(or draw in case your doing 2d)? example if its a spacecraft - do a few doodles/sketches or look at other spacecraft designs to get inspired and base your design on.eg: is it a spacecraft from the Star Trek universe or the Battlestar Galactica Universe?is it a cyberpunk or steampunk or retro style craft?is it a realistic craft that someone like NASA might have built?is it alien made?  create a folder.. name it “reference” and save images and sketches of spaceships you like. Step 3. By now a newer version of Blender might have released.. download and install it. Open blender. Do not model a space craft. Thats like a baby trying to drive a car before learning to walk. But seriously, the problem with making a really ambitious project your first ever 3d project is that when you fail(99% guaranteed) you will be demoralized and give up too soon. Instead go to step 4. Step 4. Open Blender, model a nut and bolt. feel good and confident, close blender, walk away.. go grab a beer(if you don’t drink, go do whatever you do to reward yourself).  Step 5. Open Blender, model a pipe.. a metal pipe.. fix the nut and bolt onto it.. continue to build a bicycle. feel good and confident, close blender, walk away.. go grab a beer. Step 6. Google: “how to animate in blender” “How to do lighting in Blender” “What is Global Illumination?” “Global Illumination in Blender” “Metal textures and materials in Blender” “plastic textures and materials in Blender” “glass textures and materials in Blender” “how to render in blender” Step 7. Open Blender, open your bicycle file. add materials and lighting to the file.. render it. feel good and confident, close blender, walk away.. go grab a beer. Step 8. repeat this process with cars, trucks.. and then.. feel good and confident, close blender, walk away.. go grab a beer. Step 9. google: “How to make a spaceship in blender” follow those instructions.. Please remember to enjoy yourself. now a few other follow up questions people ask - Can I learn just one software and do all animation in it? Yes it can be done. But no one really does that.. we all use other software to do the editing and final post production.. its just that while for example, blender does have a capable compositor and video editing capability, most of us are used to using other tools for these tasks.. and have a workflow in place. Can I do an animation film all by myself?Yes it can be done by one person. The quality may suffer, since one person may overlook certain quality problems.. ie, they may become lax with certain parts of the production. whereas multiple people working on the project will mean that someone will always notice when something looks substandard.. and will urge the others to fix it. Also remember in any animation film, the animation is only 50% of the work the rest is story, script writing, editing, sound fx, sound track, voice acting… a lot of non animation tasks make up a substantial part of it. Do you really want to do all that yourself? How long will it take me to make an animation film? How much time depends on the complexity. I’ve worked on a 3 min video that has so far been going on for over a year.. simply because rendering is taking time. Others have had issues that had to do with changes to script etc.. But safe to say you will need 6 months to a year or more. First set yourself smaller goals.. and work to achieve them.

In the case of video games, you can afford to live in other places like Austin, TX, Orlando, FL, and Atlanta, GA. 3D work is sometimes used for commercials and a lot of the times used for architecture and medical renderings. I found it hard to find 3D character animation work when I got out of college, and wish I had taken more animation for video games classes. For 2D work, you’re pretty set. You can find a lot of places (New York, Georgia, Texas, California, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, etc.) where you could find 2D animation work. Being a background designer or asset designer is a lot of what I hear companies need around here (Atlanta.) Again, it’s a little harder to be a 2D animator for Cartoon Network right off the bat, but there’s definitely more character work out there that you can start at to buff up your reel before applying to the bigger jobs. The video game industry also uses 2D animation, and a lot of Indy games have been priding themselves on developing really cool 2D aesthetics which sells right now. Hope this helps!

There are several good videos online on how to work with the software focusing on scene setup, character creation, and audio synching.  The only thing that is a drawback is that it has quite a steep learning curve.  The tools are not as intuitive as other software packages, the timeline is not as easy to work with and manipulate and if you have ever used another environment there is a lot of unlearning you will have to do to move over to this package.  However.  For the price if you are just starting out it is a great go to. On the other end of the price spectrum is Toon Boom  Harmony.  Hands down one of the most amazing pieces of software for animation creation.  It is designed for 2D animation but has 3D control over the stage, allowing you to see and manipulate objects on multiple layers in a 3D environment.  On top of this there is control over cameras which other software packages do not incorporate.  It has the best of both worlds when it comes to hybrid animation tools.  It can be leased on a monthly basis for $15 to $80 or purchased from $375 to a whopping $2000 give or take a few cents.  However, it has a perfect interface, intuitive controls, streamline environment and is used by professionals the world over to produce some of the best animations on the planet.  Some examples of this are, Family Guy, Archer, South Park, Rick and Morty, SpongeBob, Bob's Burgers, Simpsons, and Clarence just to name a few.  This software is attached to more successful shows that I want to count.  The Toon Boom site has a full list if you have the time and curiosity.  As a side note there is also a very powerful tool in Storyboard Pro which allows for some great pre production / production workflow, check it out if you get the chance. Last but not least and my personal favorite for indie production  on a budget is Adobe Animate.  This software, once known - not that long ago as Adobe Flash and before that as Macromedia Flash has been around for almost 20 years.  This gives you a wonderful collection of learning resources from online courses, DVD's, web videos, books, and entire sites devoted to animating in Flash.  Let's move on to the environment.  It is very easy to use.  A variety of layouts for every screen size and monitor setup.  The timeline and stage are easy to navigate, making it simple to create walk, run and other cycles, and then embed them in other videos to allow for reusable animated sequences.  Pressure sensitivity when drawing with a tablet, and the ability to scrub through the audio when synching dialogue.  Overall it is a great piece of software.  There is no more purchasing outright however, the software is leased through a cloud service for $20 US / Month, and with an added $10 / Month you get Photoshop for creating backgrounds and static props.  The software is capable of exporting for film and television, for online distribution and in High Definition.  It does however lack the stage and camera controls of Toon Boom. Well there it is.  The animation station run down 2D edition.  Do with it what you will.  Most of these have one month demos for free.  Give them a go and have some fun.  Good luck and I hope to see your work one day.

As this is a web based platform it also raises security and privacy concerns related to sensitive materials and yet to be patented IPs.Blender has an amazingly large and friendly community behind it that would be hard to create for any other 3D creation platform stemming from a difference in ideology of its user base. Since the moment Blender became open source it has been in large a community of hardcore hobbyists who have used it and improved upon it because they enjoy creating things and bringing their ideas to life; Closed software on the other hand has always been at a job orinted stance. If you weren't using the software for a job you more then likely didn’t buy it as it was prohibitively expensive for a hobbiest. The people who know how to use closed software are less likely to share what they know because they are in a competitve inviroment. With Blender and its community the idea of keeping knowledge to yourself to be more competitive is quickly dissolving in the 3D and video game space with events like the Blender Conference and GDC where professionals and hobbyists alike exchange their ideas so that everyone can sharpen their skills.One of the key differences between SketchUp and Blender is the speed at which you can get things done. SketchUp is certainly easier for beginners to get into but once you get used to navigating Blender you quickly realize how much faster everything moves and how much more powerful and versatile Blender is out of the box. If you need more functionality there are plenty of plugins already available in Blender’s settings and a lot more to be found around the internet.Blender just recently got one of its biggest updates to date making it more user friendly than ever. It is quickly becoming an industry standard and in the last year has gotten a slew of of major contributors to help keep its development moving and adding to swiss army knife like portfolio. SketchUp on the other hand had an up tic of excitement for it when it was under the Google banner and has since fallen into a niche since the company dumped the project. SketchUp is not what I would consider a vanguard of the industry and quite frankly it's feature set is dry.Best of luck TP.

As we speak, a friend of mine, a manuscript editor, is inputting XML tags into a document that indicate where images, headlines, and other graphical elements should be inserted. That Word document then goes to press—layout, composition, and formatting all done by an XML engine that spits out a press-ready PDF that goes directly to the printing plate (for larger journals) or directly to a glorified laser printer (for smaller journals.) If you missed the part where a graphic designer even looked at the material, you’re not alone. You can buy a system like this for about a third of my annual salary at my old employer.

The most familiar form of 2D animations can be found by watching Saturday morning cartoons with your kids, or even simpler animations every day when you surf the web. It takes on the forms of advertisements, e-cards, etc. The basic starting point for all animations is a storyboard that lays out the basic script in a visual format, much like an extra large comic strip. From that point, a rough audio track of the script is created to give animators something to sync with their drawings. This form of animation uses ""vector graphics,"" meaning that the images are based upon mathematical equations, rather than by an array of pixels, such as in ""raster graphics"". Although similar in some ways to 2D animations, 3D computer animation is a different process, as a scene being done in 3D is created long before any actual animation begins. Even in general terms, most people automatically think 3D when they are speaking or reading about computer animation, partly due to its flexibility. What many people do not realize is that the entertainment industry and specifically motion picture applications, while possibly being the forerunners in advancing technologies, only account for a fraction of the 3D animations market. Actually, there is very little difference between computer animation and what is called traditional animation. The main difference is the tools that are used to create animations, the effort, and the price. Traditional 3D animation was more like claymations and was done by using stop-motion filming technique. Essentially, the true concept of 3D animations did not really catch on until the use of computers for animation became more cost-effective and practical. Although the entertainment industry is largely responsible for the advances in 3D computer animation, they make up only a small part of the market that uses 3D animations. Animation designs sell products; it is also used as a teaching aid because it presents information in a more understandable way. Many animations can be created completely on a computer, but depending on the type of animation desired, such as cartoon animations, there may be the need for some hand-penciling work to be done.

If you're using computer programs like Flash, Adobe Animate, or ToonBoom, you can cut down your estimated work time a little. For example, a lot of the cartoons you see one TV are small, self-contained episodes, rarely more than 18 minutes long. There are whole studios dedicated to ensuring these are made on time. They have teams of background artists, character designers, animators, effects animators, and scriptors to ensure everything goes as smoothly as possible. Those dedicated teams could make an episode in a few weeks. But note that those teams have years of experience behind them. They all know their job and exactly how to do it. Amateur animators do not. If you're looking to make a student animation, chances are you won't get more than 2.5 minutes of solid animation done in a year of dedicated work.

With pencil and paper, animation the traditional way, you're looking at anything from a year to several years. This is including the story development, writing, and all the pre-production processes as well, and the ideal amount of dedicated animators. For reference, with only me working on one single character in a single scene (pencil and paper animation), it took me three weeks to animate eight seconds.

I will tell you right now that animation is extremely difficult to do well, and the quality of your work is directly proportional to the amount of time you spend on it. So the more time you spend polishing your shots, the better they'll be. When I first began attending Animation Mentor, I knew it would be hard...but I was not prepared for just how difficult an art form animation is. In my opinion, it is the most difficult craft to master, because you have to understand multiple principles - physics, weight, line, force, drawing skills, visual appeal, anticipation, storytelling, framing, speed, lighting...everything. This is not something you can just ""pick up"" in a couple of hours, with minimal input. I'm absolutely serious about this: You will only get as much as you put in.That said, the real answer is that depending on what you want to do, it won't be difficult to create something appealing with minimal input...you just have to strike the right chord with your audience. I would suggest you take some tutorials on After Effects, learn keyframe animation, and then do something very simple that doesn't follow traditional animation fundamentals of weight and motion...the popular ""Dumb Ways to Die"" animated music video springs to mind. But in that case, the appeal doesn't lie so much with the animation and the action as with the character designs: if you have a crappy story with crappy-looking characters and crappy animation, no one will probably want to watch it. Focus on two of those three elements being good, and you probably have something people will like. You could also think about doing stop motion with minimal frames, or drawing on a white board like many of the explainer videos that are popular right now. Come up with a unique visual style, and you might succeed.What this basically boils down to is: don't be lazy. It sounds like you want to be able to create something good with minimal investment on your part (both temporal and monetary), and without having to spend the effort to learn and polish new skills. I'm sorry, but life doesn't work that way. Spend the effort learning and practicing if you want to create something grand. Ok, I'm going to give you two answers.

In some software this is more easily controlled because the software allows for better control over stage elements and individual cameras, allowing for more complex sequencing.  Having said all of this I will give you my opinion of a few popular software packages for both professionals and hobbyists. The choice for 3D when starting out in my mind would be Blender.  This is a great piece of software and it's free.  It allows for complex, well rendered, detailed animations and it has smooth workflow.  The examples of what this software can do are abundant and readily available with a simple web search.  There are also many resources related to the software, how to use it, how to work with it professionally, all available as books and trainer videos. For 2D animation creation there are many software options but I will stick to the three I am most familiar with.  Anime Studio Pro, Toon Boom, and Adobe Animate - Formerly Adobe Flash. Anime Studio Pro is a good piece of software for creating animation, it has a good price ranging anywhere from $50 to $100 on sale for most versions.  There are several good videos online on how to work with the software focusing on scene setup, character creation, and audio synching.  The only thing that is a drawback is that it has quite a steep learning curve.  The tools are not as intuitive as other software packages, the timeline is not as easy to work with and manipulate and if you have ever used another environment there is a lot of unlearning you will have to do to move over to this package.  However.  For the price if you are just starting out it is a great go to. On the other end of the price spectrum is Toon Boom.  Hands down one of the most amazing pieces of software for animation creation.  It is designed for 2D animation but has 3D control over the stage, allowing you to see and manipulate objects on multiple layers in a 3D environment.  On top of this there is control over cameras which other software packages do not incorporate.  It has the best of both worlds when it comes to hybrid animation tools.  It can be leased on a monthly basis for $15 to $80 or purchased from $375 to a whopping $2000 give or take a few cents.  However, it has a perfect interface, intuitive controls, streamline environment and is used by professionals the world over to produce some of the best animations on the planet.  Some examples of this are, Family Guy, Archer, South Park, Rick and Morty, SpongeBob, Bob's Burgers, Simpsons, and Clarence just to name a few.  This software is attached to more successful shows that I want to count.  The Toon Boom site has a full list if you have the time and curiosity. Last but not least and my personal favorite for indie production  on a budget is Adobe Animate.  This software, once known - not that long ago as Adobe Flash and before that as Macromedia Flash has been around for almost 20 years.  This gives you a wonderful collection of learning resources from online courses, DVD's, web videos, books, and entire sites devoted to animating in Flash.  Let's move on to the environment.  It is very easy to use.  A variety of layouts for every screen size and monitor setup.  The timeline and stage are easy to navigate, making it simple to create walk, run and other cycles, and then embed them in other videos to allow for reusable animated sequences.  Pressure sensitivity when drawing with a tablet, and the ability to scrub through the audio when synching dialogue.  Overall it is a great piece of software.  There is no more purchasing outright however, the software is leased through a cloud service for $20 US / Month, and with an added $10 / Month you get Photoshop for creating backgrounds and static props.  The software is capable of exporting for film and television, for online distribution and in High Definition.  Well there it is.  The animation station run down.  Do with it what you will.  Most of these have one month demos for free.  Give them a go and have some fun.  Good luck with your animation and I hope to see your work one day.

Thanks to hardware limitations in the 80’s and 90’s, those older 2D titles had to compromise frames (that is, the smoothness of the animation) for functionality. Modern 2D games sometimes still use sprites, but there aren’t as many technical limitations now, allowing for much more detailed results. Although these types of animations can be beautiful, they’re also very time consuming to produce. Cuphead, a game inspired by and employing traditional 2D animation, is a great example of this. The game took five years to produce, comparable to the development time of big-profile games like Grand Theft Auto and The Legend of Zelda. Maybe you can see why:  That flower illustration was just one frame in a game with 50,000 frames of animation. Thankfully, there are tricks in modern game animation that allow 2D games to look smoother than the old days, without a crazy amount of extra effort. Computer software can be used to interpolate between frames, essentially filling in gaps in the animation. This is often the case when animating with 3D models, although it can also be used on 2D illustrations. Modern tech also allows animators to find some pretty crafty ways to deceive our eyes into seeing 2D. By animating with a 3D rig first, developers can superimpose a 2D artstyle overtop. This is how the main character in Dead Cells is animated while still maintaining the appearance of classic pixel art.    An industry lead in 2D-esque 3D, Arc System Works, use some technological wizardry to make their 3D games resemble TV-level anime, to the point that it’s difficult to tell 3D models are being employed.  The modern tech essentially make it easier on the animators so they don’t have to create every single frame by hand like in older titles. But if animators want to do it the (usually) more time consuming method of animating individual sprites, they can do that too. It comes down to preference. Some developers (especially indie teams) are more comfortable or efficient at working with sprites, while others choose a 2D style out of artistic preference.  I’m not in game dev, so just know that this is my best understanding of how game animation works from taking interest in games from a bunch of different eras. If you’re curious and have time to kill, I’d recommend you check out a few other things: Art Design Deep Dive: Using a 3D pipeline for 2D animation in Dead CellsNew Frame Plus does a great job of explaining Arc System Work’s technique, and the video also gives some great context to how frames work in animation.

However, if the point here is to animate with a minimum amount of resources and effort, then you should obviously work in a digital 2d-animation program at a computer. You are already at a computer if you are reading this, so the bigger part of your investment is already made. The ""look and feel"" of traditional cut-out animation can easily be achieved in computer programs such as  Adobe Flash Professional , Toon Boom Animation  or  Anime Studio 2D . These are considered the ""Big 3"" in 2D animation today. The differences between the programs and their different iterations are a bit too complex to go into here, but I'd advise you to do some research on these programs depending on your budget and what you want to get out of the program. Then again, maybe you really don't even want to get into the process of actually animating, but rather just want to utilize a drag-and-drop based program with pre-recorded animations to create a short presentation of some kind? Then you should look into  GoAnimate or Crazy Talk Cartoon Maker. Using these programs is as easy as it is ever going to get, but they obviously have rather big creative limitations. Essentially you will be remixing and tweaking other peoples pre-recorded animations and designs to make your own. So there you have it. There is a plethora of resources out there today if you want create moving images, but your first priority should be to lock down  what you want to achieve and how much time, effort and cash you are willing to invest in your project.

How capable is the developer? For someone to do something right, and know they did it right, they had to have done it at least three times. If they get it right the first time, it’s luck. Even if they did it right, they won’t know why. The second time, they’ll try to put more things in, make new mistakes, have no idea why it doesn’t work this time, and generally make a mess. In terms of being able to execute, the second system an engineer makes is the most dangerous thing they will ever attempt. By the time they get to the third try, they have a better idea of how much they don’t know and will go back to making it simple and easy to reason about. You want someone who’s made something like Wix or Squarespace at least three times. Preferably four or more. If your someone has never done it before, double my estimate. Don’t worry, we’ll get to that in a minute. From Wikipedia: Squarespace is a software as a service-based content management system, integrated website builder, blogging platform, hosting service, commerce platform, and domain name registrar. The system allows individuals and businesses to create and maintain websites, blogs, and online stores. For a single person to make something like Wix/Squarespace, they need full-stack skills. They need automation skills (there’s no way something like that will scale without an automated release system). They’ll need to know about user interface design, system architecture, front-end development, user management, tests, security, data management, databases, e-commerce, DNS, networking. They’ll need to know about what happens when there’s 10 users, and what happens when there’s 1,000,000. Even if they abstract a lot of that out into managed services on a cloud provider like Amazon AWS, they still need to know how it all works (because they’ll need to fix it when it breaks). What’s the definition of done? Does “done” equal a bare-bones implementation that will serve minimum traffic, have no CI/CD automation, allow the customization of a single template, and limp website to sell it? Or does “done” mean that it can operate with the same efficiency, robustness, and resiliency of a production website serving hundreds of thousands of customers and millions of requests a day? I’m guessing you want the latter. The first is just an MVP, to prove that it works. Wix has already proven that it works. You want a Wix competitor. Great. I’ve got all that. How long will it take? This is where your decision-making skills come into play. If you have a unicorn developer who can do all of that, and spends a month designing the system architecture, designing the user interface, establishing what the system will do, what it will not do, and then you leave them alone to do their thing, and don’t bother them with stuff you want to add because you think it will be really cool, it will take them a year. That’s a lie, they’ll never finish. Six months into the project, you’ll realize that they’re going too slow and you don’t think they’ll hit their target. You’ll hire more people onto the project. The first person will be resentful and won’t want to share. Even if they do want to share, they’ll have written something that only they understand, and you’ll lose even more time bringing everybody up to speed. Eight months after that, you’ll be two months late and you still won’t have a finished product. The first person will have either quit or will be throwing up roadblocks whenever the new people want to change something to make it better. They’ll be talking about something called Agile and stand-ups and the first person wants to do Kanban and they spend a lot of time arguing and not enough time moving the product forward. You’ll hire a manager to deal with it. Eighteen months after you started, you’ll get the MVP, plus a couple of features they threw in because just the MVP would be embarrassing. The first manager has since quit, and you’ve hired another one. You’ll want to fire all of them, but you can’t, you’ve already spent so much money and you won’t be able to walk away from it. You pay a contractor for four weeks of work to build a shiny website to sit in front of your shoddy MVP and then you try to sell it to a VC group, so you can keep the project going. You’ve mortgaged your house and all your hair is white/gone. Your health is declining and you stress-eat donuts and you’ve gained forty pounds. Rewind to today. Hire a team with a devops culture. One that has worked together before and gels well. Give them a clear set of requirements, work through their design process, and then give them a giant stack of money. Get your Wix/Squarespace competitor in 8–12 months. But I don’t need all that! I just want the website generator. Oh! Then my original estimate of a year stands, especially if they’ve never done it before, and you want something as feature rich and solid. Half that if they’ve done it before.

With some of the DIY tools, it’s a lot cheaper: Squarespace is anything from $140 to $480 annually depending on the plan you pickWix is from $60 to $350 annuallyLast but not least, building a site with WordPress is usually in the $60-$90 a year range.Then, there's the topic of how comfortable you are with DIY tools. Though, I wouldn't worry too much about that since the tools of today (Squarespace, Wix, etc.) are all user friendly and can be used by beginners very effectively. Essentially, you just sign up, pick a design, get through the settings, and you walk out with a perfectly functioning website. You do need to spend an afternoon going through these things, but it’s time well invested. Overall, I’d advise trying to build a site yourself first. Giving it a good couple of days to pick your platform, select a design, and set everything up. If you feel overwhelmed and can't figure things out on your own, this is when you should consider finding some help. My personal favorite tool for all-things website building is WordPress. It gives you more control than Squarespace or Wix, while also letting you go the easy path if you want to and simply select an off-the-shelf design and install it with one click. Not to mention that currently more than 30% of all websites run on WordPress.

6043d16ded76476feda35603,https://www.quora.com/Did-services-like-Squarespace-kill-off-web-development?-,"I think this is a great and import question to answer. The world of web design and development is evolving quickly. Are services like Squarespace, Weebly, Wix, and others killing off web development? In my opinion, no. Here’s why. While DIY website building tools are powerful and easy to use, they do not solve every problem that someone needing a website may need to resolve. In those cases a different solution is needed. Ofter a solution like Wordpress or Drupal could be used. Other times a completely custom solution is needed using a Javascript based framework or Ruby on Rails. In those cases a web developer is engaged in the development of the site. I also know several developers (including myself) that are using Squarespace for our clients. I actually love working within Squarespace. I may get slaughtered by other developers, but for me…I love it. Squarespace is really working hard to make a place for designers and developers to user their solution. They even built a developers backend. It doesn’t allow us to do everything that we may want at times, but it does give us massive flexibility for making Squarespace work for our clients. Another thing to remember is that solutions like this still require developers to build out the tool itself. Companies including Squarespace need developers as part of their team to build the tools that others are using. Developers are the backbone of making these site building tools amazing. I’m excited about the innovation and creative thinking that is currently happening in the industry. Amazing new companies are creating a brave new world. Without developers, many of these innovations would never happen.

Here are some of the key points which matters the most while before choosing the best platform: Ease of useExtensions and integrationsThe priceDesigns and TemplatesExtensions and integrationsEcommerceInformation portabilityDialects and InternationalizationEase of use:Most of the business owners and also the beginner level users are not aware of the HTML, CSS, and other code-related things. For them, Wordpress is the best choice as they can easily start creating a blog without hiring a developer. The Wordpress content editor is very easy to use as it comes with custom blocks to simply add content elements to the pages, so as to build beautiful layouts with good content.  2. The price Knowing how much the platform is going to cost is very important in making a business decision. Wordpress is free to use whereas Squarespace starts from $12 on a monthly basis.  For beginners, I will recommend using Wordpress as it is an open software which gives complete freedom and control as well. In order to build a website with Wordpress you just need to register a domain and get a reliable hosting provider. Shared hosting is always considered the perfect choice for beginners. Wordpress is popular because the overall cost of building the website with Wordpress is low. 3. Extensions and integrations: Wordpress is a clear winner as it comes with thousands of plugins and integrations. The plugins are like apps which one can install to add new features or change the default behavior of your site. They also have plenty of premium Wordpress plugins which is available from third party websites. 4. Design and templates: Wordpress comes out to be a clear winner when in terms of design choices, flexibility, and customization options. Wordpress offers access to thousands of free and paid website templates. These templates are customizable and also allows you to use your own website logo, colors, upload your own images, and more.  Also, many Wordpress themes come with multiple layouts choices, drag and drop page builders, sliders, and a lot of other features as well. 5. Ecommerce: Wordpress is much better when it comes to building an online store, as it allows you to integrate and payment platform which you need. There are many Wordpress plugins available which easily accepts the payment online. Stripe, Paypal, Payoneer, and even Bitcoin are some of the most popular plugins if you need to accept payments.  It has a lot of eCommerce plugins which turns your website into an online store within minutes. 6. Dialects and Internationalization Wordpress is way ahead in comparison with Squarespace when it comes to languages and localization options. Most of the Wordpress themes are translation ready and also many of the Wordpress plugins are also translated into many languages. Wordpress website can be build up in any language you want and also you can translate Wordpress yourself if the language is not available. 7. Information Portability: WordPress beats Squarespace completely as it has easy to manage tools where one can export the entire site easily. Not just the content and images, but also one can easily backup the themes, plugins as well.  Conclusion: Wordpress is a better platform in comparison with Squarespace if you need to start a website. The major cons of Squarespace which I figured as follows: Its cost is higher than the shared hosting website.It has limited designs choices and a limited set of features.The limitations are the major disadvantage in growing business.Some of the pros of Squarespace are as follows: Hassle-free website setupIt is easy to use for small business website only.Hope it helped!

You’ll end up working overtime, late at night, without any extra compensation.I have seen many a developer (not only web) who thought they knew what they were doing. Nothing written, drawn, sketched, just the thought in the head that “it should take only a couple of hours”.The plan may be wrong at some points (needing correction or elaboration), but at least it helps you tackle the problems you see waaaay ahead. And when you write it down, you may “discover” things that weren’t among your thoughts.Don’t ever give a time (and thus a cost) estimate before you create the plan for the brief. If you are 100% sure about how to solve the given task (e.g.: YOU have done it before), you might create the plan only in your mind, and get away with it. But for problems that you haven’t encountered before: give yourself some time to think it over.The second most amateur move is trying to work faster, when someone says informally to “hurry up, the project’s already late”.If you make a mistake in such a hurry, nobody will think that “this developer tried his/her best to get the results in a less than enough timeframe. Give him a break, and find the person really responsible for not having enough time for actual development.” No. They will say: “The developer. Again. It’s his/her fault. Always late, whining about deadlines, and making errors even I could see and fix.”Development is a heavy brain process that requires time. If time is crucial, then plan tasks so, that they may be carried out correctly.So, I think the most important thing is planning (to have a realistic sense about the task), and the most amateur move is to think that “doing” is more important than “thinking”. Both are required to carry out tasks in a satisfactory way.",2021-03-06T19:22:17.954Z,"What is the most amateur move to do in web development? ",Quora

In fact, you can, but you have to sell your soul for that)) So, in these 7 months I have leaved with my lowest income and have spent very few money. I was dedicated at least 6 hours a day to learn web development. It was a blast for me! Never though that this will be such an interesting topic. So much to learn, so many resources, so many answer to all of my questions. I am bad at math. I don’t have an analytical way of thinking. I was a creative guy… and that’s all.

In this domain, I am way more free and creative than I was in the video and domain. So, my answer is DEFINITELY IT IS WORTH IT to invest time in Web Development, if you want a steady income and a pleasure to work. It is not for everybody, like all of professions, but this domain is quite large, so you can dive in many different aspect of web development (front-end, back-end, web design, testing, etc).

However, I haven’t stuck with anything as long as I have with Squarespace! My top 5 reasons why I choose Squarespace are: 1. modern & responsive design templates Squarespace has a number of sleek modern templates to choose from. Now, the platform may not have as many templates as WordPress — but ever heard the phrase “too many options make it harder to choose.” Yep, exactly! Squarespace lets you view each template on a live demo website. So, rather than just pictures, you actually see and manipulate how the site works! It also shows a handful of websites using that template. You can see the versatility from the client’s perspective. An up-to-date look is crucial for any website. Squarespace takes some of the pressure off modernizing your site by supplying you with trend-setting designs. All the templates are mobile responsive. That means that your website will be flexible and easy to view on any device. Plus, you don’t have to do anything — these capabilities are built in! Check out Squarespace templates here → All this just makes the process that much easier, especially for the do-it-yourselfer — which brings me to my next point. 2. easy “diy” interface One of my favorite things about Squarespace is how easy it is to build a website. Squarespace keeps everything simple and straightforward, unlike many other web builder platforms. You can easily navigate the back-end of the platform — adding pages, updating blogs, and changing your site design through an easy-to-use style guide tab. For some users, there may be a bit of a learning curve. But, honestly, once you start playing around, you’ll find that there’s nothing you can’t manage. It’s literally step by step. 3. all-in-one package What other platform gives you everything? Well, what do I mean by everything? With Squarespace, you can have eCommerce, blogging, templates, email marketing, hosting, and domains all in one. No third party integration is necessary. For most users, being able to tap into all of these resources easily is a must. This is especially the case for businesses where a small team, or even one person, is trying to tackle all of these elements at once. Having the ability to update, manage, and build your business in one space is a dream come true. 4. super responsive customer service Even the best of designers may run into a situation where they need support. Thankfully, Squarespace customer services is awesome sauce — for real! It’s a super-responsive live chat with people who actually know what they’re talking about. To date, I have yet to leave Squarespace customer support chat without a solution. We’re not talking about a call center that sends you to several different departments and so forth. I mean open a live chat, wait in queue for your agent, and get instant support on your site with a rep who is actually knowledgeable about the platform. I mean, how often does that happen? And that’s not even mentioning the resource area, which has support for all aspects of Squarespace. There are helpful articles and plenty of tutorial videos to get you through any issue imaginable. 5. squarespace listens! Squarespace Circle is a community of designer using the Squarespace platform to build websites (DailyMode Studio is one of those designers!). Squarespace actively communicates with this community and takes heed of its advice, using it to better the customer experience for us designers and you clients. Story time… Squarespace recently made a change to the order of the back-end menu options in hope of creating a better customer experience. Most of the Circle members were thrilled about the majority of the changes, but there were updates in the design section that we KNEW were going to complicate things for everyone else. We expressed our concerns and, by the next day – literally – Squarespace made changes based on our feedback. That, my friends, is called listening!!! Squarespace cares about your experience and ability to grow your business. I’d rather choose a platform that listens than one that doesn’t care.

As such, you don't really have to think about the site design. Creating your website with the site builder is simply a matter of choosing the appearance you want to have.     Step by Step Wizard     The site builders typically provide a step by step wizard, that takes you through the steps of selecting a design and entering your site information. It gives the user the impression that the whole process is very easy, and doable.    No Need to Upload Files and Whatnot     Since you design your website online, with the site builder, there's no need for you to upload (publish) your web page and images. The site builder creates the files directly in your web hosting account. To newcomers, the process of uploading a website can seem daunting at first, and so this painless procedure has tremendous allure. Why You Should Not Use the Online Site Builder If You Can In spite of the above, when visitors ask me this question, I normally recommend that they forgo the online web builder and learn to use an offline, standalone web editor. In the short term, this may seem like it increases the hurdle of getting your site onto the Internet, but there are far-reaching long term benefits.    Flexibility, Control and Transferability of Skills     Building your website using a site builder only seems easy on the surface, since it provides the illusion you don't need to dream up the visual appearance of your website. You can simply use their provided templates.     But despite what newcomers think, designing a website is more than creating an pleasing visual look. There are far more important aspects to web design, including usability and search engine friendliness.     As you learn more about these things, you will want to modify your website so that it is more usable and search engine friendly. When you limit yourself to a site builder, you are surrendering flexibility and total control in exchange for initial ease-of-use.     Now, of course it's possible that some site builders provide you with facilities to modify every aspect of your web pages. To do that, you will probably have to spend time learning the interface and working with it (or even around it) to accomplish your task. Why bother? All the skills you acquire in working with the site builder are not transferable. The moment you leave that web host, you have to re-learn everything again. You might as well have spent the time learning a standalone web editor. Your skills will then be usable no matter which web host you use, even if they don't provide a site builder.  Content     When I said that using a site builder provides you the illusion of ease of use, I really meant it. The most important part of the time creating any website is drafting your content, whether it is your product description, sales pitch or some other thing. When you use a site builder, you still have to invest time and energy writing that content. There is no shortcut. If the pretty face of the online site maker led you to think that creating a website will take you no time at all, think again. The only one that can generate good content is you. The site builder will not write it for you. All it can create are the pseudo-Latin ""lorem ipsum"" gobbledygook meant as placeholders for your real text.    Transferability of Web Design: Are You Locked into Your Web Host?     I have had visitors to Website design, promotion, CGI, PHP, JavaScript scripting, and revenue earning. writing to me to tell me about how their website was locked to a particular web host, because they used their host's website builder. The template and graphics used by the builder were copyrighted, and licensed to them for use on their website only if the site remained on that host. If they were to move to another web host, they could no longer use that template.     This, I think, is the most serious problem of all. Does your site builder tie you to your web host? Will you be able to move to another web host simply by transferring all the files to the other host? If you find that the terms of use of those templates do not allow this, you should not even consider using the site builder. Never allow your site to be locked into any web host. If the hosting company deteriorates, or unreasonably increases their rates, or even goes out of business, your website and your business will be held hostage. Newcomers to website building are often highly tempted to use the site builder that is provided by the web host, for a few reasons:     Pre-built Templates     The site builders come with a selection of pre-built templates for your website.

At the time WordPress couldn't do what I needed and Joomla had too many deal killers for what mattered to me. I worked with Drupal for 2 years but I could never love it and I wasn't quite sure why. About 1.5 years ago I had someone ask me to do a WordPress project (developing admin components in PHP) to which I agreed with the intention of returning to Drupal. But by the time I was finished I had realized that WordPress was far easier to develop for than Drupal and that it had a much better model (IMO) for separation of code from design so I decided to switch. In Drupal the URL enters and Drupal figures out what to do with it by delegating work to ""nodes"" and ""blocks"" and then collects up all the output and send it to the browser.   In contrast when WordPress receives the URL it figures out what to do with it then turns over full control to the template and its the template's responsibility to call back in to WordPress to get data for ""posts"" and ""sidebars.""   On the surface the WordPress approach looks like more duplication, and it is, but it turns out to be brilliant because it enables the necessary flexibility to get a project done like the client wants without any ""Sorry, we just can't do that w/o rewriting/duplicating much of the core engine.""   What I found from my own experience is that I could get 85% done with Drupal in no time and then work for months to get the last 15% done, if ever. With WordPress the first 85% takes longer, but not much longer, whereas the latter 15% can get done in weeks, comparatively speaking. There are two (2) places today where I can see Drupal still has the upper hand;  1.) Where there are no existing plugins for WordPress that do (though unlikely) and the Drupal feature set enables a user to get 100% of what they want without coding, and coding in PHP is not an option,  2.) Maybe in certain enterprise scenarios (although I'm just giving Drupal the benefit of the doubt because I don't know for certain what these situations would be.) For all others WordPress wins hands down in my book. Of course, this is all just IMO. Hope this helps. -Mike",2021-03-06T19:29:14.270Z,"Why are some people using WordPress rather than Drupal? ",Quora

Are you just not getting what you want? Are the colors wrong? The font you selected not looking right or hard to read? Are the images not aligned the way you want? Making a website is a publishing task that requires multiple skills. You have to have good page content copy. You need a good layout structure best for your site theme and purpose. You select colors and font that is clear to read and go well together. You need to select and place your images. There's the logo to make and perhaps a video or image slideshow to make. Your content may include an events calendar, contact form and a membership form. You may need a way to sell products or put up an image gallery. When I create webpages first I choose whether to make the page from scratch (Notepad) or get a template and adapt that. I learned all my web programming by myself as I went. I never learned it in any school or course, but I learned the basic fundamentals that apply to any design project. If I type a page, I follow a set of code formatting conventions to make my code easy to read and prevent coding errors. I put comment labels on my sections and choose easy to identify names (#bannerbox). For help in choosing colors and fonts, I don't trust my eyes, I find pages that help me make the best choices. A CSS guide can help choose the best objects to use for your text and image content. If I am adapting from a template, I study the template to determine what features I want and how the sections work. The general idea is to start with a website design that you can realistically use to build your site. Choose the simplest for your first site and work with that. Determine what features your site must have as a priority and work to build that first. As your skills improve work on more difficult pages or features. I have a club website that I am proud to say works very well and has been running for 14 years. It's got an events calendar, contact form, membership form page, an officers page and an ""about us"" page. It's essentially a web version of a brochure. What I did not know how to do from scratch, I found a plugin or service to help me (like the calendar). One thing I want to have someday is a membership login but I am not sure how to do that with what I have or how to make that work with the multi-platform template. My approach to this is to find a service or help page to walk me through it if I decide to go through with this upgrade to our site. So start with the basics on your site. Do first what you know how to do to create a good site that people can use. Get feedback from your visitors (very important). Expand your site as you learn new skills and determine what features you want to have. =====Added: Links to very useful web design sites you should have next to your projects so they are handy. I focus on color since that is probably the first decision you will need to make when creating your site. Try other similar sites until you find ones you like best. Web Colors: (there are many)Some pages are for selecting specific color codes if you are looking for a matching code or colors. Others help you select good combinations to use. HTML Color Picker - W3 Schools color chart - pick a color then lighten or darkenWeb Color Chart - Hexadecimal - by VisiBone - Chart with hexadecimal codes, this is good for studying web color variations and getting to know them by code. (#ffffff is white and #000000 is black)Web Color Codes - This one uses your choice of picker options. You can start with a chart. Adjust it with a color picker. Choose by name or RGB code if you prefer.Eyedropper, Color Picker, Gradient Generator and more - Chrome plug in helps pick matching colors using eyedropper method. Cool if you want your site color to match your site logo or cover photo.Color Combinations | Color Schemes | Color Palettes - This helps you choose color combinations that work. Choose a range of best options and try them all. You won't know exactly until you see it on your pages and try different browsers and screens. Use search and replace to swap out color options.",2021-03-06T19:29:32.009Z,"How can I develop good-looking websites if I have learned HTML and CSS? ",Quora

Firstly, because both services are very reputable and have millions of active users. Secondly, because the former is a website builder, while the latter is an open-source platform. It’s like comparing the strength of boxers belonging to different weight categories. Nonetheless, one day you can find yourself deciding between these two services for your next online project. Which one to choose Squarespace or WordPress? Read this review to find out the benefits and disadvantages of these web publishing solutions. 1. Ease of Use Squarespace. The latest version of Squarespace is much easier than its predecessors. Its interface is cleaner and less complicated. To create a website, Squarespace users don’t necessarily have to know how to code. Unless you want to get under the hood, the builder is completely code-free. At this point, the key advantage of Squarespace over WordPress is its coherence: you get everything you need to design, customize, publish and maintain a website in one place, with all the heavy lifting done by the system (hosting, maintenance etc.). WordPress. WordPress is a rather intuitive CMS, but it still has a slight learning curve. If you know what it takes to get a site online, WordPress can be a great option. But if you’re looking for an ‘all-in-one’ platform that supports WYSIWYG and drag-and-drop editing, you’d better opt for a site builder. Wordpress editor squarespace vs WordPress. The answer seems obvious. Of course, the site builder is easier than the open-source CMS. While Squarespace is mainly targeting the end user who has no idea about how websites are being made, WordPress is meant for those who know a thing or two about website creation. Squarespace includes a library of themes, ready-to-use widgets, and hosting. This is a secure, managed hosting platform, which means you don’t have to do anything in terms of hosting. With WordPress, you have to purchase and manage a web hosting account yourself. This is both a disadvantage and advantage. It’s an advantage, because in WordPress you have full control over your site and can transfer it to any other provider, at any time. It’s a disadvantage because website maintenance is a complex process for a newbie.  2. Feature Set and Flexibility Squarespace. Squarespace is a feature-rich publishing platform. It offers a decent selection of in-house apps and widgets, and also leaves enough room for customization. In my opinion, it provides enough tools to build a quality website. These include: eCommerce. Squarespace gives the ability to sell both tangible and digital goods, ShipStation integration, Stripe and PayPal support, customizable order confirmation emails, the ability to add store managers who’ll have control over inventory, but not the rest of your website, data export, coupons, taxes, and more. Squarespace eCommerce Blogging. Squarespace blogging engine supports scheduled posts, built-in Google Author Rank, tag support, post display options, multiple author support, geo tagging, customizable URLs etc. Importing and exporting. You can import your blog content from WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr or Posterous. Import products from BigCartel and Shopify. You may also export your Squarespace content to WordPress. Multiple contributors with different access levels. Squarespace gives access levels include Administrator, Content Editor, Billing, Reporting, Comment Moderator, Trusted Commenter, and Store Manager. Connected services. Squarespace provides Dropbox file synchronization, simultaneous posting (auto-posts to Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr). Moreover – you can import your blog from WP to Squarespace. For power users, Squarespace offers Developer Platform, where you get full code control, from the opening doctype tag to the footer. Besides, all templates are exposed via Git, meaning that you can work with a team and roll back changes easily. WordPress. WordPress is very flexible. Whether you need to build a webstore, a portfolio or a blog, WordPress can be the right choice. Thanks to the extensibility of the platform, you can create almost any website imaginable. However, you should know that almost any new feature in WordPress requires a plugin, be it an SEO pack, a social media plugin or a commenting system. Though these are quite easy to install and configure, the flipside of this concept is that over time your website accumulates many plugins which can overlap and also make your WordPress website heavier. WordPress vs Squarespace. Though WordPress seems more flexible, I wouldn’t call it the clear winner. It depends on your needs. Don’t get caught up in the “more is better” mentality, unless you really need it. But you should also realize that if your website expands outside of Squarepace’s capabilities, and you don’t want to sign up for the Developer platform, you’ll have to migrate your website to a more scalable platform.

This means that the right to your car, for example, is digitized in the form of a token. A token is a unique set of characters and it can only work in a certain environment. In our case, the blockchain is such an environment that ensures the self-executing of contracts, safely conducts transactions, and ensures their traceability. No other system is suitable for this since the blockchain has a number of unique properties: Security- all data is stored in a distributed registry, on hundreds of computers at the same time, this prevents information damage. Traceability - each block of information is linked to the previous one, so any transaction leaves a trace in the system and can be tracked. You cannot delete anything from the blockchain.

They run on the blockchain, so they are stored on a public database and cannot be changed. The transactions that happen in a smart contract processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without a third party. A Guide to Write a Smart Contract on Ethereum The transactions only happen when the conditions in the agreement are met — there is no third party, so there are no issues with trust. Smart Contracts are automatically executed once the conditions of the agreement are met. This means there is no need for a third party, like a bank, a broker or a government. The blockchain is a shared database run by many computers (called nodes) belonging to many different people. Because of this, not one single person or company has control of it. It’s worth noting that bitcoin was the first to support basic smart contracts in the sense that the network can transfer value from one person to another. The network of nodes will only validate transactions if certain conditions are met. But, bitcoin is limited to the currency use case. By contrast, Ethereum replaces bitcoin’s more restrictive language (a scripting language of a hundred or so scripts) and replaces it with a language that allows developers to write their own programs. Smart contracts can: Function as ‘multi-signature’ accounts, so that funds are spent only when a required percentage of people agree.Manage agreements between users, say, if one buys insurance from the other.Provide utility to other contracts (similar to how a software library works)Store information about an application, such as domain registration information or membership records.Smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman.The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, driver’s license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.

Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, a jurist, and a cryptographer. He wants to use a distributed ledger to store contracts. Smart contracts are like contracts in the real world. The only difference is that smart contracts are completely digital. In fact, a smart contract refers to a computer protocol. Once such a protocol is formulated and deployed, it can achieve self-executing and self-verifying, and no longer requires human intervention. Technially speaking, a smart contract can be considered as a computer program. This program can autonomously perform all or part of the contract-related operations and generate corresponding verifiable evidence to illustrate the effectiveness of performing contract operations. Before the smart contract is deployed, the logical flow of all terms related to the contract has been formulated. Smart contracts usually have a user interface for users to interact with established contracts, and these interactions strictly adhere to previously formulated logic. Thanks to cryptographic technology, these interactions can be rigorously verified to ensure that the contract can be successfully executed in accordance with previously established rules, thereby preventing defaults. Here are 5 advantages of smart contracts: 1.Efficient real-time updatesSmart contract execution does not require the participation of third-parties or centralized proxy services. It can respond to users’ requests at any time, greatly improving the efficiency of transaction processing. Users do not need to wait for the bank to open the door to request related services since all requests can be solved quickly and easily through the network.Accurate executionAll the terms and execution process of the smart contract are formulated in advance and carried out under the absolute control of the computer. Therefore, the results of all executions are accurate and unpredictable. Today, with the development of cryptography and the invention of blockchain technology, the smart contracts can execut accuratly.Low human intervention riskAfter the smart contract is deployed, all contents of the contract cannot be modified, and neither party in the contract can interfere in the execution of the contract, which means that no contractor can maliciously break the contract for his own benefit. Even if a breach of contract occurs, the person responsible for the incident will be punished accordingly. This punishment has been decided at the beginning of the contract and cannot be changed after the contract takes effect.Decentralized authorityGenerally speaking, smart contracts do not need a centralized authority to arbitrate whether the contract is executed in accordance with regulations, and the supervision and arbitration of the contract are performed by computers. Generally, in a blockchain network, there is no absolute authority to supervise the execution of the contract, but the vast majority of users in the network determine whether the contract is in accordance with the implementation of regulations, this way of supervision by most people is achieved by PoW or PoS technology.Lower operating costsBecause there is no human intervention in smart contracts, the labor costs incurred in performing, awarding and enforcing contracts incurred in contract implementation can be greatly reduced, under which circumstances the contract formulators need to establish and confirm all the details in the contract from the very beginning.Let’s take an example and see how smart contracts work. Maybe you are familiar with the large crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The product team can create projects in Kickstarter, set funding goals, and then raise funds from those who believe in the team’s idea or vision.Kickstarter is essentially a third party between the product team and supporters. This means that both parties need to trust Kickstarter to properly handle their funds.If the project is successfully funded, the project team hopes to get their funding from Kickstarter. Supporters hope that their funds can be given to the project after the fundraising, or get a refund if the project failed. Under this kind of model, the product team and its supporters need to trust Kickstarter as the intermediary to help them achieve their goal.But with smart contracts, we can build similar trust mechanism without third parties like Kickstarter. The blockchain provides a trusted execution environment for smart contracts, and smart contracts expand applications for the blockchain. Smart contracts on Ethereum can control various digital assets on the blockchain for complex operations. In the long run, the smart contract will promote the transformation of the industry and develop into newer and better fields.",2021-03-06T20:31:43.799Z,"What is the importance of smart contracts in Blockchain Technology and how does it work?

This is a kind of question that most people who have been scammed online usually are asking to make sure that it wont happen again. It is always accompanied with fear and the desire to be always in a safe place, disregarding the idea of being a risk-taker. If someone invited you to join Forsage and promised you to earn massive Ethereum but you are not sure if Forsage is legit or not, read everything here from top to bottom for I will piece by piece bring you all the details to end whatever questions you have in mind about Forsage. Is Forsage Really Legit? It depends upon your criteria what makes an Online Money Making-Program legit. Secondly, it also depends on what’s your objective of asking whether or not Forsage is legit. If your purpose is to make money with Forsage, and if you do it becomes “legit” the answer could be YES. But if your intention is something else, let’s go into the details. Let us first know what makes an online money making program legit and you should have your own answer on this. Is it because you can really make money with it? Is it because it’s not going to SCAM you? Is it because it is allowed by the authorities to operate? Is it because many are promoting it? Or it is not legit because it is an MLM and some people say that it is another PONZI scheme. You have to know your take on this. To really answer whether or not Forsage is legit, it’s better to discuss what Forsage really is, what makes it different from the rest and how anyone can make money with it. The question of its legitimacy is a kind of ambiguous because there is no definite meaning of the word legit that applies into it due to it’s nature - being an online program available anywhere via Internet. Again, if your intention is to make tons and tons of money with it, then I would say that it is legit because many have already earned close to millions of dollars in just 6 months. So, what is Forsage? Forsage is a kind of Crypto-Gifting Program that runs on Ethereum Smart Contract that has launched last February 2020. It was created by a Russian guy named Lado Okhotnikov and after a few months since it becomes available online, many marketers have earned thousands of dollars because of its unique system that has never been done in the Internet in the past. And that’s because of the Smart Contract System they’re using to execute the designed compensation plan. What Exactly is a Smart Contract? There’s a lot of contents online that explain what Smart Contract really is. But the more you get into those complex explanation the more it becomes confusing what is it really for and how it works. To put an end to the question that says what Smart Contract really is, here’s the most precise and concise statement: Smart Contract is a system or program that runs on Ethereum Network or Blockchain to facilitate the execution and distribution of Ethereum into the deserving recipient based on the company’s Pay Plan. Huh! Is it really concise? Yes, by using this latest technology called Smart Contract, Forsage became one of the most advanced online programs that existed today where, members are in control of the transaction and there is no chance of getting scammed. And the most interesting part (as they said many times) is that the Smart Contract once uploaded into the Ethereum Blockchain (network), it can never be changed or altered. Even its creator cannot change it. That means to say that Forsage will last forever provided that the hosting of it’s website is kicking. If we are going to break the Smart Contract into pieces to know what’s in it, we could say that there’s really nothing in there. It is just a mere platform that automatically transfers Ethereum from wallet to wallet. Look! If you join Forsage, you send the required Ethereum into the Smart Contract and the Smart Contract will 100% send it instantly to the the deserving member’s Ethereum wallet, usually your sponsor. But there are times that your entry will go to some members whom you don’t know and they called it a “spillover” if it comes from the top and “spill under” if it comes from the bottom or downlines. If we are going to trace the flow of Ethereum in every Forsage Transaction, there is no way that a scam will happen because the money in a form of Ethereum of all joining members will go directly into their sponsors wallet address and nothing is left in the system. It seems like you are just sending some Ethereum into someone else with all your consent. The question is, WHO WILL SCAM YOU? How scam is possible? If you are sending money into a friend and only the two of you are involved who do you think will scam you if you think Forsage is risky? Think about it… Due to the use of Smart Contract program, here are the words that describe Forsage and these are what most marketers are saying who are promoting it online that seems to be too enticing and worth joining. The members are in full controlNo ADMINNo CEONo chance of getting scammedNo need to request or approval of payoutNo need to waitNo transaction fees (for payout)No hassleNo restrictionsNo limit of entriesNo riskMember to member transaction systemOnly pure Ethereum flooding into your wallet daily 24/7But how’s that possible? Forsage has two matrices or plans where you make money. There is what they called X3 Plan and the X4 Plan. Each plan has 12 slots that you have to activate. You can do that by paying the corresponding amount in Ethereum encrypted on every slot and that qualifies you to receive the same amount over and over again from your referrals and from the system spillover at X4 Plan. Meaning, you will only receive earnings on the slots or levels, where you are already active. So, it is always your goal to move into the higher levels to earn more with Forsage. Each activated level or slot can bring you earnings. So the more slots you have activated, the more chances of receiving money. All your referrals will follow you as you move from different levels so you should always be ahead to receive their payments if they also purchase the higher slots. At X3 Plan, all your earnings come from your direct referrals entries and upgrades. So the more you have referrals the more you earn. At X4 Plan, your earnings come from many directions. It could be from the system unpredictable spillover, spill-under and could also be from the upgrades of your direct referrals, as well us from member’s who jumped ahead of their sponsors under your team. With spillovers, many members really earned huge amount of Ethereum with only a few or even zero referrals. It happens to those who activated higher slots at X4 Plan of up to level 6 or level 7. Some teams suggest that you have to do the same if you can afford to pay those higher slots - that is where your wallet will be flooded with Ethereum. To join Forsage, it only needs 0.05 Ethereum. This will activate your Level 1 of both X3 Plan and the X4 Plan. For the level 2 of both plans, you have to purchase individually. When we say purchase, you send the required Ethreum into the Smart Contract and it will be sent directly and instantly to your Sponsors Ethereum Wallet. And it is really an amazing feeling seeing your Ethereum funds growing daily into some unexpected amount. From level 2 to the the level 12, the cost of Ethereum to activate slots is 100% higher than the previous. And it is not allowed to skip one slot and jump into the much higher level. In other words, to activate level 6 for example, you have to activate all from level 2 to level 5 and it costs you a lot. Here’s how it goes: Level 1 0.05 ETH or $12 that’s the entry levelLevel 2 0.05 ETH or $12Level 3 0.1 ETH or $24Level 4 0.2 ETH or $48Level 5 0.4 ETH or $96Level 6 0.8 ETH or $192Level 7 1.6 ETH or $384Level 8 3.2 ETH or $768Level 9 6.4 ETH or $1,536Level 10 12.8 ETH or $3,073Level 11 25.6 ETH or $6,147Level 12 51.2 ETH or $12, 299As you can see above, it is not a joke. It needs such huge amount of money to earn right away from spillovers if it happens at the level 6. This is where many unaware members are crying who cannot afford to pay those slots (level 3, 4, 5, and 6) and don’t want to invite. Many of them feels like being scammed but that’s just a meager amount of $12. How to Make Money with Forsage? To make money with Forsage, your goal is to get all those slots activated as early as you can especially the X4 Plan. If you have the funds, it is better to spend some money on those slots. If you don’t, you have to find referrals to receive Ethereum from the lower levels (Level 1 and 2) and use your earnings to pay your upgrades. As a marketer, you must forget the word SPILLOVER, you should become and act as a network marketer - finds referrals unceasingly, create a team, motivate each member and teach them how to become successful. Let them duplicate what you do to their own team and that is where an endless flow of Ethereum will flood into your wallet. Is Forsage a Pyramiding or Ponzi Scheme? Let us break the above question into two to address each concern. But before we do that we should delete that (a bit of) negative impression in your mind associated with the word Ponzi and Pyramiding. And to do that, let me ask you a question: What is wrong with Pyramid? Or what do you think is wrong with pyramiding? The word “Pyramid” became negative in the eyes and ears of many due to the fact that many scams are using it in the past and even today. But the word itself has no negative meaning. It is just a label associated with a structure of any organization with a few on top and many at the bottom just like the Pyramid in Egypt, where there is a pointed top that represents the few and a wide base that represents the ordinary masses or let us say members. If we bring that idea into the MLM or Multilevel- Marketing Industry, there is really nothing wrong with it. All MLM type of businesses will really form a Pyramid on its structure as members are coming in. Imagine that each member has it’s own circle of friends and it happens on many different levels. That should of course form a Pyramid on its structure from a few into many as members exponentially multiply. So, instead of associating the word Pyramid with some kind of negativity, why not see it as levels of connection among members that strengthens any organization or an MLM business. Yes, Pyramid represents hierarchy and connection and through it alone , the communication from top to bottom of any organization could flow smoothly for whatever purposes it may serve. To become successful with anything, we really need a connection. No one can thrive alone, as they said “no man is an island.” So we need to be part of any pyramid or organization to eliminate our own limitation to be able to produce results greater than what we can do being alone. Now, is Forsage a Pyramiding? My Answer is a BIG YES! Is Forsage a Ponzi Scheme? First let us define what PONZI SCHEME is. According to WikiPedia, a Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. Wikipedia If the above definition of PONZI Scheme is right, then Forsage must NOT be a Ponzi Scheme. Why? Look! A Ponzi Scheme is an Investment Scheme that pays profits from the recent investors as said above. Forsage is not an Investment Schem, it is a Crypto-Gifting Program. If you can’t imagine what a Crypto-Gifting means, take an example of those member to member cash-gifting programs in the past, where all joining members has to send donation or offer into the deserving member (sponsor) and become qualified to receive the same amount many times. It is actually an application in real-time of the Law of Giving and Receiving, where you will be qualified to receive multiple times the mount that you’ve given once.Ponzi Scheme is clearly with an intention of fraud. Forsage’s intention is to create millions of dollars among members.Ponzi Scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means. Forsage is transparent and all joning members are aware of how and where the money comes from and they join with their own will and consent.So, if that definition of Ponzi Scheme is what we all believed to be right, that’s very clear that Forsage is different and it is not. Although I understand the concerns and issues of those who are really skeptics and against Forsage. Their argument is that Forsage is a Ponzi and a Pyramiding Scheme because only the people on top will benefit and the rest at the bottom will cry. Well that’s really possible if you as a member will not do your part. If you join Forsage and do nothing, you just go there and wait for something to happen, then nothing will happen, it is better to cry in advance if you want. What Forsage brings is an equal opportunity for all joining members. It is a kind of seed of a good fruit. You have to plant and water to grow and you will reap the fruit. You have to work on it, exert some effort and spend some resources. If you just receive it and keep it somewhere it will not bring you anything. Additionally, with Forsage, anyone can make huge income grated than their sponsors. So the idea that only those who are on top will benefit is really NOT precise to describe what Forsage is. How to join Forsage? To join Forsage,you have to decide first what device you will be using. It could be an Android Phone or a Laptop Computer. If done, you just need to have a kind of Ethereum wallet address that can access to the Smart Contract System that works on the device that you are going to use. For Laptop Computers, you need to install the Metamask Browser Extension for Firefox and Google Chrome. If you are using an Android Phone, you need to download and install Trust Wallet App. If you are using an iPhone, you have to go for CoinBase Wallet. Hey, if you have been a Forsage member and you are not making money with it we have a solution that works. And I’m sure that you will also love it. Interested?

There are in fact about 200 truffle orchards operating in the United States, they are referred to as “orchards” not farms, the reason will become apparent. Some history, a little background and the reason why they are so hard to raise as opposed to harvesting wild ones. What Are Truffles?  A truffle farmer does not plant truffles, he plants oak trees— truffles grow only near the roots of certain trees (evergreen oak and pubescent oak are best). Five years later at the earliest, 10 years later more likely, the farmer-hunter paces around the grove on a cold winter day with an animal, a pig traditionally, but a trained dog most frequently, that can smell buried truffles. Female pig's actually get turned on by the aroma of truffles, it's like an aphrodisiac! Prized white truffles (Tuber magnatum) from the Italian Piedmont sell for upwards of $3,000 a pound; and black truffles (T. melanosporum) from the Périgord in southwestern France, will set you back to the tune of $900 a pound. There are only two species among several that have the desired flavor, there are many impostors primarily from China.[1] But there is trouble in Europe keeping up with demand, global warming is being blamed for a significant decrease in the wild harvest. European truffle harvest, which topped 2,000 annual tons a hundred years ago, is now down to a mere 20 or so, a victim of climate change’s elevated temperatures and decreasing rainfall. It was finally figured out how to inoculate the roots of tree saplings with truffle spores, thus increasing the chances that the trees would produce truffles. When a truffle spore comes into contact with one of the hair-thin rootlets that fan out under an oak, it sends out long, microscopically thin filaments that wrap around the root. As for their growing habits there unlike any other fungi, they grow underground. Truffles are hypogeous fungi: that is, unlike the familiar gilled mushrooms on stems that pop up periodically in back yards, they grow underground. Buried, they depend on foraging animals, rather than wind, to spread their spores. Here is why they are so difficult to grow. Truffles are associated with the roots of trees—primarily oaks and hazelnuts in the case of the Italian white and Périgord black; Douglas firs in the case of Oregon white truffles (T. oregonense and T. gibvbosum). Together tree and truffle mesh to form a complex and inseparable ecosystem. The filamentous mycelium of the fungus intercalates with the tiny hair-like feeder roots of the tree, forming a mycorrhiza(from the Greek words for “fungus” and “root”). It’s a beautiful partnership in which the tree provides the truffle with sugars, the products of photosynthesis, and the fungus provides the tree with water and soil nutrients. Over the past few decades, techniques have been developed for inoculating tree seedlings with truffle mycelium, but the process is still iffy and doesn’t necessarily ensure that you’ll get mature truffles. Italian white truffles remain resolutely wild. French black truffles, on the other hand, are more amenable to domestication. Up to 80 percent of the crop, now come from truffle farms (truffieres), the offspring of inoculated saplings. Oregon, the top truffle-producing state in the U.S., boasts some 350 different native truffle species, four of which are harvested and sold commercially. While Oregon truffles lack the reputation of their European cousins, many proclaim them delicious, and they had the enthusiastic support of renowned chef James Beard. In blind taste tests, they’ve even ranked right up there with the renowned Italian white. Truffle farming isn’t cheap. Estimated costs are somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000 to establish a truffle orchard. But if all goes well, at an average production rate of 35 to 80 pounds of truffles per acre per year, lucky owners can expect an annual profit of $42,000 to $96,000. Truffles are fungi. True truffles are subterranean tubers, unlike their similar but distinct relatives, mushrooms, which sprout above ground. Unlike mushrooms, which disperse their spores out in the open, truffles meaning existing plants rely on animals to dig up their sacs of spores and distribute them throughout the surrounding area through their feces. Hunters originally used wild pigs for this task for a good reason: Truffles contain androstenol, a sex hormone that acts as a sort of aphrodisiac for the animal, attracting it directly to the source of the scent. ""Wild pigs are naturally attracted to truffles because the aromatic compounds are similar to the pigs' sexual pheromones so they like to dig them up and eat them,"" says Ken Frank in a phone interview. Frank is executive chef and owner of the Napa, California, restaurant, La Toque, which has hosted an annual all black truffle dinner for nearly 38 years.

The name “smart contracts” was coined by a cryptologist computer scientist, Nick Szabo, in the 90s.

The name “smart contracts” was coined by a cryptologist computer scientist, Nick Szabo, in the 90s. Nick Szabo in 1994 said this: A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. The general objectives are to satisfy common contractual conditions. Ahh! So technical!! To make it easier to understand, let’s fast forward to the 21st century. Consider a real life example where you are taking out a bag of potato chips mapped against the trigger number “B6” of a vending machine. You put a $10 note in a vending machine. This action triggers the next option for you to select a number (like B6) on the vending machine. And what happens when you select B6? A lever in the vending machine moves and pushes out the bag of chips. A smart contract self-executes the “if-this-then-that” conditions coded onto it in the same way that triggers are implemented in a vending machine. But why is everyone buzzing about the outdated technology in vending machines? The buzz is about the smarter contracts that are based on Ethereum technology. The Ethereum blockchain mechanism coupled with smart contract technology removes intermediaries and escrow services. Let’s dwell deeper into the concept of smart contracts so that even a non-techie can understand. But before that, you need to be familiar with Ethereum 101… Ethereum in a nutshell: Ethereum – A blockchain which records all executed codes as transactions.Ether – The cryptocurrency which fuels the Ethereum blockchain.To be even more familiar with Ethereum 101, see our guide on “Ethereum Cryptocurrency: Everything A Beginner Needs To Know”. What is a Smart Contract?  Image via blockchaintechnologies A smart contract is a piece of software that contains rules and regulations for negotiating the terms of a contract. It automatically verifies the contract and then executes the agreed upon terms. And when this smart contract’s centralized code is made decentralized for execution purposes on the Ethereum blockchain, it becomes a smarter contract. Coding and executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain makes them immutable and independent from centralization. Smart Contract’s Characteristics on Ethereum A smart contract has the following characteristics: Self-executingImmutableSelf-verifyingAuto-enforcingCost savingRemoves third parties or escrow agentsHow Do Smart Contracts Work on Ethereum? Developers write the code of smart contract using the native language of Ethereum called Solidity. These contract codes can be of many forms, such as the transaction of money when certain conditions are met, or the exchange of goods between parties. Once the code is written, it is uploaded on the EVM- Ethereum Virtual Machine, which you can say is a universal runtime compiler or browser to execute the smart contract’s code. Now once the code is on the EVM, it will be same across each Ethereum node. And each node will try to run and see whether the conditions are met or not. A contract of Ethereum will involve two or more parties which will be fueled by the digital asset (Ether). Once the contract is executed successfully, the digital asset will be distributed or re-distributed according to the logics defined in the code.  Image via lightrains To make it easier to understand, consider this example: Assume that Harry has given a contract of $1000 to Mary for web development. Harry has hard coded the requirements and conditions about the kind of website he needs onto the Ethereum blockchain. Now, this blockchain will act as the evaluator whenever Mary submits the website to Harry for approval after the project’s completion. Harry has already pre-coded his requirements (such as load time, server host, design specifics, etc.). Now, Mary submits the work on the blockchain for evaluation. If the conditions set by Harry are successfully evaluated, and the website is done as per his coded requirements, then the contract worth $1000 will be instantly self-executed, and payment in equivalent Ether (ETH) will be released to Mary. But let’s suppose Mary didn’t get her payment or Harry didn’t get his work. Then this conflict of interest is resolved by the blockchain’s smart contract, which enforces trust by default.  Why Trust an Ethereum Smart Contract? As every transaction history and history of every executed code is stored on the blockchain, you can trust and verify everything when needed. Even in the case of Harry’s smart contract, Harry can’t cheat Mary. Because once Mary has done her work, it will be verified by the blockchain and recorded onto it. Anyone, including Harry, can inspect the blockchain, hence resolving the conflict or protecting against cheating. Moreover, Harry can’t stop or manipulate this contract as the execution of this contract is no longer dependent on one single party or node. As Harry’s contract is running on an EVM of the Ethereum blockchain, it is resistant to damage caused by a single point of failure. On the other hand, if these conditions are not met, then Mary will need to continue the work until the appropriate website is created. That’s why you can trust an Ethereum smart contract. Use Cases of Smart Contracts  Image via draglet Smart contracts are becoming an integral part of the blockchain economy. Some current applications of smart contracts: Real Estate – A Midasium Contract is a small computer program. It is a digital representation of the mutual agreements as in a traditional real estate contract. This software code self-executes and self-enforces, and it is based on smart contracts.Supply Chain Mangement (Skuchain) – A material’s supply and procurement are typically tracked with paper trails which are mutable. Hence, implementing the supply chain management on blockchain removes the possibility of theft or fraud.Intellectual Property Rights – Musicians, writers, and artists can put their creativity on the blockchain and can control ownership of their work. Smart contracts like this enable the creator to collect royalties and payments directly without any third parties involved.What is the Future of Smart Contracts? Bitcoin is merely the first application on the blockchain backed by the internet. But Ethereum and smart contracts are the next gen applications on the blockchain. And I think Ethereum smart contracts also answer the question of “why do you need Ethereum when you have Bitcoin?” Just like the invention of the internet has transformed human life, the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts have the power to change human life in incredible ways. Why incredible? Because the marathon has just started; Ethereum is only 3 years old, and many scholars are pursuing a lot of research on it. The floodgates of unparalleled innovation have been opened with the establishment of The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance connects Fortune 500 enterprises (like Accenture, Microsoft, Intel, JP Morgan, Wipro, etc.), startups, and academics with Ethereum subject matter experts. With this meeting of minds, it’s highly likely that Ethereum will be the next big cryptocurrency. Hope this answer helps many :) …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….

Last year, the Ethereum software firm Parity lost 513,000 ETH due to a bug in one of their smart contracts – enough (under a Proof of Stake system) to create a supply-deflationary year on its own account. Combine this with a series of smaller private losses, “dust” and burnt coins and Ethereum’s supply may become long-run deflationary (à la Bitcoin) or at most only slightly inflationary. The price implications of limiting Ethereum’s supply are dramatic, and on the demand side there may be equally powerful forces that could drive the price upwards. Decentralized applications (dApps) that begin to attract a mainstream audience over the next few years will be required to buy and hold large quantities of Ether to pay for storage (see rent fees above) and gas fees (analogous to server costs). If Ethereum is to become ubiquitous as the decentralized smart contract platform of choice, then simple demand and supply economics would suggest a very significant upward pressure on the price over the next few years.",2021-03-06T20:38:39.049Z,"How will change to proof of stake affect existing ethereum smart contract and development of new smart contract?

Perhaps, you have already heard about the line “Future is Decentralized.” Yes, you have heard correctly. Decentralized applications (dapps) are evolving rapidly. New projects are entering the market based on blockchain technology and they are totally decentralized applications. The answer will discuss everything about Decentralized App Development along dApp examples. What is a Decentralized App (dApp)? Decentralized applications (dApps) are applications that are based on blockchain technology. dApps run on a P2P network of different computers rather than a single computer. dApps have been since the beginning of P2P networks. It is actually a type of software program designed to run on the Internet in a way that is not controlled by any single entity. All the data on the decentralized app is stored on the distributed ledger. It is impossible to hack the decentralized network. Some features of a Decentralized Applications Cryptography Tokens Users should be required to use tokens to access the app. Tokens can also be sent to people within the p2p node who is contributing to building of the app. Within this same nodes, miners are rewarded with the secured tokens which is encrypted with the use of cryptography. Data Should Be Stored Cryptographically The Applications data must be cryptographically stored. Its data and operation records are held in decentralized public blockchain. Open-source Decentralized Apps are not controlled by any particular campany. It has to operate autonomously where no single node controls the majority of its token. Any changes in the Decentralized App is exercised using Consensus protocols decided by the participant users. The few benefits of building decentralized application with a blockchain are: • Quick Response: We highly believe in responding to queries that may arise from our clients at the earliest. With the additional understanding of cryptocurrency app development, our project managers will add significant value to your project. • Reliable, Transparent and Secure: To develop a cryptocurrency, Blockchain has its own set of security rules.

The smart contract acts as a communication layer between the platform and the blockchain. All transaction data will be sent to the smart contract to execute its terms, and the transaction will be stored in the blockchain. This removes the need for a middleman and facilitates lower transaction costs throughout the platform. The GO platform utilizes the widely-used Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum’s smart contracts provide multiple language implementations that will facilitate future integration. An audit of all transactions on the platform will be kept on the blockchain each time the smart contract is executed. 5",2021-03-06T20:47:43.248Z,"Has GOeureka developed Block-chain and Smart Contract?

With so many moving parts, it’s becoming more difficult to reliably and efficiently track actions and data along the supply chain. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts are emerging as a solution — one that provides transparency and ensures everyone along the supply chain is following the same set of agreed-upon rules. With everyone on the supply chain sharing the same logic and data, manufacturers can automate time-sensitive processes and avoid costly dispute resolutions. Blockchain is on the rise, and Gartner predicts that 30% of manufacturing companies making more than $5 billion in revenue will have invested in blockchain-powered projects by 2023. Implementing the technology and data infrastructure to convert processes into smart contracts can seem daunting, and companies that don’t hit the $5 billion mark will be slower to catch up. The fear of failing after the investment can be a serious deterrent. But smart contracts save enough time and money for manufacturers that the costs of waiting might be greater than the upfront investment needed to get started. Being Smart About Which Contracts to Convert As companies convert more intra-business processes into smart contracts, the benefits of doing so grow easier to recognize. Shipments and payment approvals can be verified in real-time, and disputes are eliminated or resolved immediately with no intermediaries. The time and cost savings are substantial. By using these strategies to determine where to use smart contracts, companies of all sizes have a better chance at reaping the benefits much sooner: 1. Break down costs before the converting starts. The first time a company implements a smart contract, the costs of establishing the blockchain system will be relatively high. These initial costs can often be the biggest deterrent, especially for smaller, less tech-driven companies. Over time, though, the incremental costs of automating smart contracts will go down. Account for this initial cost by taking time to identify the contracts that are currently the most costly to execute. 2. Prioritize external contracts over internal ones. Not every contract needs to be a smart one. In fact, the costs of executing some processes might not justify the investment in automating them. Focus on agreements, contracts, and other expectations that are between the company and another business (or better yet, where more than two businesses are involved), and rule out internal agreements between departments. Because trust is less of an issue, internal disputes can be reconciled relatively easily. Putting them on a blockchain would just be overkill. 3. Focus on contract difficulty — not frequency. Because the goal of automation is to create less work, it’s tempting to go straight for the contracts that are executed most often. Instead, focus on the amount of effort it takes to use each contract rather than how often it’s used. High-frequency contracts might be executed with few or no disputes, whereas low-frequency ones might be costly to manage due to complex and/or unclear terms. These are much better candidates. 4. Start with material sourcing for maximum impact. To know for sure which processes can benefit most from conversion into smart contracts, look for people throughout the organization who deal with reconciliation, quality control, and/or audit support. Also, consider the data used in each transaction. Between both parties, how important is trusting that data? Material sourcing is often ripe for improvement, and trust in data is critical to the relationship between manufacturer and supplier. The ability to create smart contracts is becoming one of the best-known benefits of using blockchain technology in the manufacturing realm. Investing in the technology might be costly at first, but getting in on the ground floor will be easier if you use it to turn the right processes into irrefutable smart contracts.",2021-03-06T21:34:51.975Z,"How can one develop smart contracts on Azure Blockchain Service?

Extrapolating that last point, smart contracts are likely to need assistance from other smart contracts. When someone places a simple bet on the temperature on a hot summer day, it might trigger a sequence of contracts under the hood. One contract would use outside data to determine the weather, and another contract could settle the bet based on the information it received from the first contract when the conditions are met. Running each contract requires ether transaction fees, which depend on the amount of computational power required.

Some of these Cryptocurrencies are also programmable by supporting smart contracts. Based on the input and conditions, the contracts are self-enforced by the decentralized platforms like Ethereum or Stratis. Please find the long explanation: Bitcoin - the first Cryptocurrency popularised the concept of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger technology. World was accustomd decentralised money called Gold for thousands of years before the arrival of Paper currency. Gold was valued across geographical borders and served as the universal monetary system. Once we moved to the Fiat currency system we have been forced to use Inflationary currencies that are valid only in limited jurisdictions. Though decentralized technologies like E-mail or Internet have become ubiquitous, financial transactions had to be routed through a trusted third party like Paypal or Banks. These centralized institutions maintained one ledger that stored the balances of each customer. Bitcoin broke barriers by creating a universal platform where the ledger that captures the transactional data of all individuals who own Bitcoin, is hosted by volunteers distributed across the globe. No single entity has the control of the platform and hence the transactions are censorship proof. It is distributed in the sense that there is no central repository of information, no database on a file server which can be hacked, or bank vault that can be robbed. It is ledger technology in the sense that it is able to hold and transmit information, a system which can store transaction details – in the words of Harvard Business Review – “efficiently…in a permanent and verifiable way.” Vitalik Buterin suggested that Bitcoin has potential to become the World’s computer by supporting a scripting language for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language which became Ethereum. Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. Ethereum can be imagined as a platform where anyone can host their Smart Contracts just like how apps are hosted in Google PlayStore.",2021-03-06T21:46:14.764Z,"Why do oracles enable developers to develop smart contracts that can incorporate high-quality off-chain applications?

Nick Szabo in 1994 said this: A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. The general objectives are to satisfy common contractual conditions. Ahh! So technical!! To make it easier to understand, let’s fast forward to the 21st century. Consider a real life example where you are taking out a bag of potato chips mapped against the trigger number “B6” of a vending machine. You put a $10 note in a vending machine. This action triggers the next option for you to select a number (like B6) on the vending machine. And what happens when you select B6? A lever in the vending machine moves and pushes out the bag of chips. A smart contract self-executes the “if-this-then-that” conditions coded onto it in the same way that triggers are implemented in a vending machine. But why is everyone buzzing about the outdated technology in vending machines? The buzz is about the smarter contracts that are based on Ethereum technology. The Ethereum blockchain mechanism coupled with smart contract technology removes intermediaries and escrow services. Let’s dwell deeper into the concept of smart contracts so that even a non-techie can understand. But before that, you need to be familiar with Ethereum 101… Ethereum in a nutshell: Ethereum – A blockchain which records all executed codes as transactions.Ether – The cryptocurrency which fuels the Ethereum blockchain.To be even more familiar with Ethereum 101, see our guide on “Ethereum Cryptocurrency: Everything A Beginner Needs To Know”. What is a Smart Contract?  Image via blockchaintechnologies A smart contract is a piece of software that contains rules and regulations for negotiating the terms of a contract. It automatically verifies the contract and then executes the agreed upon terms. And when this smart contract’s centralized code is made decentralized for execution purposes on the Ethereum blockchain, it becomes a smarter contract. Coding and executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain makes them immutable and independent from centralization. Smart Contract’s Characteristics on Ethereum A smart contract has the following characteristics: Self-executingImmutableSelf-verifyingAuto-enforcingCost savingRemoves third parties or escrow agentsHow Do Smart Contracts Work on Ethereum? Developers write the code of smart contract using the native language of Ethereum called Solidity. These contract codes can be of many forms, such as the transaction of money when certain conditions are met, or the exchange of goods between parties. Once the code is written, it is uploaded on the EVM- Ethereum Virtual Machine, which you can say is a universal runtime compiler or browser to execute the smart contract’s code. Now once the code is on the EVM, it will be same across each Ethereum node. And each node will try to run and see whether the conditions are met or not. A contract of Ethereum will involve two or more parties which will be fueled by the digital asset (Ether). Once the contract is executed successfully, the digital asset will be distributed or re-distributed according to the logics defined in the code.  Image via lightrains To make it easier to understand, consider this example: Assume that Harry has given a contract of $1000 to Mary for web development. Harry has hard coded the requirements and conditions about the kind of website he needs onto the Ethereum blockchain. Now, this blockchain will act as the evaluator whenever Mary submits the website to Harry for approval after the project’s completion. Harry has already pre-coded his requirements (such as load time, server host, design specifics, etc.). Now, Mary submits the work on the blockchain for evaluation. If the conditions set by Harry are successfully evaluated, and the website is done as per his coded requirements, then the contract worth $1000 will be instantly self-executed, and payment in equivalent Ether (ETH) will be released to Mary. But let’s suppose Mary didn’t get her payment or Harry didn’t get his work. Then this conflict of interest is resolved by the blockchain’s smart contract, which enforces trust by default.  Why Trust an Ethereum Smart Contract? As every transaction history and history of every executed code is stored on the blockchain, you can trust and verify everything when needed. Even in the case of Harry’s smart contract, Harry can’t cheat Mary. Because once Mary has done her work, it will be verified by the blockchain and recorded onto it. Anyone, including Harry, can inspect the blockchain, hence resolving the conflict or protecting against cheating. Moreover, Harry can’t stop or manipulate this contract as the execution of this contract is no longer dependent on one single party or node. As Harry’s contract is running on an EVM of the Ethereum blockchain, it is resistant to damage caused by a single point of failure. On the other hand, if these conditions are not met, then Mary will need to continue the work until the appropriate website is created. That’s why you can trust an Ethereum smart contract. Use Cases of Smart Contracts  Image via draglet Smart contracts are becoming an integral part of the blockchain economy. Some current applications of smart contracts: Real Estate – A Midasium Contract is a small computer program. It is a digital representation of the mutual agreements as in a traditional real estate contract. This software code self-executes and self-enforces, and it is based on smart contracts.Supply Chain Mangement (Skuchain) – A material’s supply and procurement are typically tracked with paper trails which are mutable. Hence, implementing the supply chain management on blockchain removes the possibility of theft or fraud.Intellectual Property Rights – Musicians, writers, and artists can put their creativity on the blockchain and can control ownership of their work. Smart contracts like this enable the creator to collect royalties and payments directly without any third parties involved.What is the Future of Smart Contracts? Bitcoin is merely the first application on the blockchain backed by the internet. But Ethereum and smart contracts are the next gen applications on the blockchain. And I think Ethereum smart contracts also answer the question of “why do you need Ethereum when you have Bitcoin?” Just like the invention of the internet has transformed human life, the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts have the power to change human life in incredible ways. Why incredible? Because the marathon has just started; Ethereum is only 3 years old, and many scholars are pursuing a lot of research on it. The floodgates of unparalleled innovation have been opened with the establishment of The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance connects Fortune 500 enterprises (like Accenture, Microsoft, Intel, JP Morgan, Wipro, etc.), startups, and academics with Ethereum subject matter experts. With this meeting of minds, it’s highly likely that Ethereum will be the next big cryptocurrency. Hope this answer helps many :) …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….

If and when the pre-defined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced.

If and when the pre-defined rules are met, the agreement is automatically enforced. The smart contract code facilitates, verifies, and enforces the negotiation or performance of an agreement or transaction. It is the simplest form of decentralized automation. This is the reason most of the companies are prefering smart contract development for more secure and fast transactions. We all know how blockhain smart contracts have pretty much taken over the lives of all modern tech-based businesses. Be it for handling escrow management or disbursing insurance payments on time, smart contracts are the order of the day. Before proceeding further, let's understand a basic concept which forms the basis of this calculation. This basic premise is the “gas” in Ethereum. Gas” in Ethereum terminology refers to the basic fuel that powers the network, be it for deploying smart contracts or for hosting dApps (decentralized applications) on the network. For fast and smooth transactions, you would need to pay a higher gas price. How To Calculate The Cost of An Ethereum Smart Contract? To calculate, you must know the media gas price (at the time of writing, it is 20 Gwei), the gas limit (usually 21000 gas for a smart contract) and the market price of Ethereum ($357.71 at the time of writing) to be able to calculate how much you will have to shell out for deployment. So, while calculating, you must take that into account as well. Moreover, that calculation was done with the gas price being 20 Gwei. Now, remember, you must determine your own gas price depending on your needs and calculate accurately. I hope you understand how to calculate the cost of smart contract deployment. If you are still confused then I would suggest you connect with the skilled team of blockchain experts from a reliable smart contract development company, they will assuredly guide you the best. I hope the above information is helpful to you.",2021-03-06T21:49:54.940Z,"How much does it cost to smart contracts? ",Quora

If you’re not doing serverless WASM at least somewhere in you’re stack, you’re missing out. There will come a point here where WASM gets native host bindings, at which point there will be very compelling reasons to choose fullstack Rust/WASM over JS. Rust probably will need some time to get ecosystem adoption of async await once it’s released into stable, after which point there will probably be a bit of a software renaissance period similar to what happened when NodeJS transformed frontend development. The performance characteristics between the two languages is night and day, and this will show as JS gets toppled and Rust paves the way with a transformatively better user experience.

I would say the best way to start is understanding how Bitcoin works. Being a beginner, you could make the mistake of thinking that blockchain technology and Bitcoin can be studied by separate. The reallity is that you must understand Bitcoin, and after you will be able to understand what the Blockchain Technology is. As the concept of the private blockchains has grown, I have added some links to the most important projects and white-papers on this field. Anyway, in order to understand this concept, first you should have understood public blockchains. So, here is a list of the most important papers I have found: Concepts 1: Public Blockchains: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s inventor)The first step to start with blockchain technology should be understand where does Blockchain Technology come from.This paper started the whole crypto revolution. It can be complex, but will give you a good understanding what has happened since the paper was published in 2008. Ethereum: A Next Generation Smart Contract & Decentralized Application Platform (Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s creator) I would say this is the second most important white paper in the blockchain/bitcoin history. If you are thinking about starting with Ethereum, you truly must read this paper, as it will give you a nice comprehension of what Ethereum is, and Ethereum vision about how a decentralized application should be made. If you want to get into more tech detail, you can also read the Yellow Paper, by the CTO Gavin Wood: http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf Ethereum: A Secure Decentralized Generalized Transaction Ledger (Gavin Wood, Ethereum’s founder)A technical paper that takes deeper dives at describing how Ethereum will build and deliver their technology. Sidechains:Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains (Blockstream team)Another key concept that’s supposed to drive innovation around the Bitcoin blockchain, this one without disturbing its core principles. Also, “Simple Explanation of Bitcoin Sidechains for a less technical interpretation to the same paper. 2: Private/Permissioned Blockchains: Multichain: Multichain is a Bitcoin fork that allows you to create your own private blockchains with different permissions (create, send, mine…) . Eris Eris started as an Ethereum fork for private solutions, changing afterwards its consensus system by using Tendermint. In the same way that in Ethereum, it allows you to create Touring complete Smart-Contracts using Solidity as the programming language. Coding Once you have understood the key concepts you will be ready to start coding! You can start either programming for bitcoin or ethereum. Personally, as a developer, I prefer the Touring completeness of ethereum to development, as it allows you to write smart contracts (you can program directly the behaviour of your decentralized application!) Ethereum Dapps for Beginners : A really good manual step by step on how to create your first smart contract and Decentralized applications.

I always recommend creating explainer in more than one language based on the target audience. For example, our Canadian clients prefer French as a second language. Some American clients prefer Spanish as a second language. We have created videos in most of the popular accents and languages of the world. In India, it is mostly English and Hindi. If we know that a client needs more than one voice, we would configure the adobe after effects file differently and would be more organised :) When I started in 2009 the first thing I learnt about voice was accent. :) Just like English other languages also have accents. For example Portuguese Accent from Portugal would be different from Brazil. So choose the voice artist based on the accent as well. While giving directions to voice artist, you can always inform them the keywords where you would like to put more emphasis. Voice artist would then use techniques to ensure your keywords are in focus. If you can refer them to their own previous sample, it becomes much easier for the voice artist to follow your directions.

Clients from (literally) around the world find me through my website, my membership in various professional organizations, and referrals from VO colleagues. Now, to be sure, there are limits. If your dream is to voice animated characters for a Pixar movie, say, or for one of the many animated shows on TV, then yes, location matters. As one of my coaches explained, the people in LA who cast those shows want to know you, to see you audition face-to-face numerous times for a wide variety of roles. They want to have a good idea of not just your range as an actor, but also your professionalism and character. They’d much rather work with a very talented and reliable actor than with a genius who’s temperamental and flaky. It takes time to develop that level of familiarity and trust, so being there is really essential. This is also true, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent, for movie trailer and promo work. I do know of at least one successful voice actress who, after working on many successful animated shows, was able to move back home to Canada and yet still be cast in new shows. But there’s no way she could have done that without having first paid her dues for years in LA. I’ve done some animation VO work in Richmond for clients like Sesame Workshop (makers of Sesame Street) and others, but never for a network animated series. But for the myriad non-animation VO genres, such as commercials, corporate narration, audiobooks, telephony, e-learning, documentary narration, etc., the geographical boundaries have largely disappeared.

Very few projects are done this way - generally only high profile projects from major publishers and proven authors. The director and studio/engineer are paid separately. You would expect to pay $400 or more per actual session hour for the narrator alone. The narrator shows up at each recording session and leaves all the technical steps to the studio/engineer. An experienced narrator might take between 1.5 to 2x the finished time of the book to record the book. The second is for projects done through a site such as ACX, where the narrator is also responsible for the production, editing, QC and delivery of audio files (what the director and engineer were doing in the first example.) On platforms such as ACX, the narrators are therefore called “Producers”. The author or publishing company would be the “Rights Holder”. There are three options here: Straight “Per Finished Hour” (PFH), Royalty Share Plus (RS+) (essentially a PFH stipend and then royalty on the sale of each book) or Royalty Share (RS). PFH is determined by the actual finished running time of the book. A rough rule of thumb would be about 8-10,000 words an hour. PFH is generally $200–450 an hour. Bear in mind that it will likely take a Producer somewhere between 6 and 10 hours to create each finished hour of audio. A competent Producer would pre-read the book, record the narration, proof against the copy, master and QC the recordings and handle all the audio file uploads to the site. RS+ is a refinement of the older ACX “stipend” program. The Rights Holder agrees to a minimal PFH payment (~$100 PFH) to cover production costs (many narrators will use a proofer and/or editor and/or mastering engineer in their workflow, so the narrators are immediately paying out of pocket on their end). Then as the audiobook title sells, the rights holder and the narrator spit the sale commission (as of early 2020, the ACX* contract between Rights Holder and Narrator runs for 7 years and the sale commission that is 40% of the selling price of the audiobook). This is a good way to balance the investment in a quality narrator and leave some upside for both parties. RS (Royalty Share) is the splitting of the per-book sale commission only. Most good narrators will only do this if the author is known and has a viable sales history with other titles or within a specific genre, or if the author/publisher has a clear plan for promoting the title, or the book has suddenly become a hot commodity in print/kindle versions and has some sales momentum. You could also contract with an audiobook publishing company who would basically handle finding the narrator and dealing with the mechanics of creating the audiobook. Those rates can vary widely. Many of those operations are simply listing the book through ACX or a similar site. With your example: 50k words is probably 6.25 finished hours audio.1 - Narrator $450/hr plus $300/hr for director and studio/engineer. Figuring 1.5x running time = $4,687.50 (plus probably a few hours of studio/engineer time mastering at $150/hr.) = $5137.50 2 - PFH (let’s use $375 PFH as our number here) 6.25 hours finished = $2343.75 (and the author/rights holder keeps all 40% of the sales commission from each audiobook.) 3 - RS+ ($100 PFH) = $650 (and sales commissions are split for the run of the 7 year contract). 4 - RS = $0 (and sales commissions are split for the run of the 7 year contract). In the 3rd and 4th examples, you are asking the narrator to take a financial risk to be involved with your project. Let’s say your audiobook sells for $20 each. That means that the Producer and the Rights Holder each get $4 for every audiobook sold. If the Producer (Narrator) was reasonably efficient, they might have invested 8 hours for every 1 hour of finished audio. That would be 50 hours for your 6.25 hour finished book. If the Producer/Narrator wanted to make minimum wage (let’s use $15/hr here and ignore any production costs such as outside editors or mastering fees) they would need to recoup $750. That means 188 audiobooks must be sold before they are making that amount of money (376 audiobooks means $30/hr, 750 audiobooks equals $60/hr, etc.) *ACX is a division of Audible which is a division of Amazon.",2021-03-06T21:56:14.558Z,"How much to voiceover artists charge per minute?

6043faa3ed76476feda38709,https://www.quora.com/Where-are-freelance-voiceover-artists-having-the-most-luck?-,"My answer comes from here The Law Of Large Numbers ""For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief."" (Proverbs 24:16) If you want to create your luck, you must be ready to fail numerous times. The Bible says a just man will fall seven times and then he will rise up again. Numerous people are unwilling to fall once, let alone seven times. Yet, they want to have the results of the just man. It is impossible to have the same results if you disobey the principle behind the result! Some months ago, I took a course in Statistics and one of the Laws that struck me right across the face was The Law Of Large Numbers. In simple terms, the law states that the number of successes increases as the number of experiments increases. Here's an example that explains how it works: Suppose you were told to flip a coin. For the purpose of this analogy, let's assume that 'Head' means 'Win' and 'Tail' means 'Lose'. To make it even more interesting, let's assume that the first time you flipped the coin, you got 'Tail'. Does this mean you are a failure? Does this mean you are unlucky? You are probably going to feel apathetic because deep down within you, you know that every coin flip has two outcomes - 'Head' or 'Tail'. Let's go a step further with this. What if I told you that flipping 'Head' will fetch you one million...dollars?! And you have TEN chances to flip 'Head' in order to win the one million dollars. Would you keep on flipping the coin? Or would you just toss the coin once, get 'Tail'and then blame yourself for having bad luck? The truth is that the more you flip the coin, the better your chances of getting a 'Head'! We actually did the calculations in class and we found that if you flip a coin just once, you have a 50% chance of getting a 'Head'; but if you flip the coin 10 times, the probability of getting a 'Head' increases to a whopping 99.4%!!! Here's the thing: Failing doesn't mean that you are a failure or that you have bad luck. It only means you have figured out an aspect of your action plan that is not working. Get back up on your feet, dust yourself and keep on flipping!",2021-03-06T21:56:51.679Z,"Where are freelance voiceover artists having the most luck? ",Quora

You need to start… While I don’t think most people want to take my long path, here’s what worked for me and how you can do that in a shorter timeline. However, I made many mistakes early on and had some challenges that slowed me down. Find resources: VoiceoverXtra is a great website with lots of resources. It’s probably an overwhelming amount for anyone new to this world. And that’s just one place. However, go there and start exploring. Everyone there is in the voice over and voice acting world, is very knowledgeable, will provide you good advice and will link to other great resources. Make mistakes: Record yourself. Put yourself, and your voice, out there before you’re ready and then learn from it. Practice. Read aloud every day. Record yourself reading. Listen back to yourself. Then do it again. Try to remove all the punctuation and do it again. Put the punctuation where it needs to be to make this sound right for you, where it works for breathing and to make the copy sound real. Get thick skin. Get used to hearing yourself, and that you sound quite different from outside your head. I recorded my first work when I was like 17, PSA’s and sponsorship scripts for a college radio station. I had to listen to those horrible readings for several months before I had the opportunity to record them again. In that time I learned a lot about how to do it better. Get some training: My training started, completely by accident, shortly before my voice dropped. I had a lisp (called siblance in our world) plus the added benefit of stuttering and stammering. As a result, I mumbled. A lot. Speech therapy allowed me to make my mistakes in front of another person’s ears, hear how I could properly explore the different parts of my mouth, deliver words with more energy & presence, how to strengthen my lips, tongue and vocal cords. I learned and practiced several tongue twisters I still use to warm up. Don’t have the issues I encountered? Find your local community college, community theater group or comedy group and take an acting or improvisational class. Don’t want a class, or have a class nearby, look for a Meetup group for acting, improv or theater in the area. Start one if one doesn’t exist. For me… part of training is you, alone, learning how to be comfortable being uncomfortable while sounding comfortable. Oh, and get good exercise. Lung capacity is important. This will all prepare you for the next step… Get Coaching: The best thing you can do is have a professional in the field who helps you, to sound more like the best version of you, by giving you positive feedback and a positive path to grow and develop. I learned the best from a friend who was a very skilled producer/director and she helped me get so much better over several years of working together. We’d play back a reading, dissect how to do it better, then try again. I used this and would record my coaching sessions with my students. I’d ask my voiceover students to tell me about something great or exciting that happened to them. Later, I’d ask them to read a script. The next session I would have those recordings ready to play. I’d let them compare the sound of telling me a story and then reading me a story. Then we would work on getting the sound of reading a script more like them telling me a story. Proper coaching prepares you for proper mic position and technique and working with future producers, directors and clients too. If you skip it - you’ll regret it. There are coaches out there for all lines of voiceover and voice acting. They should all be positive, have a goal in mind (that you both develop for you together) and come to a point where they can no longer teach you more in a worthwhile manner. Once you have coaching under your belt, even if you don’t feel completely done, but you’ve started nailing your reads, gaining confidence and know how to avoid siblance, plosives, can change your energy from serious to ecstatic (with the same copy) without complaint, or many missteps, the next step is… Make your demo(s): You and your coach should agree that you’re now ready to make your demo(s). This isn’t something you should, in my opinion, schedule on day one. It also isn’t something that should takes years to be ready for. It can be weeks of work, if you have some natural skills and talents, or it can be months if you really need to develop your instincts and skills. The more prepared you are and the more willing you are to do the work to challenge yourself, the better this will be. Work with a demo producer who knows what they’re doing. Get recommendations. Many people at this stage are actually landing some work. Perhaps you’ve volunteered for a local friend or no profit to do a commercial, video, their phone system, or even get paid. You’ll need to work with the demo producer to get more coaching (mainly to select scripts and for them to learn your range) or you’ll work with your present coach to do this and the demo producer will record you before editing and mixing your demo. Please don’t make your own demo. Unless you’re a producer yourself it’s nearly impossible and, even if you are, it will take you far longer than it should to make it. Get equipment: Many people pick up the equipment along the way. You need a computer and then a low quality mixer (Behringer UM2 is as low as about $30), something like a Shure SM58 (about $90 or less, used is usually fine), an low quality XLR cable ($10 from a local music shop), some semi decent headphones (Audio Technica ATH M30X for about $60 or Sony MDR7506 for closer to $99) and software (Audacity is free and ‘good enough’ for awhile). These can be upgraded as needed with a proper mixer, a microphone that’s better suited to your voice and these headphones can be in your ‘road kit’ as you upgrade). You can land low paying jobs doing fan based work that will pay $5 - $20 for cartoons, game expansion packs and other work at places like ‘Casting Call Club’ and online groups. Once you have professional quality equipment you’re ready for the next steps… Marketing yourself and getting clients, managers or agents: You will need to tell people about who you are. You’ll need to have a niche (don’t be the person who claims ‘I can voice anything’) You’ll need business cards and a website where you can post your demos. You’ll need to network. This will give you clients. Clients give you cash flow and credibility. Cash flow and credibility establish you as a professional. You then become bookable. Bookable people who can do good work for clients, and can represent themselves well, can get representation from an agent or manager. You shouldn’t pay a manager money up front. For anything. Some will want more demos for a niche you don’t have represented well. Some will even pay for these to be made as an investment in your business and theirs. Overnight success?: As you can see - this might not be something you can do overnight. But, maybe you can. Start this as a hobby. Learn as you go. Build on what you do. Start making money. It’s a great problem to look at your full time job and feel like it’s holding you back from making what you should be making. Many people aren’t prepared to work on their own and many successful voice talents I know keep a part time job. I may have a day where I don’t do much work, and can answer a post like this on Quora, followed by three grueling non-stop days of recording and editing. So how does someone get into voice acting?

The fair use exception in copyright law allows people to use copyrighted content (youtube videos) for educational, news, and creative purposes (as well as other uses, but then it gets more complicated). In your case it's mostly about how your voice acting ""transforms"" the original work (video) into something more. If you just change a small piece, it would be seen as a derivative work, which is in most cases is seen as property of the original creator (who made the work you slightly changed). Derivative works can still be allowed online, but if you start making money people get upset and lawsuits are born. Making money off derivative works is not allowed unless you created very significant new value via your changes- turning into a 'transformative work'. However, everyone can sue for anything, so you might always have to fight for your right--- to parrrrtyyyyyy. I think the famous Obama art poster is a good example, which the lawsuit has been settled, but settlement terms were not disclosed.AP And Shepard Fairey Settle Lawsuit Over Obama Image; Fairey Agrees To Give Up Fair Use Rights To AP Photos | Techdirt So first ask yourself how much value are you creating for society beyond that of the original work by voice acting over it? For example if you copy an entire 5-10 minute video to voice act for only 5-10 seconds, then it probably isn't fair use. However, if you do voice acting for a more significant portion (ie: 4 minutes out of 5-10) then it is more likely fair use.  However with creativity, there is a sliding scale in every direction so there is no one-fits-all answer. It all depends on the specific context of the copyrighted work. Maybe its a slow narrative or perhaps you voice acted for a critical but minor character role. Also, the law questions whether your new video is ""superseding the use of the original"" video. If people can get essentially the same benefit/value of the original video by watching your new video then it's not fair use- you copied the original value and that's sort of like stealing. However, if people get a different experience from your video as compared to the original then it might not supersede the original and rather complement it. The law is mostly concerned about stealing and hurting the value of original works (which includes the original creator's ability to generate ad revenue on youtube). So that being said, if you try to monetize your video with the voice acting, your situation will be even more scrutinized in court for how much value you really added by voice acting. Then again, maybe the original creator won't care and won't bother fighting you. It only really matters when big money is at stake- most youtube videos, even at a few million views don't make enough money to support a lawsuit. That being said, Hollywood is extra sensitive when they realize people were more creative than them =P Wikipedia is great for learning more:Fair useDerivative workTransformation (law)Transformativeness I would just note for other readers that 'voice acting' is not the same as 'commentary' and commentary on top of a video could prove more 'transformative' than voice acting, even if it is done poorly (such as cursing at the TV). Commentary does not have to be parody or educational- it could just be your thoughts- but parody, education, and news purposes are valued in the courts. So since 'commentary' is completely new speech, it likely transforms the original work more than using the existing speech in a new way (IE: high pitch voices).

But those “50 best freelance platforms” types of lists don’t really tell you much, right? It’s like they’ve just gone and listed every single freelance platform out there – I don’t see it much more helpful than a simple Google search you could’ve done yourself. That’s why I’ve decided to compare the two of the most popular and most diverse freelance platforms instead. Fiverr vs Upwork – who wins the clash of the freelance titans? Let’s start with a brief overview. Fiverr vs Upwork – Platform Overview Fiverr Fiverr was founded in 2010, as an online marketplace and a platform that enables freelancers to offer their $5+ services to customers all over the world. It was established by Shai Wininger and Micha Kaufman with headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel.  In September 2018, Fiverr had 35.95M monthly visits. In addition, it is estimated to facilitate around 1 million transactions, each month. Upwork Upwork was born in 2015, after an Elance-oDesk merger. The two platforms merged in 2013 and were eventually rebranded as a new platform. Today, Upwork is a global platform that connects businesses and freelancers and enables them to collaborate remotely. Its headquarters are located in California, USA.  In September 2018, Upwork had 34.76M monthly visitors. According to some estimates, there are around 12 million freelancers and approximately 5 million clients on Upwork. There are more than 3 million jobs posted to Upwork per year, worth a total of $1 billion. So, if we compare the two platforms in terms of popularity (judging on the basis of the number of monthly visitors), we’ll have to call it a tie. Fiverr vs Upwork – 1:1. (Yes, I realize that Fiverr had over a million visitors more than Upwork in September, but these numbers fluctuate from month to month, so this difference is not too significant.) Upwork vs Fiverr – How They Work Even though these two platforms are often compared side-by-side, the way they function is essentially different. Sure, both enable you to connect with clients or freelancers looking for or offering a particular skillset. But here’s how the basic operation of the two platforms differs: On Upwork, a freelancer offers services closely related to one set of skills. Fiverr, however, enables them to offer gigs that can cover a wide range of services.On Upwork, a freelancer bids on jobs by sending their application and cover letter as a response to the client’s job posting. On Fiverr, client’s buy gigs already pre-defined by freelancers.In order to get a better grasp of the cross-platform similarities and differences, I’m going to compare the two platforms from both the client and the freelancer perspective. Fiverr vs Upwork – The Freelancer Perspective Becoming a Freelancer Here, I’m not going to judge the two platforms based on their user interface or how easy it is to fill out the registration form, set up a profile, or apply for a job. If you’re looking to become a freelancer on Fiverr, there’s no stopping you – all you need to do is sign up and start offering your gigs.  Upwork, on the other hand, has recently started moderating and filtering new freelancers. There have been numerous cases of new freelancers being denied access to the platform because there are already too many members with a particular skill set. This is especially true of content writers and data entry specialists, for example. So, if you ask me which platform is more hospitable towards new freelancers, the answer has to be – Fiverr. Of course, when it comes to both platforms, you need to follow their guidelines and agree to their terms of use in order to be able to offer your services on each of the platforms in the first place. It’s also easier to remain a freelancer on Fiverr, as Upwork has recently started enforcing a more strict policy, suspending freelancers that do not fulfill certain criteria over a certain period of time. Earning Potential Even though Fiverr is notorious as a cheap labor marketplace, where “you can get anything done for $5”, that’s actually not true (at least in most cases). The pricing for some services may start at $5 but can go up to several thousand when you add various gig extras. Still, the earning potential on Fiverr may be somewhat limited when you first start working on the platform, as the number of gigs and gig extras is limited until you become a higher-level seller. Upwork, on the other end, does not impose any limitations when it comes to the price of your services. Actually, the only limitations are the minimum hourly wage of $3/hour and the minimal set project value of $5.  Generally, Fiverr’s main drawback is its reputation (maintained by its very name, among other things). Most clients come to Fiverr looking for cheap labor. Full stop. So, in terms of earning potential, my 10 points go to Upwork. Job-Finding Ease As already mentioned in the How They Work section, the basic difference in the way Upwork and Fiverr operate is in the fact that with the former you apply to job postings, while with the latter you wait for the clients to find your gig and contact you. What does it mean for you in terms of job-finding ease? Fiverr vs Upwork – where are you more likely to land your first job? The competition is rough on both platforms and the first job is always most difficult to land, but I’d still give an advantage to Upwork. It’s foremost due to the ability to proactively look for a job, instead of passively waiting for customers to contact you. There is, in fact, a section of Fiverr that allows you to bid on client requests, but it’s not nearly as rich with postings as Upwork’s job feed. So, another +1 for Upwork. At least when it comes to landing your first job.  Once you’ve got your Fiverr gigs going and earned a considerable reputation, you’re likely to get flooded with offers without even having to waste time applying to dozens of job posts. In this respect, getting new jobs might be easier on Fiverr. But your gigs need to rank extremely well for this to be the case. Fiverr vs Upwork – The Client Perspective Making Sure You’re Making a Quality Hire If you’re looking to hire a remote freelance professional, both Upwork and Fiverr can provide you with plenty of choices for your needs. But how to make sure you’ll be hiring someone who can actually get the job done? Even though both platforms make an effort to vet their freelancers, I’d say that Upwork goes a step further. As already mentioned, they’ve recently started enforcing a more rigorous policy in terms of who can become a freelancer on Upwork, unlike Fiverr, where literally anyone can just register and start selling. Upwork vs Fiverr – who does a better job at vetting their freelancers? On Fiverr, there are several seller levels (Seller, Level One Seller, Level Two Seller, Top-Rated Seller) that help you determine whether a freelancer will be a good fit for your needs, experience-wise. Quality-wise, you can rely on buyer ratings. Upwork, on the other hand, has its very detailed (but to some extent still vague) Job Success Score (JSS). In addition, the top-rated freelancers are distinguished by a special badge on their profile. Most importantly, Upwork provides you with an easier and more effective way of vetting freelancers on your own, by reviewing each freelancer’s cover letter (they’re obliged to send along with each job application).  Even though you can find quality freelancers on both platforms, it seems it’s easier to make a more informed hire on Upwork. If you need more help with hiring the perfect candidate for your job, you can learn how to use a job application form to hire the top candidate. Making a Quick and More Affordable Hire For many one-time projects or small tasks, you need to hire a freelancer on a bit of a short notice. In that case, you need to make sure you pick a platform that will enable you to make a quick hire. Fiverr enables hiring in just a few clicks – in some cases, you don’t even need to communicate with the freelancer before making a hire. Provided that their gig description is clear and detailed enough, their gig extras are carefully added, and their profile is reputable, you can make a hire in a matter of seconds. Upwork, on the other hand, forces you to go through the interview process, which often requires a significant amount of back-and-forth communication so it can make it a bit more complicated making a quick hire. Plus, as already mentioned, Fiverr has the reputation of a more affordable freelancer marketplace. Final Verdict: Upwork vs Fiverr?  Before I make a final verdict, it’s important to emphasize that the “one size fits all” approach doesn’t work with freelance platforms either. So, choosing the right platform out of the two largely depends on your specific needs.",2021-03-06T22:08:03.450Z,"Which voiceover artists do YouTube viewers prefer in 2021 who are for hire on Fiverr or Upwork?

You need to start… While I don’t think most people want to take my long path, here’s what worked for me and how you can do that in a shorter timeline. However, I made many mistakes early on and had some challenges that slowed me down. Find resources: VoiceoverXtra is a great website with lots of resources. It’s probably an overwhelming amount for anyone new to this world. And that’s just one place. However, go there and start exploring. Everyone there is in the voice over and voice acting world, is very knowledgeable, will provide you good advice and will link to other great resources. Make mistakes: Record yourself. Put yourself, and your voice, out there before you’re ready and then learn from it. Practice. Read aloud every day. Record yourself reading. Listen back to yourself. Then do it again. Try to remove all the punctuation and do it again. Put the punctuation where it needs to be to make this sound right for you, where it works for breathing and to make the copy sound real. Get thick skin. Get used to hearing yourself, and that you sound quite different from outside your head. I recorded my first work when I was like 17, PSA’s and sponsorship scripts for a college radio station. I had to listen to those horrible readings for several months before I had the opportunity to record them again. In that time I learned a lot about how to do it better. Get some training: My training started, completely by accident, shortly before my voice dropped. I had a lisp (called siblance in our world) plus the added benefit of stuttering and stammering. As a result, I mumbled. A lot. Speech therapy allowed me to make my mistakes in front of another person’s ears, hear how I could properly explore the different parts of my mouth, deliver words with more energy & presence, how to strengthen my lips, tongue and vocal cords. I learned and practiced several tongue twisters I still use to warm up. Don’t have the issues I encountered? Find your local community college, community theater group or comedy group and take an acting or improvisational class. Don’t want a class, or have a class nearby, look for a Meetup group for acting, improv or theater in the area. Start one if one doesn’t exist. For me… part of training is you, alone, learning how to be comfortable being uncomfortable while sounding comfortable. Oh, and get good exercise. Lung capacity is important. This will all prepare you for the next step… Get Coaching: The best thing you can do is have a professional in the field who helps you, to sound more like the best version of you, by giving you positive feedback and a positive path to grow and develop. I learned the best from a friend who was a very skilled producer/director and she helped me get so much better over several years of working together. We’d play back a reading, dissect how to do it better, then try again. I used this and would record my coaching sessions with my students. I’d ask my voiceover students to tell me about something great or exciting that happened to them. Later, I’d ask them to read a script. The next session I would have those recordings ready to play. I’d let them compare the sound of telling me a story and then reading me a story. Then we would work on getting the sound of reading a script more like them telling me a story. Proper coaching prepares you for proper mic position and technique and working with future producers, directors and clients too. If you skip it - you’ll regret it. There are coaches out there for all lines of voiceover and voice acting. They should all be positive, have a goal in mind (that you both develop for you together) and come to a point where they can no longer teach you more in a worthwhile manner. Once you have coaching under your belt, even if you don’t feel completely done, but you’ve started nailing your reads, gaining confidence and know how to avoid siblance, plosives, can change your energy from serious to ecstatic (with the same copy) without complaint, or many missteps, the next step is… Make your demo(s): You and your coach should agree that you’re now ready to make your demo(s). This isn’t something you should, in my opinion, schedule on day one. It also isn’t something that should takes years to be ready for. It can be weeks of work, if you have some natural skills and talents, or it can be months if you really need to develop your instincts and skills. The more prepared you are and the more willing you are to do the work to challenge yourself, the better this will be. Work with a demo producer who knows what they’re doing. Get recommendations. Many people at this stage are actually landing some work. Perhaps you’ve volunteered for a local friend or no profit to do a commercial, video, their phone system, or even get paid. You’ll need to work with the demo producer to get more coaching (mainly to select scripts and for them to learn your range) or you’ll work with your present coach to do this and the demo producer will record you before editing and mixing your demo. Please don’t make your own demo. Unless you’re a producer yourself it’s nearly impossible and, even if you are, it will take you far longer than it should to make it. Get equipment: Many people pick up the equipment along the way. You need a computer and then a low quality mixer (Behringer UM2 is as low as about $30), something like a Shure SM58 (about $90 or less, used is usually fine), an low quality XLR cable ($10 from a local music shop), some semi decent headphones (Audio Technica ATH M30X for about $60 or Sony MDR7506 for closer to $99) and software (Audacity is free and ‘good enough’ for awhile). These can be upgraded as needed with a proper mixer, a microphone that’s better suited to your voice and these headphones can be in your ‘road kit’ as you upgrade). You can land low paying jobs doing fan based work that will pay $5 - $20 for cartoons, game expansion packs and other work at places like ‘Casting Call Club’ and online groups. Once you have professional quality equipment you’re ready for the next steps… Marketing yourself and getting clients, managers or agents: You will need to tell people about who you are. You’ll need to have a niche (don’t be the person who claims ‘I can voice anything’) You’ll need business cards and a website where you can post your demos. You’ll need to network. This will give you clients. Clients give you cash flow and credibility. Cash flow and credibility establish you as a professional. You then become bookable. Bookable people who can do good work for clients, and can represent themselves well, can get representation from an agent or manager. You shouldn’t pay a manager money up front. For anything. Some will want more demos for a niche you don’t have represented well. Some will even pay for these to be made as an investment in your business and theirs. Overnight success?: As you can see - this might not be something you can do overnight. But, maybe you can. Start this as a hobby. Learn as you go. Build on what you do. Start making money. It’s a great problem to look at your full time job and feel like it’s holding you back from making what you should be making. Many people aren’t prepared to work on their own and many successful voice talents I know keep a part time job. I may have a day where I don’t do much work, and can answer a post like this on Quora, followed by three grueling non-stop days of recording and editing. So how does someone get into voice acting?

I don't know where you are located, but there's probably a decent acting teacher or group class in your area. There are several acting techniques that are popular now (e.g. Meisner, Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, etc.) and it doesn't much matter which one you use. The key points are:  learning how to ""be truthful under imaginary circumstances,"" and developing the ability to make strong character choices and committing to them. As one of my teachers put it: ""A trained actor makes choices; an untrained actor makes guesses."" Classes in improv are also invaluable. They will help you switch between different approaches to your character if the client or director or casting agent is looking for something different from what you initially offer them.  Beyond learning general acting skills, there are other skills specific to voice acting, whether it's acting for advertising, animation, audiobooks, voice mail systems, corporate narration, e-learning, trailers and promos, ""explainer"" web videos, etc. For that you should find a respected coach, someone with whom you can study either in person or remotely (e.g. phone or Skype). A word to the wise: there are many less-than-reputable companies out there, who will gladly take your money and promise you all kinds of impossible things (""In just four easy lessons, you'll be ready to record a professional demo that will have agents falling all over themselves to sign you up!""). Ask for references, check out online discussion boards to see if they have a sleazy reputation, and--smartest move of all--join the World-Voices Organization, Inc. (WoVO).  A reputable coach would not even think of letting you record a demo until you both agree you're ready, which may be many months down the line.  Your demo, by the way, is absolutely the most important tool you have for getting an agent. Nobody in this business will ever ask you for a CV. They want to hear what you can do with your voice, and that's exactly what a good demo is for. It's a whole subject in itself, and thus outside the scope of this answer. But if you remember nothing else, know that recording an amateurish demo is the surest way to sabotage your career before it's even begun. Other (free) things to do: read aloud every single day. It doesn't matter if it's a morning newspaper (if you still have one of those), a magazine ad, or a passage from a novel off your bookshelf. Get used to the sound of your own voice--in fact, record some of these reading sessions. You can use the ""voice memos"" app on your smartphone for starters. If you're like most people, you won't initially like how you sound--don't worry, you'll get over it.  Try reading the same passage several times, but with a different underlying emotion each time. If you have an ear for dialects, try them out too. Read as if you're a child, a teenager, middle-aged or elderly (one of the great advantages of voice acting over the ""regular"" kind is that your biological age is much less important than your ability to convincingly portray a character at any age--that and no head shots required!). Read as if you're a dog, a donkey, or an inanimate object (for some projects I've voiced a police whistle and a recycling bin, as well as playing cats, parrots and a variety of aliens).  See if you can create a full-fledged character and mood that you can maintain for the entire piece. When you listen back, it should be glaringly obvious if your concentration has faltered and your character has slipped. All voice acting--even if it's narrating the most boring medical narration you can imagine--involves getting into a character and making it sound like you're speaking your very own thoughts, thoughts that have just now spontaneously popped into your head. If it sounds instead like you're reading something off a page (even though that is, of course, exactly what you're doing!), you've failed. Reading without sounding like you're reading is a lot harder than it sounds, but it's truly the indispensable skill in all of voice acting.  Your initial efforts are sure to sound pretty laughable. But don't erase them. Come back every few weeks to an older effort, especially one that you thought was pretty good at the time. If you're progressing and your ear is getting more sophisticated, you should be able to hear the flaws.   A key goal that should be the end result of all this training, but that is often overlooked, is finding your own voice.  Nobody cares if you can do a spot-on Sponge Bob or Donald Duck or Stewie--those positions have already been filled. What they don't have is you. There's no easy way to achieve this. It's something that will take time. But if you can get there, an agent will sit bolt upright when listening to your demo and think ""Holy crap! We don't have one of those!""  Understand that voice acting, like all acting, is a business as well as a vocation. You have to absolutely know deep down that this is what you want to do, come hell or high water. You'll have to spend a great deal of time, effort and (yes) money just to get your skills up to anything resembling  a professional level. And once you're there--you'll need to train even more! And while the initial outlay for a home recording studio is nowhere near as expensive as it used to be, you'll still need the basics: computer, microphone (and an interface between the two), as well as some basic sound treatment for your recording environment.  There's free recording software (for example, Audacity) that is available for any OS. But understand that eventually you'll need to upgrade each component, which can be quite expensive indeed.  And no matter how good an actor you may become, it will mean nothing if you don't learn how to run a business (Now that's a whole subject in itself!). Most of your time will not be spent acting, but instead on hustling to find people to hire you, and networking like mad. Are you a shy introvert? That's fine (you'd be surprised how many actors are!), but realize that you'll never get anywhere unless you can push past the shyness and put yourself out there so the world can see (and hear) you. This is where the majority of voice actors get discouraged and end up quitting. Like most freelancing jobs, your business will have peaks and valleys, and at the beginning the peaks will be few and far between. But if you're truly committed to this, setbacks and dry spells will not be enough to deter you.   If you're willing to do all that, you might just be able to become a good (and working) voice actor. Then, if you work with great people, never stop learning, and be generous to those around you, there's even a minuscule chance that you could someday be a great one! Good luck!

People tend to identify with visual imagery, so creating an explainer video that is filled with interesting content is a major challenge. In order to get your point across to potential clients and business partners, it is important to have a video that communicates what it is that you do and how your services can make a difference in the life of your target audience. So what is an explainer video, exactly? It is a visual document to your business' qualifications. It allows interested parties to learn more about what you do, while also providing a more detailed explanation. It is a way to simultaneously make an introduction and an impact on your potential client base and business partners. In an era where attention spans are getting progressively and sites such as Vine are making a killing by providing six second clips to eager consumers, it has become crucial for a business to deliver visual media that gets straight to the point. The point of an explainer video is to introduce yourself to the customer, while also making a case as to why they need to obtain your goods and/or services. The average web surfer is not going to spend a long time reading lengthy press releases or dedicate more than a minute or two towards watching a video. The most important tip for fledgling business owners: treat your explainer video as your chance to make an elevator pitch. Brevity is to your benefit. Since you can reach more people than ever and geography is no longer an obstacle to success, a video should emphasize your company's strengths, while also ensuring that viewers are able to learn more about your story. Personification of business takes on added gravity in a landscape where so many companies are competing for the dollars available. Simplicity is a key aspect of your video's overall structure. Streamlining your message gives young children and older adults both the chance to understand it clearly. Reaching out to the right explainer video company can help you through this process. They will help you to create a video that establishes the problem you are trying to solve and how you will go about it. An explainer video should clearly define a company's value, while also providing a call to action. The most snazzy, complicated video in the world does nothing to spur an audience into action. By delivering a clear definition of what your business does, the problem that they are attempting to eliminate and their methods for achieving this goal, an explainer video can accomplish more than a press release or endless paragraphs of texts ever could.

It's not even close to what I wanted life to be, but it's not all bad things. I always pictured myself being a homeowner and having a business and making a lot of money. I started my own business and did fairly well, but nothing like I dreamed. I had ownership of a house with someone else and it failed. I was trying to become the person I dreamed of, but I only came into serious debts and that was the end. Piece by piece, everything fell apart. I always thought I'd be a very successful business person who made a whole lot of money. I wanted a big house for myself and family, kind of like a subdivision. I wanted to buy a large amount of land and build my house, then build a house for my mother, then for my brothers too. I figured one day I'd be married with kids so I'd eventually build houses for them too. I did start a business doing what I wanted to do as a kid, I got into remodeling and restoration of properties, and I worked on a crew framing houses. Then over some time I bought a place with someone, but it had no land with it. I figured it would be a good start though and from there I'd get another property. I let alcohol and drug use decide my life instead, and I stupidly spent everything I earned on those instead. Then piece by piece, I lost everything. I would say if I hadn't started drinking and drugging I would have made it, but that would be a lie in itself. I wasn't even close to ready to get what I managed to get, and I wasn't smart about the way I handled things. It made no difference of my habits because if I wasn't wasting money there, I would have wasted it on something else. I was raised in a family who made all the mistakes I did, so I even knew what I was doing was the wrong way. That's the biggest amount of stupidity that I had, but I did it anyhow and figured it won't happen to me. That didn't work out so well, but I did learn a whole lot of valuable lessons from all that I did. That in itself can be priceless, so that's one thing I did achieve out of my life this far. I just wished I had gone much further than where I did, and I always believed I would. I'm only 42 years old, so there's still some time left to achieve some of my goals. Time will tell I guess, but I'll be happy for now with what little I have, that's honestly all I need. Happiness is determined by the person, and I feel pretty happy and that's what really matters to me, so I hope this helps you.",2021-03-06T22:16:21.103Z,"Has your life turned out how you pictured it to be when you were a child-particularly in regards your job?

There are a lot of different requirements for voice, e.g. What types of voiceover artists and voice work are there? Before you get into the industry you will need to know what you are talking about and how to price your work. You’ll need to know some of the technical terminology and how to use a microphone. If you don’t know this, do a course - they’re available online. Then starts the marketing part, i.e. you have to market yourself. You will need to put together some kind of showreel which is a compilation of work you have done. This, obviously, is a catch-22 - how do you get work without having a showreel to get work. There are three ways which I have experienced (I’ve recorded probably around 8000 hours of voiceover and I’ve helped numerous new people get into the industry: Network in whichever industry niche you want to enter. For example, if you want voice acting work then find some student animators and offer to do a character for free. If you want to get into doing ads, find a community radio station and do some of their ads.Approach a voiceover agency (not sure if they have any in Malaysia, but I’m sure you can find out), and ask some advice about how to get listed with them. They may have a process and might even have a studio you can record a demo in. I helped one acting agency do this in New Zealand with about 25 actors who had never had voiceover experience before.Make your own recordings of hypothetical scenarios - if you have some production skills then you can put together some fake ads, or a character dialogue.So, those are the main three ways, but you still also need to look professional, so having your LinkedIn profile up-to-date with the right description of you helps immensely if you don’t have a website (a website about you with your showreel is even better). To get more experience you could offer gigs through Fiverr or Guru with a money-back guarantee. Then you need to continue to network and introduce your business to people. Find out who books the type of voiceovers you want to do (casting agents, ad agency creatives, directors, etc) and make sure they know who you are and are reminded of what you are doing fairly regularly (don’t spam them, though). Finally, make sure you are invoicing accurately and on-time, and ensure that you get paid for your work. Good luck.

But don’t overload your viewers with emotions, so that it looks real. 5. Correct text. Choose your words wisely, because each of them affects the viewer. 6. Style. Make your video of your own style. Let it match with your video. It should all the way describe your product/company/service. 7. Voiceover. Use a professional voiceover artist. Otherwise, your video might sound annoying. 8. Music and sound effects. Again, it should fit with your video’s action. And better choose something soothing, not inspiring aggression. 9. Watermarks. if you had somebody else or some company made a video for you be attentive not have watermarks of video production company on it. 10. Simplicity. Keep it simple. This is very important. Yes, you can add a lot of characters and animation, you can make it look luxurious. But luxurious does not mean goo and effective.

Focus on stories, not sales Before the rise of social media, if you wanted someone to see an advert, you had to rent space within a popular media channel like TV or print. On social platforms, brands can reach the exact same audience directly. This means that branded content (advertising) competes with entertainment, rather than interrupting it. 2. Use the first few seconds wisely Attention spans online are short. In fact, the average attention span is now just 8.5 seconds. When it comes to creating a successful video, you must bring your story to life quickly, so as to instantly gather interest as people scroll through their feeds. 3. Target relevant audiences on Facebook As a content distribution platform, Facebook is incredible. One of the features that make Facebook stand out from other marketing channels is the super-in-depth targeting you can use to select audiences for your content. 4. Tell your story with and without sounds In a recent change, videos now autoplay on Facebook with sound on (unless your phone is on silent mode). It’s not yet clear exactly how this change will affect viewing habits on Facebook. Before the update, multiple publishers reported as much as 85% percent of video views on Facebook to happen with the sound off. 5. Include CTA’s When creating videos, be sure to optimize your content with calls to action (CTA). A CTA doesn’t always have to directly lead to a sale or sign up, video CTA’s could include: Subscribe to your channelFollow / Like your PageShare with your friendsComment on the videoCheck out other content6. Optimize for search More than 3.5 billion searches per day are performed on Google and Google-owned, YouTube also boasts more than 3 billion searches per month. Search is also a growing trend on Facebook, with more than 2 billion searches per day conducted on the platform. 7. Collaborate with other brands and influencers Ninety percent of people today trust peer recommendations over company ads. When a trusted influencer recommends a product it can feel more genuine and trustworthy than a brand telling you how great its own product or service is.

Explainer videos tell your audience what your business is all about in a snap in a way they understand and remember. These are the few elements that make an explainer video an asset rather than a liability: Type of explainer video There many different types of explainer video like animated, stop motion, live action,etc. There is no set universal type of video that works for all businessess. You have to find out what works for you. Sales script; The Script is the most crucial & time consuming aspect of a successful explainer video. A minute of explainer video comprises of approximately 150 words which means you have to be as conscise as possible. A good script must state the problem the business solves, the solution it provides as well a call to action. Video quality: How a video is created tells a lot about the experience audiences will have with it . Whether it was created using templates and free images from google or was it created from scratch using custom animations and graphics. I also recommend a full HD resolution at a minimum. Length of the video: The ideal length for an effective explainer video should be between 60 to 90 seconds depending on the complexity of the business. Less than that is not enough make people understand the value of the product and people get bored if its more than that . Voiceover: The voiceover should have that x factor that makes people connect with the story you’re trying to tell through the video on an emotional front as if they are having a conversation with a friend. Simplicity: When businesses are starting out with explainer videos, they tend to wander and not stick to the point they are trying to make with the video and end up confusing their audience even more than before which is counter productive. Idealize startup recordings: 1.Runtime. Fundamentally we suggest two lengths. a) The first is under 1 minute. It can even be 59 seconds however in the event that you can press your message in this length at that point it will pay back. Why? Since there's a mental limit in the vicinity of 0:59 and 1:01. The second one looks any longer simply like 700$ looks significantly more than 699$. Despite the way that the distinction is minute. That is the reason our promotion video is 51 seconds short :) b) If you cannot make in a moment, make it under 90 seconds. The main exemption of these principles is the point at which you create a video for somebody who is as of now keen on your answer (i.e. VC or truly focused on client portioned). They have regular inspiration to invest more energy in finding out about your answer so it can be 2– 3 minutes in length. 2.Content As some folks have just let you know - endeavor to make a story. In any case, recollect that story is just an instrument to tell about your answer. You should demonstrate both - how your startup will slaughter some extremely awful client's torments and how it will advance his function. Time is restricted however you can complete a little trap. Make voiceover tell half of the content and the rest you can appear in your liveliness with charts, infographics and so forth. The most mainstream botch is when individuals need to advise to much. Never at any point do it. It's smarter to tell less yet in a justifiable route than jabber yet not be retained. 3. Request Begin with demonstrating a circumstance than produces client's agony. You need to assemble compatibility with them so they will see that you comprehend them. Specific should torment - as much as possible. Demonstrate some most basic arrangements individuals use for this situation and how they are insufficient. And afterward is the ideal opportunity for your answer that goes ahead the white pony and recoveries the day! 4. DO's and DONT's DO's: - Spend no less than seven days taking a shot at your voice-over content. - Read it to your companions and potential clients and get the input. - Make all the visual components clear as crystal. On the off chance that you need to imagine security - utilize shield symbol. You can likewise utilize more unique things like Avengers to picture that on the off chance that you have the correct group of onlookers :). - Get a decent voice-over. Truly. Terrible voice-over can crush even the best startup pitch video. DONT's - Never make it chaotic. - Never adhere to the primary thought. Attempt some others. In some cases the primary thought is the best however you need to make certain you have thoroughly considered different thoughts also. - Don't endeavor to tell excessively. Keep in mind - it's only a pitch. 5. Enlivened or shoot live. It relies upon your startup. Livelinesss are extraordinary with regards to indicating conceptual things or models that don't exist yet. There are numerous methods for doing it - 3D, 2D, whiteboard. I profoundly suggest it in the event that you have a financial plan and your startup is doing some product stuff.

Your script is the creative blueprint of your video.  … and that is the reason why: Animators/editors love a good script. A video with a good script will literally look better. The Structure of a Good Script The type of people who talk about “best practice” will often recommend the below structure. It’s a useful starting point but don’t be a slave to it or let it get in the way of your creativity! Step 1. The Problem: State the problem that exists in the market [for a 60 sec video, aim for 30 words or less here].Step 2. The Solution: Introduce your product [10-15 words].Step 3. How it Works: Explain your product. Use only “need-to-know” info [30-50 words].Step 4. Call to Action: Reel ’em in. And slap on some credibility and social proof.[10-20 words]Video Concept The above can give you a good script, but what about a great script? You need to think about the video’s concept! Your script-writer’s creative credentials are super important here. An experienced writer will have a memory bank of ideas to draw from, coming in some part from all the other videos or adverts they spend their time watching! In the scripting process your writer will brainstorm for ideas, sometimes in conjunction with an animator or designer. As one idea of a concept, see the below video. Here the concept is to use simple statements where the visuals transform from one visual into the next. That means the script needs to be written in a certain way, i.e. with one statement leading into the next and without too many words! The concept won’t work if there is too much information to get across.  To come up with ideas it can help to look at other videos, e.g. see our article about explainer video examples. Writing Visuals A lot of copywriters may be experienced with other forms of writing but slip up with video due to the visuals. As mentioned above, having an idea for a concept can help. Here are a few tips. Keep the visuals simple. You don’t have Pixar’s budget! By making your animator’s life easy you give them more time to perfect your video. You should keep the number of characters to a minimum and try not to rely on complex visuals (e.g. let stuff happen to your characters rather than having them do stuff).Don’t be a control freak. Designers are paid to be creative, so give them some space.Voiceover must match visuals. Don’t have the voiceover saying A, while the visuals are doing B. This is a common cause of a video “not working” or “lacking impact”.Match timings. Don’t script in a lot of visuals for a short spoken portion or vice versa.What’s the best length for an Explainer Video? Keep it short, ok? People prefer watching shorter videos and they’re also cheaper to make. Would you rather be paying for creative time to make your video (1) longer or (2) more awesome? But in the end it comes down to your message and the intended use of the video. A tutorial or case study for example may be longer than a brand video.

I had the “it’s that guy” reaction, where I could picture his face and some things he was in, but couldn’t quite get to his name. Hiring a well-known celebrity is relatively expensive, so commercial producers really want the voice to be recognized immediately. Even if the listener can’t quite place the voice, they want it to be familiar enough that it lends credibility to what’s being promoted. Hiring impressionists instead of the real thing can be a double-edged sword. Some impressions are far enough “off” from the real thing, or so over-the-top that it’s clear it’s not the real celebrity. But some are so dead-on that the producer sometimes feel they need to add “celebrity voice impersonated” to the commercial, to avoid getting sued by the real celebrity. That said, here are a few celebs that some people might not have immediately recognized in their commercial voiceover work: Matt Damon, TD AmeritradeEd Harris, Home DepotJosh Lucas, Home DepotVing Rhames, Arby’s (“we have the meats”)[Note: Arby’s ads are not and never have been voiced by James Earl Jones, contrary to what you read and hear elsewhere. This series of ads has always been Ving Rhames, since the campaign started in 2015. If you want to hear James Earl Jones, listen to the promos and intros for CNN. Jones has been the voice of CNN for many years, and has never voice an Arby’s commercial.]Bill Hader, Planter’s Peanuts (Mr. Peanut)Paul Rudd, HyundaiJohn Corbett, Walgreens and Applebee’sWill Arnett, Bank of America and GMC trucksTim Allen, Pure MichiganJ.K.

Personally, I can’t think of one celebrity voiceover that I didn’t almost immediately recognize. The one I had the most trouble identifying Josh Lucas for Home Depot. I had the “it’s that guy” reaction, where I could picture his face and some things he was in, but couldn’t quite get to his name. Hiring a well-known celebrity is relatively expensive, so commercial producers really want the voice to be recognized immediately.

In one podcast he was seemingly baffled by the way Westerners have limits on science based on “a thousand year old religion” while (and this is almost verbatum) “there are Chinese are ready to abort the thousands of embryos in order to select for super-embryos and program them to survive at least until age 36 as a contributing member of society.” He feels this is a threat to American “progress” and is therefore genuinely annoyed that we were limited by our ethics while other countries proceed to experiment on human beings without such bearings. He even remarked that China is already running social experiments on humans by giving them social points for certain behaviors to encourage better social performance… as if this is a good thing and not a repurposing of ideas from Orphan Black episodes. Literally the stuff that we are worried about is the dystopic end to human civilization is what he thought might be the “progress” our society limits by caring about ethics. Dillon actually spotted this attempt to discredit ethics in science and goes “Well we obviously need ethics in science, right?” To which Altucher gave some dismissive answer. Another video I watched when he was talking to Tim Dillon he states that talking about the truck-drivers who will lose their jobs is “fear mongering” since AI will create jobs for truck drivers overall and since progress/technology has never actually caused the loss of human jobs like predicted. Except it did. There are thousands of people right now out of jobs because we stopped doing coal and didn’t give them any footing to stand on to support their communities. The idea that the production of these tech companies benefits laborers in a meaningful way is kind of absurd. It just relegates them to slave, as operators of machines who are forced into the limited jobs (if any) that open for things that can otherwise be done by robots. I have the sense that he finds this status as acceptable based on darwinistic ideas of social fitness and weakness, and I base this on my observation that when he explains how government should help the unemployed he uses the term “weak people” to describe people without jobs or with a diminishing job market. Even though he believes government should provide for “weak people” he seems to think that talking about this impending threat of AI on the livelihoods of people is overstated and didn’t like that Andrew Yang talked about it. In another instance he is talking to Tim Dillon who is describing his cynicism which developed from acquired knowledge and his assertion that knowing more about the world can make people less happy. This idea, for most moral people, is sort of self-explanatory. Obviously knowing about pain and human suffering (which is what Dillon was ultimately talking about) naturally decreases the happiness you feel. But Altucher finds this surprising and goes “Why?….You can just think of it as fun. It’s all just a game.” And he says this in all seriousness. For him there is no good and evil “since both sides of the political aisle are friends” and he thinks that the best way to view policy is through an individualistic lens (what things will benefit me personally). With this level of moral ineptitude it is hardly surprising that he observes the debacle of society’s impending collapse with a sense of detached enjoyment. Because he thinks all people are selling a narrative, he has no real position or leaning politically, no measure of the value of measuring truth in people’s ideas besides the occasional question of “what viewpoint is this person selling to me and what are their motivations for selling that narrative”. He rejects any meaningful historical narratives as “the creations of the one percent of the one percent” but simultaneously accepts the current narrative of impending scientific “progress” of the brand of Steven Pinker et al. I am almost positive that his brand of “removed enjoyment” at social progress at the (temporary) cost of human livelihoods stems from the kind of optimistic capitalist, Social Darwinist,rebranded utilitarianism that Pinker tries to pass as humanist ethics. In general he sounds like an intelligent but utterly morally inept guy. He measures his intellect and everyone else’s in terms of IQ (“Andrew Yang has the highest IQ!) and thinks that in the future children should be pre-selected or aborted based on traits such as IQ. He’s the type to fit perfectly in finance in the 21st century but would be lost in any school of abstract or philosophical thought that attributes one’s purpose to anything beyond that which directly benefits social progress. His analogue would be a Jarvis Lanier type. idk what else to say about him. Just not my cup of tea by any stretch of the imagination.",2021-03-06T22:23:24.900Z,"Is James Altucher a scam artist?

If possible, use a pop screen to avoid plosives popping the mic diaphragm.•Record at proper levels, allowing some headroom.•Make the original recording as good as you can - don’t rely on equalisation or compression to ‘fix’ things later.•Related to the previous point, don’t equalise or process the voice in anyway while recording, unless you are a VERY competent sound engineer. Once you’ve committed processing to the original recording, you can’t undo it.•If there are technical problems that can’t be addressed quickly, take your performer out of the studio and situate them comfortably - they don’t need to be standing around while you rewire a cable or reformat a drive. 2. Performance: •Use a professional voiceover artist. You might find a good amateur, but generally speaking, a professional will save you a lot of time and give you a better result.•Try to record your voiceover in one session. Voices can change according to many factors - time of day, tiredness, health, atmospheric conditions (yep) - and for consistency it’s best to do everything at the same time. If you need to get an artist back to do pickups, try to do complete segments rather than a sentence here and there to ‘drop in’.•Be prepared. Have the script arranged in loose leaf, and provide a decent-sized lectern or music stand for the pages. Make sure the type is of a decent size, and the lighting in the booth is good. Provide pencil and eraser for your performer to make notes.•Don’t tire your performer. Both their performance and their voice will suffer as they get tired. In long sessions, plan for short breaks at least every hour. Have fresh, room-temperature water available in the booth.•Know what you want, and be clear in your instructions. Doing multiple takes with no explanation or vague explanation will confuse your artist.•Keep the performer relaxed and in good spirits. 3. Script: •Make the script available to the voiceover artist some days before the recording session, so they can go through it and flag any difficult areas.•Make sure the words are readable. This might sound obvious, but you’d be surprised at how many writers just have no facility for writing words that sound good when read aloud. •Make sure the script is succinct and makes sense.•Be prepared to change the script if the performer has a problem with a word or phrase. This happens more frequently than you might think, and if your artist can’t get a word in a few goes, you’ll create frustration and tension by making them do it over and over.

Out of the two choices, the script is always first, however before the script there has to be an accumulation of data which I shall leave for another day to prevent going off-track. To put things bluntly, no script, no video. The script, a good script, will define or play a prominent part in all other stages (and sub-stages) of production, so not only is it about: The structure of the information in the video, but alsoFlow of information (lyrically and visually)Visuals and icon to be in the video (taking into account brand style), when, and for how longVideo durationTo elaborate Structure of information within the script, typically 5 sections, although one can break up solution information and certain problems into smaller sub-sections that go to and fro as the video progresses.Definition of problem and target audience qualification:State the problem, and let the viewer know what the message is about. We need an emotional response, a negative one triggered by recollections of pain and problems, so we sow seeds of sorrow into fertile ground. If we can get it to the level of cats and dogs living together all the better.Recommended duration within which this needs to occur is 7-10 seconds (depends on which video analytics report or white paper you peruse). This doesn’t mean the whole problem, but the hook, or to be more exact preliminary lead qualification. Target audience stay, the rest leave.b. Solution introduction: With the sour out of the way, and the audience now hopefully close to quivering lips and tear drops clinging to lashes, we can bring forth the solution, erupting from the fertile ground, thus evoking a greater contrast and greater appreciation, as the solution manifests in all its glory, bringing bouts of jubilation and unbridled joy.Ok, slightly over the top, but the point is, there is no true appreciation of the light, without the dark, (yes, this line was not over the top).I try to use the UVP here if possible, maybe an additional line for clarification.c. Solution information: Benefits derived from features and value attained by using the solution. Benefits on their own just comes across as hype; save money, save time, go faster, last longer, shed pounds, gain an inch, etc, etc. So, I do not go for benefit, benefit, benefit, it has to be benefits derived from features in order to substantiate that it is this product (business or service) that brings these benefits.Features are the unique traits of the product/service (as well as not so unique, but rather refined traits or an amalgamation of previously unrelated traits). However, features on their own unless one is an expert, are more or less useless, for if the features do not convey to the target audience the benefits they bring, the value they provide, then it will fall flat.d. Summary of solution: Final summary that also shows how the problem defined at the beginning has been alleviated, in a succinct manner. I like to arc back and convey the change to the problem that was used to hook the viewer.e. Call-To-Action: Self-explanatory, needs to be in keeping and in tandem with whatever the objective is of the other materials used in that section of the funnel.2. Flow of information (lyrically and visually) Although a general flow has been defined by point 1., flow still needs to take into account other things: Logical flow and story flow:Logical flow is self-explanatory.Story flow:we need to make sure that the script flows with peaks and troughs, with the right amount of build-up to the crescendo. The first crescendo being the revelation of the solution, and that enough has come before this revelation to give it the appreciation it deserves. From that we also need to analyse each line to see if the crescendo in each line should be at the beginning, middle or end, and if need be, the potential to change the script to give enough down-time at certain stages to allow enough up-time at those crescendo moments.We are also wanting to make sure that there is enough time within which the information can be taken in.Modular:Bite size building blocks for this aids retention and understanding. Information is presented in bite-size blocks, and subsequent information is latched onto what has come before. This is one of the ways in which we retain and learn anyway, latch what you don’t know onto what you do know.Macro-micro:Not only do we present information in a modular way, we should also present it in macro-micro fashion, which basically means show the overall thing, focus on details at a specific point, show how that fits overall, then move onto focusing on some more details; doesn’t have to be so formulaic as in one then the other, can do a few details then overall, etc.Like looking at a painting, one looks at the overall picture, zooms into focus on a specific part, then zooms out again to see how the detail fits into the bigger picture.This allows the viewer to have their bearings so to speak, so they are not lost as they take the detail in, and see how things fit into the scheme of things.Visual flow:What may logically flow, and flow like a good story, may cause jumps in visuals; so we need to look at visual flow as well. If the text needs to be reordered without it affecting a modular macro-micro presentation of information, then it should be re-ordered.3. Visuals and icon to be in the video One needs to analyse the sentence structure as well as the overall structure, so, one looks at what point in the sentence are the core words, and thus are those words in the optimum place for the visuals. How many core words are there, and where in the sentence are they, so basically I am talking about timing and space needed for the information to be taken in, bu also consistency in visuals in regards to timing and space. Considerations here are: If visuals are to be synced to the words (voice over), have we left enough time for the visuals to sink in, in that sentence?If visuals are to be synced, have we got any time left to animate the visual in an appropriate intrinsic manner befitting the visual?If visuals are not to be synced so we are using the whole sentence due to where the core words are, is the animation going to be at a consistent pace, or does it break the speed, so some elements come in at a speed that is outside of what we consider appropriate, taking into account contrast of visual speed can only be done when there is a difference to note, and that difference is what partly contributes to an organic animation.What has come before, and if that visual is to be in the next sentence, are the core words so far into the sentence that we have to have some visual fluff? I am not against visual fluff, but don’t like it going overboard.There is also the usage of certain words and phrases that evoke visuals, and if those visuals are appropriate, or if a different word or phrase needs to be used.Cheers, Ace.",2021-03-06T22:28:11.369Z,"Do you first make your video or the script when making explainer videos?

Here are some of the advantages of creating an introductory video: Having an introductory video on the homepage of your website is a very effective way to explain about your business to your audience. It not only grabs audience attention but also helps you in building a connection with them. After watching your video, they would perceive your business to be more professional and trustworthy. An introductory video helps you to start a conversation with your customers and gives them a human touch. They are associated with a higher rate of website conversions. Here are some tips to create the right type of an introductory video for your website: While creating an introductory video for your website you must ensure that you have a brilliant script that explains about your company, its products, and services. Create a user persona that defines your audience age group, their profession, location and their preferences. Create a fictitious character so you know who your video is talking to. Your video should appeal to your target audience. They should understand what is being talked about and they should enjoy watching the video. Your brand video should evoke positive emotions a such as confidence and trust. You must bring out the unique proposition of your business through your video. This could be the quality of your products and services, the expertise of your team or the type and size of clients you have served or the awards you have received etc. You should keep your video short and interesting. The purpose of a video is to generate more interest and not reduce it further. So, make sure your audience is not bored and they are having fun while watching the video. You need to understand the pain points of your target audience and communicate about how you are going to solve their problems. You can create a video of up to 2 minutes but shorter is always better. You could also showcase your team and your office, to add to the trustworthiness of your services. It is important to have a Call-To-Action at the end of your video. The CTA can be used to offer them a free trial of your product or a free consultation. This would help you to collect leads for your business and you can always nurture them to get more conversions. You can also hire a professional animated video production services provider to get your website introductory video made.",2021-03-06T22:29:45.481Z,"How can I make a website intro video? ",Quora

I learned it from a professor when I was taking my acting degree. Using six consonant sounds (m, n, l, voiced th as in “they”, v, z) and adding a vowel sound after each, in a cycle (ah, eh, ee, eh, ah, oh, oo, oh, repeat), said in a continuous breath, you can cover pretty much all the bases vocally. In other words, with one continuous breath, say: mah-nah-lah-thah-vah-zah-may-nay-lay-thay-vay-zay-mee-nee-lee-thee-vee-zee-may-nay-lay-thay-vay-zay-mah-nah-lah-thah-vah-zah-moh-noh-loh-thoh-voh-zoh-moo-noo-loo-thoo-voo-zoo-moh-noh-loh-thoh-voh-zo- (repeat entire sequence) Once you learn it, you can rattle it off a few times very quickly and get your articulators ready to go in a snap.

Yes mom she is missing that small thing which all of us have. ( I was screaming in my mind) :-D :-D I am panicked why nobody has observed yet. I tug at my dad's shirt, he bends down to me. Just then I remember what mom had said me, something that the baby is prematured. My 7yr old brain figures out that she might develop that small organ as she grows up, preferably in two weeks time. I feel proud of my sheer intelligence and presence of mind.!! doubt clear!! ( it was a year before I realise that the organ is exclusive to boys!) Second one. (same as a super curious 7yr old)Often I used to rest in mom's laps and watch with her ""the saans bahu soaps""( the original star plus+ekta kapoor ones!). There I would find women with baby bumps but without a husband. That made me wonder/believe that after a fixed age women automatically became pregnant and had babies. A marriage was necessary prior to that, to find a man who would be willing to become the father. Me- Mom! (I ask innocently) why cant these girls marry at the right age. Who is going to take care of the baby?Mom(with a giggle)- You know everybody doesn't get a perfect deserving match like your father. So...I guess they are unlucky!! !!Doubt clear!! Peace.

They are actually receiving some level of an outsider's critique, if they pay enough attention.

My opinion is that a company that is eager to grow can learn these things even more effectively when they work with Epipheo. Having a highly motivated ""brand-summarizer"" like Epipheo come in and tell your story can be the equivalent of brand analysis and can be used for redirection and in-house vision casting.  As someone who has never worked for or with Epipheo, I can personally say that the most rewarding work I have ever done before involved this same process of successfully learning a brand's projected story, looking at its current story, and attempting to help reconcile the two. This is not necessarily what Epipheo promises, but anyone who works with them has the opportunity to glean these rewards through the relationship.

However, as we all know that performance is the combination of our attitudes or views to people and things and our strong feelings of love and hate based on that, although we human actors do have screenplays to refer to. It is their experience and judgement that make their acting skills. Does a robot have such a rich personal experience like a human being has and understand the instant situation changes under different circumstances to make a reaction quickly? In order to take a role, a robot has to be input a large amount of data to get trained to understand each environment and other figures involved. Of course, if our screenplays were written in a monotonous and mechanical way and can even be summarized to be a certain routine for the specific role, robots would have a strong market there since they know what they should do and would do it very efficiently. Therefore, for those roles that need creation and imagination to play well, human actors would do a better job. From their performance, we can understand further the nature of things and explore the undiscovered unknown reasons or emotions on the things that the actors are trying to express. In one word, robots would never replace true actors who can accurately grasp the the image of figures and inner psychology and successfully demonstrate their inner world. For those roles that involve less response to the constant changing environment, robots would be a better choice. Thanks for reading. Will robots ever replace human actors in films?

There are voice over actors who make a good living reading books such as those you find on Audible or librevox. Some of these folks cross over into the first group and along with books also narrative educations films, documentaries or do creative voice work. All cartoons and animations use voice-over talent. These are basically actors who, while watching the video speak the parts of the cartoon characters along side an engineer, creative directors and producers or alone in home studios. Many retired actors do are vocal talent who no longer want to work on movies or tv or for various reasons cannot do so. Or in many cases it can just be fun for them. Cartoons and animation features often want a few voices from popular celebrities so adults will be more inclined to go see the animation. Check out any popular Disney animated feature or any other animation and you will hear all kinds of famous people doing the voices of the animated characters.  Last are people who do voice-overs for educational and professional films. If you have ever had to sit through a corporate diversification in the work place video or some other kind of corp training there is often a narrator who guides you through the training. Along with this most TV commercials have voice-overs.
