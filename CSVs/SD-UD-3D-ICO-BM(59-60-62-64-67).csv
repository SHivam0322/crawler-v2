Of course, sound is powerful in making a film feel complete, but merely laying in sound effects and dialogue is not designing sound - it’s editing sound. Editing sound for a movie is in itself a demanding and skilled craft, but designing the sound is another thing altogether. A good sound designer will use all the sound components at his/her disposal to shape the sound to reflect the intent of the story in literal, psychological and emotional ways. It’s not a matter of coming up with ‘cool’ sound - as many people think - but instead, a process which looks at the movie as a whole, and deploys the many possibilities of sound to aid the director’s aim to take the audience into the world of the movie. Sometimes - often - you won’t even notice good sound design, because it’s achieved its purpose without taking you out of the moment. Just like the photographic look of the film, or the sets, or the costumes, or makeup, sound works best if it’s a properly designed and truly integral part of the process. A good director will always place great importance on sound design. How important is sound design in films? Good sound design can add dimensions to a movie that are not possible in any other way.

From what I've realized, it's half analytical and half artistic creativity. You have a sound in your head you're trying to replicate with a synth. So ask yourself questions.. does this sound have lucious character? If so, crank up the number of voices. Does this sound need to be plucky? Create an ADSR that would create that characteristic to a low pass filter. Does this sound feel up front or distant in the mix? Automate reverb. I find this strategy to work well for when I create my own sounds. What is it that I need it to do? What roll in the mix is this sound fulfilling? And try to answer those questions logically with what your synth has to offer you. Watch a lot of YouTube videos. Some great channels show how to recreate sounds from popular tracks. But don't just copy those sounds. Watch how that person gets that sound and analyze what each parameter is effecting so you can use that knowledge to answer your own questions about what you want YOUR sound to do. A big thing to creating interesting sounds, and ultimately songs, is to use the macro controls most synths offer. Make the sounds build and automate throughout to keep the listener intrigued. It's not hard. Automate effects, voicing, filters, you name it. No rules. Just remember to have fun and keep learning the best you can, and like anything else, you'll get better and better at it. I'd recommend sticking to one or 2 powerful synths and learn them inside and out. You don't need to use more than one or 2 to creat countless different kinds of sounds.

But it cannot ‘anchor’ itself to a spot like its UNSC ‘equivalent’ M808 MBT. E.g on a steep hill. Its main armament it’s a heavy plasma mortar (HPM). As the name suggests, it has a curving arc allowing it to strike enemy vehicles on their top armour as opposed to their front armour. The firing arc also allows the T26 to hit targets behind cover, adding a psychological effect that there is nowhere safe from it. This allows the T26 to be used as a mobile artillery gun operated from the frontlines, behind cover, or further back from the lines. The HPM is fitted to the chassis as opposed to a rotating turret, this increases the HPM’s size but means the T26 must face the direction of engagement. As the HPM is mortar in nature, it’s Plasma speed is relatively slow, allowing fast and nimble enemies to evade its fire, however as the mortar is plasma in munition, it devastates a large area when it hits the ground. Depending on the year, the T26 came with dual plasma cannons for limited anti infantry/anti light vehicle defence, with it later having added a secondary plasma turret for increased defence. All defences are mounted on the front off the T26. The T26 has a slow speed due to its weight. With a GPM that does not stop quickly makes the T26 prone to accidentally ‘running’ over friendly foot soldiers, and occasionally of a high distance either killing the crew or injuring them. As all defences are mounted on the fore of the T26, it’s aft becomes succeptable to enemy fire, risking one of the few weaknesses on the T26 (an exhaust point) to damage and detonation, destroying the T26. Depending on the area of operations, terrain involved, enemy faced, the T26 shows that it is a devastating opponent with a sound design, but is relatively exposed to enemy fire. This all meant that the T26 was susceptible to ambush and performed lower than standards in locations with high surroundings, for e.g ravines, deep river beds, etc. As a result, the T26 was fielded with a ground force to protect it from such weaknesses rather than travelling as a single convoy.",2021-03-06T11:57:26.789Z,"Is the Covenant Wraith a soundly designed military vehicle?

Sometimes though, they are out and about in the most unusual places, recording just about any sound they think they might need for a particular project. The soundtrack of a motion picture is comprised of several elements: DialogueMusic/ScoreFoleySound FXAmbianceYou know what music and dialogue are, right? Foley is the recording of all the very familiar sounds. Characters interactions with objects (tables, doors, keys, clothes, etc, etc), footsteps (in many different surfaces), those sorts of things. All of these are recorded by people in a special recording studio, prepared with many materials. They have a screen where a scene is projected, and they record sounds to match exactly what they are watching. The people who do this are called Foley Artists. Back in the early days of cinema, the foley artists made all the sound effects for a movie (Radio theater, also very popular at the time, was made in pretty much the same way). I'm not an expert in film history, so I'm not quite sure at which point sound designers started to branch out from foley artists, but I'd be inclined to say that it was sometime in the late 60s or early 70s. Anyway, back to what I do know for sure.Sound designers create the sound effects and the ambiance for a movie. To do this, they resort to using library sound recordings and/or recording their own sounds. In the studio they can then manipulate these sounds to change them into something new, if the job calls for it. In science fiction and fantasy movies, they are responsible for creating the sounds of creatures/machines/devices/phenomenon that don't exist. The tools sound designers use, are the same ones used to record albums: Audio signal processing. These days it's all mostly done digitally (i.e: with a computer). The task of a sound designer is comparable to that of a cinematographer: Help tell the story. Help shape a believable reality in which the characters will interact.What they do is far more of an artistic endeavor than a technical one. A good sound designer can bring so much to a movie. Here are some wonderful sound designers who have done great work: Ben Burtt (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Wall-E)Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now, The Godfather: Part II, THX 1138)Gary Rydstrom (Jurassic Park, Toy Story, A.I.

When cooking food, the stuff you put in your specific recipe can be compared to sound design. When you are preparing a pizza, you select the bread base, toppings, sauces, cheese etc... Similarly, sound design is like deciding the audio content of music piece or some visual situation. What instruments/sounds/audio elements you would like to select is sound design. Sometimes it is more of a selection. You don't select contradictory elements. In a Indian folk song, you don't add electric guitar or drums. The examples I gave are simple but in a movie, role of sound designer is complex. It is more of selection of audio elements in visual situations which exactly explain the situation or help in giving more feel to the video content. Sound design, in my opinion is 60% art and 40% technical. Sound engineering on the other hand can be compared to how the dish is prepared, garnishing and serving the dish. Like in a restaurant. Sound engineering is no doubt artistic but is more of technical nature. In a typical recording studio it involves ways of recording sound, analyzing the frequency bands of sounds involved, tracking, mixing and finally mastering. For live sound, analyzing the reflectivity of surroundings, preparing for the live show, mounting the speakers, microphones, understanding the frequency response of the sounds on stage and operating the mixing console, balancing accordingly etc… are the activities of sound engineer. Sound engineering is how you prepare final presentable content. Hope this helps. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T12:00:26.752Z,"How is sound designing different from sound engineering? ",Quora

Rhoda can possibly make you crazy with the piano in this scene!  Carnival of Souls, 1962. Playing the devils music in a House of worship. The organ scene.

They might not use your work on the first project, but who knows. Step 2b. You can also offer your work for freelancers to use on games / movies. There are a lot of websites for stock special effects, but if you really want games, just pack your sound effects nicely and put them on the Unity Asset Store — go check it out and see your ‘competition’, if you think you can do better, just do it. Note: when it comes to audio packs, make sure you make it complete, a complete package that is not amazing is better then 3–4 amazing sound effects. Think of a theme (space ship sound effects, western cowboy sound effects, world war 1 audio pack etc.) and make the minimum number of effects needed to complete this: 5x different ‘fire’ sounds, 3x different explosions, various character sounds, various ambient / environment sounds etc. Step 3. Put together a nice CV / Linked-in page / personal webpage. Reviews are really important to get work, so that’s why Step 2 is important. Also, if you are up for it, we are building a demo for a new game / VR experience. We don’t need custom sound for it, but I can guide you on what would a games studio is look for from an audio pack.

I work with “reality” I try to make my loudspeakers be as faithful as possible reproducing sounds that are as close as possible to the original sound. Sound synthesis is not really my field, although I am learning about Wave field synthesis (WFS) a spatial audio rendering technique, characterized by creation of virtual acoustic environments. It produces ""artificial"" wave fronts synthesized by a large number of individually driven speakers. Wave fronts that originate from a virtual starting point, the virtual source or notional source. Contrary to traditional spatialization techniques such as stereo or surround sound, the localization of virtual sources in WFS does not depend on or change with the listener's position.  WFS is based on the Huygens–Fresnel principle, which states that any wave front can be regarded as a superposition of elementary spherical waves. Therefore, any wave front can be synthesized from such elementary waves. In practice, a computer controls a large array of individual loudspeakers and actuates each one at exactly the time when the desired virtual wave front would pass through it. The basic procedure was developed in 1988 by Professor A.J. Berkhout at the Delft University of Technology. Its mathematical basis is the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral. It states that the sound pressure is completely determined within a volume free of sources, if sound pressure and velocity are determined in all points on its surface.Therefore, any sound field can be reconstructed, if sound pressure and acoustic velocity are restored on all points of the surface of its volume. This approach is the underlying principle of holophony. But this is not really what you are looking for. Therefore I posted a series of links above that may help you with your learning. Hope it helps. Maybe someone who produces music may give you better sources, or maybe the ones I posted are good enough for you. You just have to check them out for yourself.

Yes, they are old fashioned and if they were more experienced with a computer, some things would be faster and easier, but their techniques and ideas will teach you a lot about how and why they are great at sound design: Spend a lot of time practising and experimenting with sound, recording it, editing it, processing it with pitch shifting software, effects, time stretching, equalisation and other tools to see what it does. Explore what happens when you layer sounds together, like cooking a delicious dish, different ingredients make it interesting and exciting. Coconut milk in the potatoes? Wow! Spicy pepper in the chocolate sauce? Who knew!Be aware of and use the many resources out there and use them. There are great websites for buying and downloading sounds for feee when you need the sound of a hard to get object or very specific thing. Same goes for powerful sound manipulation software. Start by playing with what you have on your computer now in Garage Band or Audacity or whatever and then register with companies like Waves so that when they have a 70% off sale you can get some great essential tools like equalisers and pitch shifters.Get some videos and delete the soundtrack and try doing sound design for them, then compare with the original. What happens when you use a truck door slam instead of or layered with a gunshot sound effect? Try different things. Of course creativity is important because sound design isn’t just about making something sound realistic, it’s about telling a story and creation emotion.Start developing a good sound effects library, a combination of sounds you downloaded and ones you’ve created yourself and things you’ve recorded. And if you don’t have a mobile recorder, get a Zoom at least so you can capture interesting things out there.When you’re going about your day, listen to the sound everything makes. When there seems to be no sound, listen to what is left, air conditioners, room tone, ambiences, the air. Unless your in space or a very dampened recording studio, there is always sound.

Recognizing that a) the sound of the engine is an important part of the thrill of driving a sporty car, and b) engines are getting quieter all the time as they grow in refinement and are required to meet more rigorous environmental standards, car makers are taking various steps to “enhance” the (disappearing) growl of a big engine. Some makers try to enhance the driver’s acoustical experience by actually channeling more engine sound directly into the cabin using a tube (with a filter to keep out fumes!), while others use microphones to send the engine sound to the car’s audio system. Higher end models sometimes pair engine sound enhancement with non-engine sound masking, using the same technology that one finds in noise-canceling headphones, canceling out lower-frequency road noise with inverted sound signatures. I’ve even heard of manufacturers adding a gizmo that rattles the windshield a bit when the revs get high. Finally, there are some makers who simply use recorded engine noises, substituting a V-12’s voice for the native V-6. In most cases, the technology is sophisticated enough to enable the “sound symphony” to respond to all kinds of scenarios — high revs, peeling out from a stationary start, pushing the transmission hard as you’re about to change gears, downshifting at speed, and so on. Some people hate the inauthenticity of the experience, while others (perhaps initially skeptical) give it a try, find their pulse quickening, and say “yes please.” 1",2021-03-06T12:12:40.503Z,"What is active sound design?

Sometimes though, they are out and about in the most unusual places, recording just about any sound they think they might need for a particular project. The soundtrack of a motion picture is comprised of several elements: DialogueMusic/ScoreFoleySound FXAmbianceYou know what music and dialogue are, right? Foley is the recording of all the very familiar sounds. Characters interactions with objects (tables, doors, keys, clothes, etc, etc), footsteps (in many different surfaces), those sorts of things. All of these are recorded by people in a special recording studio, prepared with many materials. They have a screen where a scene is projected, and they record sounds to match exactly what they are watching. The people who do this are called Foley Artists. Back in the early days of cinema, the foley artists made all the sound effects for a movie (Radio theater, also very popular at the time, was made in pretty much the same way). I'm not an expert in film history, so I'm not quite sure at which point sound designers started to branch out from foley artists, but I'd be inclined to say that it was sometime in the late 60s or early 70s. Anyway, back to what I do know for sure.Sound designers create the sound effects and the ambiance for a movie. To do this, they resort to using library sound recordings and/or recording their own sounds. In the studio they can then manipulate these sounds to change them into something new, if the job calls for it. In science fiction and fantasy movies, they are responsible for creating the sounds of creatures/machines/devices/phenomenon that don't exist. The tools sound designers use, are the same ones used to record albums: Audio signal processing. These days it's all mostly done digitally (i.e: with a computer). The task of a sound designer is comparable to that of a cinematographer: Help tell the story. Help shape a believable reality in which the characters will interact.What they do is far more of an artistic endeavor than a technical one. A good sound designer can bring so much to a movie. Here are some wonderful sound designers who have done great work: Ben Burtt (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Wall-E)Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now, The Godfather: Part II, THX 1138)Gary Rydstrom (Jurassic Park, Toy Story, A.I. Artificial Intelligence)Randy Thom (Forrest Gump, Cast Away, The Incredibles)Christpher Boyes (Con Air, Titanic, Iron Man)Tom Myers (Up, Toy Story 3, ParaNorman)Richard Beggs (Lost In Translation, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Askaban, Children of Men)Ren Klyce (Se7ven, Zodiac, The Social Network)",2021-03-06T12:15:06.910Z,"What types of sound design are there?

I hate to be so general , but I think the overall moviegoing public (at least as far as those who have no theoretical or practical understanding of the process of making a movie) takes a lot for granted when watching a movie, whether or not the film is good. In my opinion, it may be easy to overlook because it takes more to make a aural world distinct. Even in the most outlandish environment, there are common sounds. Whereas, the set design, cinematography and sometimes direction makes those environments particularly auspicious. In other words, even in the most domestic settings (let's say a comedy like ""Along Came Polly""), because people hear footsteps or vehicles, birds and other environmental sounds every day of their lives, it's easy for people at large to gloss over the fact that the majority of the sounds they hear in a film are added after the film is shot.

The gaps have historically been clearly reduced, but the lines have recently been blurred. Let us continue by looking at the conventional scenario in the debate on Film Scoring and Sound Design. In other words, the bare bones of the composition versus sound architecture. Sound Design Audio or sound design simply involves all electronically made sounds. That might be stuff like the sounds of voices, the slamming of doors, lights that were flickered in a studio, and dubbed into a movie in its most simplistic form. If the bulk of the sound you hear on the film is added later, not captured at the site if you didn't already know. The dialogue is most sometimes captured and dubbed in a studio. In a more imaginative way, the creation of new sounds for conditions that do not exist in the real world would be the sound design. Sound designers are innovative, inventive solvers of problems. The challenge they face is to make a scene credible while retaining film theatrics and dramas. Have you ever seen a first street struggle? If it is the case, you know that in real life a ""punch"" sound is hardly audible. However, if anyone got a punch you would be extremely underwhelmed if you saw an on-screen scuffle of only soft thuds. The sound designer must then produce digitally a sound that will satisfy the senses while staying normal. You either discover a sound to capture or process a current noise inventively. Film Scoring The song is composed, of course. That was historically tools, especially the orchestra. But the addition of synthesis, samples, and audio processing changes everything in modern cinema. Although the orchestral score is the standard basis of film soundtracks, composers incorporated or totally removed the orchestra in the last few decades, using artificial sound and samples (Hans Zimmer). In addition to the electronic effects, the trend is also non-traditional. And several composers invented new instruments! Like a sound artist, tapping, striking, and bowing stuff will play with those sonorities.",2021-03-06T12:38:58.922Z,"What movie has your favorite sound design from the 1960s? ",Quora

From a more basically practical perspective, sound can be used to shape scene transitions[1]and to set pacing and rhythm within a scene. Cinema has often been described as a “visual medium” but it is in fact far more than that: it is a complex interplay between visual and aural elements that interact to create a complex and impactful experience. If we become too regimented in our thinking, and always demand that sound follow picture, we will miss out on vast array of (often untapped) possibilities open to the cinematic storyteller. While working with sound and music is not strictly required to be a picture editor, I think it is well worth the extra effort both to share your ideas and creativity with your collaborators but also to discover where sound can lead you as a picture editor. David Lynch has said, “Every time I hear sound, I see pictures. Then I start getting ideas.” And Lynch’s films are arguably among the most visually inventive works in the history of film. To me the question comes down to this: sound is an immensely powerful component of filmmaking and as a picture editor it is a part of your toolkit. It is up to you whether you want to use it or not, but be aware of all you are giving up if you chose to ignore it.

If so, the importance of having good acoustics engineering included from the start of the project designing a new performance space instead of a ‘corrective’ measure after the space is built can be shown with a few simple anecdotes. The Carnegie Hall HAS to be a part of any such discussion. At one point, the acoustics of the space were so horrible; orchestras and performers would refuse to perform in it. It’s difficult enough when there are places in the audience seating where phase interference occurs and the performance cannot be heard… but in spaces where the acoustics are really poor, these dead spots can exist in the middle of the performing area as well. Imagine trying to play your part in a symphony and not being able to hear half of the other instruments. We often point out that the Greeks understood this issue… the Greek amphitheaters were designed to ensure that the performers could be heard through a seating area that held as many as ten thousand, without amplification, and with the understanding that audiences were drinking, talking and celebrating throughout the event. Are you referring to sound reinforcement? One responsibility of a different type o Sound Designer (and the Live Mix Engineer) is reinforcement.. taking the natural sounds of a performance and using technology and acoustic knowledge to ensure that everything is heard by all audiences. That includes amplification of instruments, microphones for voices all piped through processing and mixed in such a way that the most important elements are best heard. It also includes less obvious things like transmission of the audio aspects of a performance to assistive listening systems, to aid those with hearing challenges… and to audio description systems, for those who cannot see. Are you referring to the Sound Designer who is part of the creative team for a play production? This position ranges over a huge scope from production to production. One show, a Sound Designer may simply be responsible for providing a couple sound effects. Of course, even this can be important… the wrong type of door buzzer can destroy authenticity of a period piece, disrupt the seriousness of a key moment of play with an overly comedic effect, or break the immersion of the moment when the sound of the door opening ‘seems’ to come from a speaker on the wall more than forty feet from the physical location of the door. But a production’s Sound Designer is also typically responsible for choosing the genre and stylistic quality of music used to take the audience in and out of scenes, to fill the breaks between scenes as set pieces are moved around, and to establish or maintain the mood during the pre-show and intermission periods. It can even extend to the more complex use of music or soundscape under the dialogue of moments (or large portions) of a play. After all, as audiences become more familiar with this sort of sound support in film and television; its lack during stage performances becomes more obvious. Sometimes that requires going outside what’s available in recordings… and composing/recording something original for a production. And let’s be honest… who among us hasn’t created the perfect ‘road trip’ mix tape? Or the mix tape telling that object of our affection just how much we care for them? We pick music to calm us down when we can’t sleep, we pick music to drive our pace when we work out, we play our ‘favorites’ when we celebrate, we sing hymns when we worship… few of us can say that music and our emotions are not entwined in at least some fashion. Being a Sound Designer is about recognizing that, and using sound and music to draw out those emotions as you engage and immerse yourself in the words of the play. And if you think THAT isn’t important, tell me that these words originally describing a sort of sound design don’t change your mind: “bow chicka bow wow.” Oh, there’s also that Sound Designer who creates ‘sounds’: Probably not the one you’re referring to here, but just to compound how much overlap and confusion there is on what a “Sound Designer” is… it’s also the term that we use for the people who combine a basic wave form with modulation, harmonics, echo and decay, and release rates to form a unique ‘sound’ used as a patch for a keyboard/synthesizer. Finding just the right qualities might once have been a matter of finding the right instrument and a musician with lots of skill and a unique acoustic environment… but now, it can be a matter of patching your guitar through a specific combination of pedals or a keyboard through a computer with software designed to manipulate every aspect of each note from attack to release and everything in between. And ALL of these are important. Why? Well, if they have done their job right; you might not even be consciously aware of what they’ve done. They’ll have helped you engage in the other aspects of the performance. But you’ll certainly know if they get it wrong; whether that’s a dead spot where you can’t hear the show, a bad mix where you can’t understand lyrics, the wrong genre pick where every song clashes with the message of the script, or an annoying click in the middle of every note.

The best way to do this is go to a lot of live music - not bars and clubs, but sit-down concerts. You would do well to start with Classical because it represents hundreds of years of musical history, and connects to 40,000 years of musical evolution. Acoustic sound design (composition and orchestration) is more stringent, subtle and has more memorable impact than just twiddling knobs. The music following the Age of Exploration is remarkable because the European explorers gathered music from around the world. “World Music” was not a new trend in the 20th Century, it started in the 15th Century. The aristocracy not only supported a professional class of musicians and composers to create this new world wide synthesis, they also took music lessons so they were the best educated music audience in history. They played and wrote on a professional level throughout this golden age of sound design, from Alfonso X of Spain and the Troubadors of Aquitania to Frederick the Great of Prussia. We have new sounds and musical organization possible today, but most of it is novelty for novelties’ sake. The last hundred years of music technology does not change our genes enough to create significantly new or deep feelings from the infinite number of electronically possible sounds. For example, we still develop special parts of our brains for decoding melody, harmony and rhythm. This is so deep that we can easily tell the difference between real metallophones (struck metal instruments) and recorded or synthesized versions. We can also easily hear the difference between radical scales and irrational timbres and random frequencies (stochastic noise). Sound design as merely sounds can range from ignorable background to annoying background, but it takes narrative or descriptive content to make a real foreground impact. Even when the sound is intended as soundtrack, meaningful sonic content through melody, harmony and rhythm enhances all artistic forms supported by music like plays, movies, TV, video games and poetry (Rap). This elevates the audio/visual content to a duet, instead of relegating the sound to “backup”. Next you need to learn the interaction of sound, acoustic spaces and psycho-acoustics. Unless your audiences all wear headphones (I attended a play in a 600 seat theater where they supplied headphones and jacks to every seat), this is critical. Acoustics are “the last mile” for your deliverables.

Sometimes though, they are out and about in the most unusual places, recording just about any sound they think they might need for a particular project. The soundtrack of a motion picture is comprised of several elements: DialogueMusic/ScoreFoleySound FXAmbianceYou know what music and dialogue are, right? Foley is the recording of all the very familiar sounds. Characters interactions with objects (tables, doors, keys, clothes, etc, etc), footsteps (in many different surfaces), those sorts of things. All of these are recorded by people in a special recording studio, prepared with many materials. They have a screen where a scene is projected, and they record sounds to match exactly what they are watching. The people who do this are called Foley Artists. Back in the early days of cinema, the foley artists made all the sound effects for a movie (Radio theater, also very popular at the time, was made in pretty much the same way). I'm not an expert in film history, so I'm not quite sure at which point sound designers started to branch out from foley artists, but I'd be inclined to say that it was sometime in the late 60s or early 70s. Anyway, back to what I do know for sure.Sound designers create the sound effects and the ambiance for a movie. To do this, they resort to using library sound recordings and/or recording their own sounds. In the studio they can then manipulate these sounds to change them into something new, if the job calls for it. In science fiction and fantasy movies, they are responsible for creating the sounds of creatures/machines/devices/phenomenon that don't exist. The tools sound designers use, are the same ones used to record albums: Audio signal processing. These days it's all mostly done digitally (i.e: with a computer). The task of a sound designer is comparable to that of a cinematographer: Help tell the story. Help shape a believable reality in which the characters will interact.What they do is far more of an artistic endeavor than a technical one. A good sound designer can bring so much to a movie. Here are some wonderful sound designers who have done great work: Ben Burtt (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Wall-E)Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now, The Godfather: Part II, THX 1138)Gary Rydstrom (Jurassic Park, Toy Story, A.I. Artificial Intelligence)Randy Thom (Forrest Gump, Cast Away, The Incredibles)Christpher Boyes (Con Air, Titanic, Iron Man)Tom Myers (Up, Toy Story 3, ParaNorman)Richard Beggs (Lost In Translation, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Askaban, Children of Men)Ren Klyce (Se7ven, Zodiac, The Social Network)",2021-03-06T12:50:12.757Z,"What do sound designers do?

I’m in Seattle and make around 200K + bens, as a Principal Engineer focused on Unity. I don’t think I’ve made below 100K salaried while working on Unity. But this is not typical as I use Unity for business applications. Game companies notoriously expect long hours, offer little pay and poor benefits. People will fight tooth and nail to get these high stress low reward positions. Most start out under the mistaken impression, that developing games is fun. Don’t get me wrong, it can be fun. The culture usually tries to make up for when it isn’t. But the things that make it fun, are typically duplicatable in business environments. That greatly depends on your company, product and team, which is why you are supposed to be interviewing them as much as they interview you. Business developers tend to make a lot more by default. A full stack junior dev could reasonably make 30/hr starting out, while a junior game dev would be hard pressed to get over minimum 20/hr. The Zero I posted, relates to indie developers. Groups that randomly assemble to develop a game for fun, or for money (or both). MOST are not successful, but in almost all cases, you still learn valuable content. In some cases, you actually develop something cool and earn a lot, but very rare. There is a separate concern. If you don’t have a lot of motivation, your career will do very little, you will not make the wages you want. If you are passionate, and constantly expanding, as well as understand when to move on, and when to ask for more, they sky is the limit. For me to get where I am, it took no college, but nearly 20 years for 40 hour weeks for work, plus another 20–40 at home. Its who I am. I do this because I love it.

The problem has been around for years, it was reported, and even though this is something that could be fixed in under half of an hour, Microsoft has never addressed it. This little shit of a glitch is the main reason why I have been using monodevelop prior to switching to VSCode. MonoDevelop is what I would call the buggiest IDE in existence, and to the date it remains the only editor I know where Copy/Paste could glitch out. However, unlike Visual Studio, monodevelop did not have this bug, and in case it goes bonkers, you could just kill it and restart it in a blink of an eye. However, unity technologies deprecated monodevelop, so that rather than using Visual Studio I switched to VSCode. I’m not a fan of VSCode either, as I find the fact taht this thing was written with JavaScript/TypeScript and probably wastes ton of resources irritating. However. It does work for programming in unity. Nevertheless, there are shortcomings. VSCode tries to auto compile your source whenever you made a change. There’s no “build” button. Well, maybe there is one but I’ve not found it yet. This behavior wastes your time, as in monodevelop you could slam F7, it would save EVERY file and then you’d get your list of compile errors. In VSCode at the moment you’d need to go through every file and save them manually before jumping back to unity. (Speaking of which there’s probably a “save all files hotkey” somewhere…)VSCode at the moment is unable to properly process the situation where you add new file to unity project through VSCode. If you add a file through VSCode, it will fail to see the rest of the unity project, until you shut down the editor, and restart it by double-clicking the file in unity project.Both of those are annoying. However, those issues are less annoying than dealing with space glitch in Visual Studio. Have fun. At the moment I’m using VSCode for unity code, even though I’m not entirely happy with it.

I’m not a traditional game developer, but I have been paid to do Unity VR programs, so let’s go! I actually have been a speaker at the Game Developer’s convention on 3D engines … a long time back. I got sucked into the proverbial “Job you can’t refuse”. It was a C++ development job, but wasn’t a ‘game’ in the traditional sense. So I’m uniquely qualified to answer this question, having professional experience in both worlds. Over the years, that company got bigger and bigger and I started to supervise Oracle DBA’s because who else was technical enough to understand them? Long story short - I did a lot of ERP software installation; JD Edwards, Oracle EBusiness Suite. A LOT of Java and PL/SQL software development. It’s crappy software. People just throw big servers at the problem, especially for data conversion. Developers often don’t understand computer science basics like queues, or any other multi-threaded software features. Heck, I’d be happy if they understood exception processing. Game development on the other hand, as Konrad Krupa mentions, HAS to be tight, efficient, and effective. He also mentions math. The owner of the company I went to once went off about how stupid it was that they taught higher order math in College, because “you forget all that stuff anyway”. In a completely unnoticed piece of incredible irony, that afternoon I had to use some math to figure out hosting costs and square footage of servers, and explain why the actual costs were double what she thought. (It’s related to cooling efficiency per square foot and expected server capacity). One other thing that is VERY frustrating about both #Unity and #Unreal - you get to do what the game engine decides you can do. I had a client refuse to pay a bill because they didn’t understand you can’t just animate a camera in Unreal. (It’s a player … an entire software component stack, not just a camera like in Nuke). You’ll run into this constantly. To be fair, in ‘regular’ programming you may be constrained by certain libraries you are using (don’t ask me about IBM’s Loopback), but in general you are in charge of what your code does. With a game engine, you merely create ‘scenes’ and the engine decides what happens. It’s up to you to bend your app to suit the game engine’s assumptions. This can make for very frustrating development. In fact, I finally paid for a Udemy course on Unity a couple of years back, just because the docs weren’t always clear. With conventional source code, you can do text searches for various API’s, variables, and the like. With a game engine, you’re using an app to develop your game, not pure code. How do you search a workbench for a feature? You can’t. Sure, you can google around, but frankly a lot of the hits are usually useless. So, there can be a learning curve with a game engine. I’ve found that Unreal, more than Unity, is more “like a game”. I was doing an art project for a “Large Nevada Desert Festival” and we were animating things. Even though it was a display with various controllers that interacted with things on the screen, I had to develop the concept of “Players”. With Unity, I could have simply connected controllers to objects, but with Unreal it was more ‘player’ related and the controllers had to be attached to ‘players’. Made it slightly more complex. If you aren’t designing a game, get used to game technology. You’ve got a level and players, even if it’s a data visualization app with a CEO and CFO. By the way - I mentioned that PL/SQL developers frequently aren’t that good. It pays almost double what game development pays. Supply and demand I guess. Everyone thinks they can develop a game. Game developers also rightly look at ERP developers with disdain; this has kept me from getting employed in Virtual Reality, even though “I wrote the (a) book”. Too much business software on my resume, even though when I was first applying to positions, NO ONE had VR experience as it was just too new.",2021-03-06T13:00:27.411Z,"How is a Unity developer job different from usual programming jobs?

But don’t imagine for a minute that it’ll give you an advantage in the job market. I don’t mean to discourage you from taking the cert if you want to learn, but this bears some explaining anyhow for when you want to go a step beyond and try to do professional work. At the very, very least, you deserve to know where the cert sits along the path to being a capable game-maker. And that’s a space that’s very, very early on the board. Unity has a massive array of learning resources and tutorials available. Anybody can teach themselves proficiency in Unity, to the point that the certification is almost laughable in its basic concept. The problem is that the cert covers barebones basics of a couple of weeks of training, nothing that’d set you apart from a college grad that had a couple of classes with it or any of the hundreds of self-taught hobbyists. Furthermore, nobody in the professional world of any commercially available engine uses a completely vanilla implementation of that engine, and therefore nobody cares if you know the basics of the editor. There’s much more pertinent information to your hireability that isn’t covered, even by their advanced test. As an artist, I want to see good art. Doesn’t matter what engine, give me good art, show me a style that’s compatible with the studio I’m working with and the project we’d be hiring you on. Learning to import assets into Unity is so blitheringly easy that I’d give no preference to the cert or even prior Unity experience. I’d want to see a good portfolio above all else. The cert is irrelevant. As a designer, I’d want to see fun games or levels. Maybe the skills you’d develop with the Unity cert would get you a start towards making these kinds of things, but basically the cert itself doesn’t matter half as much as the quality and polish of your portfolio material. In this regard, you’d need to have had experience that was already well beyond just the topics in the cert and Unity’s example projects. I’d put some weight on a design test to see what you could develop in a short period of time. As a programmer, I’d want to see that you could define a custom workflow for a game project that enabled design productivity. Failing that, major factors for potential hirees I’ve looked at have been familiarity with certain asset store frameworks, Scaleform, or console dev kits. These kinds of things denote real experience developing a working game, which is a much better qualifier and a much better way to learn how to use Unity.",2021-03-06T13:01:27.237Z,"What work exposure you can get being a Unity developer?

Most start out under the mistaken impression, that developing games is fun. Don’t get me wrong, it can be fun. The culture usually tries to make up for when it isn’t. But the things that make it fun, are typically duplicatable in business environments. That greatly depends on your company, product and team, which is why you are supposed to be interviewing them as much as they interview you. Business developers tend to make a lot more by default. A full stack junior dev could reasonably make 30/hr starting out, while a junior game dev would be hard pressed to get over minimum 20/hr. The Zero I posted, relates to indie developers. Groups that randomly assemble to develop a game for fun, or for money (or both). MOST are not successful, but in almost all cases, you still learn valuable content. In some cases, you actually develop something cool and earn a lot, but very rare. There is a separate concern. If you don’t have a lot of motivation, your career will do very little, you will not make the wages you want. If you are passionate, and constantly expanding, as well as understand when to move on, and when to ask for more, they sky is the limit. For me to get where I am, it took no college, but nearly 20 years for 40 hour weeks for work, plus another 20–40 at home. Its who I am. I do this because I love it.

(AR, VR, XR Development)Animation and Film Industry.Architecture Engineering and Construction.Mobile Application developmentMachine Learning Simulation. (Reinforcement learning)Check this out for reference: Unity - Unity As the experience increases for a Unity developer, it’s important or feasible to delve into different career paths. These are few career paths, I’ve observed people evolving over the years. Unity developer -> C++ (Unreal Engine)-> AAA games-> PS4, Xbox, Nitendo switch. Unity Developer (C#) <-> Dot net developer (I’ve seen people shuffling here and there) Unity Developer-> Shader programming-> ShaderLab, Visual scripting -> HLSL -> Tech Art. Unity Developer <-> Network Programmer <-> Multiplayer Game <-> Server side/ Backend Programmer. Unity Developer -> Graphics programmer -> OpenGl, DirectX Unity Developer -> Xr/Vr/Ar/ Mr Developer (Hot and trending) I’ve also observed people jumping into Game designing from Unity developer. So, to answer your question a Unity Developer can fit into any of the above mentioned career paths and as the Industry grows there will be more opportunities created. I’m programming in Unity since many years and I love it, there is huge community for support on the net for help, I’ve also learned C++, HLSL, Python, Dotnet. Its more like passion for me and I still find many things to explore. Coming to the financial angle of the career, I would say it is not as lucrative and demanding when compared to other career paths: for ex .net, Android, Ios, , ML developers etc. Again this depends on the level of expertise, experts are always paid well and will be in demand. Finally, As this is a very fast paced world, it will not suffice only to learn unity, Its important to learn other systems, which work with Unity.

The answer is yes, we’re aware of the other engines: Unreal, Godot, CryEngine, Amazon Lumberyard. We’re keeping an eye on them as each of them is progressing. However, they all have drawbacks that are crucial for our business. Check out the other engines pros & cons in our full article plus much more about innovative technologies we use. Now let's compare Unity and Godot! Godot Godot is a free and open-source 3D/2D game engine which evolves really quickly. It already supports 2D and 3D, has a convenient editor which can compete with the Unity editor, supports the physically-based rendering, etc. Godot is literally breathing down the Unity’s neck. However, Godot still has flaws as it is: Not as mature as Unity. It has fewer features and they are not as advanced as Unity’s ones.Open-source and doesn’t have a public company supporting it. In case of problems, there’s a risk that we’ll need to get into the engine code and fix the bugs ourselves.Not officially supported by VR and AR platforms, as well as by lots of other 3rd party tools.Having its Asset Store with less premade tools and assets compared to Unity, resulting in less development speed.Unity Unity is the 3D engine that we currently use for interactive apps, game development, VR and AR apps in 90% of cases. Why Unity? Why don’t we just make a native iOS, Android or Windows app, etc.? Here’s the answer: MultiplatformWe can create an app once and publish it for any of the platforms we need. With a “native” approach we would have to code separately for each platform thus increasing the cost and timeline drastically. ToolkitUnity has the most advanced and convenient tools on the market for both 3D and 2D graphics, animation, effects, etc. Also, it has a high-quality rendering. It lets us concentrate on designing and developing the best possible user experience instead of building low-level tools for graphics and animation. Which results in cost and time reduction. There are other benefits, as Unity is: The most supported 3D engine by the 3rd party frameworks and platforms, including Vuforia.The best and the most convenient for 2D and mobile games. It was initially designed with mobile games in mind. It’s well-optimized for mobile platforms and supports even pretty old smartphones.Non-running for the share of your revenue. We just pay a monthly subscription of $125 per seat for the Pro version. This is very reasonable, compared to how it reduces the development effort, time and cost.Easier to learn, since it uses C# as a scripting language (for example, Unreal uses C++ which is more complex). Also, the good thing about Unity is that it encourages the best practices among developers, by introducing the advanced programming concepts like ECS and making those concepts as easy to use as possible. It constantly cares about the simplicity of the engine, combined with top performance. All that helps to complete Unity projects with smaller teams and less development time.Of the same graphics level compared to Unreal, starting from the 2018.1 version due to the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) or custom render pipelines. Having technical artists with corresponding expertise, we are sure to deliver AAA graphics in Unity within a reasonable amount of time and effort.Packed with multiplayer. Although in Unity we mostly use 3rd-party tools for it, like Photon, Gamesparks or PlayFab.Overall, Unity is the best choice for an interactive app, game, and VR/AR development, as: It is the most universal engine.All the third-party tools support it.There’s a large Asset Store with a lot of premade assets and scripts.We are sure that with Unity we can complete any feature requests, even during development.",2021-03-06T13:10:18.834Z,"What are the benefits of being a Unity developer?

You don’t try to lose yourself entirely, doing full sensory replacement for visual, audio (and maybe even tactile) inputs while wandering, or even stationary out in public. The whole concept is ridiculous. AR is a digital layer meshing with what is really going on around you. It could be for entertainment, for information, or for assistance in completing a task. VR is for interacting with a virtual (or possibly remote) environment. Visit somewhere real you cannot (easily) get to. Visit somewhere made up. Participate in scenarios that are too dangerous or too expensive to test in reality. Each technology is offering something different. The only thing tipping the scales further towards “AR” being a definitive yes answer, is that it is entirely plausible that the hardware and software used for AR could go from a layer over actual reality, to blocking out that input and replacing it. Such as AR glasses that can “black out” entirely so you ONLY see the digital input. That makes it function like VR displays.

It’s not a title one assigns to themselves, though we may all be great in our own ways. Are you talented enough and able to execute on your ideas and complete code/projects in reasonable time? That definitely defines you a good developer. Did your project/game garner thousands of views/plays/purchases? Suddenly everyone views you as great despite the fact that there are so many factors that decide whether your project hits/misses. PS. You still have to be a good developer first to be be considered a great one, by that I mean, if you steal some assets or just do an asset flip game, no one will consider you great no matter how much money you make. I only ever got complimented at being an amazing developer when my projects started getting a lot of plays, before that, no matter how good I thought I was, no one knew so no one could call me great. 1",2021-03-06T13:15:54.794Z,"What would be the difference between a great Unity developer and a good one?

With its efficient prototyping ability, unity 3D game development has become the first choice for developing interactive and exhilarating gaming solutions. Some examples of the game developed in Unity are Pokemon Go, Rust, Temple Run Trilogy, Super Mario Run, and Escape Plan. Unity can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality games, simulations, and other experiences. Its main features are: Unity gives the ability to create games and experiences in both 2D and 3D and the engine offers a primary scripting API in C# (for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins and games themselves).Also, it provides drag and drops functionality as well.It has a large community of users that keep it constantly updated.It has a powerful interface that is used in developing games and their cross-platform applications.That said and all, why should you be using Unity? Is there anything more to it? The answer is Yes. Not just developing games, you can use it for the following tasks: To create better user experiences – As we know, Unity is a great game engine. This is mostly due to its beautiful graphics and ability to render in 3D. Unity extends its support to VR and AR. Therefore, it could become a great tool for exploring architecture and automation.For interactive experiences – Unity is very versatile when it comes to creating interactive applications. Its extensibility makes it possible to integrate into whatever existing back ends the applications have.Advantages of developing games in Unity are: 1. Platform Support – This is one of the biggest advantages of Unity. It is compatible with platforms like Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux, Android, and many other platforms. Due to multiple platform support, the app developed in one platform can be easily shared with the other platforms. Besides, its methodology allows for speedy prototyping, which in turn reduce the time required to develop apps 2. IDE – The engine consists of an in-built IDE which is used to write the project code. Additionally, the integrated development editor supports programming languages like JScript or C# for scripting. Along with this, it provides features that are suitable for game development. 3. Debugging – Debugging in Unity is a pleasure for every game developer. The support for debugging is nice because all the variables are displayed in the gameplay. 4. Graphics – It supports high-quality audio and visual effects that support easing the game development. The visuals are capable of adapting to every screen and device. 5. Community – Unity enjoys the support of a large community of users that keep the engine updated and offer wide built components for sound, physics, rendering, and controls. 6. Analytics – Unity consists of built-in analytics which you can easily find in the editor. Thanks to Unity Analytics, you can get very deep insights into your game. It gives you information that can be used to improve the gameplay by doing some modifications and offer an awesome gaming experience for the players. I hope it gave you some insights into the goods of Unity. Definitely. Unity is a great engine for developing games.

Most of the aspects are taken for granted as some sort of technical magic, and that’s fine. Why? Because,You didn’t learn number systems and group theory before learning how to add/subtract. You didn’t learn the equal-tempered diatonic scale before you learnt songs using the same. Heck, you didn’t learn the alphabet before learning words. It doesn’t make much sense to assume the experience would somehow be different for developing video games.With as abstract a subject as computer science, man-made architecture and structure is of utmost importance if you’re going to achieve anything even remotely scalable (unless you’re writing reams of code daily that you chuck out the trash and never see again, it includes you). Reinventing the wheel with every single aspect of all the nuances of a game engine is not only tiresome, it is bordering on moronic.One minor example: should a Vector representation be 2D or 3D? If it’s 3D, what about all the 2D space variables where you’ll essentially be wasting 33% of memory? Should it be a struct or a class? Should the values be floats or doubles?Another similar example: Unreal Engine (4.x) encodes bools as bit-shifted uint32s. Can you guess why?A more involved example: if Player and Enemy both derive from GameObject/Actor and both use the same Movement pattern, where will you put that code? If in the base class, you’re on your path to a monolithic huge class that is no longer a representation of what you intended it to be. If you put it in the child classes, you’re duplicating code. The answer is not so simple: it is architectural, and involves balancing inheritance with composition/entity-component-systems.I haven’t even scratched the surface of gameplay programming, forget about engine programming, which is all about efficiency, resource management, object pooling, dynamic asset-swapping, toolchain development, asset conversion, matrix transformations, and a whole universe of other sub-specialisations. The point is: it’s much easier to have a reference model that you explore and figure out first. Then use another one to compare the differences and research why the engineers took those decisions differently. And so on, until you’re in a position to critique all the various game engines and the technologies they offer. I hope you realise this means decades of dedication to game engines.If your idea of a “real game developer” is encompassing all of the above, most games you play aren’t made by “real game developers”.",2021-03-06T13:31:26.164Z,"Do you think a real game developer should learn OpenGL or DirectX instead of just learning how to use Unity?

Learn how to create UV maps and paint textures onto your meshes as well as baking textures and normals which you will need. Practice a little with creating complex textures with node trees. All these concepts will be valuable once you get into Unity and Unreal. Try out a bit of C# coding in 3D graphics to get an appreciation of how objects are created, textured and manipulated in a virtual world. It will teach you a bit on vector mathematics performing transformations on objects making them rotate scale or translate in a game like environment. Visual studio express editions like C# has a windows presentation template which allows you to start programming in 3D. You can even create some basic scenes like you would using a game engine which contains 3D objects and a camera to navigate this virtual world. When you get into a game engine you will start to appreciate how much easier it makes creating interactive 3D content. Unity in comparison to Unreal is more easier to use. It allows coding in C# and java. You can easily import Blender files in fbx format and incorporate all your uv maps without the frustration you will encounter with Unreal. Texture painting of landscapes has a much similar workflow compared to Unreal. Although Unreal has the option for coding in C++ its main difference from Unity is its Visual scripting methodology (Blueprints). Its not as easy in my opinion compared to coding. However it can be used to develop full games without using C++. In essence you are still working with a type of coding. I would recommend starting with Unity. There are a lot of other advantages over Unreal such as not needing a more higher spec computer. Quicker application launching opening of projects and compilation and previewing of content. Ive seen more ease of reproducibility of packaged content to Windows 64 than Unreal engine for similar content. Maybe because Unreal has so much more menus and steps that need to be tweaked and adjusted to get things working.

DLLs are not a good idea for people who do not have deep computer science knowledge. There are many IDEs that can be used. Visual Studio is the most integrated on the Windows platform. On Mac I find JetBrains Rider to be better than Visual Studio Code, I have not run full Visual Studio on Mac. I have heard of people using Eclipse with a lot of customization, I don’t know how that compares to Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or Rider.

There are several tutorials for platformer games, side scrollers, top down rpgs, board games, etc. Though you can make most basic games with it, but with some your own research and hard work, you can add new things into your game… There is a 2D game called Stardew Valley, which is made by single person. It took him 4 years to implement all those features of the game, such as farming, fishing, mining, etc. This game was made over four years, he spent on development where he did all the stuff all on his own, including designs, programming, music, etc. His story is truly inspiring as he is one of the indie developer who achieved fame with just a game, because of his game… If you have this much kind of patience, and will to make a game, then you will surely make one. Though first you have to think, the game you are making is really fun or not. Talk with your friends, what kind of games they prefer to play? How much time they spend in the game? What they like in that game? Then you can surely have some little bit insight into what they like, why they play, etc. This can help you make an idea for a game. Write down the idea, think about it, make changes as you read it again and again. Once you finalize the idea then start working on it… There are several tutorials which can be helpful. Though you can always learn something new from some other tutorial for a different genre of game and maybe you can implement that idea in the game. When I was making my first game, I just stole some ideas from other games I had played before… Also when you play a game, don’t just play it mindlessly. Think of the gameplay, is it addictive? If yes, write down about it, what makes it good and addictive. If no, then what improvement it may need. This can help you shape up your game, since if you are thinking of making the game of same genre.

It will take hours and hours of practice, tutorial reading, theory reading, thinking and problem-solving. Most computational skills you have until now will help. But also you will have to learn things most programmers don't even mind. General Considerations So you want to be an Indie: Indie Game developing is not about trying to come up with the next Halo. Nor it is trying to do things like most AAA games do, not matter how exciting they look. Indie games are about finding how to entertain people without having to produce a 100 million dollars game. I like Extra-Credits' Video on the subject:  Read: I started developing games years ago and I'm still not an expert. Daily there are tons of new exciting stuff to learn. Use Quora, subscribe to interesting mailing lists, read books on game design and development. etc.Read focused: Ok, maybe the ""read"" thing is not that specific. Put yourself a challenge or set your mind on a particular topic, then find interesting literature on that, and practice until you consider you have a good domain on the concept or skill you are dealing with. For example, grab a tutorial on how to change the texture on a model. As simple as it sounds, maybe tweaking variables or going outside the expected path will help you understand. Your first goal is to understand...... Oh yeah, and read news related to indie Games Do: Do something, even if you think you have mastered a skill, do something with it. Program a little script to do something funny, program a game you can achieve with the few concepts you have or make a little sketch of a character and publish it on your facebook. More often than not, those little projects will take you to better understanding and will train you. One day you will find yourself being called ""The one that does [Insert here your skill]"" Repeat until... well, until you die...: You will never end the learning process, there is not a point where you are an expert and then you stop learning and then you make an indie game. NO.But in the process, you will find that you have enough skills to make that little game that came up to your mind. And then do it. It will be like your son (You will love it, even when everyone else thinks it's extremely ugly ;) )And then again, if you think you lack the expertise in some area to start your game, then LEARN it; Even those things outside your programming career. Things like modelling, rigging, illustrating, GUI designing, etc. will be extremely helpful. There is not always an artist at hand. Particular Considerations Ok, the question was about Unity3D, but I wanted to make the abovementioned stuff clear. There's lot to think about when making games, beyond the game engine. For learning Unity3D, I would suggest you a scaffolding approach to learning. This is, try to learn new deeper and more complex things only when you have attained a considerable skill on something fundamental or in a more basic level. And make sure the new stuff you are trying to learn is attainable within the skills you already have. Here are some steps I recommend: Learn the Editor: Unity3D is so powerful, that there are some simple games you can do, only by using the editor without writing a single line of code!. There are tons of tutorials out there, and they almost always start by the editor. These are often suited for beginners.Learn the Inspector: It is a part of the editor, but it offers lots of functionalities regarding the game elements that will save you scripting time.Memorize Hotkeys: It will save you lots of time.Create a little project only y using the editor and borrowed code: Again, there are lots of tutorials that guide you into this. When doing this, try to understand the scripts you borrow. C Programming skills will help you a lot, but start to think in C#/Javascript terms.Learn C#/Javascript (The Unity version ""UnityScript""): Do this outside of unity. Unity uses these languages from an scripting perspective, and from an event oriented architecture. The simplest path is to learn how to declare variables, functions, procedures, keywords and other stuff outside the Unity environment. It will be better to gain understanding this way. Again, lots of tutorials and books. There is also Boo but no one uses that.Learn how to program from an event-oriented perspective. Learn about how methods get called from a main loop, and how messages are passed between GameObjects in Unity3D. Also, learn about Co-routines and Threads.Learn the .Net framework: Unity uses Mono, an open-source version of the Microsoft .Net Framework. It is astonishingly big, but some basic tutorials will help. Above all, try to learn about collections and serializing.Do something. At this point you should be able to create your first frankenstein (without art, or borrow it from the internet)Learn to model, process images and edit audio. Using something like Blender3D, Photoshop, Audacity and Inkscape is not as hard as programming. Learn them.Do something else: Create another mutant (now with art)Think about your project: At this point if you have enough basics, think about a bigger project (but be careful of scope, often you will find yourself making cuts to the original idea, but that's fine). By building it, you will find you lack other skills to make the game you want to make, then learn those skills outside your current game (OUTSIDE!, do not experiment with your game, trust me, I've been there)Learn advanced stuff and newer features: This includes, Procedural particle systems and Textures, Unity Animation System, Shaders, Lighting.Be on touch with future features: The guys at Unity are always innovating and coming up with new ideas, plugins and utilities for the game engine. Just repeat the process until you think you are leveling up in those new functions.And hey, enjoy it. This is fun, when you're not killing your head in a Crunch time problem :P.

I can answer you with the specs to look for but not a laptop because laptops are in a speedy development so, for example, every single month there comes a latop which is more powerful than the previous one, you need not always go with the most expensive or latest ones, you need to know your needs.Suppose you are an excellent game developer who has learned everything and you want to make a game like pubg, you can’t do this alone, so, you will join a community but a community already provides you with a laptop, or let's assume you joined an online one so you will get a specific task to do. For example, you get to make 3d objects so you will need a good GPU or if you are a scriptwriter then you need a good processor to compile them.I understand how you must be thinking.SO let's again assume that you do not know what you are going to do and you are learning to develop games then you will need a simple laptop, but it is not that you won’t buy a laptop twice, one after learning game development. Now again we assume that you are alone capable of making games like pubg then let's see what are the recommended specs for this game- A simple gtx 1660ti would go it easily but note you will require a bit higher-end GPU than recommended as the assets that you see are already loaded into your system when the game downloads but you will need to makes the assets, so an RTX 2060 will do, let's talk about the CPU, for the CPU never choose anything under a 6 core processer, I recommend an 8 core one. I suggest going for RTX cards as they can enable ray tracing in the game you are making, most gamers love it. So do not worry I am listing 2 specs for each category on the left is recommended ones and on the left are minimum specGPU- RTX 2070/ RTX 2060/Gtx 1080/ GTX 1660ti CPU- Amd ryzen 9/ i9 10th gen/Amd ryzen 7/i7 10th gen Ram- 12 gb+ Storage- 512+ bg ssd + 1tb hdd Some of my recommendations are helios 300 or Asus tuf a15 or Asus zepherus g14, if you can afford a helios 700 then go for it without any doubt in your mind.",2021-03-06T13:54:53.112Z,"Which is the best laptop for game development with Unity and Unreal Engine?

For example, collision detection (you won't be writing your own queries, but still), and representation of rotation. In case of rotation in 2d you have 1 number to represent it, in 3d you need matrix or quaternion. While 2d angle is covered by school math course, quaternion requires at least one book to grasp it (because it is 4 dimensional representation of rotation on 4d 1 unit sphere), and you'll want quaternions because you smoothly interpolate those, while doing the same thing with matrices is more complicated, and euler angles/yaw-pitch-roll rotations are subject to gimbal lock. You'll need to understand those advanced concepts at least at basic level. Producing good-looking 2d content is also simpler than producing good-looking 3d content. (it is easier to make a pixelart sprite than to model 3d object that will look decent at every angle), and if you want you can still plug 3d models into 2d project - unity allows that.

You can see the results here. http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.envysoftworks.projectd But your question was what game to make. Let's tackle that. I think the best way to break down a game is by genre, theme, number of players, art style and platform. I will assume that the goal of your first game is for you to test your ability as a game developer and release a finished product. Not make a fortune or make you world famous. There is a really small chance of those happening right away. When getting started your only goal should be to finish a game. Nothing more. It is way more important than you might think.   GenreThe most important factor you must consider when selecting your genre is your skillset.What are you good at? Do you have mad coding skillz? If so try picking a more tech heavy genre like a platformer or a fighting game. If you are good at art make an adventure game and so on and so forth. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES choose a genre that is traditionally big, like an RPG. 2. Theme This one is way easier. What is it you find interesting? What is the subject you know a lot about? Do you like bird watching? Excellent make a game about birds! This will help you pushing on during the hardest parts of development. If you like your theme you will want to interact more with it. It will also save you time from research. The less you research the faster your game will finish.  3. Number of Players  Stick to ONE. If you have to have more than one player make a local multiplayer game. DO NOT make an online or massively multi player online game. You will have enough problems to deal with already. Server-client and peer-to-peer models are something you don't want to mess with.  4. Art Style  If you absolutely no idea about game art go 2D. Easier to program, easier to create, easier to find online royalty free.If you are already a modeller or animator and know how to do 3D then by all means go 3D. If not better stick to 2D. 5. Platform  Unity does produce multiple platform exports for your game. That does not mean every game should be made for all platforms. You better have decided what platform you are going to release on before starting development and tailor your game around it. You should not start with a console game. Licensing os crazy and complicating and you probably won't make it on any store easily. I would say your best bet is PC, Android and Windows Phone.  There are multiple ways to distribute a PC/Mac/Linux game for free like Newgrounds, GameJolt, IndieDB etc. You can even try your luck with Steam Greenlight for a one time fee. The mobile market is even easier to get into. The Windows Phone store and the Playstore will ask you for a small fee on registration and then publish your game within a few hours. I would suggest to stay away from iOS for your first game since they have a strict set of guidelines you will have to follow in order to get published as well as a yearly developer fee and of course you are going to need an Apple computer to produce the final build. That being said you can still try your luck with iOS I just would not recommend it. Finally keep it simple. Don't try to reach multiple platforms right away. Pick one and focus on it. There will be changes needed from platform to platform even with the power Unity provides. Trying to make a game for both Windows and Linux might make you feel lost from time to time. You better avoid that.If I were you I would either choose Android or Windows PC. So that is pretty much my advice. I hope it helps. Feel free to ask any questions you may have or raise any objections. Good luck and have fun!

Mobile devices have a lot of limitations that you have to build a game around, and Unity, being generally more lightweight than Unreal, handles all those limitations much better. In a lot of situations mobile devices’ graphics support is vastly under-equipped relative to what either engine is capable of building, so you’ve got to cut corners wherever you can on graphics features. Their available working memory is going to be constrained more than their hardware specs suggest, being that users almost never have just one app open at a time, so memory optimization is vital. The more intense the needs of your game the worse it’ll drain the battery, so processing optimization is also vital. What’s more, online stores have been known to keep some pretty hard limitations in terms of delivering an executable beyond a certain size. Even when you are allowed to push an executable that’s rather large, users are in fact known to skip out on games merely because the download size is too big. Basically you want them to have no hesitation snagging it over their data plan if they don’t have wi-fi around. Also, for Android especially you want to minimize the hiccups that might be involved in splitting an APK. Speaking from personal experience this is a colossal pain in the ass. When you start to add these problems up, you start to realize that merely supporting the ability to make a build and push it to a device doesn’t make a solid mobile game development suite. For each of the above issues Unreal is categorically worse than Unity in its ability to fit into limited hardware. Even if you set your project’s presets to Mobile a blank Unreal project will still take up more resources and inflate the executable size dramatically. As a predominantly 3D engine it’s graphically more demanding by default, and its 2D pipeline is less developed, meaning it doesn’t have great options to “scale down” the visuals to fit the platform better. Unity is simply a lot more minimalistic, to the point that it hasn’t got much gameplay framework unless you build some yourself. Its visuals aren’t as strong as Unreal’s and it doesn’t have as many tools in its technical art pipeline — or in general, for that matter — but a lot of games can do without those things, especially on mobile. It also has comparatively mature 2D tools, making 2D game development attainable if not necessarily efficient. On the flip-side, Unity scales up comparatively poorly, partly due to project management problems and partly because its overall memory management scheme (IE the horrible garbage collector) isn’t well-suited to dealing with a large amount of working memory. Unreal will have an inflated heap size to begin with and Unity will make it easier to keep it small, but Unity will work more and more badly the bigger the heap gets. *shrug* Tradeoffs.

The way to complete any large project is to sketch out the overall goal and then break it down into smaller and smaller chunks until you reach achievable atomic goals, then start knocking out those goals while taking time to test and refine over the course of the project.

""Like Audiosurf"" isn't really a description, unless you're directly ripping off Audiosurf, and I wouldn't recommend that.   Is unity the right tool for this? It's as good a tool as any other you're going to find. Better than most. How does one read audiofiles? This is actually two different difficult questions. One is how do you access the user's music library on iOS, that requires a native code plugin to access the music library and bring the audio data into Unity. I know this is at least partially doable, because there's plugins for sale for Unity that allow you to control the playback of music from the music library... but whether you can actually access the waveforms of that music is another question... and I simply don't know the answer to that.  EDIT: I did some additional digging and the word is that it is NOT POSSIBLE to access waveform data from a user's music library. You can play the music through Apple APIs but they will reject your game from the app store if you try to capture any data from the music inside of your game.   You can only make games that are based on analyzing music if you supply the music in your own download. You cannot access the user's on device music on iOS like Audiosurf does on PC. This is not Unity's fault... it's Apple's  Then there's analyzing the audio once you have it. This is extracting useful data for game play from the waveform data. I don't know too much about it, but there are some pretty good tools for it on the Unity Asset Store. This one in particular looks pretty good. Altered Reality Entertainment LLC - Visualizer Studio How to generate scenes for such a game? This another question nobody but you can answer. If you aren't up to the task of figuring this out, you are not going to be able to make this game.  Don't expect people to hold your hand and walk you through everything.

(3) These days, I prefer C# on Android - since my team and I are using the Unity 3D Engine to build cross platform games that work on Android, ios and others.We also use MonoDevelop a bit on Android - for other stuff-- but me having never been an Android Java guy, I dont like the thing about Activities, Intents and such-like!!! C# on Android: Unity 3d  (4) C# on Android - Mono - and MonoDevelop - Mentioned also in (3) above   (5) HTML5 - In past I have also used HTML5 on Android - with the beautiful aspect being it's ability to use JavaScript to write code.I used Apache Cordova and before that PhoneGap (which is now obsolete)Also, Facebook's initial version of it's Android app was written using HTML5 and not in Java- and it had hundreds of millions of downloads before Mark Zuckerberg decided to make an Android Native (=Java) app for Facebook on Android.  HTML5 on Android - can be put together as an app using a variety of toolchains, including online toolchains which can generate code or APK (no longer as popular as they once were)HTML5 Can be compiled and built using a variety of commercial and open source compilers and build toolchains.Have released multiple apps and multiple versions of my apps made using HTML5 on Android- and while it is cool giving power & flexibility of JavaScript, somehow for me, Javascript is not one of my favorite languages.  6) HTML5 on Android - Apache Cordova- Released Version 2.0 of a HTML5 Game we released on Android - using Apache Cordova- after releasing first version built using PhoneGap (which is now obsolete)  6) HTML5 on Android - Phonegap (before it became obsolete)- released first version of a HTML5 Game built and compiled using PhoneGap on Android  7) Lua - Using CoronaSDK    8) Lua - by running Lua Programs within the Lua Interpreter embedded in Cocos2D-X    9) Lua - by Embedding it inside a larger ""Lua Application Server"" framework application, which serves as the glue between Android OS/underlying platform and the app's logic.Angry Birds - by Rovio - was written using this approach- and it's believed that it took Rovio lots of effort and debugging to finalise and get debugged it's Lua Application server inside which the Angry Birds Lua scripts ran.This approach is less common nowadays-- as we can use Lua inside Cocos2D-x OR Corona SDK.     10) Using GameSalad - it has a proprietary byte-code based representation of programs/actions and was once (in it's heyday) often used to make simple Android games which could also be built for various other platforms - but now it is less popular.   Using Various JVM connected languages like Clojure and Scala - Advantage of these is that they are functional languages and considered by many to be tens or hundreds of times more expressive than Java Code. Details below. 11) Using Clojure:Please visit the site below for info:Clojure on Android   12) Using Scala:See the articles below for details:Scala: A Better Java for AndroidDeveloping for Android    13) Using  Flash / ActionScript - And Adobe's Flashbuilder + Flex etc tools: I have personally cross-compiled atleast a few Flash Scripts onto Android (and also onto BB10 platform)- and it works fairly well except that adobe has already written this off as a platform.  Have any hit Apps or Games been Written with Flash Builder for Android ?Yesss... Candy  Crush was originally written and cross compiled for Android, IOS etc in Flash / Actionscript using Adobe's tools.    14) Using MIT's AppInventor:See:AppInventor is not as popular as it was when introduced- but it provides an open-source GUI based environment to use drag and drop to put together Android apps-- and the Java source code is generated- which can be hand-edited or added to by the programmer/user using AppInventor.

But not because I helped make the tools, but for these reasons: 1. AR in general deals with realtime 3D interaction, and Unity has the best tools for developing this kind of software. You will also find a whole ecosystem of other tools and assets for this on the Unity Asset Store. 2. Unity’s mission is to democratize (game) development, and so we’re trying to make everyone an AR developer, whether you are technically proficient, or more of an artist with a great idea. We’ve done some good work with exposing AR SDKs to C#, but realizing that AR development is challenging, we’re striving to simplify it as much as possible (minimize coding). Watch for news on this. 3. 70% or more of ARKit apps on the App Store are made with Unity, so you have a lot of developers with experience making these apps who can help with issues and questions, and I know a lot of them - they are very active in the community. 4. Once you’ve written your app for ARKit, you can easily target ARCore, or Hololens or Magic Leap, or whatever comes next. And we’re working on making this even easier i.e. no code changes at all. For these reasons, I hope I have made a convincing argument for using Unity for AR apps in general. I look forward to welcoming you to our vibrant development community.

Firstly, Unity is free and anything required to make a game can be done by yourself, partners, or/and freelancers. They have a store with free assets and ones to buy as well, which is very helpful for both learning and creating the game. Unity does not require you to pay them any money until after you make $100,000 as well, which is something that Unreal does not do. Unreal on the other hand, requires you to use Blueprints aka shortcut drag and drop instead of straight programming; could even think similar to Python. With Unreal and their store for assets, they really are not aiming for self-made and more so for either you have to be a top modeler or you have to pay. Also, to even use Unreal commercially, you need to pay $49 per month per license aka per person in your team. Then, to top it off, they take 5% of profits every quarter if you make $3,000 or more on a commercial game (not completely free non-profit games). Just looking at the costs, anyone should choose Unity, especially when just starting out. Now, with graphics, they are on the exact same level and Unity is only getting bigger and better for all game, graphics, and animation rendering. For an example, look at Book of The Dead made with Unity:  Now, onto the programming side. I had alluded to it earlier with Blueprints but really, it goes further into that. With Unity, you have complete control of everything and it has continuous support, meaning that whatever you have trouble with, there are most definitely people out there that either know how to do it or might have something on the Unity Store that could help. Also, there is a deal with Humble Bundle with selling many Unity Store products in a bundle for an extremely low price, as in 1% of original cost. With Unreal Engine, there is not as much support and to actually get in to programming, it is not ideal and is confusing. Pretty much, if you are involved in computer science or game programming, Unity is the best way to go. It is also where most students learn first. Most companies require computer science and C# programming skills, so it is better to go with the engine that actually has a lot of code. You do not even need to know much about the video games as long as you know how to code the mechanics. Unreal Engine takes that needed skill out but keeps the requirements for company jobs, making it quite unfair. Not only is Unity more skill and knowledge based but it prepares the programmers for multiple fields from graphics to artificial intelligence to phone applications and web design. Unreal Engine cannot come close to this and unfortunately is the reason why many new game developers go to Indie due to no true prior experience with Unreal Engine, which requires experience and money to use. In the business world, Unreal is seen as needed but is much more difficult. With the GUI and API, Unity is made for all systems as a one-stop shop and is meant to be fully clean, easy to understand, and customizable. Unreal is a lot more messy and trying to say that it is easy and simple but in reality, it does not explain much and tries to rush the process of game creation. Actually, it looks more like a more confusing version of if the old Alice engine and Unity got combined. Now, you are probably thinking that Indie goes Unity and AAA goes Unreal Engine. Well, that is because they can afford Unreal Engine and their employees are trained in Unreal Engine. However, there is another big factor: Tencent. Now, Tencent has not always been involved but before they were, Unity was younger, so that is why Unreal was still top. However, Unity has been making huge progress each year to the point where in the past three, made giant progress to match Unreal Engine. They are even matching Unreal Engine’s improvements and soon, they may overtake Unreal Engine. Though, with Tencent, they have been funding many games and taking equity, making sure that they use the Unreal Game Engine that also have an enormous stake in as well. So, all in all, AAA started with Unreal Engine in its prime and Tencent enforced it. However, right now is the Age of Indie Developers and they can afford and are more skilled in Unity. The Unreal Engine is stagnating and is only making small progressions while Unity is making leaps and bounds forward. Overall, Unity is the better game engine in every aspect. If anyone was to argue that Unreal Engine is better, then they are not looking at what Unity is capable of since Unity either matches Unreal Engine or bypasses them.

During the first period of American party politics there were the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties. In the 1790s there was the Alien and Sedition Act, promoted by the Federalist Party. This controversy reflected the partisan division over how to regard the French Revolution. This animosity came to a head with the nasty political campaign of 1800 during which both sides claimed in the strongest terms that liberty and moral order would be lost if the other side won. The Federalists were eventually reduced to a few small strongholds. (One of the largest being in New England, and one of the smallest being around Washington County, Ohio.) The dominance of the Democratic-Republicans in American politics seemed set to become hegemonic, but then this party split from within in the 1820s in a rivalry between New Englander John Q. Adams and frontiersman Andrew Jackson of Tennessee (the first plain “Democrat”). Jackson, president from 1829 to 1837, was opposed by some former Democratic-Republicans who called themselves the National Republican Party. By 1834, this party had merged with other minor factions to make up the Whig Party. The Democrats and the Whigs included both northerners and southerners, both slave-owners and non-slave-owners. I suppose that you could say that southern and northern Democrats and Whigs were kept united by their respective parties so that both parties strove not to rock the boat as far as slavery was concerned, and even slave-owning presidents during this period firmly opposed secession. This promoted national unity as long as the two main parties could keep in control of the national government, although they did differ regarding hotly contested topics such as economic policies (including protectionism and centralized banking), the interpretation of the Constitution, and Native American rights. Despite the Establishment of that day wishing to submerge the slavery issue, it could not be avoided forever. Northern states tended to want to limit the number of slave states and the slave states fought against being limited in number, leading to the Missouri Compromise of 1820. As westward expansion continued, however, more territories applied for statehood and people became less satisfied with that compromise. Dissatisfaction with slavery for a variety of reasons eventually estranged many people from the two main parties. By 1840 there was at least one minor party, the Liberty Party, that took a firm anti-slavery stance. The number of anti-slavery political parties grew after 1840. The major parties’ North-South alliances and hold on national government might be said to have promoted national unity, but this was only temporary.

Based on my limited experience, the answer to your question is (surprise surprise): it depends. Both HTML5 and Unity allow you to build pretty much any 2D game you could imagine and both let you do it fairly easily. What I'm liking a lot about Unity so far are the built-in tools in the editor that make developing/tweaking your game so much quicker, such as: Built in game preview mode that lets you run the game in the editor and dynamically tweak pretty much all variables on all objects.The scene editor lets you drag and drop your game objects into your scene so you don't have to worry about hard coding positions, running your game to see if the positions look good, etc. Same for things like collision boxes, which you can just transform/resize right there in the editor instead of having to do trial and error in your code, which is what I had to do when coding in Sublime for my HTML5 game.Sprite importer that automatically finds the frames/sprites in your texture sheets so that you don't have to worry about making your own spritesheets with proper spacing, etc.Visual state machine and transitions for animation.There are tons of other advantages to Unity, these are just the ones I've noticed immediately within the 2 weeks I've used it. Some things I liked better about HTML5: Since it's basically all done in javascript, you get to learn and use a lot of tools that are widely used outside of game development, such as node/NPM, gulp, Socket.IO, canvas, etc. The framework I used (phaser) was open source, so it was incredibly easy to go in and hack around when the framework didn't quite support my use cases.As a professional developer, having a workflow that was completely code-centric felt very natural.The biggest advantage: HTML5 games run natively in the browser, so I could easily just send a link to anyone who I wanted to play my game (instead of them having to download something). This made development a lot of fun because at any point in the development of my game I could just give my friends/coworkers a link and let them try it out and test features immediately.Aside from general usability and 2D capabilities, for which the two are pretty closely matched, there are other things to consider. Do you want to do a lot of collaboration with other indie devs, or possibly join an indie studio in the future? Unity is basically the indie standard these days, and I've found that the vast majority of indie developers in my area (based on the meetups that I've gone to) use Unity. What actual platforms are you targeting? Obviously for the browser, HTML5 is a no-brainer. But Unity is better for basically all other platforms. And I know that the developers at Unity are actively working on their WebGL export, so it's only a matter of time before Unity becomes suitable for native browser games. Do you want to stick with 2D? If you hope to eventually branch out into 3D games (or VR), it'd be better to just invest the time to learn Unity. Unity is a full-fledged 3D engine and has VR support. You could theoretically make 3d games with HTML5, but it's really an uphill battle since the tools for it (WebGL, Three.js, etc.) are still in their infancy compared to Unity.",2021-03-06T14:27:55.130Z,"What are good tutorials for Unity 2D for iOS game development?

If you are asking if ‘you should’ use the default controller… I guess you should if your game is going to have some very classic game mechanics. Using the default game controller will allow you to use a lot of 3rd party plugins and extensions that might prove very useful later down the line — saving you time and making your game easier to port to various platforms. However, if your game is not going to have a classic 3rd person game mechanics (such as the one in Angry Bots, the Unity demo), then you are better off building your own. Case 2 — the fairly new to unity developer (or 3D artist that doesn’t fill comfortable coding): If you haven’t build your own game controller / basic gaming mechanics before, then you should — it will make you a better game designer / Unity developer. There are loads of tutorials out there and it will definitely allow you a lot more freedom (game mechanics wise). However, you need to remember that you might find yourself stuck and limited by the first game controller you build. If that happens, don’t let it stop you from finishing your game. Figuring out (for yourself) why something doesn’t work is part of the process. Just try and keep your triggers and reactions outside your game controller, so that you can still change the game controller (if you have to) without messing up all your other elements.

I’d start with the basics - i/o, input, rendering, core loop , ui That should be enough to get a main menu working and allow you to start a game. Thats the hello world of game dev and a great place to be. After that it depends on the game. Do you need models? You’ll need to write an importer. FBX is probably the best bet. You’ll need to implement lights and materials. You’ll need managers to load and free them as well as create instance copies as needed. You’ll need to write your rendering pipeline and figure out how shaders will work in your game. You’ll probably want an entity component system so I’d get that working early. Animation is also a good thing to have. If you have sprites then you’ll need to understand and manage sprite sheets. If you have models then you need to get skeletons and bone animations going. Then you’ll need to handle blending. And you’ll need some place to reference what animations need to be playing for what - which really means you need an anim tree/graph/state machine and likely some aliasing system so you can reuse the logic on different characters with different anim sets. You’ll need some sort of level editor - again, depending on the game. It might be as simple has generating some XML that defines the UI and some other XML that defines the objects in the level. It might be far more complex - this ends up being very game specific. You’ll need to be able to load the XML and then use that to load the required assets. You’ll also need to be able to unload. And keep a ref count so assets can be shared between levels and won’t be incorrectly unloaded. You’ll probably need a streaming system of some sort to handle all this.

If the group of units is starting and ending in the same areas… then the lowest cost path will simply be the same for each unit. There’s no way around this… if you want better movement behavior you will need to work at a level other than the navmesh itself. If you want your units to move together in a formation you may want to use some form of offset following whereby a single unit in the group uses a navmesh call, and the rest of the units use something like steering behaviors to follow that leader at an offset. Or you might offset the destinations and make multiple calls to the navmesh. Another thing you can do is disable the NavmeshAgent’s ability to move, set the destination and wait for the path…. and then move you unit along a modification of that path, updating the NavMeshAgent’s position as you go along. There’s lots of possible ways to go about it, and none of it is easy. GameAI is difficult… But one thing I can say for certain is the NavMesh and NavMeshAgent behavior is what it is, and you’re not going to be able to change it… so you’re going to have to work with that limitation and get the behavior you are looking for another way. (There are also some replacements for NavMesh available on the asset store, like Apex… these will get you more flexibility but the basic behavior isn’t going to be that different.)",2021-03-06T14:59:17.319Z,"How can I develop the NavMesh algorithm in Unity?

If none of the above is true, go back and work more until it is second nature. Afterwards, you take the time to learn “under the hood” stuff and understand why things work the way they do. For instance: When 1 element in Canvas is changes, everything in that canvas is redrawn. So, when you know this, you organize canvases in groups by how often and when you expect changes on them to happen. This helps with number of draw calls.Minimize the amount of things happening in Update() function - It always amazes me how many people do things inside update function that have no place there. Their games work slower and take up mo battery on the phones (not to mention overheating) These two are just examples of things you can probably do right now. Go deep and learn how everything works “close to metal” and adjust your coding style accordingly.

But if your product sells well throughout a year and each quarter earnings are more or equal to 3000$ you’ll end up paying 50% total from your revenue annually to steam and unreal alone. I know I was heart broken too- These are just the straight costs. Where as unity as of the moment is only costing 125$ a month or 1500$ annually that is if your team or you earn more than 100,000$ a year(regardless of how you get the revenue , donations, startup funding etc still counts for both engines). So basically- You potentially end up being charged less on unity if you make a successful game- you’re not being charged a percentage and you only have to buy pro if you make a huge success. Where as Unreal is ready to milk that sweet 20% if you make it big and still going to milk you if you end up earning small time. Unreal did their work- they know even flopped new indie games make around 3000$ in the first quarter of their release. -edit- I just noticed this question was asked about andriod- I think google playstore also charges 30%? not exactly sure however in unity from the last time I messed around it with you had to buy 10$ addon in order to use android and apple app feature. Also Unity isn’t all that green and cheap- if you’re not a pro and/or don’t have access to certain developmental assets you usually end up having to buy addons or or going to unity asset store. Basically you can mess around with unity and make a good game or app but you can’t exactly use it to it’s fullest potential without having to pay a little more here and there. Where as unreal doesn’t bog you down with such let us say microtransaction and you can use it to its fullest potential. Still even with all that said- you’ll end up paying more to epic for unreal engine then unity when it comes to bigger revenue success.

So for Pan-Africanism you don’t really “African unity” in the sense of getting all 1.2 billion to agree; you need “African unity” among enough factions to force the issue. Here is what I would consider a workable list of factions that, if harnessed, could push Pan-Africanism forward: Cross-border traders, which would benefit from less restrictions on crossing country lines, reduced tariffs, and reduced bureaucracy at the borderAfrican multinational companies which would like to see easier access to continental markets and limited competition from abroadFirst Diasporans (slave trade diaspora) who have no loyalty to particular African countries but want to engage with “Africa”Major African airlines who would see more riders if travel hassles and costs were eased across AfricaAfrican expats, migrants, refugees in Africa for obvious reasonsPan-Africanists on the ground for obvious reasonsTourism & Hospitality Companies (see point on airlines)I could go on, and I’m surely forgetting some. It’s not really a matter of saying “let’s unite Africa NOW” and getting everyone on board. That probably won’t work. But it’s certainly possible to promote particular Pan-African policies and get buy-in for those particular polices from particular factions. It’s more of a Fabian strategy; eating-an-elephant-a-bite-at-a-time stuff. It’s still African unity, just not the broad mass-movement sort of unity we are used to.

Design - 50–200h (depending on complexity) $0–100 per hourGraphics - 20–300h - $20–80 per hourCode - 200–1000h - $20–200 per hour depending on skillsTesting / QA - 20–100h - $0–20Sound - 10–30h - $20–100Middleware - 10–20h - $0–50 per hourAds/Marketing/ - 10–100h - $0-100 per hour, 0.10-$1 per install.So i’d estimate from scratch you’re in the middle range of all of these not factoring the time of housing, communicating or generally getting the team together is a total cost is between $20,000-$40,000 for a full game launch. Now your next game might be much cheaper as you can reuse code and learn from it, say $10,000 but that all depends how you built your first game.",2021-03-06T15:38:59.950Z,"How much would it cost to start a small 2D mobile Unity game developer startup?

They can’t wait to sink their hard earned money into the next hot thing. But, do they know what they are actually buying? Now-a-days, I don’t think they do. Let me give you a little background… I’ve talked about this before. An IPO is an initial public offering, and is the first time that the general public can buy shares in a company. For the public, this sounds like an exciting thing. There are many private companies today that investors can’t wait to invest in, like Uber and AirBnB. But, think about why a company would want to go from private to public. Why would they do that? Going public involves a mountain of paperwork, auditing, and ongoing reporting requirements. And that’s not even including the millions of dollars it takes to go through the whole process. So, why would a company go through all of that trouble? If a company is successful, it probably means that everyone within the company is making money, right? Why would they want to sell off part of their business to the public? Well, there are a variety of reasons. The major reason is so the company can get liquidity… or rather, so the early company founders and investors can get liquidity. “…the basic business of finance is buying low and selling high, and it is sometimes hard to resist the secondary cynical explanation for going public, which is that you do an IPO to top-tick the market for your stock and sell at the very high point of hype.” -Bloomberg Think about that for second, if you are buying an IPO. As an investor, you are literally putting money into the pockets of those early founders and investors. That isn’t always a bad thing. There are many, many companies that have gone on to be very successful after their IPO. Investors who bought those companies are very happy, as those stock prices have continued to go up. But, there is another side. How do you know why a company is going public? Is it so they can get more capital into the business so they can continue to expand? Or is it because they are simply trying to cash out at the public’s expense? Let’s look at tech company $SNAP as an example.  Since IPO’ing in early 2017, the stock has been a complete disaster… but not for the founders. CEO Evan Spiegel was awarded $750 million in stock, just for getting the IPO done. That doesn’t include all the other equity that he owned… and the $272 million of stock he sold in the IPO. (That’s over $1 billion that he earned because of the IPO.) Maybe $SNAP will recover. Maybe Spiegel will be able to justify his massive liquidation event in a couple years. Or maybe he’ll just walk with a mountain of money… we shall see… Now, there are not too many other recent examples similar to $SNAP’s. And that is mostly because there haven’t been as many IPO’s.  Source: Yahoo! In addition to regulatory burden, companies have been able to raise significant money in the private markets because of low interest rates and private investment firms being flush with cash. However… “That finally may change. Investors, bankers and analysts said they expected a wave of initial public offerings to bring some of the most highly valued and recognizable start-ups to the public market over the next 18 to 24 months — and billions of dollars in returns to their executives and investors. The potential bonanza would follow years of waiting as a few dozen companies amassed valuations without precedent in the private market.” - NY Times  Source: NY Times As our economy gets further into this record-long bull market, private companies will know that it’s ‘now or never’ when it comes to their IPO. They understand that they need to go public in order to get their liquidity event. They need to offload! Of course, the public will be there to provide that exit. Traditional investors will line-up out the door to own shares in tech behemoths who have only been available to exclusive insiders. For you, as an investor, you need to ask yourself something: Are you investing in a company that has a lot more upside? Or are you investing in someone’s big exit? If a new wave of IPO’s does in fact start to materialize, you’ll know exactly what is happening. Private companies will be trying to get money for their wild valuations before the environment of easy money disappears.",2021-03-06T15:42:10.855Z,"Is it good to invest in the IPO of the video game software development platform Unity?

Blizzard is known to have leveraged PlayMaker for a variety of purposes in creating Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, as an example. Tools like these are worth the investment in that they permit you to avoid both reinventing the wheel and supporting/testing/troubleshooting the tools yourself. ProCore does all the maintenance work on ProBuilder so that you don’t need to. The purchase per seat sounds daunting, but compared to the hundreds of thousands you’d spend developing and troubleshooting an equivalent tool internally it’s practically a steal. A tool as mature as ProBuilder or PlayMaker also comes with the advantage of excellent stability, and speaking from personal experience, developers making tools solely for their internal use never come out with something that polished. I mean. How many object pooling and localization table systems do you really need to write? It’s not like there’s a prize for this shit, and the license model for these tools is a per seat basis — not a per project basis, as was the case for engines like Unreal 3 back in the day. What you get in return is the cumulative effort of the equivalent of several AAA teams worth of programmers. You can’t fathom what this does for your productivity, even as a single developer.  On Art Assets Now, if you’re talking about Unity art assets… no. Flatly, no. Technical art and art direction are vital elements in defining a successful game, and asset store art packs are very scattershot in quality, organization, visual fidelity, style, and technical specs. That last bit is one of the things that really kills these as a legitimate prospect for development — you can download three sets of attractive-looking assets that are all specced for different modes of play and subsequently have different polygon counts and texture resolutions. This isn’t even mentioning the lack of consistency or originality that leaning on these entails in terms of art direction, which is something that gamers notice and complain about ad nauseum. As such, while it isn’t unusual for Unity developers of any size to take advantage of prop packs so that they don’t need to spend art budget making garbage cans, the vast majority of art is something you need a team to supply and direct.  On Game Templates Nobody uses these. Depending on what you mean by assets, yes. Many kinds of assets are sold on the asset store.

There are less things to configure, and games will look good with the built-in effects and shaders with less effort than is required with Unity. Also, if you use GDScript (similar to Python), programming is fairly simple and you can do it right in the editor. But Godot does have limitations that could slow you down: Team collaboration tools - If there are several programmers working on the project, then they will likely be more productive with Unity. The team and cloud development tools that Unity has are very useful, and Godot has nothing comparable. Also, Unity has excellent support for extending the built-in game object types, allowing one developer to add custom behaviors, while another uses those behaviors to script the game. Extending the editor - In addition to extending built-in types, Unity makes it very easy to extend the editor. This is useful for a lot of different scenarios. For instance, if you are creating an adventure game, it would probably be useful to create a dialog editor inside the game editor. This would speed up development as the writers would be able to instantly edit the dialog right in the game editor window. In Unity, creating editor extensions is powerful and easy. For evidence of this, just look at the 100s of powerful extensions available in the Unity Asset Store. In Godot, you can create extensions using GDScript, but they are much more limited. To create extensions as powerful as Unity has, you have to create them in a compiled language like C++ and use a confusing bridge called “GDNative” to link it to the editor. This is one reason why there are only about 30 extensions available for Godot, and most of them aren’t very useful. Unity Asset Store - There may be an extension available for purchase in the Asset Store that will drastically speed up your game development. There are also thousands of 3D models, materials, 2D graphics, game templates, sounds, and more available for purchase. All of these assets will work instantly in a Unity game with little change or configuration needed. In Godot, there are far less extensions available, and any third-party assets you need will have to be purchased elsewhere. These assets will likely require some effort to optimize them and make them work in Godot. Animation tools - Compared to the animation tools in Unity, the Godot animation tools suck. This may not be a problem if you are creating a 2D game, or if your 3D game doesn’t include any rigged characters. But since most 3D games DO include rigged characters, this can be something of a problem. Here are some things Unity can do that Godot cannot: bone constraints, animation layering, inverse kinematics, ragdoll effects, composing bone animation in the editor, animation retargeting, and state machines. Technically, there is an add-on to Godot for a state machine, but it is fairly rudimentary and not integrated into the API. It is nowhere close to as good as Mechanim in Unity. So if you use 3D characters in your game, beware. (SEE UPDATE BELOW)  So, in summary, if your game meets all of the following criteria, then Godot is a good choice: There is only one (or maybe two) programmers on the project.You don’t require any extensions to the editor.You are using your own art and sound.Your game does not have any 3D rigged characters. OR…You are happy to compose all your animations in other tools and write your own state machine logic. UPDATE 4/3/18 : As Stanley Yoo pointed out in a comment, it seems that AnimationTreePlayer has been vastly improved in Godot 3.0 and can now reliably be used to make state machines. I hadn’t tried it because it was basically broken in the 2.x branch. ALSO: There was a broken IK module added to 3.0, but it has since been removed. It is being fixed and should be part of the 3.1 update coming sometime in 2018. So there are now (or soon will be) 2 fewer reasons not to use Godot. Under some circumstances, Godot may actually be faster to develop with than Unity. There are less things to configure, and games will look good with the built-in effects and shaders with less effort than is required with Unity. Also, if you use GDScript (similar to Python), programming is fairly simple and you can do it right in the editor.

There's no Quora to answer your most basic, idiotic questions you were too lazy to figure out on your own. But guess what - this actually did some nice things to your brain. Have Goldfish memory and you won't survive in the community. See, you actually had to know things in order to overcome obstacles and actually build software. In programming communities, you were respected because you knew things, not because you had the most resources from which you can derive knowledge. People were in awe of people who knew so many intricacies of C, C++, assembly language, how computers worked, how OS's or compilers were built, who understood programming idioms and bit hacks and computer architecture and so much of everything else.  Knowledge was a currency. It was highly valued and those who had it were revered.

It is simple and elegant, less verbose than Java, boasting features that can make your code succinct, readable and maintainable, yet quite, quite powerful. It is what a modern Object Oriented language should look like. The .net is a powerful framework which enables you to do absolutely anything, because .net framework is to C# what standard library is to C++, plus so much, much more.   Asp.net MVC is a great server-side framework for Web, so C# is not just about building enterprise software. As far as I noticed, there are many jobs out there that look for engineers proficient in C#/.net, although most likely not as many as Java jobs.  Bottom line is - C# is an awesome language and I sincerely recommend anyone working on the Windows platform, or Web, to try it out. Even if you don't make a career out of it, you will have expanded your knowledge with a great language capable of doing wonderful things. You will learn similarities and differences of the language in comparison to C++, or Java, or Python, or whatever language you normally use and you will gain a fresh new perspective.

You’ll have camps of people say Unreal is the best while a lot of people will side with Unity. The reason why I say no, is because it’s really up to the developer and or developer’s and the tool they choose to use doesn’t matter at the end of the day. It’s the product that you put out. There have been critically acclaimed games made in Game Maker that have made more money than a game made in CryTek simply because they focused on outputting a good product. Money isn’t the end all be all, but if a game made in Game Maker is better than a game made in Crytek, then you have to understand that there’s is more too than just an engine. Its the tools you use, and the product you output. Unity certainly is a great engine, and is very user friendly. It’s easy to get running, and easy to make something. But you have to remember, it’s not the the engine you’re working in that’s entirely matters, but the end product. I use Unity a lot and I love it and I’m a huge advocate of using it and supporting it, but there’s a lot of things you need to consider before jumping into app development. Sure selecting which engine you’re going to use for technical merit is a major factor, it is not the only defining aspect of choosing which engine to work with. 3",2021-03-06T16:44:06.064Z,"Is Unity the best app development program?

Answer: First off, we need to see what the goals of each is designed to do before we can answer this question. The SpriteKit framework makes it easy to create high-performance, battery-efficient 2D games. With support for custom OpenGL ES shaders and lighting, integration with SceneKit, and advanced new physics effects and animations, you can add force fields, detect collisions, and generate new lighting effects in your games. Unity gives users the ability to create games in both 2D and 3D, and the engine offers a primary scripting API in C#, for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins, and games themselves, as well as drag and drop functionality. Both of these have a fundamentally different user base they want to connect with. SpriteKit framework is designed specifically for iOS development whereas Unity is designed for full cross platform development. This means when you develop games for iOS with Unity, it isn’t going to be as efficient as SpriteKit framework is. Developers choose the tool that best fits their project and overall design goals. To answer your question, the fundamental aspect of your question is flawed as I see no signs of SpriteKit dying. It has a specific market that it caters to and that market likes that it is built for iOS only as these devs tend to make apps and games for the iOS platform only. 1",2021-03-06T16:53:18.313Z,"Is the game development with the SpriteKit framework dying due to the game engines alternatives like Unity?

I have developed for both the GearVR and Oculus Rift. You can view on of my projects here (Feet First!). There is a HUGE difference between developing a first person game for the Rift vs. developing one for a regular monitor. And it all pertains to character movement. When in VR, it is extremely easy for the user to experience motion sickness. Motion sickness in VR generally occurs when the in-game character (or game world) turns to the right or left independent of the user turning their body or head. For the VR user, their eyes are telling the brain that they are turning (left or right), but the body is telling the brain that they are not turning. This simple biological fact has cause major issues for VR game developers, as you constantly have to be thinking about how movement in your game will effect the VR user. Many types of game movement/mechanics that you use in 1st person game development, just can’t currently be used in VR. In my game, that I linked above - the user has no means to turn on the Y-axis, except for when they actually turn their head. That was one step that I took to reduce the % of users who get motion sick. I hope this helps.

Honestly, I too was in a similar situation up until a few months ago where I had set goals to master master Web Development before the commencement of placement season for my batch in my college in order to bag a well-paying job in a product based company. Now, after having been successful in my venture of bagging a high paying Full Stack Web Development job (INR 9.8 LPA CTC ~ $13,000), by showcasing to the recruiters my self developed project - gathering and compiling data on status of cabs running in a particular location. The MVP of the project had facilities to book a cab, to to search for cabs with 5-star rating drivers, sorting cabs based on female drivers. Once a cab was booked, the user’s selected contacts were sent details of the cab and the driver. Hence, I believe, there wouldn’t be a better time for me to share my journey from a complete amateur to a decently equipped Web Developer. I hope my journey through pits and falls and multiple roadblocks to eventually bagging a dream job, would save you time, money and would make your learning experience better and less troublesome than mine.  To master Web Development, I had left no stone unturned. I had purchased plethora of courses, books, PDF material, learned from YouTube channels, but I always used to hit a wall after a few days into the learning. In majority of the cases, I felt that the author/tutor was in a hurry to get to the end of the course and was not educating the rationale behind writing those pieces of code and assuming that one is well versed with the Web Development environment. However, that is not the case with someone who is a beginner in this domain. Now, the resource that finally helped me master Web Development was Angela Yu’s Web Development Course. I found some of the other courses on some of the similar websites designed from a professional perspective, for someone who already has his all the concepts on point and requires just some finishing touches. However, a beginner, who has little grasp on the field would not find himself at ease by taking courses from those platforms. Whereas, with this website, one can find courses specific to one’s skill set and level of understanding of the subject. From very basic to ultra advanced, there is a course for all genres, hence I opted for the course. If you wish to read more about my journey of how I, a complete amateur in Web Development, mastered the subject, and eventually bagged a high-paying job in one of the software giants, you may consider reading my answer - Meera Sangwan's answer to How do I learn complete web development course? I hope my journey through pits and falls and multiple roadblocks to eventually bagging a dream job, would save you time, money and would make your learning experience better and less troublesome than mine.

Therefore, the more things you try and practice - the better. It doesn’t mean switching all the time. Whatever you take up be sure that you’ve learned everything you can from the source. In fact, many people start their way in programming with the games. I’m one of those people. And I’m convinced that it’s easier to start there because games are engaging and vivid. They keep you enthusiastic for longer and don’t let you burn out.  The tricky thing about game development is coding itself. So if you’re beginner in all that programming stuff as well it might appear a bit challenging. But if you are not forcing yourself and do everything step-by-step, you’ll make it through. Whatever happens, keep calm and move on. Remember that while exploring anything in programming (so is a game dev), the better way is always to turn to the sources with the extensive documentation part. I mean not forums but official documentation and tutorials. Later, when you become mature enough to filter information, you will be able to get the information you need just from everywhere. After all this philosophy finally I want to recommend you Unity. I started there. It’s actually game engine, one of the most popular ones. What I like the most about it are the huge documentation and tutorial parts. They guide you from the simplest games that you can make within an hour to the complicated ones that can take months to grasp. But you will if you take the time to fully explore this incredible source. I suppose that for beginner purposes Unity engine would be the best fit. Later you will explore more of them. Unreal is another popular game engine. In many ways similar to Unity (you’ll appreciate if you turn to it after Unity) but it can be more tricky when you’re completely new. Besides, they’re not focused that much on the beginner level as Unity and don’t provide so much information. Wish you good luck!

Then regulatory approvals etc. That will take at least 9 months . So if all these are completed and this antibody is taken for mass manufacturing then it can be sold allover as a drug to cure and to save all corona patients who are already afflicted with Covid 19 attacks . But this antibody is therapatic drug for patients and not a preventive vaccine . Nevertheless very useful to stop the death rates drastically. Alternative wud be ask Israel to waive it's patent at least for an Indian pharma manufacturer like CIPLA or Zydus cadilla, or GSK ,or Biocon or iPCA , Abbott laboratories like established players or generic medicines manufacturers , to mass manufacture it immediately in millions of doses . Even non established drug manufacturers but reliable ones can be asked to manufacture this antibody once the israel gives up its patent either free of charge or on cash.payments or on profit sharing basis . One more alternative for india to make use of this compulsory licensing provision during Emergency Compulsory Licenses which allows Govts to waive off patents during Emergency even without payments to Israeli firm.But being a friendly country of India union Govt won't like to resort to this route but to a mutually negotiated agreement with Israeli firm. Since all the Indian manufacturers have got the JUGAD capabilities once formula and permission is received from Israel India can quickly scale up manufacturing to billions of doses .These drugs manufactured can save most of the Covid 19 patients when they get infected . It can be a stop.gap arrangement till vaccine by Serum institute Pune is released in market . Vaccine is a preventive measure for all people . Whereas the Israeli antibody is a specific therapatic drug that can only and shall be used in Covid 19 patients to save thier lives . Another suggestion for possible immedite use of this Isreali invented antibody:- Ideally speaking no antibody or a drug can be used unless clinical trials are completed and regulatory approvals are received. That has been the global norm . But Indian govt being a sovereign govt can take a short cut :- Get the Israeli formula and permission to mass manufacturering here in India . Authorise the Indian pharmas to carryout human trials on at least 100 volunteers in India for 3–4 weeks and it will be proved successful no doubts on it . Then ask all the Indian pharma giants to manufacture it under licence from Isreali govt immediately . This arrangement can't be used outside India . But all indian Covid 19 patients can be given this drug that wud prevent most of the deaths .This arrangement can be used till October 2020 till Indian Oxford vaccine 40 million doses gets released by Serum institute Pune .( Subject to Oxford human trials being satisfactory ) ..The world's largest vaccine maker is producing 40 million units of a coronavirus vaccine on trial in Oxford, without knowing whether it works Meanwhile parallel full thrust research into all Ayurvedic, Homopathic,Siddha medicines clinical trials in Covid 19 patients COVID-19: Why Not Traditional Medicine, Says Minister as Clinical Trial of Ashwagandha Begins to be carried out . Definitely we will get some immunity improvement or full cure from these experiments . So it appears that India can have 3 things arriving at the same time .1) First wud be : Covid cure Israeli drug for all infected patients manufactured by Indian pharma companies under license from Isreal 2) second being : Siddha or Ayurvedic or homopathic drug for cure and immunity improvement after human trials for all ,3) Third being: preventive vaccine by Serum institute Pune for all Indians . All can start before sept 2020 or earlier . Since this arrangement doesnot have global regulators approval it can't exported till we recieve it . But it can ve very well used all over India for saving lives of all 135 crores Indians by a decision of sovereign Modi govt even without the approval of global regulators or WHO. So Govt can take a call for three pronged approach as above . That wud help reopen the economy at the earliest and fully as Covid 19 comes under control immediately with the above . Israelis most of them are all Jews are all brainy people. If we see the list of Nobel Laureates of last century Jews comprise bulk of the list .So Israel inventing anything ahead of others is not a surprise .

What your first game in Unity will be will be a very basic, sidescroller or perhaps a space shooter. You need to build your way up from that. Next up, coding. Your knowledge of C and C++ might not be that helpful in Unity, because Unity uses C# (and to some extent, JavaScript) as its primary scripting language. You can get started with C# here. Unity doesn’t include tools for drawing. It uses external image files like JPGs and PNGs for its sprites. What this means is that you need to either master drawing skills on your own in programs like Photoshop or GIMP, or find someone who already has and is willing to work with you. (Or for you. :P) You will not be earning money from Unity just because you have knowledge of how it works. Unity is game design software, not a money dispenser. You need to sharpen your skills, make your products attractive to your audience. That is what will generate your income. Now, as for “being the best” is involved, there’s no real way to do that. You have to prove yourself in the gaming industry, show them that you can make stuff that is original and creative, since that’s what defines a good game from a bad one: originality, fun and creativity.

I checked out the preview videos on it, and inside, I’m seeing instances of GameObject.Find(“game object name”).GetComponent()…. This is a terrible practice, as there is nothing in the front end to tell a scene designer, that a particular object cannot change name. They should have made it public field, and expect it set in the IDE, or find a pure code way to reference it safely in a strongly typed way. Additionally, they are not putting in namespaces, which is an immediate red flag as well, as you are potentially destroying your chances to pull in assets. Most Assets are responsible enough to put in their own, but don’t shoot yourself in the foot. They also make use of “GameManager” as a script, which is another bad practice, as that could imply hundreds or thousands of meanings for what it holds, and developers that use this often fill it with code just as judiciously. They are also using string tags to identify state. This is also a bad practice, as if you change it once, (in the UI or the Code) you lose track of all other things using it. You specifically have to go find it. A better practice is to apply a script, even an empty script to an object, with the sole purpose of acting like a “tag” this allows multiple “tags” and allows for strongly typed identification. I.e. if you have a typo, it won’t let you compile, and when you do make changes. Visual Studio or Mono Develop can both handle auto repairs. This was from about 2.5 minutes of video coverage.

I scrapped it off from a free Unity beginners book PDF that I downloaded. Of course, I did not understand anything but as I went along, I looked at more beginner tutorials and still didn’t understand what everything that I was coding meant. I tried and tried until I could. At last, I understood everything that I coded, and I am still a beginner in Unity 3D development. In conclusion, please don’t go straight into developing AAA games like the studios do once you dive into Unity, learn with experience, and yes, along the way develop the games you think are of your level, progress and make more complex games along the way! Beginner? If you say complete beginner, it won’t take so long as you believe. If you are like 5 mins into Unity, you can follow some fast and helpful online tutorials to make a simple game. If you’re talking about AAA games, please don’t try it as a beginner. Try to learn everything on your way as you develop your own games, and even go on releasing them. Learning is the most important thing. Understand what you do rather than memorising them. DO NOT MEMORISE. It doesn’t help at all. It makes your work seem unnecessarily hard and you will be unable to understand anything.

When someone says VR development it is not clear if it is a game, an experience or a fully functional application. VR is gonna change the world - VR applications are being developed on Unity and Unreal, even though there is no good database support, no generic User Input method, applications will be made for VR. IMHO Unity3D is the best, go for it. Unreal is better? just for really big projects, large teams big companies. Unity3D targets all platforms really well, scripting is mono C#, now there is native support for native 360 video playback, it is evolving really fast, if you think on creating any VR application for GearVR, Daydream, HTCVive, OculusRift, PSVR, Unity3D is the best choice. no way one can compare it to other tools on the market. What makes it even better is that it is free to use for small companies and indie developers even for revenue. Yes, it still needs a lot to be done to become a complete solution for developing VR applications. You still cannot build a VR Photo Viewer on Unity3D because textures cannot be loaded without dropping frames, and that is bad VR experience. There is no “keyboard” for user to enter text on any VR platform yet (daydream is working on it). The VR User Interface is hard to design yet there are plenty of third part options, the native GUI designer is good enough for now, but it will keep evolving. One more point to mention is how great it is on Unity3D to control animations, there is Mecanim inside Unity3D that make it really fantastic, 3D sound is great, physics is good. IMO Microsoft will buy Unity soon. yes it will happen (wait for it) - how did it not happen yet? I don't know - microsoft just bought xamarin; so Visual Studio is the main coding solution for unity (yet you can use mono editor). Will it be good? Well, microsoft Windows 10 is just being realized as a VR platform soon, Project Scorpion will have VR support, sadly xbox one cannot handle it as PS4 can (xbox one can barely achieve fullHD gaming).",2021-03-06T18:25:28.632Z,"Why are most game development tutorial and documentation of engines like unity focused more on iPhone and iPads than Android?

They will say: ""We have no knowledge: it is Thou (O Lord) who Knowest in full all that is hidden. 110 Then will Allah say: ""O Jesus, the son of Mary! Recount My favor to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book, and Wisdom, the Law, and the Gospel. And behold! Thou makest out of clay as it were the figure of a bird by My leave and thou breathest into it, and it became a bird by My leave; and thou healest those born blind and the lepers by My leave. And behold! Thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the Clear Signs, and the unbelievers among them said: `This is nothing but evident magic'. 116 And behold! Allah (on the Day of Judgment) will say ""O Jesus, the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men `worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah""? He (Jesus (a.s.) will say: ""Glory to Thee (O Lord)! Never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing Thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart though I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden. 117 Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say; ie. `Worship Allah my Lord and your Lord'; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up, Thou (O Lord) was the Watcher over them and Thou art a Witness to all things. 118 If Thou dost punish them they are Thy servants: if Thou dost forgive them Thou art the Exalted, the Wise.” Even the Prophet have not passed the judgement and let God to judge.

There is no particular language that is the best language for developing games. Historically, C++ was widely used for a long time, but there is a sizable amount of the industry that has moved away from C++. If you want to learn C++, you can. If you don't want to, there are alternatives. Ultimately, the language is up you. I personally recommend C#. One thing to keep in mind is that it is wise to pick a language that has other uses. For example, if you learn C#, you can write games OR other applications. But if you use some obscure language that was made for a game engine, you might not have much use for it outside of that game engine.  If you want to use an engine, you don't need to learn OpenGL because the graphics are mostly taken care of for you. If you want to write games from scratch without using an engine, then learn it.  In some cases with an engine, you might want to write your own shaders, but the big engines don't require you to write in OpenGL, they usually use HLSL or Cg.  If you want to write games from scratch, you should familiarize yourself with a game library. If you go this route, then note that some game libraries don't include a physics engine, so you'll need to familiarize yourself with that too if that's the case. Typically, some of the main concepts in game development are: concurrencysoundgraphicscollision detection inputIf you make a game from scratch, you'll have to code all this yourself. In a game engine, a lot of the heavy lifting is done for you. For example, when you make a game from scratch and you want to check a collision, you have to check if the objects's positions overlap, whereas in an engine you can just check a boolean like isColliding.  Regardless if you use an engine or want to make a game from scratch, you should be have a good understanding of vector math. Positions and movements of objects in a game are all handled with vectors.   I use a game engine for all my work, but when I started, I coded everything from scratch. Nowadays, a lot of game development is done with engines, which is fine. However, the knowledge you acquire from making a game from scratch is invaluable. In my experience working for various game companies, I have found that my co-workers that had prior experience writing games from scratch tended to be more well-rounded as game developers, and were better at fixing issues because they were more familiar with the underlying problems. Chances are you'll use a game engine if you join a game development company. Many companies develop their own tools though, and don't use Unity, Unreal, or the like. If you become an expert in one engine and then join a company that uses another, you'll still be well-off because understanding game engines is itself an art. Point is, you don't have to learn to make a game from scratch, but it could be useful. Learning a game engine will definitely be useful, in my opinion.  Pick up a book or watch a tutorial and start writing games. The best way to learn is to do, so write code! If you want to use a game engine, the choice is up to you.

If you see in the app store, low rated games are typically those which have tons of other games like them, people get bored with the same type of games. For example, the generic zombie shooting game where the zombies have same models, same quality games, etc. Unity is a free-for-all game engine, which means that anyone can just hook up their own game in a few minutes on the play store. For me, a good Unity game would be a game which has graphics that no other game has, and in some cases you don’t need good graphics to be a good game. You need quality assets, which in most cases must be your own made. Your story can be ethical, related to human nature in a unique and interesting way. Or you can have no story at all, and develop somewhat of a battle royale game. The possibilities are endless. In the end, it all depends on your creativity and skills that make you what you are. Feedback Feedback is the only thing that will make sure that your game is up to the mark and suitable and fun for the public to play. Get feedback from any enthusiastic game developer, and even gamers. It will give you information that you’ll find really valuable in your game dev career, such as what could be added to make the game even better, what could be removed etc. Hope you found this answer helpful! 1",2021-03-06T19:02:43.008Z,"What are the tips you follow to develop a hit game with Unity?

And I’m convinced that it’s easier to start there because games are engaging and vivid. They keep you enthusiastic for longer and don’t let you burn out.

But if you are not forcing yourself and do everything step-by-step, you’ll make it through. Whatever happens, keep calm and move on. Remember that while exploring anything in programming (so is a game dev), the better way is always to turn to the sources with the extensive documentation part. I mean not forums but official documentation and tutorials. Later, when you become mature enough to filter information, you will be able to get the information you need just from everywhere. After all this philosophy finally I want to recommend you Unity. I started there. It’s actually game engine, one of the most popular ones. What I like the most about it are the huge documentation and tutorial parts. They guide you from the simplest games that you can make within an hour to the complicated ones that can take months to grasp. But you will if you take the time to fully explore this incredible source. I suppose that for beginner purposes Unity engine would be the best fit. Later you will explore more of them. Unreal is another popular game engine. In many ways similar to Unity (you’ll appreciate if you turn to it after Unity) but it can be more tricky when you’re completely new. Besides, they’re not focused that much on the beginner level as Unity and don’t provide so much information. Wish you good luck!

Honestly, I too learned these lessons the hard way. But now, having mastered Web Development, and thence having bagged a high-paying Full Stack Web Development job fresh out of college at Airbnb (US $91,700), after facing lots of challenges along the journey, I believe I should put an answer to this question so as to make your learning less troublesome than mine. Well, in my learning journey, I came to realize that a vast majority of resources available for learning Web Development - books, courses, PDF material, etc., are not learner friendly. I felt that the author/tutor was in a hurry to get to the end of the course and was not educating the rationale behind writing those pieces of code and assuming that one is well versed with the Web Development environment. However, that is not the case with someone who is a beginner.  Moreover, in several resources I found that while solving a particular question, the author applies a logic/technique that has not been taught yet. This leads the learner to skip to those sections of the tutorial where that particular topic is discussed. The concepts taught in those sections in turn apply logic that belongs to another concept. Often, this is a repetitive cycle. I dropped the idea of learning from those resources and instead resorted to free video tutorials available on the web. However, over the time I realised a major issue with learning from them is that they being ‘free and open for all’ community, attract lots of creators who are considering to make a quick buck. Content quality of such tutorials is questionable. Moreover, one cannot prove of one’s grasp on the subject to potential employers, due to no provision of obtaining certification for the courses completed on those platforms. This may hinder one’s career, especially in cases where employer has set a criteria of choosing candidates with relevant degree/certificate.

Joseph Raymond 1. There is this absurd theory that Afghanistan has been conquered many times.  Especially by ""Muslims"".  ""Muslims"" as a Nationality?!!!2. An even wilder theory that it was ""captured"" by the Taliban, who were trying to re-establish an Afghan Empire that had been created by earlier Pashtun conquerors.

There is this absurd theory that Afghanistan has been conquered many times.  Especially by ""Muslims"".  ""Muslims"" as a Nationality?!!!2. An even wilder theory that it was ""captured"" by the Taliban, who were trying to re-establish an Afghan Empire that had been created by earlier Pashtun conquerors. ""Taliban"" means Religious Scholars. It is an outfit created by, the Pakistani ISI, with CIA support & funding from American public money, very much in the early 1990s only. The Talibs do not have a medieval lineage. Their mission statement, - to evict all foreign invaders / occupants of their homeland. "" Pashtun conquerors""?!!! Pashto is a native language & Pashtoons native tribe of Afghanistan for ages. How can a society invade itself?3. There is the misconception that the British and the Soviets,  were failing empires on the edge of collapse. Actually that period was 'the finest hour' for the British Empire - not collapse. Britannia would proceed to further consolidate, expand & establish itself firmly in its global empire, especially India. The Russians were no slouches either. They too would grow from strength to strength in their own sphere of influence. Even a scant study of history (Military History not required) will educate that the Russians were able to exert their influence in Afghanistan right up to the 1980s. 4. If the British weren't really trying to establish an empire and they were fighting a proxy war with the Russians, they must have been crazy to fight three most horrible wars with the formidable Afghans. It is a historical fact that the British directly faced off with the Afghans. There was nothing ""proxy"" they went about it. The creme de la creme of the British Indian Army Regiments were committed to these campaigns - Anglo-Afghan War I 1839-1842, Anglo-Afghan War II 1878-1880, &  Anglo-Afghan War III 6 May – 8 August 1919. All inconclusive. Battles were won & lost. Afghans remained in power.5. The USSR did not try to ""conquer"" Afghanistan. They were forced to counter the intense threat mounted by so called ""freedom fighters"" actually warlords promoted by CIA due to the paranoia of the USA :     (a) That the USSR was getting close to the West Asian oilfields which they covet.     (b) Obsession with ""Containment of Communism"".     (c) Fixation on ""Dominos Theory"".6. The USSR moved in due to the very heavy presence of ""Military Advisors"" from the US. The country itself was independent. The overt profession of General Babrak Karmal regime as a Communist government, did not help matters. It was seen as a threat by the religious regimes in the neighbourhood, who also worked/helped in its CIA engineered downfall.7. Afghanistan occupies a very Geo-Politically 'valuable' spot. It was the Key to the Khyber, the land route to the greatly coveted riches of the Indian sub-continent. Hence the target of many attacks/invasions. Attackers/invaders from Persians, Greeks, Turks, Mongols & British have forced themselves on Afghans, but never actually ""conquered"". The calibre of great Afghan generals like General Ahmad Khan, General Sher Shah Suri & their armies are stuff of legend. The latter was even appointed by Babur the Moghul Emperor as the Chief of Army Staff of the Moghul Army. The Moghul Army had Afghan Regiments. Even the British recruited them. 8. Even in the nearly five decades of the Soviet influence in the Warsaw Pact countries, from the East European countries to the Baltic & Central Asian Republics, there is no proof that the USSR wiped out the native language & culture, notwithstanding the western propaganda to the contrary. The same is true for Afghanistan. 9. The US of course never professes conquest of any of the countries attacked - only ""policing"". But the fact remains, that even that policing has been less than 'satisfactory', to the Police themselves. 10. What is lost sight of here, perhaps in a self serving denial sort of way, is that to conquer, the country & its people have to be totally crushed, enslaved & made subservient. This has not been achieved. Mere threats to ""Nuke them back to the Stone Age"" ""Kill them all & repopulate with Americans"" have been proven to be wild fantasies since Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, with the exception of the extermination of the Native Americans and grabbing of their homeland. And the defensive stereotyping that Afghans are ""primitive goat herds"" possessed of ""ancient apathy"" unable to realise that they have been ""conquered"". This, apart from the pathetic attempts to play the divisive Shia vs Sunni card, insults the intelligence of the Afghan people.  Perhaps lessons have not been learnt  from history.",2021-03-06T19:30:38.539Z,"What will you say about the recent developments in the Afghanistan unity government? ",Quora

Let’s continue with the rest 10%. 80% of those who have promising ideas don’t have the experience or skill to turn it into a fun game. Let’s continue with the rest (10x0.2)=2%. 70% of those who made a fun game don’t have any budget to work with a good artist and their game eill have a bad programmer art or worse - a general cartoon style. Let’s continue with the rest (2x0.3)=0.7%. 60% of those who made a fun and stylish game don’t know how to get players. They publish it and wait. And wait. And think about writing a blog or posting to social media, etc etc. These almost never work and they end up having a good game with 100 downloads including their 50 friends and mom. Let’s continue with the rest (0.7x0.4)=0.28%. 50% of those who made a fun and stylish game and got a lot of downloads don’t know how to make money with their game. They don’t care about monetization, put some fullscreen ads or worse - banner ads! Flappy Bird had an awful monetization with banner ads, every monetization expert knows that his $50k daily income could easily be $200k!! The guy knew nothing about it! We end up wih (0.28x0.5) = 0.14% of mobile developers who do everything in the right way. Success is still a big luck even for them and maybe their every second/third game can make any significant profit. So if you see a good and successful game, its developer is most likely one in a thousand! And I bet that this one has a professional background and not just a game developer wannabe who downloaded Unity half year ago. Sad but true story bro. Don’t be an independent game developer. Go and work for a professional studio and learn, learn, learn. How much can you make? On average you can get $0.01 after every player downloaded your simple game which has lots of ads to watch. The number depends on a lot of things like your monetization strategy (simple ads or rewarded videos?) and which country they are playing from (Brazil worth nothing, USA is the holy grail). So let’s assume an average $0.01 per download. After having 10.000 downloads, you will most likely earn $100! It doesn’t matter what kind of simple game you create, you won’t get more than $100-$200 after ten thousand downloads! That’s a fact! That’s just how the ad driven freemium model works. So people, only start making a game seriously if you believe it can get a million players at least!

It provides for abilities that it would not have otherwise - and thus the ability to respond to and fulfill the needs of people within the society true diversity is not simply multiple people (different color and religion) and cultures living in the same space without hate, fear, violence, prejudice, apartheid, privilege for a few, and the oppression of some ! True diversity is a society where people who are “other” are respected cared for and listened to - they are important. The opposite is what is happening to america - an inability or lack of will to respond to a crisis that has killed 200,000 in less than a year. The US did not suffer 200,00 dead in World War 1, that is half the number in World War 2. White Police officers acting out of deep ingrained fear are killing Black citizens of the US, which is then justified because they were not “good” people - so now the criteria for being shot is Black and not a “good” person. It seems to me that there is a different criteria for White people. The boy that was shot in Portland by a opposing demonstrator walked past the police with an assault rifle, the police did nothing - would they have afforded the same to a Black person. Given America’s history with mass shootings shouldn’t they have taken the gun away - by the way all of the mass shootings in the US have been done by White men ! Black people are not shooting up schools, concerts, theaters, shopping areas, invading places of governance with guns and threatening elected officials. Without unity, without consideration, respect and care for others there will be no development in Malaysia - there will be a carving up of the money and resources, and dehumanizing of “other” which in Malaysia’s case most likely means people of color who are not Muslim, tribal people (Dyak for example), Chinese, etc. The lack of a strong civil society in Malaysia will create the space for the development of radical Islamic control. Al-Shabaab already has a foothold in Malaysia, East Sabah (North Borneo) was “invaded” by Abu Sayyaf - what if they had linked up with local radicals - their fate would not have been so certain. Once Malaysia becomes a radical Muslim state the lives of all of its people, especially its women will change. Extreme Sharia law would be imposed, women excluded from public life, Non-Muslims subjected to institutional discrimination which will manifest itself in drastic ways. Malaysia’s elite will fee, the country will descend into ruin. All of this in the middle of an environmental crisis which threatens not just the wildlife of Borneo, but all Malaysians and everyone in the world - what ability to mitigate, and or change to “defeat” the crisis would Malaysia have ? so the short answer to your question is unity in diversity is an important aspect in the national development of Malaysia, because without it there is no path forward which provides for the improvement and survival of Malaysians.

6043df27ed76476feda36b27,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-learning-game-development-on-Unreal-Engine-or-Unity-in-2019?-,"I’ll explain how you can start learning and then I will tell you my story. If you want to learn Unity, then watch Brackeys on YouTube. If you want to learn Unreal Engine, then watch Virtus on YouTube. If you have money then you should also visit the website, Udemy, and maybe pick up an Unreal Engine or Unity course. But which engine to choose? Well, I recommend that you try both to begin with. Go through one of Brackeys’ tutorials, and then go through one of Virtus’ tutorials and then decide which engine you like best and continue learning that one. Whichever one is best all depends on what type of game you want to make. Now, I started my Game Development about 2 years ago, when I curiously searched up on YouTube ‘How to make a game’ and I instantly found out about Unity. It was early in the morning so I got up to turn my computer on and I decided I would start to learn Unity. I adjusted my YouTube search to ‘How to make a game in Unity’ and I found a tutorial series titled, ‘How to make a game in Unity’ by Brackeys. I spent the whole day following that tutorial and I was pretty surprised as by the end of the day, I had a fully playable runner game with 3 levels on it. I had only a laptop then, and it wasn’t very good, so Unreal Engine was out of the picture. So I continued to watch Brackeys on YouTube. At first I didn’t understand what was going on, I just followed along, however as I was repeating certain things in different tutorials (Getting user input, physics based functions, collision based functions), I started to understand what they did and I tried to make my first game without a tutorial. It was pretty bad, but I had fun making it. I was learning on and off for about a year and a half, just launching Unity when I felt like it, and then making a small game or following another tutorial. Then I got a Gaming PC. And then it occurred to me that I can now use Unreal Engine since I now have a PC powerful enough to run it. I searched on YouTube ‘How to make a game in Unreal Engine’ and I found Virtus. I followed his FPS tutorial series for a while until I got bored, and I didn’t understand anything that was going on, so I wasn’t learning anything, and I went back to Unity. Then I discovered a website, Udemy, where you can buy online courses on Game Development, and I immediately saw a 60 hour long Unreal Course on sale for £9.99 and I had to get it. After going through that course, I have been using Unreal Engine ever since, and I am currently developing a bigger open world game at the moment. Anyway, that is how I started learning, and how I ended up where I am today. And if you decide to get into game development then good luck. 1",2021-03-06T19:59:35.641Z,"How do I start learning game development on Unreal Engine or Unity in 2019? ",Quora

That's a great question. I own a mobile game company with 55,000,000 downloads and also a game dev software company. I've worked with a lot of new entrepreneurs who have had a lot of success in the gaming world like David Reichelt who created Color Switch, Florian Porkert who created the #1 game, Ball Jump, and many more.  Here are my top 5 reasons why game development is a good industry for entrepreneurs: #1 - Low Cost of EntryIf you know how to code, or use codeless software like our software Buildbox (which is what David and Florian use), then you mitigate the huge cost of starting a business. This is obviously situational, but from my examination, it's been a huge selling point for successful entrepreneurs. When you're trying to start a business the most ideal is one that has a low start-up cost and a high potential for growth. Video game development has both. Not only is it a billion dollar industry that's growing bigger every year, but there's also a low cost of entry if you can make your own game. Creating your own game by doing the coding yourself or using codeless development tools can cut your start-up costs by thousands of dollars. However, if you don't know how to code and don't want to use codeless software, then obviously this could be negative because hiring programmers is not cheap. #2 - Distribution is Covered In most businesses, distribution is a real pain in the ass. You either have to create distribution channels or spend a lot on advertising to get eyeballs on your product. Both of these options can be time consuming and expensive. With the creation of the App Stores and Steam, this has been mostly alleviated. You simply upload your game to the store, and it's available with a nice built-in sales page. You don't even have to create a website if you don't want to, though you would need a Facebook page or some other online presence for support. There are other challenges here with actually getting the game seen, but the physical distribution of your product is completely automated. There's no complex distribution channels that you have to set up, additional hidden fees or restrictions. You can easily publish your game on multiple platforms with minimal hassle. #3 - No Shipping and Endless Stock Unlike most businesses out there, you don't have to pay to ship your game when someone purchases it, and the stock never runs out. That was a huge bonus for me 10 years ago, to initially get into software in general. The thought of building a business where the stock never depletes was just very cool ;) There's no need to worry about keeping up with inventory, manufacturing or warehouse costs. With digital products like games, you'll always have endless stock that can be easily distributed to markets around the world. #4 - Zero Sales Process Similar to above, because video games are a digital product, there is no actual sales process involved. Sales of your video game do not require you, or anyone else, to talk to a customer. You can generate revenue at any time, regardless if you are at the grocery store, working another job or even sleeping. It's all on auto-pilot allowing you to work wherever and whenever you want. #5 - The Fun Factor Most importantly, it's fun. When you choose a business to work in that you are passionate about, the work doesn't feel like work anymore. It becomes enjoyable. You'll have more energy and confidence. When you do what you're passionate about, persistence also comes more easily which often leads to success. If you're an entrepreneur that enjoys games, it's a great industry to be in.",2021-03-06T20:09:04.351Z,"How does Unity offer incredible possibilities for game developers and creators across industries and applications?

There are way too many moving parts for individuals to use tools that everyone on the production cannot also use. Likewise, how an approved tool is used, the specific production process the team lead requests is often necessary for additional tools and processes to operate. Sure, various studios and production teams will have flexibility, and allow deviations - but that is only practical when a production is beneath a given size.  As soon as the production has specialized teams for different characters, different sequences / areas, or is simply larger than a dozen people that flexibility has got to go because simplification of the production process is the only way to actually deliver without undue and unnecessary stress caused by digital asset A not plugging into production system B and having that happen all over the place. Consider this: your ambition and the audiences' expectation is great art - that's not possible if your production process has production deviations consuming team effort to fit, to inter-operate, or simply be there at all. The easiest way to kill that creative effort drain, and focus on the art, is to follow the designated production pathway. Typically it is that way for a large list of reasons, such as production tools that only run in the approved software, or operate from file formats generated by that software, or a side effect file is generated used elsewhere by the production.

6043e496ed76476feda373bf,https://www.quora.com/How-is-nuke-helpful-to-3D-artists?-,"I Can Tell You 9 things 3D artists need to know about Nuke  Puss In Boots was the first DreamWorks movie to fully adopt Nuke Nuke is taking over the VFX world and is being used not only by compositors, but also by 3D artists and animators. So if you haven't got onboard with the Nuke wave, now is the time. Learning new software can be time-consuming and frustrating but when it comes to Nuke it doesn't have to be complicated. Here are a few good things to know when getting started. 01. It has a node-based work flow First things first, NUKE is famous for its node-based work flow. You don't need to know many nodes or combinations in order the get results, simple does it. Because of the node graph layout, working in Nuke is transparent and completely non destructive. Which means that you can change things around any way or any time you want to, you can even create your own custom nodes. With the the roto node, rotoscoping is as flexible and simple as you want it to be. Combine it with almost any other node, for example a pre-multiply or a tracker, and with the accessible time line you can create animated masks with ease. You can import your 3D passes and combine them with the versatile merge node for detailed adjustments. 02. It's fully customisable  Cinesite relied heavily on Nuke to create scenes of destruction in Monument's Men For the picky artist, it is nice to know that Nuke is fully customisable - you can set up your workspace any way you want it, the interface allows you to work in a number of different ways, whether its through colours, layout or work flow. It really is a preference. It is even possible to change the controls to more familiar ways. Little features like custom coloured back drops and sticky nodes allows you to organize your script any way you want to. 03. It's very flexible Nuke is flexible in so many ways. Importing and exporting geometry, camera's or tracking data from or to other programs has never been so easy. And the good news is, there's so many different ways of doing it. Because of Nuke's excellent flexibility, it adapts effortlessly to any pipeline and works well with other software like Maya, Mari, Modo and Houdini. Furthermore, Nuke reads a lot of different files formats. For example JPEG, Tiff, Exr, mov and even RED files are supported and many, many more. It saves the hassle of converting files before import. 04. There's no loss of quality  ImageWorks used Nuke to create the Red Queen’s oversized head in Alice in Wonderland Because of Nuke's 32-bit floating point linear colour channels, it has a real advantage over other packages. Everything that comes into Nuke, comes out the same; no colour shifts and no quality loss. And with a variety of nodes it's very easy to convert pictures or do batch adjustments to your images when needed, whether it is changing the colourspace or adjusting the resolution. Relighting is another great option in Nuke. There are of course several ways of doing this, using either pWorld/pObject/nWorld against imported geometry, setting up simple shaders and lights and rendering them out as grading mattes or overlays using the scanline renderer. It is also possible to make 3Dmasks to help the roto stick to the geo, for better lighting results. 05. It offers a fantastic workspace Another great feature in Nuke is its capability for full 3D node-based compositing. You can import 3D geo into Nuke for light, rendering, or use it for holdouts and projections. It allows you to import FBX, Alembic and obj files. And with the option of importing camera data from Maya or Houdini it lets you combine live action 2D and 3D elements quickly. Nuke also has a great particle tool set. The 3D particle system makes it quick and easy to emit, manipulate and create a range of advanced particle effects - such as breaking windows, dust, fire and rain - without the need to go back and forth between an external application like Houdini and Nuke. 06. It has Python integration  Part of Aardman pipeline on Pirates! was built around a Python/QT framework which was a great fit with Nuke Python can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other languages. Python is a fully integrated scripting language and allows you to make widgets and scripts with very little programming knowledge. It allows rapid development of everything from snippets to quickly alter the contents of multiple nodes control panels, right up to integrating with external tools such as asset management software. 07. Tracking is easy Whether you want to create keyframes from real life footage with 1 or 4 point track, Nuke's 2D tracker has a variety of options and menus to make the tracking easier for you. The versatility of this node makes it possible to import tracking data from other software, for further use and manipulation in Nuke. In addition the planar tracker is also an option, should you find that the 2D tracker is not sufficient enough, it gives you the option of tracking areas in your image sequence that lie on a plane, for placement of new 2D elements on a flat surface. Nuke has a built in camera tracker that can be used to analyse 2D image sequences and automatically reconstruct the 3D camera with unknown, approximate or known focal distance and constant or varying constraints. A camera calibrator also lets you track and solve from reference stills, making it useful for set or object modelling. 08. You can animate in different ways  Look Effects used Nuke to composite practical elements for arthouse hit Moonrise Kingdom There are numerous ways of animating in Nuke, you can choose to manually set key frames on the time line or combine tracking data for a more supported result. Furthermore, there is the option of combining the curve editor and dope sheet, for better and easier control of key frames. 09. It's best to try one thing at a time There is of course much more to learn about Nuke, but when starting out it is important to keep it simple. Trying out one thing at a time usually makes for the best results and a better understanding. You don't have to be technical or a know it all to work with Nuke. Take your time, give it a go and get creative.Good luck.",2021-03-06T20:22:46.698Z,"How is nuke helpful to 3D artists? ",Quora

Just by watching a new show reel that just comes out, or a software update can lead you to change you focus on a new topic! One of the things I regret is that I didn't focus on one area, I was learning VFX, sculpting, scripting, Visualisation etc.. you name it! the result was mediocre work. It's only when I started focusing on one industry that I improved. For me it was 3D Visualisation. You can always learn more topics, but one at a time.  Klaas Nienhuis What do you wish you knew when you started 3D? I didn't really start in 3D. I did it on the side and then that part of my work grew. I find it pretty difficult to find a good piece of advice. For me, being very specialized has worked out great but only with a solid network to collaborate with. I think I wish somebody had told me to put more effort in a good network of friends and businesses while specializing my skillset. What top tip can you share with us? The second part is easy, my top tip is to learn programming. Even if it's just a little bit. The stuff you can do with simple one-line scripts in 3ds Max is way more powerful than having a big toolbox of downloaded scripts.  Neil Poppleton What do you wish you knew when you started 3D? Its all about enjoying the learning experience and ride. What top tip can you share with us? Be good at time management etc, but the best tool i have used almost every week for the past 17 years is PSD manager. A golden tool.  David Houston What do you wish you knew when you started 3D? When I started out I wish that Pinterest was available, its such and invaluable resource for collating project information, research and advice from other artists. Being able to share resource globally helps a great deal in planning and developing a project from a lighting and composition perspective. What top tip can you share with us? My best tool I use and probably my biggest hack now is a script called find and bind, it aligns any sun to the hot spot of an hdri in an instance. It also allows you to physically rotate the dome light and that automatically shifts the light position in both your dome light map and also your environment map.  Patric Verstraete What do you wish you knew when you started 3D? The best way to start in 3D is to get as much software as you can and play around with it, until you find the one which is best for you. I didn’t do that, I started with 3ds max. At that time it was 3ds Max 6 with the disks! So it was really hard to make progress because there weren’t any tutorials, or very few. So I started to learn it by myself. Then go onto the web and join forums, find tutorials, get in touch with people and share your work and ask for feedback. It is important to get extra comments on mistakes that you don't see, and last but not least, never give up! What top tip can you share with us? Some plugins that everyone needs in 3D Visualisation ...Forest Pack: Forest Pack does away with all the hassle by providing not only the scattering tools, but also large libraries of photorealistic trees and plants. Rail Clone: Generate complex parametric objects including fences, stairs and floors faster than ever before. Vray render-engine: I started off visualising using Mental Ray, but once I gave V-Ray a go, I never looked back. Of course there are many scripts available, but the most important to me are ... Floor Generator: This plugin will let you create individually boarded floors, perfect for wooden floors. Image Composition Helper: Automatically visualise the Rule of Thirds inside the 3ds Max Viewport to instantly improve the look of both your 3D static renders and animation. Relink Bitmaps: Easily relink missing files like bitmaps, VRayMeshes, Mental Ray proxies and VRayHDRI when they change directories or when you move computers.  Dimitar Gongalov What do you wish you knew when you started 3D? I would have liked to know - what is the best software to produce the most realistic images. What is the shortest way to super realistic images (is it modelling, texturing or lighting) I found that the order is light setup then texturing and finally modelling. What top tip can you share with us? My top scripts I cannot work without are... VMC Script: I use this every day. Turbo Reverse: For remodeling some ready made models.

Second key point: the level of quality depicted in your CG Reference is such that not a single person would do this work.

(Slight tangent: I own an operate a web site that does exactly this: given a photo of a person it generates a full body 3D geometry likeness of them. You can see examples at my 3D Avatar Store Blog. Using my web service, your base geometry can be done in a half hour, for an exported and in your hands price of $11.)  With basic geometry and texture maps, the character needs hair, clothing, and rigging.  Your CG Reference has high quality hair, and this is where the purpose of your character becomes very important: is the character going to be rendered into media, like a video clip? Or is the character going to be real time rendered on a phone, game console, or PC?  Or is the character going to be real time rendered in a professional setting, like a staged show or presentation (where you have control over the hardware)? Or is the character intended to be 3D printed? Or is the character expected to be multi-channel, with versions of the character for games, pre-rendered media, and maybe even 3D printing? (Meaning you really need multiple characters, each optimized for that media.) So, depending upon your target media, how the hair is achieved can be very different. Pre-rendering enables expensive physics for both the motion and the lighting of the strands of hair. Real time rendering has a range of techniques, each targeting a different class of device with greater or lessor rendering capabilities. At my web site, we offer a basic selection of ""solid form"" polygon wigs, with diffuse/normal/specular maps creating a low expense (meaning cheap to render) wig. They are not as high quality as the hair in your reference. The high quality hair in your reference looks like the pre-rendered type, probably done with something like Shave and a Hair Cut (joealterinc), which requires a dedicated digital artist and probably several days, if not a week.  The rigging of the character can be handled with any number of the auto-rigging services becoming available. Once again, at my web site we generate our full body characters in a format called Fuse, published by Adobe/Mixamo. At the Mixamo web site (www.mixamo.com) they offer pre-made 3D characters as well as free rigging of the Fuse format characters created at my web site. They also have a limited selection of clothing and over 2000 motion capture animations compatible with their Fuse rigs.  Basically: the question of how long requires knowledge of your purpose, and then knowledge of the wealth of services available. I've only touched on them. There is quite a bit more that can be given knowing more about your purpose.

Texturer: Texture artists create texture maps that gives model color and surface textures, imagine coloring the marble statue, that's pretty much the idea. However, we don't paint directly on the mode, we ""skin"" the surface of a model, make it flat, and paint it (usually) in Photoshop. After we finish, the texture wraps back to the model.    (this is what a texture map looks like).  Rigger: Now things will get a bit more technical, after the model is created and texture is painted, a rigging artist will come in and add a skeleton to the model. You need to have some really good anatomy knowledge to figure out where to put the rigs and handles so your character/creature/objects can move convincingly.    (there are a sub set of riggers who specialize in mesh painting. So imagine mesh painting is like identify muscles and tendons of a body. You identify which area a certain rig governs, much like attach muscle and tendons to the bones and make sure the bones pull the right part of the body. Imagine how weird it would look if your lower arm was pulled by a bone from your shoulder... different studios has their own way to handle this task, mesh painters are a separate position, or riggers can do it when they create the rigs.)  Animation: now finally we get to the animation part. Animation artists will take a rigged (most likely already textured) item and make it move in a timeline.    Motion Capture: Some people think because of technology of motion capture, animators job doesn't matter anymore. TOTALLY NOT TRUE. Even after character movement is captured with motion capture, someone needs to come in to clean up the shot, apply mo-cap to existing rigged models, and smooth out the animation. There's a lot of additional work goes into mo-cap and skilled animators are the best to do it.  There's A LOT more involved in 3D animation, lighting, particles, mat painting, physics, audio... some I probably don't even know, and each one can be broken down into smaller tasks.

I was lucky I had regular clients but if you bid on odesk, elance and other sites, you will fight with modellers that will work for pennies or are just building their portfolio. As with all freelance work, one month you might earn a lot, and then next 3 months you could earn $30 total. That happened to me sometimes, and was becoming more and more frequent.  Up to ~2003 it was different. You had to solve spline networks for your models, push and pull tangents to get proper curvature and be smart about every polygon because computers were very slow. Now you can open ZBrush and in a few minutes have an object that was only possible after 3 days of pushing and pulling bezier tangents. Back then you could have earned more in any 3D branch as there were not many people doing this. With all the photogammetry tools today, ""3d from photos"", 123dcatch, photomodeler, low cost 3d scanners, Kinect and smartphone 3d scanners, ZBrush and other tools, it is becoming less and less profitable field. It is a job field in decline. Even if you are the best 3d modeller in the world you still have only two hands and limited time, and there is an upper limit of how much you can earn. In 2007 I had so much 3d modeling work that I registered a business and even started subcontracting 3d modellers with lower rates and also taught non-3d people some parts of the workflow. I would then improve their models and add finishing touches before submitting them to clients. Unfortunately most of them were just too unprofessional and hard to work with, so I closed the business and gradually left that field. I moved to other branches of IT and software development a few years ago as it did not make sense for me to continue investing more time in that. I still have a lot of fun 3d modeling, and this is my #1 hobby, and a nice contrasting activity to other IT work.  In case you start pursuing organic 3d modelling field and get into ZBrush: do not make portfolio made of monsters and other nightmare creatures. These are too random to demonstrate any real skill, and to most people it just suggests the modeler might be somewhat disturbed or otherwise weird person. I never hired someone with only monsters in their portfolios. Good luck if you plan to pursue this field. Continue Reading",2021-03-06T20:30:42.287Z,"How much do freelance 3D modelers earn? ",Quora

Now let me quickly add that of course being able to draw will just make life easier as a 3d artist and may very well help when sculpting, but that's only partly because that person who is already capable of drawing really well most likely has a great understanding of anatomy already. With that being said, if you want to improve your 3d skills... Here is my advice. Study up on anatomy, how the body deforms in motion and use this to learn how your topology should flow in your mesh. The more you understand with regards to topology and the anatomy of whatever you're making, like animals or characters for example, the better your model will come out. There are two aspects to the topology stuff, some topological flow will improve the mesh for sculpting or sub-division modeling whilst other topology will help you with deforming a lower polygon mesh when animating for such uses like mobile or web video games. A good understanding for topology and anatomy alike will definitely improve your modeling across organics and character like creations, I don't mean sit there with a medical manual and start learning the latin names for everything, but there is such a thing as ""anatomy for artists"" that will simplify and break things down to the key and surface forms of the anatomy this will help significantly. Along with studying up on these things you should of course, PRACTICE! The more you practice the better you will become. If you can't make your own reference images to model, then go online and snag whatever you can. People who put their front and side references online may not want you to make their models and claim that its your design but you'll find many will not care if you make the model as practice or for your portfolio work, especially if you leave some credit information linking back to them, and if you're not sure just try to reach out and ask, this is a very good thing for not only the 3d artist needing something to model as practice but the 2d artist to get an extra piece of exposure because the more you promote your 3d model and portfolio the more traffic may get back to their portfolio and if the right person comes along then it could be a win, win for the both of you. The reasons I've mentioned anatomy and topology is because what defines a 'good' 3d artist is someone that can model something that will deform well when rigged. Understanding how the body deforms in motion will help you understand where you could start to place certain edge loops and topology on your character meshes to help the model deform as such when it gets animated, which will result in a better model. If you're more into the hard surface type of modeling such as weapons, props and the like then I'd suggest doing the same thing but look into mechanical creations, model things as photo-realistic as you can using sub-division methods and just keep at it and try more complex models as you progress through. If you're into the weapons model some handguns then progress to a sub-machine gun and then an assault rifle to a light machine gun, things like that form of progression, the technique is the same but the final output will be progressively more complex and you'll find yourself challenging your skills as you go. Keep at it! You'll improve.  Kind Regards,Patrick Griffiths.

The following was the old answer(where i asumed you meant using 3d graphics as illustrations).. some of it may still be helpful.(skip to the list at the end if your in a hurry) I started as a general illustrator.. working with traditional as well as digital illustrations.. as a side project i kept experimenting with 3d.. for every project i did, i would do a 3d version for myself. Once i started to get the quality that i liked.. i showed it to my boss.. who in turn showed it to a client, who didn't like it. But i kept at it with other projects.  Eventually that same client came back with another project and said that he thought the 3d illustration style we showed him the last time would be great for this project. I learnt a lot working on that project because suddenly i had to learn how to render my images in hi-rez print quality..  In parallel to this i started taking part in online cg challenges.. this really helped me hone my skills since these are very competitive and also helped beef up my portfolio. Pretty soon the next 3-4 projects we did were all 3d illustrations.. printed out as large wall prints for office interiors.   Shortly after that i landed a job at a gaming company during an informal visit.. i showed the HOD my work on my online portfolio and he offered me a job on the spot. They needed a storyboard and concept artist(2d skills) and would give me access to all the tutorials and other 3d skills i wanted to learn. My point is: 1) Get off your ass. Don't  just sit at home and do ""personal projects"" .. take part in online challenges and contests .. thats the best way to accelerate the development of your skills. They also help you learn some basic project management and train you to work with a concrete deadline. 2) Develop a few clients.. i found that people who need interior graphics and NGOs looking for posters/leaflets etc.. are open to new styles..Do a few assignments for them in 2d etc.. and then once they are comfortable working with you and know that your a reliable freelancer.. start pitching 3d style illustrations. 3) Maintain an updated portfolio. you never know when it will come in handy. My job at the gaming company happened during an informal visit.. i was with a friend who was visiting his cousin who worked there.. i didn't have any printouts, or even a pen drive of my work with me!.. but i was able to open my online portfolio on the HOD's computer and dazzle him. 4) Organise your portfolio.. show your process documentation.. not just the final render. This shows that you have project management skills are more than just a guy who knows some software. I started with my own site.. with my own weird design.. but quickly realized that people don't have the patience to learn how to navigate a new ""designer"" site.. just to see your work.. keep it simple, maintain a Behance or Deviant art portfolio.. 5) Broaden your horizons. keep experimenting with other parallel skills.. i kept working on flash.. unity 3d etc.. and only settled on animation and illustration as my exclusive work after 8years of being a jack of all trades. 6) Don't be a slave to just one 3d program.. learn a few of them.. this will help you realise that they all follow the same basic principles. This will also come in handy if you ever plan on ending up at a 3d animation outfit... All the big ones use their own proprietary software.. so you need to be prepared to learn a new program at the drop of a hat :) 7) First impressions matter. Whenever meeting(real life or skype) a person for the first time make sure your well groomed.. that first impression is what decides whether they take you seriously or not. I've shown up for second and third meetings without having shaved or showered.. by then it doesn't matter.. most people are used to artists being slobs However if you didn't complete a deadline ..or are asking for an advance... cleanup your act. Don't underestimate the importance of this last one. You need them to take you seriously. Hope that helps. All the best. Sorry about the confusion, heres the answer regarding doing 2d work now -  1) Contact graphic designers.. a lot of them can't draw! they hire illustrators all the time.All my first assignments were for designers who couldn't draw. note: am not being derogatory of graphic designers.. They are great at the other stuff, I trained as one myself.. i just knew how to draw as well. 2) Other illustrators and animators will usually need a hand on big projects(i have occasionally subcontracted out work) 3) Book publishers..cant hurt to give a few of them your card/email. 4) Zoos and Museums often hire illus Continue Reading",2021-03-06T20:39:52.158Z,"How can I get into the digital illustration industry as a 3D artist?

That is their market, that's what they build for and they are very good at it. That being said, not everyone has access to Boxx or can afford their prices.  For my own 3D workstation, I built it myself. Workstation grade hardware is expensive but a little bit of know-how can turn enthusiast grade consumer parts into a competitively powerful entry level 3D rig depending on your specific needs. MSI and Alienware aren't in the business of providing workstation solutions. That just isn't in their wheelhouse. You could use MSI or Alienware hardware for 3D graphics but understand that MSI in general and Alienware in specific produce hardware for gamers. Gaming computers are nice toys that some people think are powerful computers, but the truth is that they fall well short of real workstation horsepower. (Apple is even worse and don't get me started on the MacPro's mediocrity...)  If you want a real workstation and you need to buy one instead of building one, my first recommended stop would generally be a Lenovo Thinkstation or an HP Z-series workstation. In the land of laptops I'd be looking at a Lenovo W-series Thinkpad. Assuming that Boxx and Eurocomm weren't options for whatever reason. Well, Lenovo or HP on the assumption that you don't have access to Digital Storm, Origin or Maingear. I hope that helps, if you have further questions, I'm available in the comments.

First, find the 3D software that suits you best, most of them will let you download trial version so you can get a feel for them. Some have a much steeper learning curve than others, and most tend to lean towards better results using a particular style of modelling, so get to know what sort of 3D images you want to produce and find the software that leans towards that style. Personally, I have found, as a graphic designer, that Cinema 4D is by far the easiest and most intuitive to learn, but it is a personal thing so you will need to experiment. Also Blender is an excellent professional level modelling app, although I find the interface a little awkward as a designer, it is absolutely FREE, so a good one to get stuck into at no cost!! The other side is what type of 3D art do you want to produce? If it is more traditional art then you need to learn things like composition, colour theory etc. The best 3D modular in the world cannot produce good work without understanding the basics or art theory. Of course, you could have a natural talent for these things as many do! One of the best places to start learning everything from the software to composition to colour theory is on the web. There are lots of tutorial sites out there are YouTube is most definitely your friend. Find out the names of top artists in the area you wish to learn then Google them, you will find a lot of them actually produce inspirational videos online and a lot also do tutorials.

How you show off your abilities will depend completely on who you’re marketing your reel for. If you are looking for a job, recruiters are mostly interested in how good an end-product looks. They don’t really care about the breakdowns, nor do they understand them most of the time - and in truth they’d prefer a reel be between 30 seconds and a minute - so there’s not much time for breakdowns anyway. If you do a reel without any breakdowns for recruiters, I would always have another in your back pocket for your first interviews. Be ready to show off to the people hiring you (which is usually going to include at least one supervisor) how you did your work - not just what it looked like in the end. They care about that aspect, and they have an extra minute or two to be sure you’re who they’re looking for. So, for breakdowns, you’ll want to show off what you think others would find the most interesting. If you’re a compositor, show off that the thing that looks like it’s part of the backplate is actually completely digital. If you’re a character modeller, show off your topography and your character in a cool action pose. If you’re a texture/lighting artist, really highlight how subtle all the details are in your textures. As a rigger, let them see your rig being animated in a really cool way. As an animator, show off the layers of follow through, overlapping action, etc. There are countless ways to show these things off - and I would always suggest talking to a compositor first so you get passes that will work seamlessly together for a refined final reel. The key is to keep it short and sweet. You never want to spend more on a breakdown than the length of the original shot (or 3–5 seconds, whichever is longer). No one wants to see a 1 minute turntable of a cool model in 5 different poses. After the first 10–15 seconds for one or two poses (generally an A or T pose, and a dynamic pose) it’s time to move on to the next. No one wants to see your screen capture of animating every single facial control on your rig - just show off that the basic stuff works, then show off the one or two cool things you threw in - preferably at double or triple speed. For anyone trying to develop a demo reel, I’ve been in the industry for more than a few years. Feel free to comment here with a link to your reel and I’ll give back some constructive criticism. That depends on what kind of “3D artist” you’re referring to. Usually when someone refers to a 3D artist they mean a visual effects (VFX artist). Visual effects can include: modeling (hard surface and character/organic), texturing/lighting, surfacing (hair/fur/cloth/etc), rigging, animation, simulations (explosions/water sims/destruction sims/fog/dust/etc), compositing, stereoscopic compositing, VFX generalists, and more.

Or, Your smartphone, a tripod or steady surface, the object or willing participate against a plain and evenly contrasted and lit background. Shoot in 4k if your camera allows it so you can also pull textures from the same file. Obviously for human models, photos of nude models fit the bill better if you're going for fully visible anatomy reference, but of course your model has to consent and be comfortable with this. Many professional pose modelers are and are cheaper than you might expect. (Okay, this is starting to sound wrong) Sides, front and back in any situation. Top and bottom if needed. If you need more than 4k resolution for your model, then capture in sections and then auto stich in Photoshop. In this configuration just shooting in two sections gives you a combined pixel density of 8k. Obviously you want to generate correct UVs of your model if you haven't already. Output that to the same exact resolution space you need for your model and then overlay your stiched texture file in the correct UV grid spaces in Photoshop. (Or equivlent) Slicing up and repositioning the textures will most likely be required for complex or non planar UVs that are unfolded, which is what you'll want if you're doing this correctly. I also reccomend blurring the remaining texture that is just outside the UV shell borders/lines. Then, there are a host of applications that will generate all the PBR channels from your original stiched photo automatically, and allow you to adjust parameters in each channel. Some will even set the correct naming conventions for various popular render engines on output. Not a nessecity mind you, but makes life easier for sure. Just make sure the output file is the same exact resolution of your project. Always keep the resolution consistent across the process if that's a requirement. Games will typically do 2048 or 2k, which is a fair balance between quality/detail and performance. For product final renders and animations, VFX, films, I would not reccomend going below 4k, or 4096. It will most likely bite you in the butt in post production and limit opportunities that 4k + workflows afford you. Nothing will drop you outside of realism quicker than noticeable soft and stretched pixels with inconsistent pixel densities through out your model/s.",2021-03-06T21:52:23.607Z,"Where can I find the best 3D artists to create still images of photo real humans?

Do everything by yourself but ask lot of advices from people who are specialized in their own sectors to gain deep understanding about the format you want to be directing. Mastering every aspect is not necessary (it is impossible for the most) but gaining deep understanding is. Use paid tutorials that are made by professionals, they save you lot of time vs the random free ones. This is a long road so work smart and try to get into the industry as fast as you can by first specializing on one aspect, 3D art for example. Two reasons: Firstly you need to pay your bills, you don’t want to live your best years in poverty. Secondly you will learn so much faster when working for a studio. In studio ask as many “stupid questions” as you can from your co-workers. Ask what they do, how they do it, why they do it like that, what would happen if they would do it this way, what tools they use, why do they like those tools.

Also, Let me be very clear here, Work does not depend on Age / Freshness / or any other Societal term.

So, if you think, you are getting less amount, follow these: Change the JobIncrease Your Salary Negotiation SkillsStart your own small studioBut Never Cringe about being paid less. This is Sarvo VFX and you can also find me on YouTube . My Real Name is Sarvodaya Pratap Singh and Sarvo VFX by Profession. I am a co-founder of Digital Marketing Company Sarvotarzan. VFX Artists are hired in India by: Through Networking obviously, as i suppose there is nothing in this world that can’t be solved by networking.But no matter what and how good you are, as a person / at communication skills, you have to perform the task and complete the work provided. So obviously Show Reel is the Minimum Required Criteria.The salary totally depends on your skills. I have personally known to many guys who are in their 20s and are earning Rs 50k per month and have also met some guys who are in their 50s but earning only Rs 20k per month. So all i can say that salary always depends on your skills unless you have some other other skills like sycophancy or office politics. But as a Fresher in Delhi / Mumbai, you can at least expect 20k i suppose. In India, earlier the when the field of VFX was not left unexplored and the people were not aware of Special Effects / VFX / After Effects / 3D Maya etc. All they had some age old screen effects and the directors were happy about it then really the salary would have been in deep ####. But thanks to Globalisation & Internet, we got to see some excellent work from Indian Movie Production Houses as well. Personally me, Sarvo VFX has done work in many movies but can’t name them in here due to copyright issues have given my VFX Supervision in many Hollywood & Bollywood movies. Personally, i consider myself as a Mid Level Expert in Houdini / Nuke / Adobe AE / Adobe Photoshop.",2021-03-06T21:57:41.875Z,"Why are most 3D artists not happy with their jobs in India? ",Quora

6043fba2ed76476feda3889d,https://www.quora.com/Do-3D-artists-for-video-games-need-to-know-math-and-programming?-,"The short answer is not really for most cases, but it helps. The longer answer is that it really depends on what kind of 3D art you are making and what exactly you are doing in the pipleine. At the most basic level you do have to understand the fundamentals of a few concepts like Vectors, Normals, and Triangles. (trust me, it sounds more complicated than it is) You should have a basic understanding of how the device actually renders your art. That way you know what kind of things affect the performance of the game. When making art for games, you do have to concider how a model will affect performance. It has to look nice and render quickly. So you need to understand the concepts of triangles, materials, draw calls and how they affect performance. As an artist, you do not need to know how to program, but you do need to know how to make your art work well for the programmer's code. For example, if you make a character, you need to know where to put all of the joints to make the limbs bend correctly and such. So in that case you would need to know a little bit about rotating them and where to place the pivot points to have them rotate correctly. (Again, it really sounds a lot more complicated than it is) Other examples include, making things the right scale, rotation, and location; making sure that the normals of a mesh are pointing in the correct direction; procedural generation techniques such as noise, etc.. If you get into texturing and material creation, it will serve you well to know a bit about procedural texture generation and how to use noise. Really the more you know about the bigger picture (art + code) the better your art will work in the game. You can get away with not knowing much about it and just making art, but as you make more art for games you will pick up the knowledge to help you make your art to look good and have good performance.",2021-03-06T22:01:06.598Z,"Do 3D artists for video games need to know math and programming?

Remove those polys. Will the 3d object be close to the camera or far away? Characters and especially their faces (if they animate) tend to get more polys than other areas, also hair.Normal maps.

If the artist for instance is painting a picture on the piece with your permission then there isn’t a issue. You cannot control where it’s exhibited or how it’s shown or who it’s resold to, of course unless you had a contract previously. Say it was Hitler ,you sold it to him and he wanted it to be put on display in the worst artists show for instance. You could possibly have a defamation case if it personally hurts you’re career. The artwork shown at his show cannot be removed if he isn’t hurting you’re value or future earnings. One of the things hitler did before he destroyed the modern work he hated he had one of those shows . Set up another to damage public perception of someone else could be an issue I can think of if you haven’t given permission. I’ve had other artists apply to college using my work I’ve given them. I’ve had artists draw on my work without permission. Two examples of me able to file suit against another person violating my rites. So if the person has hurt you and you can prove it you can file suit. This applies to one of a kind art especially. But if it’s a buda that you are sculpting looking exactly like many other sculpture and a artist buys it from you and burns it in performance art I think it might be seen as something they can do unless you have a contract before hand. So religious idols and things like this are different than one of a kind nothing else looks exact you might have a case if it’s burned or defiled to hurt your career and ability to live . I’ve had a person make a lie about me so others will not buy my work and had my work in his shows. This is a good example of trying to hurt in order to ruin ability to sell. If the artist is selling you’re work half price to lower you’re value could be something. But most likely reselling your work should be a positive thing for you because most likely it will set a higher value for your work. You cannot stop the other artist from doing positive you can stop another from the common sense things like defiling your work, unless you’re a public figure things change a little. Like if I bought Woo Tang Clans one of a kind million dollar album and destroyed it I could say they are public figure and I’m making a statement about greed. It’s a fine line but just not liking what another is doing with it if it causes no harm to your career isn’t grounds to be able to control the intellectual property n my opinion. If I was a judge or a lawyer I would feel this way but I’m not so I’m no authority this is my feelings only.

As with all freelance work, one month you might earn a lot, and then next 3 months you could earn $30 total. That happened to me sometimes, and was becoming more and more frequent.  Up to ~2003 it was different. You had to solve spline networks for your models, push and pull tangents to get proper curvature and be smart about every polygon because computers were very slow. Now you can open ZBrush and in a few minutes have an object that was only possible after 3 days of pushing and pulling bezier tangents. Back then you could have earned more in any 3D branch as there were not many people doing this. With all the photogammetry tools today, ""3d from photos"", 123dcatch, photomodeler, low cost 3d scanners, Kinect and smartphone 3d scanners, ZBrush and other tools, it is becoming less and less profitable field. It is a job field in decline. Even if you are the best 3d modeller in the world you still have only two hands and limited time, and there is an upper limit of how much you can earn. In 2007 I had so much 3d modeling work that I registered a business and even started subcontracting 3d modellers with lower rates and also taught non-3d people some parts of the workflow. I would then improve their models and add finishing touches before submitting them to clients. Unfortunately most of them were just too unprofessional and hard to work with, so I closed the business and gradually left that field. I moved to other branches of IT and software development a few years ago as it did not make sense for me to continue investing more time in that. I still have a lot of fun 3d modeling, and this is my #1 hobby, and a nice contrasting activity to other IT work.  In case you start pursuing organic 3d modelling field and get into ZBrush: do not make portfolio made of monsters and other nightmare creatures. These are too random to demonstrate any real skill, and to most people it just suggests the modeler might be somewhat disturbed or otherwise weird person.

Otherwise, you're unemployed. Next time you see a big Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks animated movie, sit through the credits and see just how many people work on a single film. Those credits can include people worked only a few days or the entire production. Many of these films can have hundreds of animators, most of which are only following the direction of the lead animators. However, beyond the movie and television industry there is still a significant market for 3D animation. The electronic game industry actually employs more people in those kind of roles (or at least it did several years ago when I knew more people connected with it). And certain industries also offer significant opportunities for 3D artists as well. Especially high-tech industries, such as medical/pharmaceutical, aerospace, architectural and petrochemical, where the concepts are complex and difficult to explain using any other method.  A lot of work I do involves talking to engineers, chemists and scientists, and listening to them describe the way their equipment or chemicals interact with conditions deep below the Earth's surface. Some of the equipment uses the Earth's magnetic field, while others probe the strata with beams of neutrons, all in an effort to understand the nature of rock formations miles below the surface. I've had to animate robotic subsea vessels that can spend weeks autonomously inspecting the ocean floor an equipment without the intervention of humans. I've had to animate the way certain proteins that when folded in within cells can interfere with development and cause disease. Learning 3D is not a single task. Analogous to the film industry it involves dozens of smaller disciplines that start from concept through the final edit and involve things like: 3D modelingModel rigging, kinematics, dynamics and physics Texture mapping and shadersLightingRenderingCompositingEditingAll of these can be broken down further. 3D modeling can require different kinds of software depending on what it is you need to create. Some software is best for hard-surface models, like machinery and buildings. Others are better suited for organic objects like animals, plants and people. Others are specific to liquids and particles. As Steve mentioned, Maya is a good general purpose modeling and animation package, but you'll find that eventually you'll need better rendering software, or software that can handle fluids. There are other good general purpose 3D animation products out there and they are priced in the same neighborhood, such as 3D Studio MAX (which is owned by the same company as Maya), and Cinema 4D. None of these are products that are easy to learn without training, but they are industry standards and widely used. If you want to learn any of these, it would be best to take classes that teach them in depth. Trying to learn them on your own can side step important work flows that are not intuitive, but make sense once you see them used in practice. Some universities and colleges have excellent animation departments if you're inclined. Some of these companies who make the 3D software offer training themselves or can steer you to the appropriate training. However, I would recommend against going to any of the Art Institutes run by EDMC (see the list of schools here: List of The Art Institutes locations). These for-profit schools have been heavily criticized for their educational standards and were even the part of a Frontline documentary. In my experience reviewing student portfolios for the Houston Chapter of AIGA, I've been very disappointed in the portfolios I see from students coming out of the Art Institute of Houston, especially considering how expensive the tuition is. Before enrolling in any of these schools I would attend a graduating student portfolio review and see the type of work the students graduating are capable of producing. There are online communities for artists to share their work, tips and techniques. http://www.cgsociety.org/ is one of the best. Also, check to see if there are any 3D Meet-ups in your area. Having a one-on-one relationship with other animators is the fastest way to jump into the field.

I failed horribly.. see this image  maybe right now you won't understand whats wrong with it.. but when i posted that to a professional 3d artists forum i got very-mean-for-a-beginner comments. at that point i had breaken a record of devoting my time to learning 3d and when i had something presentable i got a lot of crap for it. I got so angry at that and for the next 2 years i never posted anything online and secretly kept on working my skills. 5. I gave it another try... and this time people really liked it!  6. when people online liked my work, the my motivation was it its peak!... i modelled 3 different cars in just a span of 6 months because it gave me joy and stuff   one of them got featured at a 3d model library site ( a site where you can download other people's 3d models and share your own) 7. It was time to Up my skills, my early cars were very inaccurately modeled because i didn't get into a habit of using reference photos, so this time i decided to do another car but put thrice as much effort into getting it right. And my hardwork gave yielding results!  people online really really appreciated my work, they downloaded the model and rendered it on their own and showed them to me. This above render is of a guy named Maciej Jutrzenka 8. So now i was sort of famous(on the same forum where earlier i got a lot of crap) So my next project had to be even bigger and shatter everyones expectations including mine. Now i had to put 10 times as much effort into this car.   i spent days building a every little part of this car, The project took 1 and a half years to finally reach the rendering stage. 9. That project was a turning point for me, it was my first ever experience where i took a project too seriously and when it ended i just couldn't handle any criticism i faced. and i faced a lot.. particularly with the render.. you could check out the type of comments i got here : Lamborghini Aventador J  This time when people downloaded my model and rendered it better than me i took it that i have learned almost everything when it comes to modelling cars. so i won't model one again. Now i've focused my energies on composition and color and lighting.  that pretty much covered my learning phase.. which is something that'll never end basically.

Once the 3d model is polished and green-lighted, it is passed off to a “rigger” who  Continue Reading",2021-03-06T22:38:03.782Z,"What modeling techniques do Pixar artists use to model characters in 3D?

There are some upsides and downsides. The Mac Pro is a fast, stable machine that when equipped with 64GB of RAM is quite capable of handling complex scenes. The current Mac Pro is a three year old model that has a special AMD GPU that cannot be replaced with another card. Unfortunately the current trend is to use GPUs to render final output since software can be written specifically to take advantage of their architecture. The result is that by using a GPU based rendering engine, you can blow away any CPU based rendering when it comes to speed and cost. NVidia is the leader in these GPU video cards but they are all incompatible with the Mac Pro. While there are cards compatible with older Mac Pros, those machines are about 5 years old in technology, and you need to do some tricky modifications to the system to get them to work. None of which is supported by either Apple, NVidia or the makers of the rendering engine software. So unless you have a high threshold for risk, you're going to be stuck using a CPU-based rendering engine, like the ones built into the software. Those can be somewhat lack luster. The other problem is that 3DStudio Max is not Mac compatible. Maya is Mac compatible, as is Cinema 4D and virtually every other software title. Unfortunately most of the 3D world still uses 3DS Max. For the same money, you can get a much faster Windows PC with even more RAM (128GB!), and the ability to use multiple GPUs. So with a single GeForce 780 card you would still out perform a Mac, but then double or triple that speed by adding a second or third GPU card. There are more and more GPU rendering software options coming to the market all the time. Octane is the current most popular option. Update: December 18, 2019. In the almost three years since I first wrote this answer a lot of stuff has changed. The biggest change to affect this answer is that Apple finally came out with a new version of their Mac Pro, six years after their last version. The new Mac Pro has a lot more options available than its predecessor, but its price is astronomical compared to what you could get a PC for. In fact the base configuration for the Mac Pro is more than I spent on my Windows 10 PC and that’s not even including the 8TB external NAS drive, and the two 4K monitors. Here’s a basic spec list for my Windows 10 PC. Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6850K CPU @ 3.60GHz, 3601 Mhz, 6 Core128 GB RAM1 TB SSD M.2 Drive on the motherboard, plus 2 TB internal SATA HD (mechanical)Nvidia GTX 1080ti 11GBLogitech keyboard and mouseI paid less than $5,000 and built this in one day with a lot of help from a friend who knows what he’s doing. This price also included 1 LG 4K monitor, Computer Cabinet, and 1600 watt power supply. Here’s a spec list from the closest configuration of the new Mac Pro. 3.5GHz 8‑core Intel Xeon W processor96 GB RAM1TB SSD storageRadeon Pro 580X with 8GB of GDDR5 memoryApple Keyboard and mouseThis configuration costs $7,500. It obviously includes the cabinet and power supply, but no monitor. When I did this comparison, there usually wasn’t a directly corresponding option, so I chose the closest option that was lower. For example Apple doesn’t offer 128 GB ram as an option, the closest were 96 GB or 192 GB. If I chose the 192 GB option the computer would cost $2000 more. I did compare the performance of my i7 6850K and their Xeon W and theirs was somewhat better, but I could theoretically swap out my CPU for around $1100. But the biggest factor is that as of this writing, there are two dominant GPU rendering software solutions, Redshift and Octane. Arnold GPU is also available this year. But none of these rendering engines will work on the new Mac Pro because Apple decided to stay with AMD instead of offering an Nvidia option. All three of these rendering engines require Nvidia GPUs. Redshift has announced a version of their software that will run on Mac’s Radeon GPU but it still hasn’t been released months after their announcement, and there isn’t any comparison on speed that I’m aware of yet. GPU rendering is almost ten times faster than CPU rendering, depending on the software. That means if you’re rendering an animation that takes 100 hours using GPU, you could render the same sequence overnight. That’s huge. I’ve always loved Macs. I stubbornly stuck with them through the ninety’s and 2000’s when all my friends were telling me I was an idiot for staying with Apple. Fortunately I was in a situation where switching from one to the other didn’t mean abandoning existing hardware. I worked for myself from 1988 until 2007, then I worked for one of my clients from 2007 to 2017, so when I went back to working for myself in 2017 I had the benefit of being able to start from scratch, and that made the decision to Windows a lot easier.

Even if I didn’t build the things from scratch, you can upgrade the various parts of any desktop PC pretty easily, and you just can’t do that with a laptop. The one big advantage of a laptop is of course portability (and I do have a secondary laptop for that - a Macbook Air, which maximises the portability advantage by being slim and light while still maintaining a good keyboard), but I just don’t need that very often.

Simple forms include your basic geometric forms (boxes, spheres, cylinders, as well as pyramids and cones), organic forms (simple sausage-like forms) and ribbon-like forms (think flower petals, leaves - basically something that effectively has very little relevant thickness, and flows fluidly through 3D space). It is considerably easier to draw any one of these simpler forms in such a way that they appear solid and three dimensional, as though they exist in actual 3D space, rather than being limited to the space of your page. By breaking a more complex object down into these more primitive elements, and then reconstructing it in our drawing piece by piece, we can take advantage of that. If the underlying components feel solid and three dimensional, we can continue to carry that illusion over as we build more and more complexity. Conversely, jumping into a complex object attempting to capture exactly what it is you’re seeing without consideration for those components - and how those components sit in 3D space and relate to one another - will usually result in a drawing feeling very flat. This approach is referred to as constructional drawing, and I have several lessons on drawabox.com working through it, all of which are free. The approach I teach there is completely different from the one expained by Tarique. The goals are the same, but they take two very different roads to get there. The difference is that the constructional approach completely ignores shading entirely. It hinges on the idea that you can convey 3D form before shading is ever even added, and that when you do decide to render the light and shadow in your drawing, the illusion of form does not rely upon it. Instead, it would merely reinforce an illusion that is already present. Here’s an example of one of the more advanced demonstrations of the constructional approach. Note that it’s from lesson 6, so it uses quite a few complex perspective techniques.         Now, obviously there are a lot of extra lines that one would not include in a final drawing. These lessons stress the importance of including them, but at the end of the day, the goal is that by drawing everything in its entirety, you will internalize them and later on be able to visualize them in your mind’s eye without drawing them explicitly. But that’s kind of irrelevant at this point. Every object that exists can effectively be broken down into a combination of simpler forms.

I find that today it comes down to personal preference as well, Maya is going to be 100% subscription based after January 2016, while the software is amazing you might want to consider this, even if you get a student discounted subscription fee or a free version to use while studying you will likely end up having to pay the monthly or yearly sub at one point in time, with other options you might need to consider the single lump sum of funds. If you take these things out of the equation though I would say Maya and MODO are the two easiest to learn software that I've picked up and animated with over the years.  There is a free solution called Blender which has a fairly steep learning curve but many learning resources available, the animation is not as smooth in the workflow but every bit as capable as most premium options out there.   My suggestion is that you try a few of the software out and see which one feels more natural to you when navigating or the workflow of things and stick with that, if money is an issue Blender is the best free solution you will find, if you don't like the subscription stuff that Maya will convert to then MODO has the best licensing in my opinion, it's a one fee with a small update cost every large update and free smaller updates along the way toward that next huge update. That's only if you consider the financial side of it atop the ~""easy to use"" factor.  I hope that helps a little, the best way to find the best solution for you is to take them for a test drive and see what you like best, I hope you find something.

I was lucky I had regular clients but if you bid on odesk, elance and other sites, you will fight with modellers that will work for pennies or are just building their portfolio. As with all freelance work, one month you might earn a lot, and then next 3 months you could earn $30 total. That happened to me sometimes, and was becoming more and more frequent.  Up to ~2003 it was different. You had to solve spline networks for your models, push and pull tangents to get proper curvature and be smart about every polygon because computers were very slow. Now you can open ZBrush and in a few minutes have an object that was only possible after 3 days of pushing and pulling bezier tangents. Back then you could have earned more in any 3D branch as there were not many people doing this. With all the photogammetry tools today, ""3d from photos"", 123dcatch, photomodeler, low cost 3d scanners, Kinect and smartphone 3d scanners, ZBrush and other tools, it is becoming less and less profitable field. It is a job field in decline. Even if you are the best 3d modeller in the world you still have only two hands and limited time, and there is an upper limit of how much you can earn. In 2007 I had so much 3d modeling work that I registered a business and even started subcontracting 3d modellers with lower rates and also taught non-3d people some parts of the workflow. I would then improve their models and add finishing touches before submitting them to clients. Unfortunately most of them were just too unprofessional and hard to work with, so I closed the business and gradually left that field. I moved to other branches of IT and software development a few years ago as it did not make sense for me to continue investing more time in that. I still have a lot of fun 3d modeling, and this is my #1 hobby, and a nice contrasting activity to other IT work.  In case you start pursuing organic 3d modelling field and get into ZBrush: do not make portfolio made of monsters and other nightmare creatures. These are too random to demonstrate any real skill, and to most people it just suggests the modeler might be somewhat disturbed or otherwise weird person. I never hired someone with only monsters in their portfolios. Good luck if you plan to pursue this field.",2021-03-06T22:46:30.716Z,"What is the scope of 3D modelers in India? ",Quora

At an average license cost of $1,545, that’s about 120,000 users. Piracy is rampant though, so let’s assume 10x use it illegally (sounds high, but many artists from India and Asia claim that almost no studio have legal copies). So roughly 1.2M users total. Maxon: In the Annual 2018 Nemetschek report (owner of Maxon, Cinema 4D) there was $30.5M in revenue from Media and Entertainment division (Maxon). Assuming the same 8% growth from previous year makes it $33M in 2019. At an average annual subscription cost of $1000, that’s about 33,000 users. 10x from piracy and we get roughly 330K users. SideFX Houdini: It’s not publicly traded, so unfortunately there’s no data available. But it’s search popularity is about half that of Maxon. So let’s say 115K users.

And the graphics card is becoming more important to everything in 3D content creation. Besides realtime realistic shading (now available in many 3D software packages), a ton of other things are now being accelerated using massively parallel processing, which is provided by the GPU. This includes everything related to physics simulations like cloth, hair, softbody, and liquids. Also, many 3D sculpting tools now use a form of simulation which is accelerated using CUDA (or OpenCL) on graphics cards. Also, as a 3D modeler, you will likely want to render images. This is still done primarily on the CPU, but is starting to be accelerated by the GPU, especially as Nvidia’s OptiX raytracing algorithms become mainstream. Blender has been a leader in incorporating OptiX in their Cycles renderer, and have acheived dramatic increases in rendering speed on RTX enabled graphics cards. I believe this will become even more important in the near future, and would recommend an RTX enabled graphics card if it is in your budget. The cheapest graphics card with this tech is (I think) the Geforce RTX 2060, which will set you back around US $300. So the short answer is YES, a gaming computer is good for 3D modeling. The only thing better would be a computer with a Titan RTX graphics card, which costs $2,500 for the card alone.

60440716ed76476feda39a9c,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-big-problems-with-hiring-3d-graphics-or-VFX-artists?-,"I think the ""problems"" that companies have to hire artists are the same for 2d and 3D artists. When you are hiring Juniors coming directly from school, these days they have amazing reels, big problem is, how can you know how much they did on each shot, how much time did they have to do it ( 2weeks or the hole semester do make 3 great shots?),  how tidy do they work, how much was the mentor behind the project? So basically you have no clue how those people will react to an real production ENV. Fair enough, I think it should be like that anyway because you can t pretend that a junior already knows everything and will be perfect from the start. If you see potential you probably should give him/her a chance. The issue is, that you have similar problems with hiring senior artists. When you see the final model in a great shot in a showreel, most of the time they do not get a chance to show you the wireframe of the model, so how can I be sure that the model was created up to industry standards, where you can be sure it is easy to rig, you do not get weird errors while rendering, if people need to pick up the model they do not find a non organised file where all the pieces do not have names, are not grouped together and so on.. All these things do not sound too bad.. But if you, for whatever reason, need to pass a bad organised file that contains 100+ pieces from one artist to the other during crunch time, that can cause a lot of issues. Same for a digital compositor,... it is impossible to judge from the final output how the script that created it was put together. There are cases when people have to pick up scripts from others, and those scripts are impossible to work with, and making changes that should take 3 minutes take a whole week. Basically, a lot of people call them self seniors only because they are working for a long time in the industry and not because they have all the required skills for it. Also if you are new to a company/city it is really hard to tell if you are easy to work with or not. So basically companies try to organise there questions in the interview to guess what it could be to work with you, but actually they only can find out after they hired you, if they never heard anything negative about you until that point. Unfortunately this is also true for the other side of the medal. You can be an amazing artist but maybe because the company wants to save money they just use this hole reasoning to get you as cheap as possible, telling you that they first want to work with you, and if you keep up with there expectations then they will talk about the salary again. I think the easiest thing in this hole dilemma is to always have some good references in your CV, from people known in the local industry or from colleagues that are already working in that company. That can strengthen your ability to negotiate during the hiring process. Usually if you work good or bad the word get spread around pretty fast, so just try to do the best you can, always!

Also called gesture drawing, your main goal is to pinpoint changes in the Z-axis (moving away or closer to you). By noticing and understand where and when these contours happen will aid in your understanding in remembering 3D space. 2. Perspective drawingProbably not even exclusive to 3D art, perspective drawing is a fantastic way to boost your artistic skill and comprehension. The world isn’t flat, and in 3D the main objective is to mimic that world. In order to get used to drawing in 3D, use perspective grids: vanishing points, horizon lines, along with your understand of contours. The more you practise drawing in perspective, the more dynamic and bolder your artwork will become. 3. Draw from lifeProbably the most overlooked skill when it comes to art in general, only because it is either too tedious to gather your materials, sit down comfortably, and draw away for a few hours looking at nature or people, or people just don’t like it. I can assure you, though, that drawing from life, when you are focussed on a particular idea (style implementation, improving foreshortening, anatomy, etc.), you will find that drawing from life isn’t just about getting your realist juices flowing, but instead helping you find points in your own style and skill level on which to discover and improve. 4. Incorporate your 2D skills into 3DNo good 3D artist only does stuff in 3D. That’s very amateurish, and if you really are serious about becoming a good 3D artist, you need to know 2D and how to make 2D look 3D, or at least understand 3D and apply your idea or style in 2D. Go to any game studio, and you will ALWAYS see 2D concepts. Go to any animation studio, and you will ALWAYS see 2D demo reels. Trust me, your 2D skills will make 3D so much less of a hassle to grasp, and it will shave off weeks, even months, off tweaking, adjusting and headaches when it comes to big projects, and projects you’d probably use for a portfolio. Always keep in mind that 3D is the replication of the things we see in the real world. There are many, many resources at your perusal on the Internet. If you are still unsure, you should try to jot down things that you like about your personal art style, find out your skill level and artistic knowledge, and see where you want to go with this new skill that you want to pick up.

You just click on the ""terrain"" button and one appears in your scene, ready to be positioned, resized, etc. Then, with the Terrain Editor you can modify the terrains to your liking, procedurally or by sculpting them by hand. Grayscale height-maps of real terrains can be applied for realistic effects. Here, I’m just making a random terrain with a few of the tools and effects:  I applied a sand-like material, water and made the first test render with a cloudless sky:  One of the coolest things about Vue is the Ecosystem feature. You can populate terrains (or any other object) with vegetation, trees, rocks, and the like, with a few clicks of a mouse. Here, I am selecting which trees I want to use:  You have complete control over the selection of objects, as well as various settings for how they are randomly placed, and then Vue runs a population algorithm, doing most of the work for you. You can manually ""airbrush"" vegetation onto a terrain, placing numerous trees exactly where you want them, or simply click “populate” and watch the magic happen. Here, I have populated some trees onto my terrain:  Then I added a variety of other Ecosystem plants, grass and flowers. Finally, I copied the terrain several times, moving each one into a position in the background. Here’s the final render:  A larger version (3200x2000) can be found on my personal website gallery (not a promotion, nothing for sale). artrager An important point: Vue is not designed for 3D modeling (except rudimentary modeling with primitives) but it allows you to model objects elsewhere, in other 3D applications, and then import them into your scene. Here’s a landscape scene I did recently, where I created the cabin model in 3ds Max (which is a great modeling program) and then imported the model into a Vue landscape I prepared for it:  I’m just an amateur, but Vue is used by professionals that utilize its animation capabilities to assist in creating feature films.

Things had progressed significantly and 3D rendering has found way to lower budget production as well. This year, I was explaining how 3D rendering works in some apparel brands catalog to designer friend of mine who own brands that how other competitor of hers are rendering images on their products photography. And explaining cost for ad campaign photo production for her to compete with some of her competitor are doing. So, it is actually there for sometimes now. More than decade and half almost if you talked about higher end market, and today, even mid-range budget production apparel brands are talking about using hybrid when it come to accessory etc. for their production. I do not think there are much of threat though, lot of production where 3D are dominant are part where it is cost prohibitive to do photographic production to meet certain specification. After extensive post, it will be pretty much same things as 3D rendering anyway, so it will be cheaper to do 3D rendering from start for certain parts that will be cost prohibitive. Basically when shooting certain type of Car for example, visual/lighting requirement to achieve certain looks if we do photographic production can exceed say $100000 whereas 3D hybrid can be done at $40000 and can do motion graphics. And even this budget rich production like auto, designer will choose over 3D when there are such cost difference. However, it is not that case in some luxury car especially flagship sports car… I know few are still shot in old fashion way because they still have budget for shooting old fashion way even budget for film in some car model I am aware of, and manufacture had elected to do authentic photographic looks rather than 3D which tend to give out clue in high definition printing or advertising campaign. On the surface, it may looks as though 3D studio is eating lunch for 2D photographic one. But reality is not that simple. And due to how 3D rendering costs, and cost of post processing are still there, it will not threaten mid-range production or lower budget production just yet. It just cost more to do near perfect 3D rendering. This lot to do with how things works… and labor intensive nature of such productions. And cost per frame are still pretty high when you ask for how much 15 or so sec rendering cost for HD advertisement that has realistic looks. It could be cheaper just shooting real things very carefully. And some of photographic service i.e high speed photo which were thought to be replaced with 3D rendering is still actually around. Very reason is they are actually still cost competitive due to progress in camera technology and robotics which enable to create effect at similar cost… and with better authenticity than 3D counterpart. You will be suprised using 100k camera is still cheaper than rendering 3D, but it is often cheaper and looks more authentic. It could certainly changes, but very unlikely for next 5–6 years, as things are still very fluid. For tighter budget production, when client has less than 10k to shoot their product for said campaign. full 3D production is probably out of question. Sure, you can cut corner to do it, there are always some college students in south asia willing to do it for $1000, but you will get what you paid for, so rarely this type of choice is exercised unless art director completely lost it. Hybrid is entirely possible though for certain parts where it is just too expensive to do it photographic production. And that type of capability are well within reach of lot of studio who can do commercial production services for ad agency and design firm. And we would simply has that option for our workflow if client choose to do so. So, answer to question is we have been adapting to this past 2 decades. Goal for commercial production are to create art work that serve client’s need and vision. It really does not matter it is photographics or 3D rendering. If one tool suited need for client than others. We would use it. And we have been using that for where 3D excelled for sometimes. As for 3D projection or 3D visual etc. That is I thinks slightly different animal. But lot of us are following VR and 360 photography intensely since its inception in 90’s. And that too when it became widely accepted reality on consumer devices/medium, we would be just using that. AR has been around as well, and past 3 years, I have included AR option as proposal for client project. But it is still bit too expensive for smaller company to pay for it(server cost are just still too high for longer or larger campaign). And it is right now not realistic if usage is not very small like small meetup club usage or pretty massive like pokemon go or IKEA big. So, that price has to come down like online video of couple decades ago. I had worked with some industries client, where they utilize 3D rendering since very early on. Today, they are perfectly blending 3D graphics and photography… and really hard to tell if it is real photo or 3D generated images. Things had progressed significantly and 3D rendering has found way to lower budget production as well. This year, I was explaining how 3D rendering works in some apparel brands catalog to designer friend of mine who own brands that how other competitor of hers are rendering images on their products photography. And explaining cost for ad campaign photo production for her t Continue Reading",2021-03-06T22:53:34.130Z,"Do commercial product photographers view 3D rendering as a threat or an opportunity to focus on artistic input within a different medium?

That production could be a feature film, a TV series, a commercial, or a 2D/3D/AR/VR/console/headset game - and it will employ digital artists with a varied range of skills, but all of them are specialists in some aspect of the production. Matte painters, texture painters and concept artists will work with physical paper and pen/pencil as well as digital paint programs. A large number of the roles are technical in nature, and the specific software one uses is custom for the production or studio; examples include 1) on set data recording and tracking, 2) how 3D camera tracking recovery is done and then integrated into the data flow of the production, 3) how motion capture is accomplished, cleaned up and its data integrated into the production, 4) how physical simulations are handled (hair, clothing, combat reactions, digital liquids, damaging/collapsing objects/structures, and even crowds), their modeling, running of their simulations, and integration of resulting animated data into the production’s data flow. There is a huge and growing number of specializations, each with their own requirements in software knowledge and integration of the results into some type of production asset system. There are also a large number of largely technical roles whose job is to work with the artists handling technical issues their specialization’s deep requirements prevents them from also knowing this other technical body of knowledge. Basically, you are expected to excel at one or more production required skills, know the majority of the software that does or aids accomplishing that skill, and actively track in your own time the on going developments within the narrow specialization of that skill.

Blender 2.80 is a huge game changer in the 3D industry. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Recently, Ubisoft announced that they will join the Blender Foundation’s Development Fund as a corporate Gold member. Not only will Ubisoft help funding online support for Blender developers, Ubisoft Animation Studio – a department of Ubisoft Film and Television – will also use Blender for their productions and assign developers to contribute to Blender’s open source projects. Pierrot Jacquet, Head of Production at Ubisoft Animation Studio says “Blender was for us an obvious choice: Its strong and engaged community paired up with the vision carried by the Blender Foundation makes it one of the most creative DCC of the market.”Also Epic Games, as part of the company’s $100 million Epic MegaGrants program, is awarding the Blender Foundation $1.2 million in cash to further the success of Blender, the free and open source 3D creation suite that supports the full range of tools empowering artists to create 3D graphics, animation, special effects or games.

Essentially, it is an object drawn in one specific pose and then drawn again in another pose that is different than the first. This process repeats until the desired ending point is reached. Traditionally these animations were put together in a very long and time-consuming process where artists drew pencil drawings of every object or character in a frame of film. Those drawings were painted onto clear plastic sheets called “cels”, and each of these hand-drawn and painted cels was photographed one at a time over a hand-painted background image. The thousands of created animated images were then compiled to run as the film at 24 frames a second (DBS Interactive). 2D objects can only be measured in height and width. Therefore, they can only exist in a space that is two dimensional as well. A good example of a 2D object that the site gave me was a circle drawn on a wall. This represents a 2D object because you cannot see the object at all angles but rather only a particular side. The object is also drawn a wall which means that it is flat, not a circular shape that balls are (Game Designing). Starting in the 1950s, 2D animation was done on a computer-based on vector graphic devices. However, technology has improved since then, and it is not so time-consuming to animate 2D figures as it used to be. To edit or create a two-dimensional object, you can use vector graphics or 2D Bitmap graphics (Wikipedia). There are many programs to help someone animate today. Some examples of these programs include Adobe Flash, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Freehand, and even Adobe Photoshop. Aside from simply just animating, there are other aspects to 2D animation. There has to be a storyboard and characters, scenes. Much like any other story, not just in Animation (Degrees & Courses from Top Colleges and Universities: Learn.org). Here is the entire process of creating a 2D Animation: The first step is to create your storyboard. This is a bunch of sketched scenes compiled together. This step is important because it helps you figure out what you would like to even animate in the first place and how it should play out. The next step can vary depending on if you’re animating a 2D movie or something else. This next step can either be inserting audio or the actual animation of your scenes and characters. (I personally would go for the latter). Along the way, you may have to make changes, touch up your animation, and make sure everything is in the right order. After this, you can enjoy your animation. Lastly, 2D animation was one of the biggest and best ways to Animate. Before the early 2000s, most cartoons and movies were done in 2D. Some great examples are movies The Lion King, Cinderella, etc…2D animation is not the best way to animate anymore. Even though it is not as complex as it once was, it still takes time to do. This has lead to the rise of a different type of animation. 3D animation is a type of animation where one takes a 3d object and animates it – exactly what you would think it was. 3D animation has been in the works for longer than one might think, it started as early as the ’60s, with claymation (MultimedaMcc). But now animation is done with computer-generated imagery, although it is still largely time-consuming. This computer software was developed at companies like Bell Telephone Laboratories and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In 1995, Pixar created the first of these kinds of CGI films with Toy Story. Although CGI is the main type of 3D animation that is used today, people still use claymation as well, with shows like Robot Chicken. Many programs are used for 3D animation, like Blender and Renderman (a program created by Pixar). Which one chooses is a matter of personal preference. There are also many styles of 3D animation, which is noticeable when comparing the big names of CGI Animation such as Blue Sky, Dreamworks, and Pixar. Movies aren’t the only media form to use CGI though, many cartoons now use it as well, and even commercials. The technical side of 3D is mathematical, or more specifically, geometric. There is a polygon mesh used that the animator manipulates. Sometimes within the mesh, there is a skeletal-like structure called an armature. Like the human body, this skeletal structure helps create movement. For the outer parts of the skeleton, the animator draws it out. To make things more complex, fur, fire, water animation are an option and they help create 3D dynamics (Wikipedia). Then all of these different parts of the animated character are moved by moving them in frame-by-frame animation. Then all these frames must be rendered. A short cartoon still needs many frames. In order to make the animation not look jerky, animations are usually 12-24 frames per second. There are many terms specific to 3D animation. One is cel-shaded animation, which is the computer version of the original kind of animation. Machinima is a word used to describe films based off of screen capturing in video games or virtual worlds, motion capture is when people wear suits that capture their motions and computers are able to copy them into CG characters. Photo-realistic animation is an animation that tries to mimic real life as much as possible.  The world’s first animated film was 1917’s El Apóstol. It was made as a way to criticize the then-President of Argentina (Bendazzi). The first full-length animated picture, released just twenty years later in 1937, was called Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. It would grow to become very popular, being the first of many excellent hand-drawn animated features done by Walt Disney Animation Studios, produced to entertain audiences around the world (Film Site). The first 3D film made solely with the help of computers was Toy Story in 1995, jointly produced by Disney and the company Pixar. It was groundbreaking (Clarke). Soon after, animated films began to use only Computer Generated Imagery (CGI), and the use of traditional (2D) animation declined drastically. 3D animation allowed room for more details and movement in animation, and modern audiences prefer the look of 3D animation. Most animated movies produced nowadays are created with 3D animation and software programs, although some have cleverly tried to combine both. However, the animation is not relevant only to the world of films and movies, even though it exists primarily for entertainment purposes. 2D animation is still present today, although on a much smaller scale, and mostly done now with the aid of computers rather than by hand, as done traditionally. 2D animators can become animation or art directors, and some eventually move into 3D animation. To become a 2D animator, usually, a 4-year degree is required. Degrees that will hire an animator can include a degree in animation, illustration, film, or web design. Of course, some animators do not need to have a degree because their personal work makes up for it. The main programs that are used in modern 2D animation are Adobe Flash and CelAction. Anyone who aspires to become an animator must at least have good drawing skills, be computer literate, understand how things move and how animation works, and be willing to communicate with others and manage deadlines (2D Computer Animation). With 2D animation, films, advertisements, website designs, and more recently, mobile games and other applications can be created. On the other hand, the field of 3D animation is rapidly expanding, and its high demand is expected to create many new jobs in the coming years. According to Explore Art Careers, Schools, & Jobs || The Art Career Project, the average salary for a 3D animator is about 58k annually. Much like a career in 2D animation, a career in 3D animation requires at least a bachelor’s degree, although it is available to pursue further. Someone who is interested in 3D animation will have to take not only art and computer classes, but physical science and anatomy courses, as well, to further their understanding of the natural world and incorporate that into their animations. 3D animators work hard in creating animated films, the special effects that are seen in live-action movies, video game graphics, TV advertisements, computer-generated environments, and animations for interactive websites. Being a 3D animator also requires good communication skills. In the instance of working on a video game, animators need to collaborate with many different people including writers, directors, voice actors, and music directors (In 3D Animation). The two main categories of animation may have stark contrasts. 2D animation has been used for practically a century, and though it has drifted away from hand drawings, it can still provide a fulfilling career today. While 3D animation is relatively new, it has almost completely taken over the animation industry. The advances in technology in the past few years have done wonders to help make 3D animation as sophisticated as it is now. 2D animation is a traditional animation method that has existed since the late 1800s. Essentially, it is an object drawn in one specific pose and then drawn again in another pose that is different than the first. This process repeats until the desired ending point is reached.

There’s a lot of money to be made with digital art, which is why there is a concerted effort to expand that mass-produce-ability to regular art. If I paint an oil painting and my gallery sells it for a million dollars (I wish!), I’ve made a million dollars (actually, I’ve made $500,000, my gallery gets, at a minimum, at least half). But suppose I make a thousand digital copies and sell them for $1,000 each? Now I’ve made $2,000,000… for somebody. This is the concept behind the giclée movement, a marketing approach intended to maximize artist and gallery profits. Giclée prints are high quality large scale inkjet prints executed with archival ink on high quality paper. The artist signs and, often, numbers the prints, just as he would a traditional print run. A giclée print is the “next best thing” to owning an original as it’s signed and authorized by the artist. There is no “original” in digital art, so that aspect of the issue is moot, but there remains the very real question of authenticity. Let’s take a look at the “traditional print run.” In traditional printmaking, the artist creates an image, on a metal plate (etching or engraving), on a wood block (woodcut or wood engraving), on stone or some substitute (lithography or planography), or using some other medium (silk screen or collograph). In each instance the artist personally creates the image. He then oversees or personally performs the work of printing an edition of prints. The print run is limited in scope; after the prescribed number of prints has been pulled, the plate is destroyed, the stone ground down, the screen cleaned, etc. This is done for two reasons: The value of the art work is increased by having a limited number of copies.The value of the artwork is ensured by making certain a worn or damaged plate is not used unscrupulously.Please note, these are not issues with digital art, including digital copies of traditional art. There is no limit to the number of copies that can be made without loss of quality. The only limit on quantity is how willing the artist is to sign multiple copies. Salvador Dali actually spent a good amount of his time the last twenty years of his life signing blank pieces of paper which were then sent off for commercial four color printing. That’s why you can buy an “authentic” Dali print in any mall art gallery in America. The signature is absolutely authentic; in fact, that is essentially what you’re buying, a Dali autograph. I’m not even discussing the other differences between traditional and digital painting. Digital images are all utterly two-dimensional. Oil painting have at the least the potential to have some three-dimensionality; this is “painterliness,” an inherent part of the charm and quirkiness of traditional oils. For instance, here’s one of a series of a tiny sky paintings I did last year.  I can depict the impasto two-dimensionally in a photo, but that is not the same as the actual three-dimensional object I created. So, a traditional oil painting is inherently unique, a digital painting is inherently duplicatable (I guess you could do a digital painting, print out a single copy, and then destroy the hard drive where the file is saved). A traditional oil painting is potentially three dimensional. a digital painting can never be. A traditional painting is archival—when done correctly, it can last for centuries, even millennia. Digital images are created with dyes, and all dyes fade. We’re in the beginning stages of digital art. In a hundred years, maybe digital art of equal or greater intrinsic value than traditional paintings may be achieved, but not today.",2021-03-06T23:34:00.105Z,"Does digital technology exist that allows artists to create multicolor 3D works similar to oil or acrylic paintings?

I would like to let you know that the most important things before purchasing a laptop are Storage and Processor. Selecting the right processor would depend on the kind of applications you wish to run. Factors to see before buying any laptop: Display:15–16 inches display (average)Resolution: 1920*1080 px resolution Full HD , 1366*768 px HDRefresh rate: 60Hz is fast enough refresh rate for a laptop if you are using it for general use. For gaming, some people prefer a faster refresh rate because it makes the game feel smoother when you play.Viewing angle: Measured across diagonallyProcessor: CPU intel core-based i5 ( for best performance i7), or you can go for Ryzen 3 Dual Core, preferably (INTEL)Ram: Ram 8 GB for suitable fine work, DDR 4, (For Daily life work 4 GB also fine)Graphics card: GTX better than GTS, GTS better than GT(Prefer Nvidia over intel, because intel is known for processor and Nvidia is known for graphic cards. )RAM v/s GRAPHIC CARD: Low RAM(8 GB) with a good Graphics card is better than a higher ram without a graphics card.Hard-disk: 1TB. (500 GB is enough but some time laptop starts heating).Graphics card: 2 GB (not 100% required if there than good).Dedicated graphic memory capacity: 2GBMinimum Clock Speed: 2.6 GHz with Turbo Boost Upto 3.5 GHz.Weight: Approx 1.4–1.8 KG (as suitable according to you)The amount of RAM decides on how smooth and lag-free an experience you get on your laptop. The higher the amount of RAM the better it is. I will suggest a minimum of 4GB RAM for a lag-free experience across daily used applications like office apps, browsing, video viewing, etc Please check that MS office is there or not if present check its subscription, available for a lifetime or not because few laptops come with ms office and some are not. All these configurations present in any laptop that is enough for AutoCAD, video editing, and for heavy apps. Few Other Tips are: When looking for gaming laptops, the graphics processor (also referred to as GPU or graphics card), plays the key role. Having the latest series of a dedicated graphics processor ensures the best gaming performance.I would like to let you know that the AMD Ryzen and the Intel Core CPUs offer similar performance, the former being better at multi-tasking while the latter is faster when it comes to single-core tasks.Ryzen CPUs tend to offer better value for your money.You can make the buying decision based on factors like the product specifications meeting your requirement.IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: Do I have to prefer SSD over HDD for daily life works like surfing on the Internet, using MS office, etc?Ans: HDDs are mechanical components while SSDs store data in the form of charges. SSDs are lighter, require less power hence better battery life but come in more expensive machines. HDDs are mechanical, bulkier, may get damaged if the laptop is dropped/damaged, and come in less expensive models. Unlike HDDs, a Solid State Drive does not require mechanical parts to store data, they use less energy, run cooler and store data using charges, hence deliver a faster load time for games and other applications. So, As per daily life works like Using MS Office, Powerpoint, Surfing on the web browser, Watching videos, Video editing apps as per your usage, 1 TB HDD will work fine. But If you want a safer side then go for SSD. How to choose a battery and what should be the specifications?Ans: You can select the battery according to the factor of battery lasting. Some product pages, battery backup is always mentioned. It should be a minimum of 3-4 hours as per the performance of the laptop. Preferably Battery Type: Li-Ion. Some laptop suggestion according to budget demand If your Budget is 40k+ than go for HP, Sony, Dell. If your Budget is 30+k than go for Lenovo, Asus, Toshiba. Today almost all laptops are doing better except a few, so according to the above specifications and your price range choose your suitable laptop. best graphic card Nvidia or intel UHDintel is known for processor and Nvidia is known for graphic cards.Few Tips: To check SDD in a laptop: Simply press the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut to open the Run box, type “dfrgui” , and press Enter. When the Disk Defragmenter window is shown, look for the Media type column and you can find out which drive is a solid-state drive (SSD), and which one is a hard disk drive (HDD). To check Graphic Card in a laptop: On Windows 10, you can check your GPU information and usage details right from the Task Manager. Right-click the taskbar and select “Task Manager” or press Windows+Esc to open it. Click the “Performance” tab at the top of the window—if you don’t see the tabs, click “More Info.” Select “GPU 0” in the sidebar. The GPU’s manufacturer and model name are displayed at the top right corner of the window.

The art school route is probably the most straight forward way for an aspiring game artist. It can be expensive, especially for the more prestigious schools, but you get what you pay for. You have the advantage that you want to do environment art. This is probably the easiest to get into because games require way more env artists than, say, character artists or animators.

Whatever you plan to make, there are ways that 2D art will enhance your capabilities, and that lack of it may limit them. Unlike some of the posters here, I will not claim that you do not need 2D art skills to make good 3D art. You do not need to be a master, but if you wish to create 3D art from your own head, not simply from other people's designs, you will absolutely need the skills that 2D art gives you: * You will need the ability to measure proportions and shapes by sight and by some sense of touch (as you build shapes, it can be a tactile experience, though it's very abstract in most 3D packages). * You will need the ability to gesture and work from broad strokes with low detail towards high detail. Gesture images and sketches will allow you to get ideas in place and judge thee feel of them before you commit to details. * You will need the ability to break down objects into shapes, whether those shapes are perfect representations of the actual thing or not. This skill will allow you to compose forms in 3D more easily, especially for the purpose of blocking. These are just a few ways that 2D art skills will help you with 3D work. However, as you specifically mention animation, I would like to offer a very strong suggestion of another field you should study somewhat: Theatre and Acting. Once again, you don't need to become a masterful actor, but there is so much to learn from the study of theatre performance for the benefit of character animation, and how to make a character seem alive and intentional. If all you want is a short version: Learning more will never hurt your ability to produce good work, but it is not strictly necessary to learn other things _before_ you start to learn in the field you want.",2021-03-06T23:42:38.182Z,"I want to learn 3D modeling and animation Do I need to learn 2D art befor learning 3D?

And then, when bad tries to be heard, He's just tortured and punished. As if its his will to be bad, as if he wishes to be banished.. Tell me my eye, Do you still not see this deed? Or are you really just an accessory, Of this world full of greed.... EDIT : I am sorry but You quorans will have to bear with me a little longer. Due to so many awesome comments I've decided to add some more of the brute art thingy (yeah, I know you're cursing yourself right now for the upvotes ;P)   Always wanted to buy a vintage car. So I decided ""Hey, why not make one?"" xD  Does any of you have the problem where you can play an instrument well (like me ;P) but can't join a band?? Well I have a solution, your own ""Personal band"" ;P........and I know I know they are starving ;P   and these two pics....well they show the ""Birth of my tin dragon"" ....at-least in my reality xD  And this is the digital art I made on my phone. call it ""Dawn in ruins"" . Guess I had a new beginning in mind.. :/    This is something I'm not very proud of lol. Its a kiddish riddle-poem kinda thing I wrote xD      hmm....these are some more ""hmmm's"" from my collection of weird and random hmmm's xD      and some incomplete random stuff popping in my head...-_-' and...how could I forget -  This!! and finally :-  A self Portrait ;P And if you want, you can always see more of my works on instagram : https://www.instagram.com/jugaadist For those who have a passion for art, I'd surely like to know about them. Why not use our heads together to solve community problems like littering, spitting,etc? ping me if interested and perhaps I'll show you how to make those tin foil sculptures (but that's not a promise ;P). So if anyone wants to meet up and do some crazy art stuff or scrap art, they're most welcome xD EDIT : Thank you for so many upvotes. Here are some more doodles I made while travelling in the Delhi Metro :P  I call this “How to kill freedom”. Its supposed to depict social and sexual bullying. Its actually shameful that the society either victimizes, pities or idolizes the ‘victim’ whereas when something like this happens, the only thing that person wants is to be accepted as a normal person and not as a victim or a hero. Makes me wonder who is actually wrong…..The accused or the society which doesn't accept misfits..  and again, I call this “How to kill dreams”.. Hope you guys like it ^^ I usually go for brute art or scrap-art as it uses waste and junk to create art and sculptures. I use it as a means to ""Reduce, Reuse and Recycle""  This is a motorbike I made using the parts salvaged from a broken hard disk in my office.

Let’s define “native designer”. What does that mean? Personally, I have no idea. So let’s ignore the “native” part for now and focus on the rest of your question: How do you break into the gaming industry as a designer without any experience? That’s easy: with great difficulty. I’m going to assume you don’t know your vocabulary. That’s okay; I know it’s hard as an outsider. Video game designer: someone who documents the design of a video game. It doesn’t include programming, making art or sound effects. It is documenting. It’s mostly about writing.Now if that’s what you’re talking about, we can begin. First, do you have any training? I don’t mean in video game design, I mean in anything? Like a college degree in literally anything? If so, that will help. Second, video game design is the hardest field in the game industry to break into. It’s a highly coveted role with way more candidates than open positions. Furthermore, most video game developers recruit internally than externally first, so theirs a good chance they won’t even announce a game designer position since they can get someone else from the inside to fill it. Even if they do post the job externally, they’ll get a few hundred applicants. Even if your CV is stellar, it’ll be easy to get lost in the shuffle. So most aspiring video game designers take another role in the video game industry—such as in programming, art or somewhere else—before getting their shot at game design. Do you have any skills aside from wanting to design video games? Third, most game designers work on games they’re assigned to work on, not games they want to work on. The games that get built are the ones that get funded. Not all—or any—of your game ideas are going to be thought of as “stellar” and go into development. In fact, most people won’t even hear about your game idea, at least for the first few years in the industry. So if you want to get into video game design because you want to build your dream game, I’m sorry. That’s not how it works. If you’re a game designer with a huge track record of successful games, people may listen to a game idea you want to build. If you’re Joe Green with no experience in the industry? No chance. The only way you can build your dream game from the get-go is to build it yourself. And making it yourself requires programming, writing and art. If you can do it all, great. You can do it indie. Otherwise, you’ll have to get others to help, which is always a challenge. Fourth, you’ll need a portfolio. Personal game designs—even if they were never actually built—are good resources. If you get an interview, you can elaborate on why it’s a great idea, how it’ll hook the players, and how it’ll generate revenue. Working on mods is also good portfolio material. Not all of it is programming, and you can talk about how you designed a particular portion of a mod. Fifth, the pay sucks. Especially for fresh game designers, you won’t be driving a luxury car or going out to dinner every night. Paying off student loans? You’ll be lucky to meet the minimum payment. Sure, well-known designers of block-buster games make tons of money. There are few of those. Most game designers struggle to make ends meet, just like everyone else. So, you’ll probably have to take another role in video game development first, to even get a shot. You’ll have to: Have some skill that lends itself to video game development (art, programming, even production (management))Cast a wide net (apply for tons of positions), since even getting any job in game development is a challenge, andHave a great portfolioOr you can go the indie route, which has it’s own set of challenges. Good luck!  Update: I see a word in the original question was changed from “native” to “narrative”, but it doesn’t affect my answer. I’ve never heard of a narrative designer, but even if it exists, it’s a subset of game design. So my answer is still relevant.

No matter what it is that you are talking about really! She is very introverted. The most introverted person I know. She can be perfectly content in her solitude for long periods of time. Waaaay longer than I can. In that sense, I need her more than she needs me. But overall, our relationship is one of the healthiest, most balanced friendships I have ever observed. She is a major perfectionist. It will either be perfect and take her a million years to complete, or she won’t do it. She is very laid-back & opened minded. Very type-b personality. She will always go with the flow. Easy person to be around for extended periods of time. She is not at all obnoxious in any way. She is very spiritual. She’s also a yoga teacher. We can talk about this sort of thing for hours. We can talk about literally ANYTHING. Seriously, I mean anything- and without any judgement. I feel so lucky to have someone like this in my life. Our conversations are the most interesting I have ever had with anyone, and they’re so beneficial. Neither of us ever try to one up the others ideas. We both listen, and then input and grow from each other’s point of views. We can go so deep together. It’s truly beautiful. She can be very moody. She’s struggled with depression the majority of the time I have known her. She’s gotten a lot better at dealing with it, though. Sometimes her mood swings can offend me, but I just have to put it into perspective that she doesn’t want to be this way, she’s dealing with things. She’s horrible at responding to texts, and things. Another thing she doesn’t try to do. She is just very bad at it. She is not very good with communication. She hates conflict, and will avoid it at pretty much every cost. In groups, she is a listener. She doesn’t talk much around people she doesn’t know well. However, when you get to know her is when you get to see how beautiful her mind truly is. She loves art of all kinds. We bond over this a lot. We both love music, books, and films more than most things. She is an english major, so I am always getting lovely book recommendations from her. She’s very creative. She’s also very visually detailed. She’s good with aesthetics. She is compassionate, but not very good at helping other people with sensitive feelings. She is not very vocal about how much she appreciates you, unless you state it first. She does appreciate you a lot, and you see it in other ways, but she doesn’t actually say it too often. I am very opposite in this way, so it can bother me, but I again just have to remind myself this is a way we are different and I know she does appreciate me. I know I do plenty she probably doesn’t understand too. She thinks very abstractly. I love this about her and people in general. She has an amazing and very weird sense of humor. We laugh so hard together. We can say things that don’t even make sense, but we know exactly what each other means. She is very individualistic. She is very independant. She doesn’t need almost anyone. She has a small group of friends, but quality ones. Quality over quantity always with her. She hates celebrity pop culture. She never knows what’s going on with that stuff at all. She’s not superficial at all. Very, very real. She is stubborn, and can be petty at times. Especially in romantic relationships. She is not a planner at all. Typically a procrastinator. She’s actually also very good at math! She is very loyal to those she loves. She has the purest intentions in mind when it comes to her close ones. She really does want them to succeed. She will be there to cheer you on when you need her. I could add a lot more to this list, but for now that’s what I got. Not sure if this is true for all INFPs, but this is what she is like. I know 2 other INFPs vaguely, but nothing close to how I know her. She is truly a lovely person, that I couldn’t imagine living life without.

In this way, you can get two things done simultaneously at one go. What are some virtual reality jobs? Some of virtual reality jobs include research engineer, programmer or software developer, interaction designer, system analyst. Virtual reality research engineer, for example, performs the research related with VR in the company. You need to know in deep and detail on VR and exploring on how to improve its technology and platform in various ways.  Where to start? A degree in art/technology/ design or maths and coding are all useful bases from which to launch yourself into a career in virtual reality development. An undergraduate or postgraduate degree in any of the above could be really helpful for getting your foot in the door, especially with big companies. The internet is full of useful resources that you can use to hone your skills and gain more specific experience in virtual reality beyond your degree. Not only a degree in computer science since VR is a wide area with factors that will combine various factors.

So, it is important to have a hang of all of these to have a successful career in VR. If we have to choose one of the above-mentioned aspects the most important thing that you should know apart from computer science is designing. So it would be that just like computer science degree, you can also go for an online Design degree. This would increase your employability chances. As per the online platform The Statistics Portal, the number of active virtual reality users worldwide is predicted to reach 170 million by 2018. The VR market is expected to grow very fast and it would be growing at an approximate increase of 3000%.  VR is the creation of virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we believe that we are really there. This is a technically complex feature that is achieved through the use of a number of technologies. It can be used for both entertainment and also as a serious technical tool. It is just in the starting stage it is expected have a lot of innovation in the coming years. As a result, it would certainly bring in a number of employment options. if you are a 360 VR creator, feel free to follow and request me any 360 or/and VR relevant questions! :)",2021-03-07T00:01:10.332Z,"What job opportunities exist currently in VR or AR?

Having actually worked with both, I can tell you that it’s actually not as clean-cut and simple as just one is easier than the other. The issue is that, though it’s a lot quicker to make an individual sprite (pixel art) that’s low quality, you’re not just making one individual sprite. You have to make every single frame of every single animation and, while you can copy/paste to some degree, it largely requires a lot of manual effort for each. Even a moderate quality sprite takes a substantial level of skill to produce as well, since you’re relying upon the human eye to blend individual pixels together to create detail which doesn’t actually exist, so anything above the bare minimum quality of sprites can actually be pretty tricky to do. With a 3D model, though the front-loaded effort is substantially higher to make a good mesh, then to set the UVs and skin weighting, not to mention the actual rigging and texturework, once those are out of the way you can animate a 3D model in a fraction of the time and effort, lighting can be done automatically and there’s a lot more freedom with interactions involving particle effects or collision detection between model meshes. Almost all of the really complicated stuff is done at least partially automatically for you once you have the model done, so 3D is a lot easier to work with once you have the parts ready to go, but the work to get to that point is more substantial. So yeah, if you mean just a single sprite? Sure, it’s pretty easy to pump out a single 2D sprite with relative ease, but it’s only good for one frame. Even moderately alright sprites require several frames for just idle animations, and given how finicky the individual pixels are, since you have to imply a lot of information that isn’t actually present, even minor tweaks can take some real effort. In contrast, a well-rigged 3D model can have a full idle animation with secondary motions completed in a few minutes these days thanks to how advanced the automatic features of the modeling programs are these days. It takes a lot more effort to get to the point where you can just lower the model’s height a bit so it automatically kneels down into a crouch with a fluid animation, but once you have it at that point it’s literally like a 30 second job to do basic, simple animations like that. Doing the same thing with a sprite, yeah, the single frame only takes a few minutes, but for every single little animation you have to basically do it by hand every time and there’s no automation present pretty much at all. As such, it really comes down to how much effort you’re willing to spend and how much quality you want in the end. If you look at something like the Kingdom series of games, their pixel art obviously took a long time to do well.  To be perfectly honest, this would actually be a lot easier to do in 3D than it would be to do with sprites. Which is why in the most recent game, Kingdom: Two Crowns, they redid the entire game engine and all the art was redone in 3D. What you’re seeing in that animation is 3D models, even though it doesn’t look like it. Kind of like how South Park is actually all 3D models as well.  The reason for this is that it’s a looooooooooot easier to animate things in 3D than it is to animate in 2D. Like orders of magnitude easier. There’s no comparison at all, even in the slightest. 3D is much, much easier to work with once you have the models finished… it’s just setting up the models in the first place takes vastly larger amounts of effort compared to a single sprite is all. If you’re creating a low-budget, easy to do game with minimal quality animations with no real concern for quality? Yeah, sprites are quicker and easier to do if you’re going to be sloppy and half-hearted in your efforts, but if you want high quality looking pixelated games that just have that retro look without being retro quality, well… you’re better off going 3D basically every time.",2021-03-07T00:02:10.396Z,"Is it easier for developers to make pixelated games as opposed to regular graphics video games?

My first laser was really intuitive… for people with a CAD/CAM background. The learning curve felt more like a cliff and nothing really seemed intuitive to my 3D artist / digital painter self. 3D printing was easier. The thing is, I got that first laser a year ago. About six months later, I hadn't successfully made a damn thing, I'd called tech support a bunch and I learned how to calibrate a laser with an allen wrench adjusting each mirror by hand… and forget dealing with the clunky software… it just wasn't happening. I've been working at Glowforge for six months and I make things at least once a week. Yesterday I was writing a document that I needed a screen shot for so I made a quick wallet… like it was nothing. (And really it was nothing, it took 5 minutes and that included walking to the supply closet for a piece of leather, it was about 40 seconds on the laser.) Getting from A to B didn't take long, it just took being willing to make a lot of mistakes. The hardest skill, for developing my own designs, wasn't about becomming an expert in Illustrator… it was learning how to prototype. My first table design failed pretty badly, and even the 3rd (4th? 5th?) revisionwas prone to tipping over… but that's okay. It's important to give ourselved permission to fail while we learn. This was last night's prototype for a gussetted bag:  That's a fail. The gussets don't actually fit, the tongue isn't near long enough…. Fail. So, I could call it a waste of $30 worth of leather and try again… but, I have a really precise tool for cutting things so today's fail…  Is tomorrow's bracelet.

Then, I plus a junior engineer and a 3D artist set about writing a game to run on it. We had to write tools for the 3D artist - plus we interfaced the controls, the safety systems, the coin box and dollar bill reader - made it possible to network multiple machines for multiplayer play…etc. So for the first time - I got to design, implement and test 100% of the software and a good chunk of the electronics from the ground up…and do most of it by myself.

As the company grows or shrinks in value, so does the value of your equity. Depending on the addressable market, hunting whales or social adoption etc. But value is directly linked to company performance and perception of the ability of the company to successfully grow. Also depending upon the amount of equity you may have voting/investment decision rights. ICO allocation - You have the rights to a set of digital hashes, that will hopefully rise in value on a coin exchange. You own no equity or voting rights. There is no fiduciary duty to investors, unless mandated by country of incorporation (eg: company can shut down and walk away with the money and you can do nothing, in several cases). Many startups are looking at ICOs to quickly raise funds to avoid the loss of equity and reduce fiduciary liability. Coin value is not linked to performance of company, but to the perceived value the coin my provide to investors. So the Company may be successfully bought out by another company or even IPO’d, but that does not link it to the rise in the Coin Value.

Frankly, 90% or more of ICOs are not worth even looking into based on this first question. If it passes the smell test for scam/ponzi, then here’s generally my next steps (in order): What is the token distribution? Try to figure out what their token sales strategy is first. Generally speaking, 30% is fair. If there are “discounts” that means there is an uneven playing field, and the fact they need incentives to attract buyers could be the subtle clue that drives my decision making process. However, discounts aren’t necessarily a negative sign, as a lock-in period can make up for that.Who are they working with? Check out their law firm. If they don’t have one, that could be a red flag for trouble. What is the github history of the CTO? Check out who their advisors are. If the advisors doesn’t have any experience in ICOs, usually that’s a bad sign. And that’s why people hire me. I can refer them to reputable law firms, developers and such. I’m pretty picky on who I associate with (it’s a small world!) and I also take a small stake in the token, so I do have skin in the game. I also don’t get my accredited investor list involved, unless I truly believe there is potential. Other advisors should hold themselves to at least something similar.How are they marketing themselves? Ideally, just through word-of-mouth or the well known brand gets a huge amount of investors. However, that doesn’t mean all ICOs are fortunate enough to do this. In that case, I would proceed with what they have done before, and what makes them different (in a good way)? How is the coin 10x or 100x better than everything out there in the market? What is the marketing language they use to convey it?How is the token going to get listed on an exchange? Great tokens can have a great “idea”, MVP and team, but ultimately no distribution could be a downfall. Unfortunately, exchange listing is quite expensive and difficult to navigate (again, people hire me for this because I know how exchanges are generally run). If I’m not sure an exchange will list the coin, then I might want to reconsider volume and liquidity for the token. This is quite critical, unless the ICO in question has investors that are looking for the long haul. Often a lot of investors (not all) are looking to speculate on the token. If you don’t have a clear plan to list, they might go elsewhere. Also it might not be lack of funds, but lack of will. For example, Credo (backed by Tim Draper) founder did not want to get “robbed” by exchanges, so the token never really got much volume. You’d have to wait an eternity to liquidate any tokens, if you change your mind. Even worse, if the community gets impatient or upset, you now have problems on long-term adoption.What is their cybersecurity strategy? This one is often a missed point and very few people have cybersecurity experience in this area. There are phishers, hackers, DDoS’ers and many other bad actors that will try to screw a ICO over in many different ways. I do contract security audits myself as a specialized, boutique firm, and some end up with the much more expensive route of hiring a big cybersecurity firm to do comprehensive checks. I have constructed my own token scenarios and “hacked” my own tokens based on other token code flaws out there. For instance, something as simple as a misplaced timestamp order can allow locked tokens to be claimed (In case you don’t code, this = really problematic!!). If you have an incompetent CTO with no cybersecurity experience in the ICO space, you will have potentially huge problems, especially if you ever make it big.Where is the corporation and how is it structured? If the entity is offshore, that signals the corporation is looking to avoid taxes. If you expose token holders to certain liabilities, that makes you less credible. Ideally, for US-based tokens, I would just do a Delaware C if it was my ICO and pay the respective taxes. I would register or file an exemption for the ICO with the SEC. It’s relatively low these days with the new tax bill and taxes often pay themselves back in an intangible way.There is no intention for this to be tax or legal advice, and I’m not a lawyer or CPA! Don’t use this as your guide, do your own research and hire the respective professionals. Each ICO has a unique circumstance. There are no one-size-fits-all heuristics to evaluate ICOs. There are pros and cons with ICOs as with any source of fundraising.

Security and risk is one of the biggest selling points of cryptocurrency is that it offers transparency while at the same time anonymity. This means that transactions can always be trusted once they are committed to the blockchain ledger and confirmed by other peers. On the flip side, loss, theft or fraud can never be reversed since there is no centralized authority involved and no way to track the transaction in reverse.

If any new ICO comes, community can verify the advisor involvement by verifying him / her on public Blockchain, stopping people from scamming.

In terms of your team, you’ll have some good people and some bad people, and the best and worst will consume most of your management time. You’ll have to deliver messages you don’t agree with, and own them as if you pushed for them yourself. In my experience - i.e. where I’ve worked - it pays no better than being a developer. Don’t manage because that’s “how you get ahead” and “how you get respect.” Do it because you want to.Ensure you have opportunity. The easiest place to become a manager is in an area which has high turnover or high growth. Both of these create opportunity for new managers, especially managers already familiar with that silo. Make sure your own manager knows you’re interested in management opportunities. Ask for work to help you grow in this direction, and to demonstrate you’re ready.Manage in your silo. If you’re developer, aim to be a development manager. If you’re a product manager (an individual who helps manage the project but not people), look for lead product manager positions. It’s hard enough to transition to being a manager, especially a good one. Don’t make it harder by switching domains (e.g. from dev to test, from back end to front end) at the same time.Grow in or near your silo. Your best opportunities to advance to the next level of management will come from your current management chain. Perhaps your manager doesn’t have a role for you to take the next step up, but their manager or their skip manager might. It’s much harder to move both vertically and laterally, e.g. to a higher position in a different management chain.You don’t need an MBA or an advanced degree, and if you don’t already have them, getting one will simply be opportunity cost. You need a broad understanding of the area you’re managing, some common sense, good people skills, and good communication and organization skills. A tolerance or enjoyment of talking to people - lots of people - is a plus. Being self-motivated, deciding what should happen with your team and keeping them busy, productive, and growing - is critical.",2021-03-07T00:19:23.276Z,"How does one transition from an engineering role to a blockchain manager role?

This is exactly what Ambrosus have done, with specific emphasis on the food and pharmaceutical sectors. Decentralised IoT Networks for Next-Generation Supply Chains Ambrosus have created is a system that updates the network at each and every stage of a products manufacturing and handling, by the scanning of real-time sensors attached to a product. These scanners measure a products time, location and environment (temperature, humidity, light etc) which can be traced at any time by all parties within the ecosystem. Ultimately, giving the end consumer a full overview of everything that happened to the product along the way. This eliminates the inaccuracies of relying on individual parties, to transfer from one processing step to the next.

The growing complexity of supply chains, along with a rising number of external intermediaries and different stakeholders, is one of the prominent concerns in supply chain management. So, the applications of blockchain in supply chain management have the potential to streamline the exchange of data, communication, and documents in the supply chain landscape.  However, blockchain is a comparatively new technology that emerged almost over a decade ago for supporting Bitcoin transactions. Will it be reasonable to implement blockchain solutions for supply chain management? So, let us dive into the following discussion to find out the significance of blockchain in supply chain management. Potential of Blockchain for Supply Chain Management Applications One of the first questions that come forward when thinking of applying blockchain in supply chain management relates to feasibility of the same. It is important to understand how blockchain is suitable for supply chain operations before moving towards the applications. The distinct features of blockchain show how it can be a suitable instrument in transforming supply chain management. 1. No Intermediaries The foremost feature of blockchain is the lack of intermediaries such as banks. Therefore, it can help in faster settlements with better transparency, with automatic updates of the ledger. Managers could pre-program the payment conditions along with transaction visibility for ensuring that transactions are visible only to authorized individuals. 2. Immutability The support for audit trail in blockchain also ensures that no one could modify, tamper or hide any information. Therefore, the transparency in blockchain could help in ensuring immutability of supply chain transactions. 3. Reliability Another important factor that influences the possibilities for applying blockchain in supply chain management refers to reliability. Blockchain is distributed in nature and does not feature a single point of failure. On the other hand, you also have the assurance of immutable and irrevocable transactions on blockchain. Therefore, blockchain can help in removing the risks of fraud in supply chain transactions by a huge margin. Actual Influence of Blockchain on Supply Chain Management With an impression of the potential of blockchain for applications in supply chain management, it is important to find the ways in which blockchain can change supply chain. Here are some of the ways in which blockchain can influence supply chain operations. 1. Improved Tracking The foremost application of blockchain in supply chain management refers to provenance tracking. Bigger organizations have highly complicated supply chains. Therefore, they face many struggles in tracking the records of multinational companies. The lack of transparency could impose considerable influence on multinational organizations. With the help of blockchain-based supply chain management, businesses could access product information through embedded sensors and RFID tags. As a result, blockchain could simplify provenance tracking and record-keeping by considerable margins. 2. Developing Trust The use of blockchain in supply chain management will also play a critical role in establishing trust. The development of trust in large supply chains with many participants could support smoother operations. For example, manufacturers could have trust in the supplier for following factory safety standards. 3. Cost Reduction Another promising approach for leveraging blockchain in supply chain management practically is cost reduction. Blockchain can support real-time tracking of products in supply chain, thereby reducing the total cost of transporting items through the supply chain. According to a survey by the Digital Supply Chain Institute, more than 33% of supply chain workers perceived cost reduction as the top benefit of implementing blockchain in supply chain management. Examples of Blockchain in Supply Chain The real-life examples of blockchain applications in supply chain management also showcase the significance of blockchain for supply chain management. 1. Renowned pharma giant Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) has leveraged blockchain-based supply chain systems for regulatory compliance. 2. A blockchain-based trust platform, Treum, is offering a platform for developing supply chains of the future with a focus on tradability, traceability, and transparency. Conclusion On a concluding note, it is clear that blockchain has the capability for revolutionizing supply chain management. The potential of blockchain for supply chain management and its actual influence present long-term prospects for blockchain in supply chain management. With more enterprises slowly turning towards blockchain solutions in supply chain management, you can benefit from blockchain expertise. It is reasonable to start learning about the fundamentals of blockchain in supply chain management right now.

To make thing easy and transparent they use blockchain in procurment & supply chain . Today, we will know about blockchain in supply chain. Effective supply chain management relies on knowing several attributes of the chain at any given moment including where goods are at any given moment, and the origin of all of the parts of the chain. This allows for planning for untimely delays in the process. For example, delays due to bad weather, labor disputes, etc. can be factored into the final product. If a company knows that a shipment is incomplete or likely to get delayed, they can immediately look for ways to remedy the situation. They can look for alternate sources or pass the information further down the chain as they find necessary. As consumers are making more conscious buying decisions, suppliers are looking for new ways to provide them with authenticity and an origin trail for the product. In this way, consumers can see for themselves how equitably the product has been manufactured by looking at the carbon emissions and other regulatory compliance of the manufacturer. Specifically, the food industry is estimated to lose about $40 billion every year due to food fraud. Food fraud refers to the deliberate and intentional substitution, addition, tampering, or misrepresentation of food products for economic gain. It’s easy to commit food fraud due to the numerous steps involved in the food supply chain from sourcing of the raw material to the final product. Blockchains can be immensely useful in the scenario as they can prove authenticity for every batch of raw material. It’s easy to embed farm origination data like information about the growing condition of crops. From then, as the food travels, all of the relevant information like factory conditions, batch numbers, expiration dates, storage, and shipping data could all be added to a batch of food items. Therefore when the final product is shipped, it would have its entire origination history. Both at scalar and global business networks, tractability and transparency are some of the most important foundations of logistics and supply chain. I hope this helps!

These blocks are linked and secured on a peer to peer network using cryptography technology. As the technology is evenly distributed across a network of multiple computers, it has no centralized point of entry, giving added security from cyber threats. The system is also built to be transparent and secure; those within the chain can view the individual block transactions but cannot alter those they are not a part of, they can only add further detail. Pharmaceutical supply chains are particularly complex, requiring the input of multiple stakeholders with several important requirements placed upon them. Currently, the supply chain must allow multiple parties to update and share data, it must verify that such information can be trusted and it may have to interact with national and international verification systems, transport systems and regulatory bodies. This brings many challenges. Naturally, having so many stakeholders able to input and change data adds complexity to the quality of the data. It is difficult to monitor and validate the correct information and secure against human error and missing documentation. Interactions are often time-sensitive, yet documentation may not always be managed quickly. There is also the overall issue of manufacturers, logistics companies, wholesalers and pharmacists not being able to have complete visibility on the authenticity of a drug and the quality while it is in transit. It is hoped that blockchain could revolutionize the pharmaceutical supply chain by enabling a simple single-use system for all stakeholders, which would give transparency, security, and oversight of the end to end delivery of goods. A blockchain-based supply chain has several benefits. Firstly, it allows for a comprehensive overview of the entire end to end process. The full supply chain can be managed through one piece of software. It also gives enhanced transparency between the authorized stakeholders. Each party can see the stages of the drug journey to ensure authenticity and quality. A single system also limits complexity. Once stakeholders understand how to use the platform and become comfortable with the process, they should be able to comply with ease. Human error and loss of documentation will also be significantly limited. Another important benefit of blockchain is added to traceability and security. Using a blockchain system, products can be tracked, traced and recalled when necessary. The system itself is also under a higher level of scrutiny and protection, therefore, is more secure. An audit trail created through the block system is an added benefit. With all relevant information stacked and recorded chronologically, both internal and external parties can review the entire chain when necessary. In practical terms, at each stage of the process, barcodes would be scanned and recorded onto a blockchain ledger system, which in turn creates the audit trail for the drug journey. Every delivery can be tracked, with the delivery driver traced through biometric measures. Every checkpoint involving the drug can also be measured and recorded through many tools. Sensors can also be incorporated into the supply chain, with temperature or humidity being recorded onto the ledger system. With a drug fully tracked from creation to patient, the supply chain can become a holistic, accurate, audited and secure process. Blockchain comes with a significant limitation: scalability. As the number of transactions grows, the system becomes slower, more expensive and less sustainable over the long term. One way to address scalability is sharding, a process that breaks the data into manageable chunks distributed across different nodes. Blockchain sharding is already being used for private blockchain networks. In layman's terms, sharding splits a database into smaller chunks which are then stored across several machines. Doing so balances a network's load across many nodes. There are various ways to implement the protocol, and scalability projects like Shardus are actively seeking optimal designs.",2021-03-07T00:21:50.813Z,"How can a blockchain revolutionize pharma supply chain management?

Logistics managers can automate critical areas such as inventory management, logistics, securities, and payments via smart contracts. Eliminate Fake Goods: Blockchain nodes can serve as designated quality attesting entities to verify any goods that enter the supply chains. Owing to the superior traceability offered by decentralized management, a product’s quality can be easily cross-verified. Nodes can verify an item’s authenticity via QR scans, seals, and the raw materials used to produce them. Reduce Complexity: Retailers can simplify supply chain complexities such as tedious documentation, worldwide coordination, shipment management, storage & inventory management, delivery administration, and payments via smart contract development. The government can deploy customized intelligent contracts within the supply chain’s blockchain. These self-governing programs can automate any supply chain operation with ease. Improve Trust: Blockchain builds a trusted system in a genuinely trustless environment such as supply chain & logistics management. With decentralized innovation, supply chains benefit from uninterrupted access to data shared across the supply chain. There exist no barriers to information sharing and tracking. The immutability of data stored in distributed ledgers benefits supply chains to eliminate data tampering and fraud.

Risk management Customer acceptance policy: This policy alludes to the rules that a bank follows in permitting the customer who will open a record with them. No individual can open the record in a mysterious or an anecdotal name. The character of a customer ought not have any criminal records. The record can be opened if every one of the reports are totally confirmed. Customer Identification policy: This policy incorporates the check of a customer through the data, certain information, and archives. Every one of the reports should be submitted keeping in mind the end goal to the laws and standards. Monitoring of exchanges: The exchanges done by the proprietor of any record that is related with a bank, can be checked.

Anything that you do where you want or need to keep track of things with both clarity and specificity is a good candidate. For the food industry it’s a way of improving communication and proving quality and quantity. Suppose you wanted to keep track of heirloom seeds. You could have a database that keeps track of the parents of the seeds, the supplier, dates, locations, etc. If that DB is in a blockchain then you and your customers and your suppliers all know all that information. So do your competitors if they have the magic login information. If I’m a buyer for a local food co-op then I want to know if you are growing those seeds in a greenhouse or in an open field, whether you have people or robots tending and weeding, whether and what soil amendments, fertilizers, and pesticides if any that you use. I will also want to know as the fruits of those plants pass each major stage of ripeness. All of that is so I can decide whether to wait for the crop to buy, to not buy (because my customers don’t like herbicides for instance) or even to lock in all I want by purchasing futures from you. With a blockchain we can both see, this is possible, and we don’t need to commoditize your crop on the Chicago Board of Trade. It’s all around more efficient and we both reap the benefits of that efficiency. This kind of thing can be applied at any stage of food handling, at any scale. If I’m Kroger then I want to know when the next shipment of bananas is landing in Houston. If I can know in advance where they came from, when they were picked, etc. then I can make better choices about where to distribute them, what to charge, etc. If I’m Kroger then I can have a blockchain for each and every customer. It’s a short jump from the customer retention profile I have now to one that I actually share with each specific customer. How about prepared food? My small chain of burger joints claims 100% never-frozen beef (or elk, or bison, or whatever.) We can—and do—prove it continuously. The entire history of every burger served is available to all, including the state and county health inspectors. If I had such a chain, I’d lobby for lower taxes since I’m saving them money.

A recent World Economic Forum Report states that around 10 percent of GDP by 2025 will be stored on blockchain and similar technologies. Already, several companies have used blockchain solution for procure to pay in their ecosystem. How can blockchain advance CSR? A supply chain use case. Let us take a closer look at the benefits of blockchain technology with a real-life use case: the supply chain and the provenance of our products and their components. Products retailed globally typically have one thing in common: their components come from all over the world and their value chains and logistics are often international operations. As such, the logistics and supply chains, production and retail processes are highly complex and depend on immense amounts of reliable data, as well as detailed coordination and monitoring. Modern supply chains create mountains of paperwork. Just take the ocean freight industry, which accounts for shipping 90% of goods in global trade. IBM estimates that shipping requires on average 30 signatures from different organizations and 200 instances of communication. Let’s not even start on how wasteful international shipping is on top of relying on paper-based, environmentally disastrous processes. In addition, fraud, manipulation of data and products, human error, a high vulnerability to delays and in-transparency are some additional shortcomings affecting international supply chains. This seems contradictory to the clear necessity in supply chain management to have reliable and agreed data sets and be time-efficient. Moreover, the need for greater transparency, regulation and standard-setting is evident as cases, in which consumer protection and manufacturer compliance were violated and even product recalls became necessary, have shaken consumer trust in the past. Corporate initiatives have responded to these challenges and shortcomings of existing supply chain and provenance mechanisms by exploring blockchain solutions in this area. All projects are currently in different development stages ranging from use case development to proof-of-concepts and have different success stories to tell. Among the list of big players exploring blockchain solutions in the area of supply chain management, chain of custody tracking, anti-counterfeiting and traceability are Microsoft, Walmart, IBM and Maersk.

In the case of online transactions, Blockchain lets users send, receive and manage their accounts without the need of a middleman. Let’s say you own a store and have recently started accepting online payments. But, you are facing issues over the authenticity of the payments customers make. Once you adopt Blockchain technology, management online payments become easier, as you and your customers will have open access to payment history, removing the issue of tampered payments. Blockchain technology for payments was designed for the effective running of Bitcoin digital currency, but there are ongoing attempts to use Blockchain in non-Bitcoin transactions. Once this revolutionary new way to pay takes off, it could prove useful for businesses in many ways. Below are some of the benefits Blockchain technology could bring to the business in terms of financial scalability and management. Access to a global marketplace Businesses that embrace online transactions using Blockchain technology are going to benefit on a global scale. This is mainly because Blockchain is itself a decentralized money management system that allows anyone in an encrypted database to send and receive money. Blockchain will benefit both multinational companies, who have to deal with different rates and different currencies and small businesses, who have settlement difficulties but can scale up faster in the digital space. Lightning-fast payments Whenever money is being transferred from one source to another, it would typically take a few days for the receiving end to confirm the payment; this is because the money first has to travel to the respective financial institution for legal purposes. With Blockchain, there is just you and your customers and no middleman to regulate the flow of money. The regulation is fully automated through the Blockchain’s algorithm and has proven to be surprisingly fast. No additional transaction fees The government has already spread the great news that there will not be additional taxations imposed on those businesses embracing digital payments like UPI based apps. Blockchain technology will only enhance this benefit by letting businesses have better cash flow by removing the need for payment assistance devices. More innovative devices like Bijlipay’s mPOS systems can work hand in hand with Blockchain technology to give consumers the most convenient way to pay. Secure real-time payments Security is still a major concern, especially in the still-young digital marketplace of India. Blockchain technology has the potential to solve security concerns even as transactions are being made since its entire algorithm is based on an open-to-all platform that ensures full transparency between buyer and seller. Improved financial management Online transactions and mobile payments have effectively become big data, which means the business has more information that needs to be processed. Considering the speed and ease of use Blockchain technology offers, managing large inflows of money will become hassle-free for all industries that embrace the technology. One of the project that I crossed paths with that is making blockchain payments simple and easy is called Multichain Ventures. Multichain Ventures is the parent company of several underlying entities including The Tokes Platform, Cubed, and EDEN. These brands produce blockchain-focused products including, but not limited to, cryptocurrency-based payment processing and supply chain visibility tools.

A study done by the Project Management Institute found that, for every 1 billion dollars invested in the US, 122 billion dollars was misused as a result of ineffective project management. Another interesting finding that supports calls for innovative project management solutions is the fact that 31 percent of projects were finalized on time and under budget in 1994. Twenty years later, the proportion has grown to 36 percent, the technological advancements notwithstanding. In the current setting, a significant proportion of project management solutions depend on a hierarchical, centralized structure that restricts the accountability for success or failure to the project manager or the project management office. Key stakeholders in this sector view the emergence of blockchain technology as one of the ways through which project management can be revolutionized. There is widespread acceptance that as the global economy becomes more complex, a decentralized solution such as blockchain holds the potential to scale into the future, enhance the quality of governance, and minimize bureaucracy. The belief is that blockchain project management solutions will not replace conventional project managers.

This is reinforced by all of the conversation about BTC and ETH shortages. These clients primarily reside in the U.S., the U.K., Asia, Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, Australasia, and Latin America. The growing adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies constitutes a seminal shift in the market’s perception of these digital assets. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen how the cryptos would fare against national digital currencies, backed by the full faith and credit of central banks. To this end, China is leading the race as its ditgital yaun is close to an official launch following successful trial runs.  The above chart is a little dated, but it does clearly show that not only does the bull run phase has been getting longer, but the overall cycle. So without the additional adoption interest the cycle duration was expected to grow in length. After halving 1 the bull run was 368 days, after halving 2 it was 525 days … 157 day difference or an increase of about 43%. That would be 223 days added to 525 or a total of 748 days after halving 3 for this bull run. That would put the end of the bull run on May 22, 2022 which feels really long considering I have seen and heard of dates for the peak to be much sooner. There is some interesting dates in this video … https://youtu.be/qGuBECOoYwA  This additional interest I think it will have some kind of time impact, but I still need to do more study to make my own determination.

Due to their decentralized nature, blockchain has a very large amount of computational power backing them up which makes it virtually impossible for them to get hacked. Blockchain also allows for users on the internet to be securely identified using their cryptographic private keys. These two properties of blockchain can be combined to create data management systems that are completely resilient to hacks because they don’t suffer from a single point of failure. In fact, ID management startup Civic is using blockchain for this very purpose – they upload a digitally verified copy of a user’s ID documents like passports or driving licenses to their blockchain. Later, when an entity requests access to that document, the user gets a prompt on their phone from which they can choose to allow or deny the request. The same model can be applied to healthcare records as well so that people are not left in the dark about their sensitive information being exposed like in the case of the Equifax hack. This also has the added advantage of simplifying data provenance – users can opt-in to share the medical data with researchers anonymously so that their results can be used to develop better treatments in the future. Also since there are no middlemen in this transaction, healthcare researchers can be sure that data integrity has not been compromised.

A new class of assets that can be bought, sold and stored digitally have come in and modified the field of asset management. The type of clients that need this service in the wake of a new world of assets and new technologies need an asset management firm that hears their needs. Millennials are part of these clients and they exert buyer influence for the adoption of technologies that improve buyer experience. A buzzing hype tech is blockchain. A technology that is simply described as a means to share an encrypted database on the internet with anyone (of course you have to be within the network of members) at any time and without the selfless permission to change data. So how would these qualities, put plain, affect asset management? Decentralization Centralized systems of holding clients data are the norm with many firms that have branches countrywide or globally. Clients information that is from different jurisdictions is held in one area. This opens a varied range of risks should there be a fire or a hack attack or a need to make changes. Blockchain enables each branch to have independence and serve clients at the site immediately. Whatever records are made, they are viewed by other branches on the network without the need of duplicity. Immutability Head office records maintained at one location are prone to secret alterations, mutilations or even loss. Blockchain rids of these demerits by its inherent nature of how data is saved. The ‘blocks’ of record are cryptographically saved and one ‘block’ references to the previous ’block’. This forces you to change all the preceding records should you want to modify one facet of information for your gain. It's going to be a tough, long and tedious system intrusion. Don’t you agree? Fast Transactions Speeds Peer to peer networks are the backbone of blockchain technology. This network infrastructure enables the sharing of files and cryptocurrency in seconds if not minutes. The geographic locations and international borders don’t matter as value or data is transacted with ease and in time. This enables asset management firms to share data and funds in real-time with no hitches. They can also save on foreign currency fluctuations by using a common currency. Inclusivity Blockchain infrastructure platforms are ideal mediums to bring asset management firms together for collaboration and compliance purposes. The idea to harness strengths that can benefit the client and bring in greater value is brought to fruition through this. Gov’t regulations are taken up faster and with better consultation via these platforms. A good example is the Maersk blockchain platform that seeks to bring on board forwarders, shipping lines and port terminals together to improve supply chains. Smart Contracts The need to ascend into auto-execution of trades and asset sell-offs or release of funds for investment upon the end of an event is beckoned by the customer. Notaries and lawyers are not needed in the enforcing of these special types of code in the blockchain network. Smart contracts have fostered increased faith in the activities of asset management firms and are likely to increase the volume of trades as human-interventions risks are annihilated for good. These look into the positives of blockchain technology; how the effects have and will impact asset management. Let’s look at the negatives sometimes soon. Ok? I hope this helps.

Or the clothes that you buy or the food that you eat? Besides the shops that you go to, there’s a whole other chain of different interlinked elements that work on delivering these products to you. This connected chain is called as Supply Chain. Consider a clothing supply chain for instance. The clothing, textiles, and apparel manufacturing industries involve a lot of labors in them as the demand for work is never-ending. The estimated employ count in the industry is of than 60 million people globally. The term supply chain in the clothing sector refers to the back end of the industry. The supply chain in the clothing industry is made by connecting: Raw material sourcesFactories that use these raw materials and create final productsDistribution network that delivers these clothes to consumersOn a global scale, the clothing supply chain consists of millions of people along with tonnes of water, crops, chemicals, and oil. This makes it difficult for manufacturers to find where the different parts of their products come from. The demand for increased speed, high volume, and cheaper consumption is increasing with each passing day. Due to this, when blind consumerism has valued the transparency of an ethical supply chain is compromised. What is Supply Chain Management?  Source: Statista Content & Design Dribbble In more clear terms, Supply chain management includes the integrated planning as well as the execution of different processes. This involves material flow, information flow as well as financial capital flow. The management of the flow of goods, services, and information involving the storage and movement of raw materials, building products as well as full-fledged finished goods from one point to another is called as supply chain management. A supply chain within the SCM is a network of individual entities, organizations, businesses, resources as well as technologies that combine together in the manufacturing of a product or service. Any supply chain progresses by initially delivering the raw materials from a supplier to a manufacturer and eventually ends by delivering the final product to the consumer. Proper implementation of supply chain management can result in benefits like increased sales and revenues, decreased frauds and overhead costs, quality improvisation. Moreover, this will also lead to accelerating production and distribution. While all of this seems simple in theory, practically maintaining a supply chain is a tedious task even for small businesses. The interconnectivity of different elements in the supply chain gradually becomes more inefficient when a business grows. In order to resolve these inefficiencies and save a company’s money, different technologies like AI and Machine learning are being applied to SCM. Amongst these, blockchain is exploring new ways to change the overall game. Supply Chain Challenges and Blockchain Solutions Blockchain can be applied to many challenges of the Supply Chain industry such as complicated recordkeeping and tracking of products. As a less corruptible and better-automated alternative to centralized databases. Following are the ways in which blockchain can be useful in the supply chain industry.  Source: MODUSBOX Provenance Tracking Big companies and organizations have a lot of elements in their supply chains. Due to this, it becomes almost impossible to keep track of each and every record even for multinational corporations. The lack of transparency leads to cost and customer relations issues which ultimately dilutes the brand name. In a blockchain-based supply chain management, record keeping and provenance tracking become easy as the product information can be accessed through the help of embedded sensors and RFID tags. The history of a product right from its origination to where it is in the present time can be traced through blockchain. Moreover, this type of accurate provenance tracking can be used to detect frauds in any part of the supply chain. Cost Reduction The real-time tracking of a product in a supply chain with the help of blockchain reduces the overall cost of moving items in a supply chain. According to a survey of supply chain workers conducted by APQC and the Digital Supply Chain Institute (DSCI), more than one-third of people cited reduction of costs as the topmost benefit of application of Blockchain in supply chain management. When blockchain is applied to speed up administrative processes in supply chains, the extra costs occurring in the system are automatically reduced while still guaranteeing the security of transactions. The elimination of the middlemen and intermediaries in the supply chain saves the risks of frauds, product duplicacy and saves money too. Payments can be processed by customers and suppliers within the supply chain by using cryptocurrencies rather than customers and suppliers rather than relying on EDI. Moreover, efficiency will be improved and the risk of losing products will be reduced with accurate recordkeeping. Establishing Trust Having trust in complex supply chains with many participants is necessary for smooth operations. For example, when a manufacturer shares his products with suppliers, he/she should be able to depend on them for following factory safety standards. Also, when it comes to regulatory compliances such as custom enforcers, trust plays a vital role. The immutable nature of blockchain in the supply chain is well-designed to prevent tampering and establishing trust. Benefits of Supply Chain with Blockchain  Source: Faizod One of the most appealing benefits of using blockchain for data is that it allows the data to be more interoperable. Due to this, it becomes easier for companies to share information and data with manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors. Transparency in Blockchain helps reduce delays and disputes while preventing goods from getting stuck in the supply chain. As each product can be tracked in real-time, the chances of misplacements are rare. Blockchain offers scalability through which any large database is accessible from multiple locations from around the world. It also provides higher standards of security and the ability to customize according to the data feed. Moreover, blockchains can be created in a private manner too which will allow the data to be accessed explicitly between the parties who have the permission for it. The value of adopting blockchain technology can be taken from the fact that it has the potential to connect different ledgers and data points while maintaining the data integrity among multiple participants. The properties of transparency and immutability of blockchain technology make it useful for eliminating frauds in supply chain and maintaining the integrity of the system. Other than these, few other benefits of adopting Blockchain technology in the supply chain industry are: Reduce or eliminate fraud and errorsImprove inventory managementMinimize courier costsReduce delays from paperworkIdentify issues fasterIncrease consumer and partner trustSupply Chain Management with Blockchain Use Cases  Source: IBM With its increasing popularity, blockchain technology seems like the solution to the problems of many industries today. Supply chain being one of the most populated industry holds certain use cases where the application of blockchain technology can make a difference. A single shipment of goods can have at least 20-25 people or organizations in the process which leads to roughly 200 interactions between them thus, leading to a lengthy process. If applied correctly, blockchain technology can assure provenance tracking and traceability across the supply chain. This, in turn, will lead to fewer counterfeiters and ensured safety in the processes. Blockchain in the supply chain will also allow manufacturers, transporters, and end-users to collect data, study trends, and apply predictive monitoring process for better product experience. Following are some of the use cases of blockchain in a supply chain. Seafood Verification Seafood supply chain has caught the negative headlines many a time and still continues to do so due to the lack of a transparent system. The current seafood supply chain has tedious processes like manual recordkeeping that make it more prone to errors. Moreover, other issues that result in making the seafood supply chain inefficient are the improper food storage conditions, mislabeling frauds and prevalence of unregulated practices. Due to these issues the quality and security of the food that reaches to the end-customer is compromised which threatens the industry’s economic security. Moreover, since there are the different type of frauds involved in the chain, the trust between the customers and vendors remain lacking. Blockchain technology can prove to be a panacea to the seafood verification problems as it can track fish and seafood right from the production to its distribution. Big names such as Hyperledger have even started implementing the technology in their projects in order to resolve the issues of the seafood supply chain industry. The project named Hyperledger Sawtooth is revolutionizing the supply chain by bringing traceability and accountability through its modular blockchain platform. It uses the PoET (the proof of elapsed time) consensus algorithm which allows actors in the system to reach a consensus in an environment where the counterparties are unaware of each other’s information. Sawtooth allows the seafood to be detected in the supply chain through sensors that transmit the location and time of the products to the blockchain. This allows the buyer to access a comprehensive record of the product provenance. Coffee Supply Chain  Source: Bext360 When you take a sip of that hot coffee in the morning from that big cup, you don’t even realize how long and complicated its supply chain must have been. The coffee supply chain in a global network that is highly complicated and is in a desperate need for reform. Production of coffee is fragmented as it is usually grown in developing areas of the world that are at remote locations. Other factors that affect the production of coffee and should be taken into consideration are volatile prices and the effect of changing climates. Moreover, since the people working as farmers and laborers in the coffee supply chains are from remote developing areas, there have been reported cases of abuses too. Due to the complexity of the system, the coffee supply chain makes an ideal use case for blockchain adoption and bring transparency and efficiency to the system. A Denver based startup, Bext360 is using a blockchain enabled machine called “bextmachine” that is used to analyze the coffee beans from the farms and assign a number to them for their traceability. When looked for performance, the machine is able to process around 50 kgs of coffee in one minute. The machine is also capable of scanning the outer fruit of each bean in a three-dimensional manner. Moreover, the machine also provides quality details about the coffee at the farm level itself, thus making more room for improvisation. Using blockchain in the coffee supply chain brings more productivity along with fair deals for producers and transparency as the system ensures direct payments to the farmers once their products are sold. On the other hand, the end customer can always look at the data and track the original source of their coffee. Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Drug supply chain is one facet of the pharma landscape that can be profited by blockchain. Counterfeit medicines are becoming increasingly troublesome as the global black market has been providing such drugs to people without getting under the radar. The risk of human life that rises from taking counterfeit drugs cannot be underestimated. The WHO has reported an increased sales of global fake drugs from $75bn in 2010, a 90% increase over the next five years. The major suffering population due to drug counterfeiting is from developing countries like Asia and Africa where such drugs constitute to around 10 to 30 percent of the total medicines for sale. It is becoming increasingly important for pharmaceutical companies and distributors around the world to improve the security and traceability of the drug supply chain. Taking the complexity of the current drug supply chain due to the growing number of people, there have to be reliable digital technologies and management systems that can secure the overall process. Blockchain technology can resolve this problem as it has become significantly popular in terms of applications relating to supply chain management. System vulnerabilities in the drug supply chain lead to many pain points such as very little visibility for tracking and authenticating the products. The introduction of blockchain in such cases can reap several benefits here. Drugs can be tagged with barcodes and once they are scanned, their records can be kept on a blockchain in secure digital blocks. These records will be updated in real-time as the drugs are transferred from one entity to the other in the supply chain. Parties with authorized access, including patients, can check the records anytime. The immutable nature of blockchain provides drug traceability from manufacturer to customer and allows people to check if the system is compromised somewhere. Apart from ensuring product integrity and anti-counterfeiting efforts, blockchain technology can help overcome the financial issues faced by smaller retailers and operators along the supply chain. Food Supply Chain  Source: LinkedIn SlideShare The complexity of our food supply chain is increasing gradually and due to this, it is becoming difficult for the food producers, suppliers and retailers to ensure the provenance of the products through the supply chain. Food safety issues including cross-contamination Identifying and the spread of foodborne illness are made even worse by lack of data and traceability. the source of contamination and finding the root cause of that can take from days to months which ultimately leads to an increased number of sick people, loss of revenues, and wasted food. According to the WHO, one-out-of-ten people fall ill and around 420,000 die due to contaminated food. Consumers are increasingly becoming aware and are demanding transparency in terms of the food they consume. Presently, about only 12 percent of consumers trust the brands that they purchase food from for the information of their food while 94 percent of consumers state that it is highly important for them to learn about all the information related to the food products that they buy. Blockchain resolves the issues of a complex supply chain by providing neutrality in the platform. Since there are no third parties involved in the transaction authorization and everything works on the basis of a consensus, both, the users and the operators of the system have to follow set of rules to keep the system running. Blockchain brings huge advantages for all the actors in food the supply chain. Food producers can ensure the originality and quality of their supplies by tracking the attempts of tampering as the food item moves in the supply chain. In case of identification of a fraud, the supplier will be intimidated and this notification can be sent to the retailer even before the food item reaches to its destination. Similarly, in the case of retailers, if a damaged food product somehow makes it the stores, he/she can identify and remove only such offending items rather than checking the whole batch of supplies. With blockchain, consumers are treated with transparency and openness when they need assurance for the food products that they consume. This allows the consumers to identify and consume high quality food. Automotive Supply Chain Ranging from parts suppliers, manufacturers to sellers, the automotive supply chain is a highly complex and broad sector with multiple participants. Delivering real customer value requires analysis of existing IT and business processes along with solutions that abide by the permissions of security, confidentiality, and authorization. Blockchain can turn out to be an ideal solutiMoreover, Ireland’s Moyee Coffee, on in such cases as it provides transparency across the entire supply chain along with reduced costs and complexity of dealing with multiple parties. For automotive suppliers, blockchain can be used to protect their brands from duplicate products and to create customer-centric business models. In the automotive industry, counterfeit products raise a significant issue for the automotive manufacturers. Also, the current market of counterfeit spare parts is estimated at several billion dollars. Such products can make their way to the supply chain either directly or through the OEM and aftermarket suppliers. Counterfeit spare parts are not reliable as they have degraded quality level and they often tend to fail which brings dissatisfaction to the end customers ultimately leading them to revoke their trust in the brand. Introducing blockchain technology for counterfeiting products proves to be significantly advantageous as it allows spare parts to be identified uniquely and represent them digitally. Digital identification of spare parts adds transparency to the system and it can be shared among multiple parties in the network. Inbound Logistics and Smart Manufacturing with blockchain can allow the automotive supply chain to be efficient. Currently, the tracking of individual components of an inbound supply chain is complex and prone to errors. The coordination among multi-tier suppliers, 3rd party logistics, and transportation companies through the manufacturing plant is necessary for effective functioning of the supply chain. By using blockchain, we can ensure the availability of accurate and real-time information amongst different parties. People involved can an check the status, quantity as well as the location of individual parts. Similarly, the outbound supply chain is also a complex network which consists of distributors, manufacturers importers, and dealers. These participants don’t have a common data sharing model as well which makes it difficult for them to exchange information. A shared blockchain based system ensures visibility and transparency which, in turn, ensures faster transactions and lowering settlement periods. Conclusion  Source: TechBullion Blockchain has introduced its potential to bring out positive changes in many industries and businesses till date including the supply chain industry. In fact, the supply chain management is one of the most obvious and useful applications of Blockchain technology, therefore, we can expect it to grow at a very fast pace in the near future. The source of successful operation of a supply chain management system is to keep a robust, transparent and end-to-end communication. Companies are exploring ways to filter the way their supply chains currently work and adopt the change that the Blockchain technology has to offer. Once businesses see the bigger picture, they’ll eventually go through the hassle of applying newer systems embedded with blockchain in order to reap bigger benefits in the future. Dumping the paperwork and centralized databases will bring effective change in terms of higher rewards and increased performance among the supply chain teams. This can be achieved if and only if the supply chain teams in place take notice of the latest technology trends in the blockchain space and find feasible ways to adopt the technology in their existing systems. The use of blockchain in supply chain management will work as a game changer by eliminating the vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of the current system.

Big corporations and governments are interested in the capabilities of blockchain. Infact, the Dubai government wants to be the first government to adopt blockchain all across their processes. There is also a surge in blockchain developer demand as more companies are on a hiring spree and looking to get the best talent to work for them. Now, let’s take a look at artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence(AI) has always been at the center of technological innovation in the past decade. If you are fascinated by the fact of self-driving cars, automation, and Robot Process Automation(RPA), then AI is for you. Just like blockchain, AI also took quite some time to mature as a technology. But we can easily say that it is completely mature and is a stable ground to experiment with your career on. Big companies are also actively working on technology and ensuring its growth. Apart from self-driving cars, you also get to work on some exciting tech that the major companies are working on. The demand for AI professionals is also there as it still falls under the growing market. In short, I suggest you pick a trade that you find more exciting and can relate to in the long run. If you love your work, it feels more like play than work! One more thing, I suggest taking up certification courses if you want to showcase your expertise to your potential employees and gain an advantage in the market. This is true for both blockchain and artificial intelligence. Best of luck when choosing between AI or blockchain.

Any “Blockchain as a Service” is a black box offering provided to make blockchain infrastructure “easier”, but cutting out all the benefits of a blockchain. If a single company controls +50% of nodes, you have no actual benefits over a centralized system. Some reasons are: Blockchain as a Service forces you and all the members to have all the infrastructure in their offering, therefore they control everything.They don’t integrate with other cloud providers.You cannot move away from them (migrating your infrastructure).They are not that easy at all. You still have to learn a lot of low-level details.However, you still can use cloud providers to get benefits for building Blockchain services without getting locked into their offerings. You can use AWS as a means for computing infrastructure, but don’t get stuck in their “as a service” blockchain offering. Using a platform like Forma you can create a Kubernetes cluster in your AWS account and with three clicks deploy blockchain nodes there (that can later be migrated to other cloud providers if you wish). Then other members for that network can choose to deploy them either in their own AWS accounts or in other cloud providers like IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Digital Ocean, or even on-premise. This is real multi-cloud for Enterprise Blockchain. Here’s a comparison table so you can better understand how Forma compares to cloud provider “BaaS” offerings: Forma versus IBM Blockchain, AWS, and Azure Blockchain - WorldSibu You still get the best experience (just use a user interface, no scripts) while everybody keeps control over the infrastructure deploying wherever they wish to. The premises behind Forma are: Using cloud providers as infrastructure providers is a great decision. But not getting locked into their offerings.Each participant should have control over where, how, and when to deploy their infrastructure components for a network (nodes, cryptographic materials, etc).You should be able to access everything from the ledger to the private keys.

So asset managers, like most companies, want to grow to massive size so they can manage as much money as possible and thereby earn greater fees. In order to manage money, asset managers either employ their own staff of investment professionals or hire a 3rd party firm, known as a subadvisor, to actually invest the assets with a particular investment strategy. Growing assets through strong investment performance is one way asset managers can get bigger. The other way asset managers grow is by convincing more people to invest with them. Sometimes this means convincing individual investors, but more often it means convincing financial advisors, retirement plans, or institutional investors to adopt their investment products. The asset manager may employ salespeople (known as wholesalers) or they may contract out to 3rd party firms to help “distribute” their products (i.e. convince people to invest with them). Asset management is a highly regulated industry, so every bit of work, from the investing to client communications and beyond must pass muster with compliance and legal departments to ensure no applicable laws are broken. This often slows innovation in the industry, but ultimately is in place to protect the end investor. Finally, asset management is intensely competitive, and becoming more so by the day. There has been enormous fee pressure on asset managers as investors have wisened up about the massive impact fees can have on their wealth and become more skeptical about claims of outperformance. Accordingly, we’re seeing some disruptive technologies emerge in asset management from actively managed ETFs to Direct Indexing, and we’re seeing asset managers attempt to differentiate their offerings in an effort to avoid fee pressures.

Each ""line"" is a bitcoin transaction: sending wallet ID, amount sent, receiving wallet ID, etc. Each ""page"" of the ledger is a block. The ID of each block (equivalent, if you like, to the page number) is generated to include the ID of the previous block, so the blocks can be considered to be 'chained' together. The ledger (blockchain) contains a record of every single bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place. If you have the patience -- and software -- you can trace every transaction for a specific wallet. Miners are people or organizations with powerful specialized computers who compete with each other to create the newest block by assembling new, unverified transactions (around 450 of them at the moment), verifying them as described above, generating hash values for each transaction, then generating a series of hash values of each pair of transaction hashes in a pyramid manner until they end up with just one hash. This is called the Merkle root. It is the hash of the hashes of the hashes of the hashes of ........ of the hashes of the transactions. Change one lousy bit in just one transaction and that alters that transaction's hash, which alters the hash of two hashes, and so on up the pyramid, so that the Merkle root also changes. The miner then concatenates the Merkle root with the ID of the last block and with a random number (the 'nonce') and generates a hash from that. But the hash has to meet certain conditions such as starting with twenty zeros. It almost certainly doesn't, since the chances of that happening are 2 to the power 20 which is a million to one against, so the miner increments the nonce by one and generates a new hash. Once again it probably doesn't meet the condition, so he increments the nonce again and generates a new hash again. This is sort of like buying lottery tickets, with roughly the same chance of winning. He keeps doing this -- often several million times -- until his hash meets the specified condition. When this happens he does the network version of shouting ""Bingo!"", at which point all the other miners who have been frantically doing the same thing say ""rats!"", stop what they are doing, pout, check his math, and if it checks out OK they accept his version as the official latest page of the ledger. The hash that met the specified conditions is the ID of the new block. As his reward he gets to create 25 bitcoins out of thin air and pay them to himself, which is why he is called a Miner and not a Block Assembler or a Transaction Checker. It also explains how new bitcoins come into existence. Every couple of years the amount a winning miner wins is cut by half, so, in time, the reward will be so small that no more bitcoins will be generated. At that point there will be about 21 million in circulation. (And what, you ask, will be the incentive when that happens for miners to keep doing what they do? Good question, but a different question from the one you asked.) Here's the clever part. (Actually there are a lot of clever parts in the bitcoin protocol, but here's a particularly clever part). If anybody tries to go back into an old transaction and change it, that change, no matter how small, will invalidate that transaction's hash. So, to make sure nobody notices, the evil attacker -- that's what people who try to fiddle bitcoins are called -- would have to calculate a new hash for that transaction, which would affect the hash of that hash, which would go all the way up the pyramid and change the Merkle root, which would change the block's ID (the ID includes the Merkle root, remember), which would change the next block's ID, which would change the ID of the block after that, and so on and so on through the chain. So the only way this could be done would be if the attacker had enough horsepower to force a completely new chain into existence which would likely be beyond even the capability of the NSA, and anyway the nice people in the NSA would never dream of fiddling around with the bitcoin blockchain because they are too busy reading this answer. Every two days the whole system pauses for a moment and figures out how many new blocks have been created in the last 48 hours. From that, it calculates how long each block took, on average, to create. If the answer isn't ""10 minutes"", then the condition that the block's ID hash must meet is made either harder (start with 22 zeros, say) or easier (start with 18 zeros) such that over the next 48 hours a new block will be created, on average, every ten minutes. If two miners both shout ""Bingo!"" at the exact same time, the blockchain splits into two branches as it has two apparently valid new blocks side by side. Some miners then start adding to one branch and other miners add to the other branch. Very soon -- usually after just one or two split blocks -- one of the chains gets longer than the other. When this happens, all the miners working on the shorter chain say phooey and begin working instead on the longer chain. Any blocks on the shorter chain are deleted and any miners who created those blocks and thought they were going to earn 25 free bitcoins are SOL. The chain now reverts back to one chain. The maximum number of parallel blocks there have ever been in a split blockchain is six, and that happened only once, the odds against it being several kazillion to one. So if you do a bitcoin transaction, you can be reasonably assured that it is valid after ten minutes, because it will by then have been validated and incorporated into a new block, and you can be doggone certain it is valid after an hour because even if the block it is in gets retroactively deleted on account of being part of the losing side of a split blockchain, the chain will have fixed itself after six new blocks at the most, and six times ten minutes is an hour. So if you are selling your Corvette for bitcoins, you should plan on spending an hour chatting with the purchaser before you let him drive away in case he is a very bad person and has found a way to (temporarily) send himself the same bitcoins he sent you for the car. After an hour you can breathe easy. EDIT: I wrote this answer three years ago. (It is March 2017 as I write this edit.) While the core of what I wrote remains accurate, the reader should be aware that Bitcoin currently faces a number of issues, both technical and, for want of a better word, managerial. (Example: mining is currently overwhelmingly controlled by two Chinese mining consortia.) I am not wholly optimistic about Bitcoin’s future as a currency or payment system, but I am convinced that the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin has a rosy future, albeit in many different formats.

The most accurate description of Blockchain is “Blockchain is a solution looking for a problem”. Blockchain is claiming to solve this or do this or the other, when in nearly every case there is little benefit in using Blockchain and there wasn’t really any issue to resolve. Why would a secure (at a low level only), slow, encrypted log file, be a “game changer” for the industry. For most applications, Blockchain is not a useful tool to work with, its too impractical. Blockchain is slow, due to the heavy nature of trying to copy data to multiple databases and heavy cryptography, it will always be slower than a central DB or even a normal decentralised DB. Blockchain can’t be read like a Database, it can’t make joins, you can search on a field, its completely useless at this at efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Large amounts of applications in the real world, need to be fast. Interaction with the user and efficient batch processes, need to be quick. This eliminates Blockchain from a lot of areas of computing. Blockchain is immutable, in some cases this is a benefit, in others, this is a hinderance. Making a mistake, means that mistake remains. It’s very hard to fix incorrect data. Blockchain, is a very trustworthy way of storing data, but it doesn’t eliminate the most common cause of data corruption or hacking, it’s the programs/apps that write the data and read the data that can be hacked and Blockchain isn’t going to fix that. Blockchain data needs to be exported into a central DB to be useful, so again, defeats the purpose of BC. In most common processes: Application → DB → Application/Reporting/Export In Blockchain: Application -> DB -> Blockchain ->DB -> Application/Reporting/Export Where is Blockchain adding value here? Decentralisation is nice, in the fact, it’s not owned by a central entity, but that means you must trust multiple people with that data. Would you trust everyone with your data? You will probably have higher costs, due to multiple data infrastructures needed and Blockchain replicates the entire DB every time, which is massively inefficient. Most Blockchain experiments seem to be by big business, which means they will own the Blockchain data in full, which effectively defeats the point of Blockchain. A normal DB, can be read-only, distributed, replicated and can be very secure, so it’s not like there is a desperate need for this technology. Databases aren’t normally hacked, corrupted or manipulated at the DB level, they are very secure, so there isn’t really a great problem that needs addressing here. Hacking is mostly done by identifying vulnerabilities at a higher level, again, something Blockchain, doesn’t really address. If you wanted more independent transparent process, there are other ways to address this demand. You can encrypt data in a normal DB, you can distribute, audit and validate data in multiple, efficient ways. You can already communicate data efficiently between different systems/entities with API’s, XML, JSON, EDIFACT, etc. I think Blockchain has some merit and it will find its niche, but it isn’t some panacea solution to all the world’s problems. It’s just completely impractical in most real-world situations. I think at least it gets people thinking in a different way. Hopefully it will evolve into a better, faster solution that is practical.",2021-03-07T00:53:21.721Z,"Why is the general manager of blockchain services at IBM noted that blockchain is the technology of choice for the food traceability project?

It’s helpful to think of key management as another type of password storage. You probably have a multitude of passwords you use every day. Some are stored on a keychain provided by a browser or a third-party password manager. Others, you may have written down and placed somewhere safe. No matter the storage method, if your passwords are compromised, so is the information they protect. Key management is the same principle. The alphanumeric keys you use to access services or information on the blockchain are essentially just long, complex passwords. But they need to be protected as carefully as (or probably even more than) the passwords you use to log into accounts online. I’ve been leading the key management strategy at Chronicled, and I think an explanation of the various options available would be beneficial to anyone looking into an enterprise blockchain project. Here's what I've found: You have several options for keeping your keys secure. The simplest option is known as a paper wallet. Essentially, you write down the string of letters and numbers that make up your private key on a piece of paper and place it somewhere secure, like a safe deposit box. While it may seem oddly low-tech, remember that a paper wallet is completely offline. There’s no way for it to be hacked, which is an important consideration. Another offline, yet electronic, option is storing your private key on a USB device. Again, the safest option while using a USB is to leave it in a bank or some secure location you feel confident it cannot be compromised. But physical key storage isn’t the only method. You can also store your private key within a software application such as a key management system. It’s similar to how Google or Amazon stores your password for you. There are key management providers who will securely hold onto you key for you. They may actually be using some of the same methods mentioned in this article to secure it, but they’ll likely have much more robust security than the average company, as they’re focused only on that specific task. Many people in the crypto space also choose to use a hardware security module (HSM), which is a specialized device that generates and stores private keys. These are often known as the most secure option for key management. The private and public keys are generated by the hardware device, with the private key never leaving the device or being seen by anyone. These devices are expensive but are ideal for enterprise blockchain deployments because they provide hardware protection in addition to software for key generation and storage. Choosing the right key management depends on your needs. Not every company will need to use the same combination of key management tools, so there are several points to remember while making the decision. For one, consider the tradeoff between convenience and security. The most convenient options that give immediate access, like plugging in a USB drive, are often the least secure. If you lose that USB drive, your private key and access to the system is gone for good. If it’s stolen and copied, your key will be compromised—perhaps without your knowledge. The most secure options are, unfortunately, a bit slower. Let’s say you’re the leader at a bank. To participate in a significant financial transaction, you may have to go through a lengthy process to access a key. That process might involve multiple levels of approval resulting in a trip to a secure physical location somewhere outside the office that contains the key. This dedicated location would require strict identification procedures before you’re let in. Once inside, you use the key at that location to perform the transaction, and then leave the key there. Even the computer you use is dedicated to that one task in order to keep it safe from any viruses or malware. Every step along in the process is diligently logged. Now, that hypothetical system sounds very secure, but it’s not very convenient for everyday use. The decision will be based on each individual company’s needs, and there may even be multiple processes in place at one company. For instance, a system with an average transaction of $500 may use one type of key management method that is relatively simple. Another system with an average transaction of $1,000,000 would use a different, more secure method. After deciding on a key management system, it’s best to create a policy. Whatever your choice, it’s imperative to create a policy that will keep your key safe—and give you recourse if it’s stolen or compromised. First, eliminate single points of failure. Distribute trust and some of the risk so that if one provider is compromised, it doesn’t mean you’re completely out of luck. Using a mix of key management providers is one way to do this. Also, remember to be wary that physical media can degrade over time. Paper is obviously sensitive to environmental conditions, but so is a USB or hard drive. It’s possible these fail after being used for long periods of time. You should also check the keys often, just as an exercise, so you don't forget the procedures for accessing them. Additionally, you may want to use “key rotation.” This simply means that you change your keys periodically. It protects you if someone gets access to your keys because the damage is contained. Another software solution is to use multi-access smart contracts that require both cold keys and hot-keys. The hot-key is the operational key to access the blockchain, while the cold keys are stored separately and are used to revoke hot-keys and generate new hot-keys. Every month, or at set times during the year, the hot-key can be revoked and a new one generated using the cold keys. This decreases the likelihood of a compromised hot key causing significant damage as it’s changed again and again over time. Basically, you want to be ultra paranoid about how the system is accessed. As security experts say, always assume a breach will happen—no matter how secure your system is—and prepare to minimize the impact of that breach accordingly. Key management doesn’t have to be confusing. If you want more information to help guide your decision-making, you can read through this guide from Coinbase that I found very helpful.

I spent a lot of time on researching that technology and find out what can it do for the content world. Meaning not only the “Digital Asset Management” scope, but really also the license rights management scope. However, whatever ideas you develop there will come up three issues rather quickly: Transaction costs: EVERY transaction on the blockchain costs money. We’re not talking about cents! The current transaction cost on Bitcoin blockchain is currently $1 (https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m), but it already was on $55 in Dec 2017. The more successful the blockchain is, the higher the transaction load, the higher the cost. This means if we really find a use case that works, the price will rise, which could destroy the use caseTransaction time: Transaction times on blockchain are high (Average Confirmation Time) it takes 9+ minutes to process one transaction. It already went up to a whopping 11.000 minutes (yes, thats ONE WEEK) in January. This again means - the more successful the blockchain, the longer the transaction will takeMoral: Blockchain is not really the right thing to do morally. It is wasting huge amounts of energy. Bitcoin’s energy usage is huge – we can't afford to ignore itNow, as long as these issues are not solved it will be hard to really do useful use cases using the blockchain. There is initiatives trying to solve that (e.g. Ethereum Raiden Network https://raiden.network/) but there is a lot of things to consider security wise that are not solved yet. Also, actually those networks and solutions take the blockchain off-chain, meaning the most important benefit of blockchain will be reduced: being decentralized, independent - off-chain processing means (again) relying on central parties or hubs which is the opposite of what you want using a blockchain. But back to DAM - I think a good use case would be to handle image rights management through blockchain (given the issues are solved) - this would go from the content producer through all intermediary stations directly to the DAM - and further on to the modified content - and possibly out of the DAM to the consumers. On the way earnings and license fees could automatically be shared to all contributors, which sounds like a nice thing. Hope that helps. 1",2021-03-07T01:00:24.377Z,"What is the current state of the art of Blockchain implementation in Digital Asset Management? ",Quora

Banking and Payments Some say that the blockchain will do to banking what the internet did to media. It can be used to give access to financial services to billions of people around the world, including those in third world countries who don’t have access to traditional banking. Bitcoin allows anyone to send money across borders almost instantly and with relatively low fees. Abra is one startup that is working on a bitcoin-based remittance service. Many banks like Barclays are also working on adopting blockchain technology to make their business operations faster, more efficient and secure. Banks are also increasingly investing in blockchain startups and projects. IBM predicts that 15% of banks will be using the blockchain by the end of 2017. 2. Cyber Security Although the blockchain ledger is public, the data is verified and encrypted using advanced cryptography. This way the data is less prone to being hacked or changed without authorization. That said, the applications build on the blockchain are still young and there have been several hacks in recent months. This is something future applications will need to grow up to. 3. Supply Chain Management With blockchain technology, transactions can be documented in a permanent decentralized record, and monitored securely and transparently. This can greatly reduce time delays and human mistakes. It can also be used to monitor costs, labour, and even waste and emissions at every point of the supply chain. This has serious implications for understanding and controlling the real environmental impact of products. The distributed ledger can also be used to verify the authenticity or fair trade status of products by tracking them from their origin. Some blockchain companies working in this sector are Provenance, Fluent, SKUChain, and Blockverify. 4. Forecasting The blockchain is set to change the entire approach to research, consulting, analysis and forecasting. Online platforms like Augur are looking to create global decentralized prediction markets. These technologies can be used to place and monitor bets on anything from sports to stocks to elections in a decentralized way. 5. Networking and the Internet of Things Samsung and IBM are using blockchain technology for a new concept called ADEPT, which will create a decentralized network of IoT devices. Operating like a public ledger for a large number of devices, it would eliminate the need for a central location to handle communications between them. The devices would be able to communicate to each other directly to update software, manage bugs, and monitor energy usage. 6. Insurance The global insurance market is based on trust management. The blockchain is a new way of managing trust and can be used to verify many types of data in insurance contracts, such as the insured person’s identity. So-called oracles can be used to integrate real-world data with blockchain smart contracts. This technology is very useful for any type of insurance that relies on real-world data, for example crop insurance. Aeternity is one blockchain project that is building tools that are useful in the insurance industry. 7. Private Transport and Ride Sharing The blockchain can be used to create decentralized versions of peer-to-peer ridesharing apps, allowing both car owners and users to arrange terms and conditions in a secure way without third party providers. Startups working in this area include Arcade City and La’Zooz. The use of built-in e-wallets can allow car owners to automatically pay for parking, highway tolls, and electricity top-ups for their vehicle. UBS, ZF and Innogy are some of the companies developing blockchain based e-wallets. 8. Cloud Storage Data on a centralized server is inherently vulnerable to hacking, data loss, or human error. Using blockchain technology allows cloud storage to be more secure and robust against attacks. Storj is one example of a cloud storage network using the technology. 9. Charity Common complaints in the charity space include inefficiency and corruption, which prevent money from reaching those that are meant to have it. Using blockchain technology to track donations can let you be sure your money is going to end up in the right hands. Bitcoin-based charities like the BitGive Foundation use blockchain’s secure and transparent distributed ledger to let donors see that the intended party has received the funds. 10. Voting Probably one of the most important areas of society that the blockchain will disrupt is voting. The 2016 US election is not the first time certain parties were accused of rigging election results. Blockchain technology can be used for voter registration and identity verification, and electronic vote counting to ensure that only legitimate votes are counted, and no votes are changed or removed. Creating an immutable, publicly-viewable ledger of recorded votes would be a massive step toward making elections more fair and democratic. Democracy Earth and Follow My Vote are two startups aiming to disrupt democracy itself through creating blockchain-based online voting systems for governments. 11. Government Government systems are often slow, opaque, and prone to corruption. Implementing blockchain-based systems can significantly reduce bureaucracy and increase security, efficiency, and transparency of government operations. Dubai, for example, is aiming to put all its government documents on the blockchain by 2020. 12. Public Benefits The public benefits system is another sector that suffers from slowness and bureaucracy. Blockchain technology can help assess, verify, and distribute welfare or unemployment benefits in a much more streamlined and secure way. GovCoin is a UK-based company that is helping the government to distribute public benefits using blockchain technology. The blockchain is also a good contender for implementing a basic income. Circles is a project working on developing a blockchain-based technology for implementing a universal basic income. 13. Healthcare Another industry that relies on many legacy systems and is ripe for disruption is healthcare. One of the challenges hospitals face is the lack of a secure platform to store and share data, and they are often victims of hacking because of outdated infrastructure. Blockchain technology can allow hospitals to safely store data like medical records and share it with authorized professionals or patients. This can improve data security and can even help with accuracy and speed of diagnosis. Gem and Tierion are two companies that are working on disrupting the current healthcare data space.1 14. Energy Management Energy management has been a highly centralized industry for a long time. Energy producers and users cannot buy it directly from each other and have to go through the public grid or a trusted private intermediary. TransactiveGrid is a startup using Ethereum that allows customers to buy and sell energy from each other in a peer-to-peer way. 15. Online Music Several startups are coming up with ways for musicians to get paid directly from their fans, without giving up large percentages of sales to platforms or record companies. Smart contracts can also be used to automatically solve licensing issues, and better catalog songs with their respective creators. Mycelia and Ujo Music are two startups creating blockchain-based solutions in the music industry. 16. Retail When you shop, your trust of the retail system is tied to the trust of the store or marketplace. Decentralized blockchain-based retail utilities work differently: they connect buyers and sellers without a middleman and associated fees. In these cases, trust comes from smart contract systems, the1 security of exchanges, and built-in reputation management systems. One startup disrupting the retail space is OpenBazaar. 17. Real Estate Some of the issues in buying and selling real estate are bureaucracy, lack of transparency, fraud, and mistakes in public records. Using blockchain technology can speed up transactions by reducing the need for paper-based record keeping. It can also help with tracking, verifying ownership, ensuring accuracy of documents, and transferring property deeds. Ubitquity, is a blockchain-secured platform for real estate record-keeping that is an alternative for legacy paper based systems. 18. Crowdfunding Crowdfunding has become a popular method of fundraising for new startups and projects in recent years. Crowdfunding platforms exist to create trust between project creators and supporters, but they also charge high fees. In blockchain-based crowdfunding, trust is instead created through smart contracts and online reputation systems, which removes the need for a middle-man. New projects can raise funds by releasing their own tokens that represent value and can later be exchanged for products, services, or cash. Many blockchain startups have now raised millions of dollars through such token sales. Although it’s still early days and the regulatory future or blockchain-based crowdfunding is uncertain, it’s an area that holds a lot of promise. 19. Your Industry If your industry deals with data or transactions of any kind, it is a field than can likely be disrupted by blockchain technology. The space is wide open and the opportunities are many.

DeFi draws inspiration from blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn’t controlled by a single, central source. That’s important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases. Bitcoin and many other digital-native assets stand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and PayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay with a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and the business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority to stop or pause it and record it in its private ledger. With bitcoin, those institutions are cut out of the picture. Direct purchases aren’t the only type of transaction or contract overseen by big companies; financial applications such as loans, insurance, crowdfunding, derivatives, betting and more are also in their control. Cutting out middlemen from all kinds of transactions is one of the primary advantages of DeFi. Before it was commonly known as decentralized finance, the idea of DeFi was often called “open finance.” Most applications that call themselves “DeFi” are built on top of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency platform, which sets itself apart from the Bitcoin platform in that it’s easier to use to build other types of decentralized applications beyond simple transactions. That’s because of Ethereum’s platform for smart contracts – which automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met – offers much more flexibility. Ethereum programming languages, such as Solidity, are specifically designed for creating and deploying such smart contracts. For example, say a user wants his or her money to be sent to a friend next Tuesday, but only if the temperature climbs above 90 degrees Fahrenheit according to weather.com. Such rules can be written in a smart contract. With smart contracts at the core, dozens of DeFi applications are operating on Ethereum, some of which are explored below. Ethereum 2.0, a coming upgrade to Ethereum’s underlying network, could give these apps a boost by chipping away at Ethereum’s scalability issues. Lending platforms Lending markets are one popular form of DeFi, which connects borrowers to lenders of cryptocurrencies. One popular platform, Compound, allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies or offer their own loans. Users can make money off of interest for lending out their money. Compound sets the interest rates algorithmically, so if there’s higher demand to borrow a cryptocurrency, the interest rates will be pushed higher. DeFi lending is collateral-based, meaning in order to take out a loan, a user needs to put up collateral – often ether, the token that powers Ethereum. That means users don’t give out their identity or associated credit score to take out a loan, which is how normal, non-DeFi loans operate. Stablecoins Another form of DeFi is the stable. Cryptocurrencies often experience sharper price fluctuations than fiat, which isn’t a good quality for people who want to know how much their money will be worth a week from now. Stablecoins peg cryptocurrencies to non-cryptocurrencies, such as the U.S. dollar, in order to keep the price under control. As the name implies, stablecoins aim to bring price “stability.” Also, there are companies like Coinsflux investment platform (www.coinsflux.com) where you can invest your ethereum or bitcoin or other cryptocurrency and get paid weekly. So you do not have to be in constant panic thinking about the market’s volatility. Prediction markets One of the oldest DeFi applications living on Ethereum is a so-called “prediction market,” where users bet on the outcome of some event, such as “Who will win the 2020 presidential election?” The goal of the participants is, obviously, to make money, though prediction markets can sometimes better predict outcomes than conventional methods, like polling. Centralized prediction markets with good track records in this regard include Intrade and PredictIt. DeFi has the potential to boost interest in prediction markets, since they are traditionally frowned upon by governments and often shut down when run in a centralized manner.",2021-03-07T01:02:51.154Z,"How can blockchain be used for incident management?

It is important for a business to manage its assets efficiently to get the maximum possible returns. Asset management software provides significant information like Assets count, current status, location and the asset owner. But spreadsheets can also provide the same. It can categorize the assets, generate simple reports and also help track purchase and depreciation costs. However, asset management software has its own benefits than spreadsheets. Below are the top ten Asset management software benefits in your business. Benefits of asset management software Central Database  Asset Management Software acts as a central database of the company. It can store necessary information such as purchase details, copies of invoices, descriptions, images, documents, manuals, attachments, contract agreements, project-wise assigned assets and materials for each asset. Apart from this, it keeps track of service history, maintenance, warranty details. This will let you know which assets have to replace and it’s time of preventative maintenance and inspections which reduces human error. Asset Tracking Asset Management software allows the company to track the assets from different locations and shows where the assets are currently located, last location history, how they are used, and when changes were made to them. So that you can easily identify the assets which were not reported or checked in by the user. It tracks the asset from purchase to disposal includes Supplier selection, Depreciation calculation, Sold information in order to maximize efficiency and minimize the loss. Advanced Check in/Check out Advanced check-in and check out functionalities of the software greatly increase the accuracy of the asset register and reduce the time spent over assigning the assets. The software allows assigning single/bulk assets at a time. While receiving the asset also, single/bulk check in is possible. Cloud-based software You can host asset management software according to the requirement in cloud or on-premise. The cloud-based software extends the benefits in cost and time-saving. No need to wait for the series of installation processes, updates in the cloud-based software of asset management. Since you don’t have to worry about issues with computer crashes or conflicts with other programs. additionally, new features will be published as soon as the development finished. Easy setup makes the project looks a lot friendlier. Custom Fields Asset management software comes with both predefined data fields and custom fields. Predefined fields may or may not apply to your business or sometimes you may require to manage Non-IT assets. To help in this situation, asset management software allows creating asset register with new fields of your own according to the requirement. Real Time Notifications Asset Management Software will automatically send real-time notifications for all the major actions which performed over the assets. The notifications will send to the users as well as to the management. Additionally, the threshold feature of the asset management software allows managing the stock of assets on your own. Report Management IT Asset management provides a robust reporting feature to make insightful business decisions. Predefined reports of the reporting software will give the primary report. But each department and teams of the organization may need a different type of reports for various purposes. Custom Report feature of reporting software allows creating the own reports according to the different requirement. Asset management software can streamline the complete requirements of your organization. Compliance Management Compliance Management is one of the biggest challenge faced by most of the organizations today. Observing regulatory compliance and audit policies are necessary for every organization. The asset management software monitors the license compliance and manage warranties on hardware assets and meet the guidelines of regulatory requirements for the asset register. Hence you can avoid severe penalties. Asset Auditing The auditing procedures ensure the existence of assets in a company. Some common procedures were used to test the existence of different category assets while auditing. Asset management software follows the same auditing procedure. The audit team of the asset management software will perform internal audits in a regular interval and provide the audit report. So that, you can better identify inefficient procedures and then eliminate them. Performance Booster Asset management software increases the performance with automated processes for adding, modifying asset records. The software has the bar-code facility which makes the physical asset verification process easier. The collaborative working of the software helps a business to reduce both the overall capital expenditure and operating expenditure related to the assets. The benefits of asset management software begin from the asset register creation and extend up to managing your employees, projects, suppliers, tasks and so on. Managing assets manually takes a lot of time and costs without getting the equivalent results like spreadsheets. To optimize your asset management system, consider using an automated asset management solution. IT Asset Management Software automates your asset management processes, such as asset value and depreciation tracking, asset maintenance, contract management, cost analysis, project management, and in-depth report generation. By automating complex asset management tasks, you will be able to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and productivity of your business. The same can provide the opportunity to plan against financial, operational and legal risk.

A rule of thumb is emerging, if it requires maintaining accounts, put it on the Blockchain and conduct an ICO… fast. What happens when everything eventually gets on the Blockchain? Do all our problems vanish into thin air? Does accounting utopia wait for us on the other side, or are we collectively deluding ourselves by putting our heads into the ground? How it used to be Let’s start with a simple history lesson. In the days of the barter system, there existed a truly decentralized system, as is envisioned by the pioneers of the Blockchain. The only catch, there was no concept of currency and hence, the crushing blow of double co-incidence of wants made the people come up with some form of currency. Now, currency to be widely accepted required that all people accepted it as a legal tender. This was achieved by the sanction of the feudal lord, or the Emperor, as the case may be.  One king to rule them all A point to note in this case is that without a legal overseeing authority (however dishonest and cruel it might be) people will not accept a piece of paper (or metal for that matter) as legal tender. Enforcing a legal tender has always required a feudal mindset. Coupled with human rights, this feudal mindset has evolved into what we call — rule of law. How we want it to be Let this be very clear that cryptocurrencies and any other Blockchain based application aims to upend this existing order of things. It endeavors to achieve what communism couldn’t (or could, but that’s not the crux of this article) i.e. give power to the people and let the meek inherit the Earth.  On the Blockchain, the fees for transactions do not fill the coffers of a central authority (like the banks) but it accrues to common people like you and I. This does not make the Blockchain free, it just shifts the incidence of profit to a different entity, but not randomly. This also defeats the plan of power to the people, with a few large entities running massive ASIC farms in countries with cheap electricity,cornering much of those fees… (Continue Reading) The Solution Coming back to Blockchain, the idea is old, but the implementation designed by Satoshi and Vitalik is radically new. It is this new implementation that needs to be refined further to gain more stability and acceptance by the general public.

It provides full terms and conditions data, including ratings and descriptive content, for each asset types. It also maintains extensive market-level and issue-level industry standard numbering codes associated with each equity instrument including official clearing code identifiers (SEDOL, CUSIP, ISIN, CINs, Local Exchange codes MIC). Types - Reference data can be classified as static and dynamic. Static data refers to data elements which have unalterable characteristics, such as financial products specifications and expiration dates, and information about counterparts and other supply chain partners.Dynamic reference data refers to variable data such as closing and historical prices.Why - The market data for a particular instrument would include the identifier of the instrument and where it was traded such as the ticker symbol and exchange code plus the latest bid and ask price and the time of the last trade. It may also include other information such as volume traded, bid and offer sizes and static data about the financial instrument that may have come from a variety of sources. Hence, they require Reference data management.  Reference data is stored and used across front, middle, and back office systems of a financial enterprise. It helps banks/financial institution reduces their financial exposure to counterpart risk and improve ongoing capital and liquidity management. It achieves all this by leveraging Informatics’ Intelligent Data Platform. With this platform, one can: Manage and deliver accurate, comprehensive, and consistent legal entity reference data across heterogeneous systems and existing reference hubs.On board the new legal entity identifier and cross reference it with existing legal entity information and identifiers to create a single source of the truth.Associate legal entity relationships across securities instruments, and manage accurate and comprehensive legal hierarchy structures.Deliver and syndicate this data to any system in any format, latency, or structure.Providers - There are a number of financial data vendors that specialize in collecting, cleaning, collating and distributing market data and this has become the most common way that traders and investors get access to market data.

This connected chain is called as Supply Chain. Consider a clothing supply chain for instance. The clothing, textiles, and apparel manufacturing industries involve a lot of labors in them as the demand for work is never-ending. The estimated employ count in the industry is of than 60 million people globally. The term supply chain in the clothing sector refers to the back end of the industry. The supply chain in the clothing industry is made by connecting: Raw material sourcesFactories that use these raw materials and create final productsDistribution network that delivers these clothes to consumersOn a global scale, the clothing supply chain consists of millions of people along with tonnes of water, crops, chemicals, and oil. This makes it difficult for manufacturers to find where the different parts of their products come from. The demand for increased speed, high volume, and cheaper consumption is increasing with each passing day. Due to this, when blind consumerism has valued the transparency of an ethical supply chain is compromised. What is Supply Chain Management?  Source: Statista Content & Design Dribbble In more clear terms, Supply chain management includes the integrated planning as well as the execution of different processes. This involves material flow, information flow as well as financial capital flow. The management of the flow of goods, services, and information involving the storage and movement of raw materials, building products as well as full-fledged finished goods from one point to another is called as supply chain management. A supply chain within the SCM is a network of individual entities, organizations, businesses, resources as well as technologies that combine together in the manufacturing of a product or service. Any supply chain progresses by initially delivering the raw materials from a supplier to a manufacturer and eventually ends by delivering the final product to the consumer. Proper implementation of supply chain management can result in benefits like increased sales and revenues, decreased frauds and overhead costs, quality improvisation. Moreover, this will also lead to accelerating production and distribution. While all of this seems simple in theory, practically maintaining a supply chain is a tedious task even for small businesses. The interconnectivity of different elements in the supply chain gradually becomes more inefficient when a business grows. In order to resolve these inefficiencies and save a company’s money, different technologies like AI and Machine learning are being applied to SCM. Amongst these, blockchain is exploring new ways to change the overall game. Supply Chain Challenges and Blockchain Solutions Blockchain can be applied to many challenges of the Supply Chain industry such as complicated recordkeeping and tracking of products. As a less corruptible and better-automated alternative to centralized databases. Following are the ways in which blockchain can be useful in the supply chain industry.  Source: MODUSBOX Provenance Tracking Big companies and organizations have a lot of elements in their supply chains. Due to this, it becomes almost impossible to keep track of each and every record even for multinational corporations. The lack of transparency leads to cost and customer relations issues which ultimately dilutes the brand name. In a blockchain-based supply chain management, record keeping and provenance tracking become easy as the product information can be accessed through the help of embedded sensors and RFID tags. The history of a product right from its origination to where it is in the present time can be traced through blockchain. Moreover, this type of accurate provenance tracking can be used to detect frauds in any part of the supply chain. Cost Reduction The real-time tracking of a product in a supply chain with the help of blockchain reduces the overall cost of moving items in a supply chain. According to a survey of supply chain workers conducted by APQC and the Digital Supply Chain Institute (DSCI), more than one-third of people cited reduction of costs as the topmost benefit of application of Blockchain in supply chain management. When blockchain is applied to speed up administrative processes in supply chains, the extra costs occurring in the system are automatically reduced while still guaranteeing the security of transactions. The elimination of the middlemen and intermediaries in the supply chain saves the risks of frauds, product duplicacy and saves money too. Payments can be processed by customers and suppliers within the supply chain by using cryptocurrencies rather than customers and suppliers rather than relying on EDI. Moreover, efficiency will be improved and the risk of losing products will be reduced with accurate recordkeeping. Establishing Trust Having trust in complex supply chains with many participants is necessary for smooth operations. For example, when a manufacturer shares his products with suppliers, he/she should be able to depend on them for following factory safety standards. Also, when it comes to regulatory compliances such as custom enforcers, trust plays a vital role. The immutable nature of blockchain in the supply chain is well-designed to prevent tampering and establishing trust. Benefits of Supply Chain with Blockchain  Source: Faizod One of the most appealing benefits of using blockchain for data is that it allows the data to be more interoperable. Due to this, it becomes easier for companies to share information and data with manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors. Transparency in Blockchain helps reduce delays and disputes while preventing goods from getting stuck in the supply chain. As each product can be tracked in real-time, the chances of misplacements are rare. Blockchain offers scalability through which any large database is accessible from multiple locations from around the world. It also provides higher standards of security and the ability to customize according to the data feed. Moreover, blockchains can be created in a private manner too which will allow the data to be accessed explicitly between the parties who have the permission for it. The value of adopting blockchain technology can be taken from the fact that it has the potential to connect different ledgers and data points while maintaining the data integrity among multiple participants. The properties of transparency and immutability of blockchain technology make it useful for eliminating frauds in supply chain and maintaining the integrity of the system. Other than these, few other benefits of adopting Blockchain technology in the supply chain industry are: Reduce or eliminate fraud and errorsImprove inventory managementMinimize courier costsReduce delays from paperworkIdentify issues fasterIncrease consumer and partner trustSupply Chain Management with Blockchain Use Cases  Source: IBM With its increasing popularity, blockchain technology seems like the solution to the problems of many industries today. Supply chain being one of the most populated industry holds certain use cases where the application of blockchain technology can make a difference. A single shipment of goods can have at least 20-25 people or organizations in the process which leads to roughly 200 interactions between them thus, leading to a lengthy process. If applied correctly, blockchain technology can assure provenance tracking and traceability across the supply chain. This, in turn, will lead to fewer counterfeiters and ensured safety in the processes. Blockchain in the supply chain will also allow manufacturers, transporters, and end-users to collect data, study trends, and apply predictive monitoring process for better product experience. Following are some of the use cases of blockchain in a supply chain. Seafood Verification Seafood supply chain has caught the negative headlines many a time and still continues to do so due to the lack of a transparent system. The current seafood supply chain has tedious processes like manual recordkeeping that make it more prone to errors. Moreover, other issues that result in making the seafood supply chain inefficient are the improper food storage conditions, mislabeling frauds and prevalence of unregulated practices. Due to these issues the quality and security of the food that reaches to the end-customer is compromised which threatens the industry’s economic security. Moreover, since there are the different type of frauds involved in the chain, the trust between the customers and vendors remain lacking. Blockchain technology can prove to be a panacea to the seafood verification problems as it can track fish and seafood right from the production to its distribution. Big names such as Hyperledger have even started implementing the technology in their projects in order to resolve the issues of the seafood supply chain industry. The project named Hyperledger Sawtooth is revolutionizing the supply chain by bringing traceability and accountability through its modular blockchain platform. It uses the PoET (the proof of elapsed time) consensus algorithm which allows actors in the system to reach a consensus in an environment where the counterparties are unaware of each other’s information. Sawtooth allows the seafood to be detected in the supply chain through sensors that transmit the location and time of the products to the blockchain. This allows the buyer to access a comprehensive record of the product provenance. Coffee Supply Chain  Source: Bext360 When you take a sip of that hot coffee in the morning from that big cup, you don’t even realize how long and complicated its supply chain must have been. The coffee supply chain in a global network that is highly complicated and is in a desperate need for reform. Production of coffee is fragmented as it is usually grown in developing areas of the world that are at remote locations. Other factors that affect the production of coffee and should be taken into consideration are volatile prices and the effect of changing climates. Moreover, since the people working as farmers and laborers in the coffee supply chains are from remote developing areas, there have been reported cases of abuses too. Due to the complexity of the system, the coffee supply chain makes an ideal use case for blockchain adoption and bring transparency and efficiency to the system. A Denver based startup, Bext360 is using a blockchain enabled machine called “bextmachine” that is used to analyze the coffee beans from the farms and assign a number to them for their traceability. When looked for performance, the machine is able to process around 50 kgs of coffee in one minute. The machine is also capable of scanning the outer fruit of each bean in a three-dimensional manner. Moreover, the machine also provides quality details about the coffee at the farm level itself, thus making more room for improvisation. Using blockchain in the coffee supply chain brings more productivity along with fair deals for producers and transparency as the system ensures direct payments to the farmers once their products are sold. On the other hand, the end customer can always look at the data and track the original source of their coffee. Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Drug supply chain is one facet of the pharma landscape that can be profited by blockchain. Counterfeit medicines are becoming increasingly troublesome as the global black market has been providing such drugs to people without getting under the radar. The risk of human life that rises from taking counterfeit drugs cannot be underestimated. The WHO has reported an increased sales of global fake drugs from $75bn in 2010, a 90% increase over the next five years. The major suffering population due to drug counterfeiting is from developing countries like Asia and Africa where such drugs constitute to around 10 to 30 percent of the total medicines for sale. It is becoming increasingly important for pharmaceutical companies and distributors around the world to improve the security and traceability of the drug supply chain. Taking the complexity of the current drug supply chain due to the growing number of people, there have to be reliable digital technologies and management systems that can secure the overall process. Blockchain technology can resolve this problem as it has become significantly popular in terms of applications relating to supply chain management. System vulnerabilities in the drug supply chain lead to many pain points such as very little visibility for tracking and authenticating the products. The introduction of blockchain in such cases can reap several benefits here. Drugs can be tagged with barcodes and once they are scanned, their records can be kept on a blockchain in secure digital blocks. These records will be updated in real-time as the drugs are transferred from one entity to the other in the supply chain. Parties with authorized access, including patients, can check the records anytime. The immutable nature of blockchain provides drug traceability from manufacturer to customer and allows people to check if the system is compromised somewhere. Apart from ensuring product integrity and anti-counterfeiting efforts, blockchain technology can help overcome the financial issues faced by smaller retailers and operators along the supply chain. Food Supply Chain  Source: LinkedIn SlideShare The complexity of our food supply chain is increasing gradually and due to this, it is becoming difficult for the food producers, suppliers and retailers to ensure the provenance of the products through the supply chain. Food safety issues including cross-contamination Identifying and the spread of foodborne illness are made even worse by lack of data and traceability. the source of contamination and finding the root cause of that can take from days to months which ultimately leads to an increased number of sick people, loss of revenues, and wasted food. According to the WHO, one-out-of-ten people fall ill and around 420,000 die due to contaminated food. Consumers are increasingly becoming aware and are demanding transparency in terms of the food they consume. Presently, about only 12 percent of consumers trust the brands that they purchase food from for the information of their food while 94 percent of consumers state that it is highly important for them to learn about all the information related to the food products that they buy. Blockchain resolves the issues of a complex supply chain by providing neutrality in the platform. Since there are no third parties involved in the transaction authorization and everything works on the basis of a consensus, both, the users and the operators of the system have to follow set of rules to keep the system running. Blockchain brings huge advantages for all the actors in food the supply chain. Food producers can ensure the originality and quality of their supplies by tracking the attempts of tampering as the food item moves in the supply chain. In case of identification of a fraud, the supplier will be intimidated and this notification can be sent to the retailer even before the food item reaches to its destination. Similarly, in the case of retailers, if a damaged food product somehow makes it the stores, he/she can identify and remove only such offending items rather than checking the whole batch of supplies. With blockchain, consumers are treated with transparency and openness when they need assurance for the food products that they consume. This allows the consumers to identify and consume high quality food. Automotive Supply Chain Ranging from parts suppliers, manufacturers to sellers, the automotive supply chain is a highly complex and broad sector with multiple participants. Delivering real customer value requires analysis of existing IT and business processes along with solutions that abide by the permissions of security, confidentiality, and authorization. Blockchain can turn out to be an ideal solutiMoreover, Ireland’s Moyee Coffee, on in such cases as it provides transparency across the entire supply chain along with reduced costs and complexity of dealing with multiple parties. For automotive suppliers, blockchain can be used to protect their brands from duplicate products and to create customer-centric business models. In the automotive industry, counterfeit products raise a significant issue for the automotive manufacturers. Also, the current market of counterfeit spare parts is estimated at several billion dollars. Such products can make their way to the supply chain either directly or through the OEM and aftermarket suppliers. Counterfeit spare parts are not reliable as they have degraded quality level and they often tend to fail which brings dissatisfaction to the end customers ultimately leading them to revoke their trust in the brand. Introducing blockchain technology for counterfeiting products proves to be significantly advantageous as it allows spare parts to be identified uniquely and represent them digitally. Digital identification of spare parts adds transparency to the system and it can be shared among multiple parties in the network. Inbound Logistics and Smart Manufacturing with blockchain can allow the automotive supply chain to be efficient. Currently, the tracking of individual components of an inbound supply chain is complex and prone to errors. The coordination among multi-tier suppliers, 3rd party logistics, and transportation companies through the manufacturing plant is necessary for effective functioning of the supply chain. By using blockchain, we can ensure the availability of accurate and real-time information amongst different parties. People involved can an check the status, quantity as well as the location of individual parts. Similarly, the outbound supply chain is also a complex network which consists of distributors, manufacturers importers, and dealers.

Or the clothes that you buy or the food that you eat? Besides the shops that you go to, there’s a whole other chain of different interlinked elements that work on delivering these products to you. This connected chain is called as Supply Chain. Consider a clothing supply chain for instance. The clothing, textiles, and apparel manufacturing industries involve a lot of labors in them as the demand for work is never-ending. The estimated employ count in the industry is of than 60 million people globally. The term supply chain in the clothing sector refers to the back end of the industry. The supply chain in the clothing industry is made by connecting: Raw material sourcesFactories that use these raw materials and create final productsDistribution network that delivers these clothes to consumersOn a global scale, the clothing supply chain consists of millions of people along with tonnes of water, crops, chemicals, and oil. This makes it difficult for manufacturers to find where the different parts of their products come from. The demand for increased speed, high volume, and cheaper consumption is increasing with each passing day. Due to this, when blind consumerism has valued the transparency of an ethical supply chain is compromised. What is Supply Chain Management?  Source: Statista Content & Design Dribbble In more clear terms, Supply chain management includes the integrated planning as well as the execution of different processes. This involves material flow, information flow as well as financial capital flow. The management of the flow of goods, services, and information involving the storage and movement of raw materials, building products as well as full-fledged finished goods from one point to another is called as supply chain management. A supply chain within the SCM is a network of individual entities, organizations, businesses, resources as well as technologies that combine together in the manufacturing of a product or service. Any supply chain progresses by initially delivering the raw materials from a supplier to a manufacturer and eventually ends by delivering the final product to the consumer. Proper implementation of supply chain management can result in benefits like increased sales and revenues, decreased frauds and overhead costs, quality improvisation. Moreover, this will also lead to accelerating production and distribution. While all of this seems simple in theory, practically maintaining a supply chain is a tedious task even for small businesses. The interconnectivity of different elements in the supply chain gradually becomes more inefficient when a business grows. In order to resolve these inefficiencies and save a company’s money, different technologies like AI and Machine learning are being applied to SCM. Amongst these, blockchain is exploring new ways to change the overall game. Supply Chain Challenges and Blockchain Solutions Blockchain can be applied to many challenges of the Supply Chain industry such as complicated recordkeeping and tracking of products. As a less corruptible and better-automated alternative to centralized databases. Following are the ways in which blockchain can be useful in the supply chain industry.  Source: MODUSBOX Provenance Tracking Big companies and organizations have a lot of elements in their supply chains. Due to this, it becomes almost impossible to keep track of each and every record even for multinational corporations. The lack of transparency leads to cost and customer relations issues which ultimately dilutes the brand name. In a blockchain-based supply chain management, record keeping and provenance tracking become easy as the product information can be accessed through the help of embedded sensors and RFID tags. The history of a product right from its origination to where it is in the present time can be traced through blockchain. Moreover, this type of accurate provenance tracking can be used to detect frauds in any part of the supply chain. Cost Reduction The real-time tracking of a product in a supply chain with the help of blockchain reduces the overall cost of moving items in a supply chain. According to a survey of supply chain workers conducted by APQC and the Digital Supply Chain Institute (DSCI), more than one-third of people cited reduction of costs as the topmost benefit of application of Blockchain in supply chain management. When blockchain is applied to speed up administrative processes in supply chains, the extra costs occurring in the system are automatically reduced while still guaranteeing the security of transactions. The elimination of the middlemen and intermediaries in the supply chain saves the risks of frauds, product duplicacy and saves money too. Payments can be processed by customers and suppliers within the supply chain by using cryptocurrencies rather than customers and suppliers rather than relying on EDI. Moreover, efficiency will be improved and the risk of losing products will be reduced with accurate recordkeeping. Establishing Trust Having trust in complex supply chains with many participants is necessary for smooth operations. For example, when a manufacturer shares his products with suppliers, he/she should be able to depend on them for following factory safety standards. Also, when it comes to regulatory compliances such as custom enforcers, trust plays a vital role. The immutable nature of blockchain in the supply chain is well-designed to prevent tampering and establishing trust. Benefits of Supply Chain with Blockchain  Source: Faizod One of the most appealing benefits of using blockchain for data is that it allows the data to be more interoperable. Due to this, it becomes easier for companies to share information and data with manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors. Transparency in Blockchain helps reduce delays and disputes while preventing goods from getting stuck in the supply chain. As each product can be tracked in real-time, the chances of misplacements are rare. Blockchain offers scalability through which any large database is accessible from multiple locations from around the world. It also provides higher standards of security and the ability to customize according to the data feed. Moreover, blockchains can be created in a private manner too which will allow the data to be accessed explicitly between the parties who have the permission for it. The value of adopting blockchain technology can be taken from the fact that it has the potential to connect different ledgers and data points while maintaining the data integrity among multiple participants. The properties of transparency and immutability of blockchain technology make it useful for eliminating frauds in supply chain and maintaining the integrity of the system. Other than these, few other benefits of adopting Blockchain technology in the supply chain industry are: Reduce or eliminate fraud and errorsImprove inventory managementMinimize courier costsReduce delays from paperworkIdentify issues fasterIncrease consumer and partner trustSupply Chain Management with Blockchain Use Cases  Source: IBM With its increasing popularity, blockchain technology seems like the solution to the problems of many industries today. Supply chain being one of the most populated industry holds certain use cases where the application of blockchain technology can make a difference. A single shipment of goods can have at least 20-25 people or organizations in the process which leads to roughly 200 interactions between them thus, leading to a lengthy process. If applied correctly, blockchain technology can assure provenance tracking and traceability across the supply chain. This, in turn, will lead to fewer counterfeiters and ensured safety in the processes. Blockchain in the supply chain will also allow manufacturers, transporters, and end-users to collect data, study trends, and apply predictive monitoring process for better product experience. Following are some of the use cases of blockchain in a supply chain. Seafood Verification Seafood supply chain has caught the negative headlines many a time and still continues to do so due to the lack of a transparent system. The current seafood supply chain has tedious processes like manual recordkeeping that make it more prone to errors. Moreover, other issues that result in making the seafood supply chain inefficient are the improper food storage conditions, mislabeling frauds and prevalence of unregulated practices. Due to these issues the quality and security of the food that reaches to the end-customer is compromised which threatens the industry’s economic security. Moreover, since there are the different type of frauds involved in the chain, the trust between the customers and vendors remain lacking. Blockchain technology can prove to be a panacea to the seafood verification problems as it can track fish and seafood right from the production to its distribution. Big names such as Hyperledger have even started implementing the technology in their projects in order to resolve the issues of the seafood supply chain industry. The project named Hyperledger Sawtooth is revolutionizing the supply chain by bringing traceability and accountability through its modular blockchain platform. It uses the PoET (the proof of elapsed time) consensus algorithm which allows actors in the system to reach a consensus in an environment where the counterparties are unaware of each other’s information. Sawtooth allows the seafood to be detected in the supply chain through sensors that transmit the location and time of the products to the blockchain. This allows the buyer to access a comprehensive record of the product provenance. Coffee Supply Chain  Source: Bext360 When you take a sip of that hot coffee in the morning from that big cup, you don’t even realize how long and complicated its supply chain must have been. The coffee supply chain in a global network that is highly complicated and is in a desperate need for reform. Production of coffee is fragmented as it is usually grown in developing areas of the world that are at remote locations. Other factors that affect the production of coffee and should be taken into consideration are volatile prices and the effect of changing climates. Moreover, since the people working as farmers and laborers in the coffee supply chains are from remote developing areas, there have been reported cases of abuses too. Due to the complexity of the system, the coffee supply chain makes an ideal use case for blockchain adoption and bring transparency and efficiency to the system. A Denver based startup, Bext360 is using a blockchain enabled machine called “bextmachine” that is used to analyze the coffee beans from the farms and assign a number to them for their traceability. When looked for performance, the machine is able to process around 50 kgs of coffee in one minute. The machine is also capable of scanning the outer fruit of each bean in a three-dimensional manner. Moreover, the machine also provides quality details about the coffee at the farm level itself, thus making more room for improvisation. Using blockchain in the coffee supply chain brings more productivity along with fair deals for producers and transparency as the system ensures direct payments to the farmers once their products are sold. On the other hand, the end customer can always look at the data and track the original source of their coffee. Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Drug supply chain is one facet of the pharma landscape that can be profited by blockchain. Counterfeit medicines are becoming increasingly troublesome as the global black market has been providing such drugs to people without getting under the radar. The risk of human life that rises from taking counterfeit drugs cannot be underestimated. The WHO has reported an increased sales of global fake drugs from $75bn in 2010, a 90% increase over the next five years. The major suffering population due to drug counterfeiting is from developing countries like Asia and Africa where such drugs constitute to around 10 to 30 percent of the total medicines for sale. It is becoming increasingly important for pharmaceutical companies and distributors around the world to improve the security and traceability of the drug supply chain. Taking the complexity of the current drug supply chain due to the growing number of people, there have to be reliable digital technologies and management systems that can secure the overall process. Blockchain technology can resolve this problem as it has become significantly popular in terms of applications relating to supply chain management. System vulnerabilities in the drug supply chain lead to many pain points such as very little visibility for tracking and authenticating the products. The introduction of blockchain in such cases can reap several benefits here. Drugs can be tagged with barcodes and once they are scanned, their records can be kept on a blockchain in secure digital blocks. These records will be updated in real-time as the drugs are transferred from one entity to the other in the supply chain. Parties with authorized access, including patients, can check the records anytime. The immutable nature of blockchain provides drug traceability from manufacturer to customer and allows people to check if the system is compromised somewhere. Apart from ensuring product integrity and anti-counterfeiting efforts, blockchain technology can help overcome the financial issues faced by smaller retailers and operators along the supply chain. Food Supply Chain  Source: LinkedIn SlideShare The complexity of our food supply chain is increasing gradually and due to this, it is becoming difficult for the food producers, suppliers and retailers to ensure the provenance of the products through the supply chain. Food safety issues including cross-contamination Identifying and the spread of foodborne illness are made even worse by lack of data and traceability. the source of contamination and finding the root cause of that can take from days to months which ultimately leads to an increased number of sick people, loss of revenues, and wasted food. According to the WHO, one-out-of-ten people fall ill and around 420,000 die due to contaminated food. Consumers are increasingly becoming aware and are demanding transparency in terms of the food they consume. Presently, about only 12 percent of consumers trust the brands that they purchase food from for the information of their food while 94 percent of consumers state that it is highly important for them to learn about all the information related to the food products that they buy. Blockchain resolves the issues of a complex supply chain by providing neutrality in the platform. Since there are no third parties involved in the transaction authorization and everything works on the basis of a consensus, both, the users and the operators of the system have to follow set of rules to keep the system running. Blockchain brings huge advantages for all the actors in food the supply chain. Food producers can ensure the originality and quality of their supplies by tracking the attempts of tampering as the food item moves in the supply chain. In case of identification of a fraud, the supplier will be intimidated and this notification can be sent to the retailer even before the food item reaches to its destination. Similarly, in the case of retailers, if a damaged food product somehow makes it the stores, he/she can identify and remove only such offending items rather than checking the whole batch of supplies. With blockchain, consumers are treated with transparency and openness when they need assurance for the food products that they consume. This allows the consumers to identify and consume high quality food. Automotive Supply Chain Ranging from parts suppliers, manufacturers to sellers, the automotive supply chain is a highly complex and broad sector with multiple participants. Delivering real customer value requires analysis of existing IT and business processes along with solutions that abide by the permissions of security, confidentiality, and authorization. Blockchain can turn out to be an ideal solutiMoreover, Ireland’s Moyee Coffee, on in such cases as it provides transparency across the entire supply chain along with reduced costs and complexity of dealing with multiple parties. For automotive suppliers, blockchain can be used to protect their brands from duplicate products and to create customer-centric business models. In the automotive industry, counterfeit products raise a significant issue for the automotive manufacturers. Also, the current market of counterfeit spare parts is estimated at several billion dollars. Such products can make their way to the supply chain either directly or through the OEM and aftermarket suppliers. Counterfeit spare parts are not reliable as they have degraded quality level and they often tend to fail which brings dissatisfaction to the end customers ultimately leading them to revoke their trust in the brand. Introducing blockchain technology for counterfeiting products proves to be significantly advantageous as it allows spare parts to be identified uniquely and represent them digitally. Digital identification of spare parts adds transparency to the system and it can be shared among multiple parties in the network. Inbound Logistics and Smart Manufacturing with blockchain can allow the automotive supply chain to be efficient. Currently, the tracking of individual components of an inbound supply chain is complex and prone to errors. The coordination among multi-tier suppliers, 3rd party logistics, and transportation companies through the manufacturing plant is necessary for effective functioning of the supply chain. By using blockchain, we can ensure the availability of accurate and real-time information amongst different parties. People involved can an check the status, quantity as well as the location of individual parts. Similarly, the outbound supply chain is also a complex network which consists of distributors, manufacturers importers, and dealers. These participants don’t have a common data sharing model as well which makes it difficult for them to exchange information. A shared blockchain based system ensures visibility and transparency which, in turn, ensures faster transactions and lowering settlement periods.

For more serious encryption, enough to feel protected from even government agencies, web experts are recommending using VPNs. A VPN will mask your origin point and encrypt your ‘footsteps’ so to speak. An SSL Certificate should be good enough, but in this day and age, you should take your personal privacy as far as you deem necessary. It is extremely important to get your SSL Certificates from a reputable source however, that does not mean having to pay out of the nose for an authentic SSL Certificate. Most web hosts require payment to issue SSLs, despite the fact that Let’s Encrypt want them to be free. WPX Hosting do provide unlimited, Google-sponsored SSLs for free and are one of the few companies to do this. Getting an SSL needn’t be difficult and is a necessity for your website in 2017.

Justin Wilkerson Techniques for beating facial recognition can be roughly divided into two categories: occlusion or confusion. Occlusion techniques work by physically hiding facial features so the camera simply can’t see them. How successful these methods are will depend on which bits of your face are hidden and how well hidden they are. For example, a balaclava which leaves the most important facial features exposed – the eyes, the mouth, the nose – may not actually do much to prevent a person from being identified.

How successful these methods are will depend on which bits of your face are hidden and how well hidden they are. For example, a balaclava which leaves the most important facial features exposed – the eyes, the mouth, the nose – may not actually do much to prevent a person from being identified. Researchers have found that by using a deep learning framework trained on 14 key facial points, they were able to accurately identify partially-occluded faces most of the time. This includes wearing glasses, scarves, hats or fake beards, If you really want to take it to the extreme you can skip the ski mask and go straight to a 3D-printed model of someone else's face. The deeply unnerving URME Personal Surveillance Identity Prosthetic is a 3D scan of the artist Leo Selvaggio's face, right down to his hair and skin texture. If, on the other hand, a more or less literal tinfoil hat is your thing then Project Kovr, a jacket which zips up over your head and looks like it could double as a spacecraft may be the option for you. However, while hiding your entire face may be more effective for preventing FR systems from identifying you, it’s the exact opposite of inconspicuous. Completely obscuring your face is illegal in many places, including many places in Europe, Canada and the United States. Even where it may be technically allowed, it’s hard to think of a quicker way of attracting attention from the people around you – not to mention the police – than walking down the street looking like you’ve just escaped from a sci-fi dystopia. Confounding the computer So if occlusion is uncertain at best and liable to get you locked up at worst, that leaves confusion. One of the most straightforward techniques is to stop the FR system working is to make it think it isn't looking at a face. “If you’re attacking the facial detection stage, you could try and break up the lines of your face to try and stop it from being detected by the system in the first places,” Ryan says. This is the idea behind CV Dazzle, which uses extreme makeup and hairstyles to bewilder computer vision systems. This technique (and other forms of extreme makeup, like Juggalo makeup) confuse computer vision systems by playing with light and darkness in a way which makes a face look – to a computer – like it’s not a face. ""From an academic research perspective, the 'makeup attack' is gaining more attention. However, this kind of attack demands good make up skills in order to be successful,"" Busch observes. Just applying makeup at random is unlikely to be enough – key facial points need to be obscured in specific ways in order to fool the system. Dazzle methods will only work on systems which rely on visible light, however (and like some of the occlusion methods, it is likely to get you a lot of attention when you're walking around in public). That means it’s not applicable to more sophisticated systems like Apple’s FaceID, which use infrared light rather than visible light. “They bounce the beams of [infrared] light back off your face to create a 3D map of your face. That can make it even harder for people to avoid detection because it’s not just relying on the way that you appear, but also the contours of your face,” Ryan says. “Which is really useful when it comes to say, the iPhone not being fooled by a flat printed image because you can’t get any contours off it.” Infrared-based systems may see through techniques like CV Dazzle, but they are vulnerable to other forms of interference. It’s possible to fight infrared with infrared. In 2018, researchers from Fudan University in China, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Indiana University, and Alibaba Inc., used an array of tiny infrared LEDs wired to the inside of a baseball cap to project dots of light onto the wearer’s face. These dots were invisible to the human eye, but confused the computer vision and made the face unidentifiable. The researchers found that they couldn’t just hide the wearer’s identity, however – they could also make the computer think they were someone else altogether. Using the LEDs, in 70 per cent of tests the researchers were able to trick the FR system into thinking their colleague was Moby.",2021-03-07T01:28:15.139Z,"Do you know any blockchain based open source identity management solution possibility using facial recognition?

To get a better picture, I called up Micah Winkelspecht, founder and CEO of Gem, a Venice, Calif.-based startup developing blockchain application platforms. One of the company’s main focus areas is healthcare, and its first partner is the Philips Blockchain Lab. Winkelspecht said that whether we talk about the higher education transcript or the patient health record, it really boils down to the fact that we have always kept records in some kind of a centralized system and we give very little access or control to the people who should be owning their records. “There is a major push toward a more patient-centric focus in healthcare, yet your data is stored all over the place in kind of a Frankenstein concoction of records with very little interoperability of file formats between systems. He said the project Gem is working on with Philips is not meant to replace EHRs. “But we are exploring the ways we can provide real-time access to data across multiple providers and caregivers. We are looking at how we move medical-related data on a blockchain.” One of the misconceptions about the blockchain is that you store the data on the blockchain, Winkelspecht said. Blockchains are actually inefficient as data stores, he explained, because by their very nature, all the data is replicated on every node across a network of nodes. That is how they work. “So it is highly redundant, but that means it is very inefficient for storing large amounts of data. We use the blockchain as a document registry for data stored in external data stores.” So you can kind of think of it as like a library catalog that tells you where in the library your book is. But they are also using it to record a permanent time-stamp of the fingerprint of every piece of data that goes into the system as well. “You can make very strong guarantees about the underlying data’s integrity, and furthermore we apply an identity layer so that anytime anyone performs an action on that blockchain, it is an authenticated action. And we can go back and look at every modification to a piece of data, every addition. We can say with precise definition who did what at what time.” So I asked Winkelspecht what I would see if I were a patient who had recently seen a few doctors. He said the blockchain would point me to a universal patient case file, with a universal identifier for me as the patient. “So no matter which doctor is interfacing with the system, they are recording information against the same universal patient identifier, which is recorded on the blockchain,” he said. When you go to primary care doctor, they create a visit report, and prescribe you see a radiologist. That all goes into your patient case file as a visit. Then when you go to the radiologist, they leverage the same identifier for that patient, and they upload their scans, and their report gets tracked against that identifier. When the patient goes back to the primary care doctor, all that data is available to that physician under the same record. There is no centralized data store. The data can be stored in different systems. But the blockchain controls the access and permission layer for who should have access at what time, Winkelspecht explained. “It serves as the library catalog that points you to where the data is, and it also serves as the permission layer for all that data.” Each data store is using the blockchain to determine whether it should grant access or not to a particular provider. “It becomes your integrity layer, in terms of keeping a time-stamped registry of every document, so no document can be modified without others knowing. And it provides the authenticity layer because every action is authenticated and recorded on the blockchain, so you know who is doing what with the data and at what time. That allows for a perfect audit history. External data stores can use the blockchain as the universal source of truth about who should have access to what.” What you have today is a bunch of disparate data silos, he said. With the blockchain, you could have a complete, full accurate history of a patient from beginning to end across multiple different systems. “This becomes the interoperability model for how EMRs should work.” Winkelspecht admits that there are a lot of hurdles to overcome in healthcare, including getting buy-in from the EHR vendors. “I am not sure whether they will or not. The approach we are taking is working with the largest companies in this space. We fully recognize that Gem, as a startup company, can’t just build a better mousetrap and everybody is going to flock to it. We are building a consensus with a lot of the major companies in the healthcare space, and that was what our Gem Health initiative is all about. Philips is one of our first partners, but we are working with a lot of other large companies we haven’t announced yet. We are trying to get a bunch of key stakeholders.” Finance was the first vertical market in which blockchain took hold with Bitcoin, because it was marketed as a financial technology, “but the way we are leveraging these blockchains is not really financial, it is data management,” Winkelspecht said. “So it has a much broader base of applications. Now other verticals are starting to look at this. The biggest verticals we see are healthcare, but also supply chain. It is also a big deal for the Internet of Things (IoT). We have billions of devices coming online. And now the only way we know how to manage those is to create IoT device aggregator systems. This might be the answer to allow devices to speak to devices directly with no intermediaries.” I asked him what kind of issues would need to be worked through in terms of governance. He said if you look at Bitcoin and Ethereum, these are attempts to build permissionless, public iinfrastructure where anybody can join and participate in the process of managing the ledger. “In most of these cases on the enterprise side, that is a bit of a stretch for them,” he said. “They are looking to create consortium models, where 10 different healthcare companies come together and manage this blockchain network.” That is going to be a pattern for the next few years as they get more comfortable with it and regulators get more comfortable, he added. “Then in the long run, a lot of this ends up shifting to public infrastructure very similar to how in the beginning of the internet, people focused on building intranets that were insulated and well protected, but using internet technology to do that. Eventually they decided to open themselves up to the internet, and now they are putting infrastructure in the cloud. I see the same transitions happening in this space as well.” So where does Gem fit into all this? He said Gem is not building the next great blockchain system. “There are a lot of great projects such as Ethereum to the Hyperledger project being managed by the Linux Foundation,” he said. Gem has a core product called GemOS designed to make the blockchain usable for enterprise clients. “We add in the other things you need to create great applications that use the blockchain such as document management and identity layers, and we provide an abstraction layer on top of multiple blockchains, so with one platform you could integrate with multiple blockchain systems underneath.”",2021-03-07T01:28:34.583Z,"What all legal things needs to be taken care for Blockchain based health record management startup?

While it was initially outlined for cryptocurrencies, it has quickly evolved into something of greater significance. Employed in several areas and industries, blockchain tech is successfully opening doors for small, medium, and large businesses. This is the reason why most of the business owners are integrating blockchain development services in their ecosystem. How blockchain technology helps businesses: Secure and Efficient Storage of DataIt's no secret that entrepreneurs need to have easy access to their data anytime and anywhere. Therefore, most of the time, they use cloud platforms. As awesome as this is, it still makes startups depend on a third-party, which is a solid concern when we're talking about highly-confidential data. Well, blockchains manage to make the cloud storage decentralized - meaning that no one can delete or manipulate data. Hallelujah, right? This increases data security and efficiency, as well as cuts down reliance on third parties. Entirely Automated Legal AgreementsEntrepreneurs are certainly familiar with agreements and contracts being delayed due to signatures, approvals, or dependence on lawyers. Frustrating, right? Luckily, several blockchain applications are now successfully replacing or augmenting lawyers, thus allowing startups to manage the legal agreement process entirely automatically. These smart contracts get entrepreneurs rid of the annoying delays, facilitating businesses with well-established terms and clients engage faster and easier. Fundraising EfficientlyStartups are always doing things at a fast pace. And the fundraising process is renowned to be one of the key frictions points in building a company; yet, it tends to become very time, resource, effort, and money consuming. The traditional fundraising journey of venture capitalists can take precious months of traveling, emailing, meetings, events, and so on before you get tangible results. This slows down the high speed required to be established in the market. With blockchain self-verifying systems, this entire process is accelerated by letting venture companies send funds right after they've made the investment decision. It's just a matter of minutes and helps reduce the friction amount in the fundraising funnel as well as speed up all the related actions. No More Time-consuming Background ChecksBefore getting into a new business relationship, entrepreneurs have to check the other party's background in order to verify trust. This also applies to market investors. We're again talking about a lengthy process that requires a bunch of time, numerous contacts, and substantial efforts. Blockchain technology can be used in the process of identity authentication. Verifying previous work positions, job responsibilities, birth certificates, and other mundane (but critical) things make the entire check easier, saving startups a considerable amount of time. Enhanced Capital AccessFinancing their project by raising capital is a huge step for entrepreneurs worldwide. However, in many parts of the Globe, this mechanism is not as easy as entrepreneurs wish. Hidden costs of traditional loans, limited access to modern tools, and certain restrictions are just some of the issues in this scenario. Here is where blockchains can help by giving startup owners the chance of accessing funds not only from their countries but also from different parts of the world. Bitcoin and other digital currencies don't depend on location; hence no hidden exchange amounts are involved. Basically, when transferring cryptocurrencies, no restrictions and international fees are applied. This creates an equal funding opportunity for most entrepreneurs. Improved Supply Chain VerificationWhen it comes to a startup's supply chain, owners often know the vendor they are buying from, but not the vendor's suppliers. This can be a problem when the product fails and the entrepreneurs can't identify the exact culprit. By easy, quick scanning and spotting the point where the issue occurred, blockchain technology helps businesses be aware of aspects such as ethical (or unethical) sourcing, avoid counterfeit items, or make sure that the products and services delivered to customers are meeting all the promises, requirements, and expectations. This is great for all organizations, especially those that are not well-established in the market yet and must build a trustworthy relationship with their customers. Understanding these factors is vital for preventing a negative impact, exposing uncertainties, and empowering businesses. Breaking the Entry BarrierAnother awesome way how blockchain technology helps entrepreneurs and businesses is by creating online marketplaces where transactions are transparent and there's no monopoly control over data access and price. Therefore, competition in the market is increased and the barrier for businesses' entry significantly lowered down. The greatest thing about it is that it leads to the emergence of more novel products and services. Blockchain technology enjoys an ongoing evolution. More and more entrepreneurs start learning about it and familiarize themselves with the way it can help their businesses. Undoubtedly, this innovative technology is allowing both startups and big organizations to grow, easing their way to success.",2021-03-07T01:29:28.857Z,"How do I design a trusted platform for fund management of a startup using blockchain technology?

It is easy to use than Pi because you can click the time stamp at any time on the day for you attendance. Where as, Pi can be clicked only after the green button goes white after 24 hours. When you open the TimeStope application press on the calendar, when it opens you will see a big globe symbol on the calendar, This has to be pressed once every day for your attendance. You can get detail on the application itself. This also requires the witness code or invitation code, You are free to use ‘’bp007′’ as the witness code.  iii. Bee, you can easily download the application and start mining from today. There is a bee symbol button on Bee application. This button is green in colour when it is in mining state.

A block in most blockchains is an object that includes transactions from one or more actors to one or more actors, a header that includes a reference to the previous block, and in some implementations bytecode meant for some sort of virtual machine. Each new block also has a difficulty target which acts as a gauge to determine how long it should take to generate a hash to satisfy the target. This helps prevent bad actors from the first and widest know Continue ReadingA blockchain is a construct that occurs when blocks of data are cryptographically linked to previous blocks of data and are ordered sequentially. A block in most blockchains is an object that includes transactions from one or more actors to one or more actors, a header that includes a reference to the previous block, and in some implementations bytecode meant for some sort of virtual machine. Each new block also has a difficulty target which acts as a gauge to determine how long it should take to generate a hash to satisfy the target. This helps prevent bad actors from the first and widest known type of hack, the “double spend”. A double spend is when an actor sends the same token to multiple people at once. Imagine I have a dollar with a serial key of 112358. Double spending is if person A sends person b, c and d the same dollar with 112358. This attack happens frequently. Especially on the blockchains with a weak mining coalition. The second type of hack that can happen and has happened in bitcoin is a the integer overflow. On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three different addresses. This happened because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. Another type of hack ive seen in the wild was using obscure code in the binarys. These binary files usually stole peoples coins, or in one case with an altcoin called asiacoin, they gave themselves the ability to create unlimited coins. When exchanges listed this coin they gave themselves millions of coins then dumped them all for btc then withdrew the bitcoin before people really knew what was going on. When smart contracts got introduced that opened a whole new can of worms. There are alot of smart contract implementations with bugs in them. You can search about the infamous DAO hack. What happened was a company known as slock.it created by Stephen Taul launched a smart contract called “the DAO”. The dao collected ether and gave people tokens that they could use to vote on how the dao would spend the collected ether. Well the code had a bug known as the “rentry bug”. With rentry, you could withdraw a small amount of ether to a contract account and the contract could renter the previous contract and drain the funds. And thats what happened. Other hacks have been similar and people have lost 100’s of millions of dollars worth of ether due to bad smart contracts. So to answer your question, yes it is true some have been hacked but a hack is a nuanced sort of discussion. Attacking bitcoin on a fundamental level, is computationally expensive if not impossible with current technology. Bugs creep up and could be problematic, and no one is safe from people with malicious intent. With that being said, nearly all blockchain implementations are opensource and have thousands of people looking at their code.

The technology supports cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and the transfer of any data or digital asset. Spearheaded by Bitcoin, blockchains achieve consensus among distributed nodes, allowing the transfer of digital goods without the need for centralized authorisation of transactions. The present blockchain ecosystem is like the early Internet, a permissionless innovation environment in which email, the World Wide Web, Napster, Skype, and Uber were built. The technology allows transactions to be simultaneously anonymous and secure, peer-to-peer, instant and frictionless. It does this by distributing trust from powerful intermediaries to a large global network, which through mass collaboration, clever code and cryptography, enables a tamper-proof public ledger of every transaction that’s ever happened on the network.A block is the “current” part of a blockchain which records some or all of the recent transactions, and once completed, goes into the blockchain as permanent database. Each time a block gets completed, a new block is generated. Blocks are linked to each other (like a chain) in proper linear, chronological order with every block containing a hash of the previous block.How is it different from current payment systems? Blockchain technology allows for instant recognition of the exact size of the block by all transacting parties in the chain since the block is simultaneously updated on all their databases, and has unique security features that do not allow tampering with the definition of the block. In addition, each block’s movements across the chain have the ability to be verified by all parties in the chain since the block carries with it the digital imprint, or ‘signature’, of wherever it has been.Therefore it creates instant trust without having to rely on a series of trustworthy banks to clear cheques. Here, various parties transacting regard their reputation as being more important than reneging on it. Unlike traditional banking system, cash transactions here are undertaken immediately.Benefits of blockchain technology: As a public ledger system, blockchain records and validate each and every transaction made, which makes it secure and reliable.All the transactions made are authorized by miners, which makes the transactions immutable and prevent it from the threat of hacking.Blockchain technology discards the need of any third-party or central authority for peer-to-peer transactions.It allows decentralization of the technology.Some telecom firms in places such as India and Kenya are already using their networks to help people settle cash transactions, but these are proprietary and meant largely for poor and underbanked areas with considerable mobile penetration.Concerns associated: Blockchain is still a (relatively) new technology and is not without its problems. For a start, there are ongoing concerns about privacy in the settlement and storage of securities – blockchain providers are working hard to address.Banks are also at threat with blockchain, since more and more firms (using their IT service providers from India and elsewhere) will build systems that can create and exchange ‘blocks’ with one another completely legally, without ever having to use the banks as a financial intermediary.Applications of this technology: There are applications for blockchain outside financial services as well. A ‘block’ could be defined as anything—a unit of services, products, raw materials—the list is endless. What are Blockchains?

The blockchain can prevent that. Adult being one of the world’s largest industries and the most important vehicle to decide for new technologies (HD-DVD vs. Blue Ray), there is a lot of potential. (XPlay, SpankChain)Gambling. The gambling industry is very scammy, similar to the adult industry. With standards and decentralized blockchains, this can all be prevented. (Fun, Edgeless, Casino coin, Wagerr)Social Networking. There are several cryptocurrencies where content creators are rewarded with crypto and they offer a decentralized storage of data. Quite interesting (Steem, Rdd, Mithril)Ticketing with the GET Protocol - A working ticketing protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Has ticketed over 50,000 tickets in the Netherlands so far using its application GUTS Tickets, already has over 1 Million Tickets lined up to be sold on the protocol by the end of next year. Famous artists and comedians like Zaz, Jochem Myjer, Guus Meeuwis & Youp Van 't Hek onboard, using the Ethereum mainnet in Q3 of this year.So, this is my list of the most powerful blockchain applications ranked by powerfulness and usefulness. Interestingly, the top 3 industries aren’t really served yet, only by smaller cryptocurrencies (Mediblocs, Medishares, District, Counterpart, Civic, THEKEY) that have not seen that much popularity yet. I think the reason for that is, because the industry are so huge and deeply controlled by the rich and powerful and very political that it will take a long time for cryptocurrencies to have an impact here, while it will probably go much faster in the ones ranked lower (Gaming, Adult, Gambling, Ticketing). it looks like the Top 7 has the biggest potential, but will take the most time while the bottom 7 has a smaller market, but will make an impact much faster. Some of these blockchain have already found usage and we can expect for some of them to become the standard worldwide in several industries. Here, you have a few more use cases in a nice infographic. If you found this post helpful, please give an upvote. :) The best applications of the blockchain are in industries that are controlled by very large and corrupt institutions that make the industry very inefficient. Most of them are also already used by companies and individuals in the real world. This list is sorted by potential from greatest to lesser. The healthcare industry is one of the largest industries, but extremely inefficient with no standards. I think the blockchain could do a lot, a lot of good here. This system is easy to standardize and decentralize. Blockchain technology would help save lives and cut the rising cost of healthcare.

Where blockchain is decentralized distributed system for faster, transparent transaction. So, ofcourse they are different as it is like a website made on react vs react technology! But, still lets find out how blockchain has been applied in the bitcoins and also what bitcoins are with top 5 difference between blockchain vs bitcoin!So, let just get started!!! 1.How Bitcoin is different from Blockchain A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Blockchain was infact designed for bitcoins!Whereas bitcoins is a ledger( A distributed ledger is simply a database spread across different nodes) started in 2009 as a cryptocurrency which is built on blockchain technology. 2.How Bitcoin uses Blockchain The Bitcoin blockchain in its simplest form is a database or ledger comprised of Bitcoin transaction records. However, because this database is distributed across a peer-to-peer network and is without a central authority, network participants must agree on the validity of transactions before they can be recorded. This agreement, which is known as “consensus,” is achieved through a process called “mining.” 3.What is Bitcoin all about Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a ‘digital wallet’ app on a smartphone or computer. People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. 4.Other applications of blockchain than cryptocurrency Data in the blocks need not be limited to financial transactions only as in voter registeration done in switzerland people are identified using the hashes of blockchain whose coolest part is that in UPORT app you need not login with password!! It has expanded to real estate and because blockchains are direct transactions there are no brokers here. ArBit has developed its own sort of coins that rewards musicians for their contribution and many more!!!This field is on its way to blow up!!! 5.Data mining in Bitcoin Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin’s public ledger of past transactions or blockchain. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. After someone uses Bitcoins, miners engage in complex, resource-intense computational equations to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. Through mining, a “proof of work” that meets certain requirements is created. The proof of work is a piece of data that is costly and time-consuming to produce but can easily be verified by others. To be considered a valid transaction on the blockchain, an individual record must have a proof of work to show that consensus was achieved. By this design, transaction records cannot be tampered with or changed after they have been added to the blockchain. -Engineer Diaries(Follow Engineer Diaries for latest tech, startup and career news in India!)

The average ICO returned more than 10x. ICO funding surpassed standard VC funding. Blockchain technology emerged as the brand-new buzzword of option by executives. Is this all simply buzz? This article will discuss the future of blockchain and some ”blockchain future trends.“ We argue this is just the start. As a matter of fact, both Ray and also I left our tasks at the well-known innovation research study company, Gartner, to join the blockchain motion. Here is how we believe ‘blockchain innovation’ will certainly form the globe by 2030. Originally Posted: 5 Blockchain Technology Future Prediction for 2030  Blockchain Forecast # 1: Government Crypto Governments all around the world are adopting Blockchain Technology. By 2030, most federal governments all over the world will create or adopt some form of digital currency. The federal government currency of the future is certainly crypto. Compared to the conventional fiat choice, cryptocurrency is a lot more efficient, offers minimized negotiation times, and also offers increased traceability. Cryptocurrency can also be backed by genuine properties, comparable to fiat money, and also its cost can be synthetically manipulated by various controls (e.g., financial plan for ""printing"" much more tokens). Blockchain can revolutionized the financial transactions. In the short-term, government-based cryptocurrency will come to be an area of testing and expeditions, led primarily by creating nations with unsteady economic situations and also weak institutions. Many of such initiatives will certainly relocate a rash fashion-- with a timeline driven by political concerns as opposed to financial issues or technological development. Consider the Zimbabwe buck, for example, which has actually endured an incredible inflation of 500,000,000,000%. Many Zimbabweans have currently relied on Bitcoin as a hedge against their nationwide currency, thereby driving the Bitcoin price up on the local crypto-market. Creating a brand-new cryptocurrency offers a practical solution for the Zimbabwean federal government to ease the grim understanding of its nation's monetary challenges. In the short term, such efforts might show really effective. Considering Venezuela's newly produced cryptocurrency ""petro"" elevated over $5 billion throughout the pre-sale occasion, several various other countries will follow suit. Nonetheless, much of these early tasks will unavoidably fail because of the onset of the innovation which is yet to mature as well as a result of lack of in-house expertise by a corresponding federal government in charge. In a great deal of these situations, such experiments will be unintended. Simply put, governments moving on with a cryptocurrency job may not understand that they are guinea pig in their own experiments. As a result of the lack of requisite knowledge inside, these governments will certainly look to outside working as a consultants, a few of which are newly developed as well as with restricted sources. Therefore, lots of federal governments will certainly wind up victimized by cyberpunks, as a result of inadequate or incompletely implemented practices pertaining to private-key management as well as relevant processes. This scenario parallels the early days of the Internet, where major companies that were successful in business (yet not knowledgeable about shopping) made errors in initial implementations, causing loss of data and funds. In the long run, however, effective situations will emerge. Future generation blockchain technology will certainly solve lots of present constraints, such as scalability, personal privacy controls, toolset maturity, as well as interoperability. Price-stable tokens regulated by financial plans and backed by collateral will certainly start to acquire traction as they end up being more dependable as a way of exchange and as a store of value. Governments that have stopped working to produce a successful cryptocurrency will certainly rely on ""steady coins"" as their virtual currency of option. Example Blockchain based companies attempting to fix this trouble today: Tether, BitShares, Manufacturer, Basecoin, Carbon, Stably, Havven, Kowala, TrueUSD, Arccy, Sweetbridge, Augmint, Fragments, Petro, as well as others.  Blockchain Forecast #2: Trillion-Dollar Procedures By 2030, there will certainly be more trillion-dollar symbols than there will certainly be trillion-dollar firms. There is a race amongst the 4 most valued firms worldwide (based on stock exchange valuation) regarding which one will be the initial to reach one trillion bucks in worth. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Microsoft remain in a race to the ""4-comma club."" These business are all representative of the new economic situation-- one that should maybe be called the no-longer-so-new economic climate. This new-ish economic climate is one based upon the decades-long shift to electronic company and also online links. It is the Web economic climate or what blockchain supporters call ""Internet 2.0"" (preparing for the following era, the blockchain period, as ""Internet 3.0""). The old (standard, pre-internet) economic climate is analog, brick-and-mortar, based upon oil as well as resource extraction, on production of basic materials and cultivation of foods items and also accoutrements, and also on the transportation and also sale of these with typical physical channels. Obviously, the real life will not disappear. It is where we live, take a breath, eat, and also ambulate. Yet its economic role has actually declined in the grand system of points. The new-ish economic situation is a layer of worth on top of the physical substratum. It has not yet fully diffused with all edges of the globe and economic sphere. Its impact will continue to expand, thus the high and also growing valuation in stock markets. It is feasible that after the very first trillion-dollar company, others will certainly additionally cross that threshold, as well as there might be 3 or 5. However the next era of blockchain technology is emerging, and that might comply with a various pattern than previous waves of financial transformation. What the old economy and the new-ish economy have in common is that they are both based on the notion of a company. In organization there is a long-lasting idea of the concept of the firm, expressed in 1937 by Ronald Coase. The theory of the company looks for to attend to questions as: Why do companies exist? Why do they grow? How are they structured? What are the various functions of a company? And so forth. In our sight, checking out a company resembles taking a look at a single-cell microorganism, taking a look at its internal subsystems, and also at the semi-permeable membrane that allows the flow of certain materials throughout that limit. Coase's concept is that firms exist since the cost of certain purchases or organisation processes inside the membrane is a lot lower than having to go across the border. Other purchases and also processes must cross the border (to do company with other entities), but particular features normally gravitate inside the wall surfaces of the company or microorganism. Blockchain innovation transforms the nature of this equation. It drastically lowers the expenses of transactions as well as information circulations. Where there was rubbing as well as impedance, these levels are lowered. Doing so deteriorates the conventional reasoning for a firm, specifically a trillion-dollar company. Huge firms exist, partially, due to the fact that there is a substantial schism in between procedures that occur inside the wall surfaces versus those that cross to the exterior. Blockchain technologies change the formula and support frictionless circulations of symbols as well as other electronic assets. What this means is that, in the future blockchain era, trillion-dollar firms will certainly be replaced by trillion-dollar tokens-- symbols that support a decentralized ecosystem of entities that together fulfill the function of the huge company. We remain in the dawn of that period, and also there will be a lot more trillion-dollar symbols in ten years than there will be trillion-dollar companies.  Blockchain Forecast # 3: Blockchain Identity for All By 2030, a cross-border, blockchain-based, self-sovereign identity criterion will emerge for people, along with physical and digital possessions. If e-mail verified to be the ""killer app"" for the Net, identification services will verify to be the ""awesome application for blockchain”. Identification systems, as we understand them today, are highly dysfunctional, operating in silos, as well as insecure. Blockchain based identity systems will certainly fix these issues. These blockchain based systems will supply a single resource of confirmation for individuals' identities and assets. ‘Blockchain based identity’ decentralizes the data collection, cross-verifies the collected data via a consensus mechanism, and stores this information on a decentralized immutable ledger. It enables reduced risk of security breaches, significantly higher efficiencies, higher reliability, and most importantly self-sovereignty. According to various data sources, 1.5 billion people in the developing world lack proof of identity, including more than 65 million refugees. Blockchain based self-sovereign identity platforms will provide the disenfranchised population with tools to obtain and maintain legal documentation. The new identity platform will be more secure and reliable since it will be stored on a distributed ledger rather than being in the possession of a central authority. Blockchain-based identity platforms will also enable self-sovereignty, which ultimately means individual privacy. The decision to disclose identity information will be within each individual's control. With recent Facebook data-breach scandals dominating the news, “blockchain-based identity” creates a viable and important solution to many data privacy issues. Some use cases for the types of data stored on a blockchain-based identity platform include (but are not limited to):. -- Government records (e.g., date of birth, etc.). -- Reputation & trust scores (e.g., credit history). -- Certificates & attestations (e.g., university diploma). -- Healthcare & medical records. -- Tax identification records. -- Employment records. While it is unlikely that, by 2030, a clear end-to-end solution will emerge as a clear winner, a high degree of interoperability among identity platforms will enable ease of use and global cross-verification. Furthermore, a blockchain-based asset identity platform will collect, store, and share data for both physical and virtual assets. More than 20 billion IoT devices are projected to exist by 2020. From your smart refrigerator to an airplane engine, these ""smart"" chips are already pervasive. By their nature, IoT devices are continuously connected to the internet. They collect, store, and transport unique sets of data. Blockchain will provide a secure, reliable, and efficient mechanism for these devices to transact among one other. Blockchain will keep an immutable record of all interactions and will enable instantaneous payment settlements (e.g., two IoT devices transferring assets between each other). Virtual assets will also have a unique identity on a blockchain. One example of virtual assets would be crypto kitties, fictional cats existing in a virtual game and living on the Ethereum blockchain. With the power of blockchain, these virtual objects are turned into tokenized assets which, similarly to physical assets, will have their unique identity. Ultimately, blockchain will enable an automated operating system seamlessly connecting individuals with assets in physical as well as in virtual worlds. Sample blockchain based companies solving individual identity today: uPort, BlockAuth, Civic, PeerMountain, IDRamp, Sovereign, Sovrin, LifeID, TrustedKey, Ping Identity, SelfKey, TheKey, NuID, ValidatedID, 2way. io, Microsoft, CryptID, ExistenceID, IBM, Blockstack, BlockCerts, http://Lumeno.us, etc Sample blockchain based companies solving physical & virtual asset identity today: WAX, Verses, BlockV, Xage, Guardtime, Filament, Chronicled, Blocksafe, DMarket, etc  Blockchain Prediction # 4: World Trade on a Blockchain. By 2030, most of world trade will be conducted leveraging blockchain technology. Blockchain will emerge as the growing technology of future. One of the most promising areas where blockchain can provide significant business value is global supply chain. In its current state, world trade is conducted via a chaotic, fragmented set of business relationships among parties that are untrusted. The future of blockchain is really promising. We have to wait till the world completely adopt the ‘blockchain technology’. This results in inefficiencies, errors, and fraud. This is a set of real-world business problems that are currently unsolved and cannot be fully solved without using blockchain technology. Some examples of real-world supply chain problems that need to be solved are: Counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical industry. Food supply chain in China (the tragic case of adulterated infant formula). Fake Louis Vuitton handbags and other fashion apparel in Asia. Counterfeit auto parts in North America. Grey market or counterfeit electronic equipment, including medical devices (World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 8% are fake). Enterprise IT equipment-- a major manufacturer of enterprise networking equipment estimates 10% of products in its multi-billion-dollar supply chain are grey market. As is evident, the problems in global supply chains are significant and, in some cases, life-threatening. According to WHO, tens of thousands of people die from counterfeit drugs every year. The solution to these problems is difficult because the business ecosystems are fragmented, siloed, only partially automated, and lacking a trusted central authority with jurisdiction, resources and credibility to track provenance and certify authenticity. Unlike the example of the banking industry, where there is an existing system (SWIFT) that works correctly and reliably, in the supply-chain examples, there is no proven, working system. There is no order, only chaos. Therefore, disruption is not an option, because disruption implies disintermediating or dismantling an existing system. What is required is ""anti-disruption""-- i.e., bringing order to chaos by using blockchain technology as a force for unification: to unify disparate flows of payment, physical goods and information. This won't be easy, and complete solutions will take years to build. In effect, one is constructing an ERP system for a business ecosystem, which means it will take longer and be more difficult than building an ERP system for a single company. Also, as mentioned earlier, the technology does not yet have the functional scope, flexibility, performance, efficiency, and maturity. Once it matures, the problems in supply chains are real enough, and important enough that solutions will eventually be built, and blockchain will play a critical role in these future solutions. Sample Blockchain based Companies: Skuchain, Provenance, Blockfreight, Blockverify, Caravaggio, Cargo Chain, Chain of Things, Consentio, Everledger, Filament, Fluent, Kioog, Kouvola Innovation, Mojix, Modum, Synechron, Tallysticks, Tradle, Wave, Zerado.  Blockchain Prediction # 5: Blockchain 4 Good By 2030, significant improvements in the world's standard of living will be attributable to the development of blockchain technology. Poverty and income discrepancy are arguably the hardest problems for humanity to tackle. More than 10% of the world population, more than 750 million people, live on less than $2 a day. More than 2 billion people are considered to be unbanked and have no access to financial services. Though the overall living standards increase, and world's GDP is on the rise, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Blockchain technology has the potential to shrink the poverty gap. How? It can be done by increasing financial inclusiveness, reducing corruption, and enabling decentralized access to value-creating assets. Here are three examples. Financial inclusiveness is the most obvious benefit of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As is already evident today, Bitcoin and blockchain enable the unbanked population to get banked, and therefore, get paid. One no longer needs to rely on a centralized institution, such as the government or a bank, to give you permission to open a bank account. You can buy and sell Bitcoin on an open market (provided access to a crypto exchange) with access to a smartphone. A number of merchants around the world already accept cryptocurrencies. By 2030, cryptocurrency will serve as a de facto standard, similar to how the US dollar is widely accepted today. Second, blockchain technology reduces corruption by creating transparency of official records. Whether you are a farmer in rural Latin America or a house owner in Russia, you will no longer be driven out of your land by a corrupt official tampering with the land registry. All assets, including land, will be recorded on a transparent, tamper-free distributed ledger open for the public to see. Solving this problem alone will have massive financial implications on the global economy. According to a prominent economist, Hernando DeSoto, ""dead capital,"" or, in other words, property or asset which is held but not legally recognized, is estimated at $20 trillion. Uncertainty around asset ownership reduces asset price and tradability potential. Therefore, by creating a transparent, tamper-proof property and asset tracking system, blockchain technology has the potential to increase global wealth. Lastly, blockchain technology enables a massive-scale tokenization of value-generating assets only available to the rich right now. Think about buying The Plaza Hotel in New York City or an expensive piece of gold mining equipment producing a steady, recurring income stream over several years. To purchase such an asset today, one has to borrow large sums of money from a bank and take an upfront risk on the purchase. Blockchain enables tokenization of large-scale assets. This means that even if you are a farmer in rural Africa, you can now become a fractional owner of a revenue-generating asset such as a gold mine. I hope this article will help you out in letting know the future of blockchain Technology. Blockchain Future is really promising. It will take some time for the blockchain to emerge further all over the world. Continue Reading",2021-03-07T01:43:36.977Z,"Does blockchain represent the future? ",Quora

KYC Verification Blockchain solutions are being used widely for authentication, verification and storage of electronic records in the banking industry as well as to create a KYC utility for the National Stock Exchange. Startups such as Primechain Technologies and Elemential Labs are among the key players in India here. Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies are heading to, DON'T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too but after much investigations to fine a legit platform where i can safely invest my portfolios, i came across Multicoinhodler Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . multicoinhodler . com) where i get good returns of my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. I also mine with them and most importantly store my bitcoin securely with them. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Be careful out there for there are so many fake investment website claiming to be paying. Supply Chain Financing And Management Blockchain systems allow significantly higher settlement turnaround time at lower costs by providing a single source of truth regarding pivotal points in the supply chain, like creditworthiness, supplier inventory levels, purchase order receipt and approval, invoice receipt and approval, and more. Delhi-based Sofacle Technologies is one such startup which designs and develops blockchain-powered enterprise solutions for smart contracts, supply chain finance, insurance, among others. Similarly, Auxesis which is currently focussing on private blockchain solutions with its enterprise-grade infrastructure focussing on security, performance and scalability. Then there is StaTwig which combines IoT and blockchain to provide real-time tamper-proof end-to-end tracking for packages and goods that identifies problems and inefficiencies in the supply chain. Simplification Of Remittances The main goal of blockchain remittance companies is to simplify the entire process, removing unnecessary intermediaries. The idea is to provide frictionless and near-instant payment solutions. Unlike traditional services, a blockchain network doesn’t rely on a slow process of approving transactions, which usually goes through several mediators and requires a lot of manual work. Thus, blockchain technology may solve some of the major problems faced by the remittance industry, such as high fees and long transaction time. Auxesis and EzyRemit are providing such solutions in India for businesses with large volume of remittances. Trusted Payments Solutions Blockchain technology promises to facilitate fast, secure, low-cost international payment processing services (and other transactions) through the use of encrypted distributed ledgers that provide trusted real-time verification of transactions without the need for intermediaries such as correspondent banks and clearinghouses. Blockchain technology was initially used to support the digital currency Bitcoin but is now being explored for a wide variety of applications that don’t involve Bitcoin. In India, KrypC is one startup offering such solutions for the payments industry. The startup’s specialised connectors for the financial industry are customised for money transfer, trade finance and pre-approved loans. Another one is Mumbai-based GetXS which is developing blockchain-based digital identities which can be authenticated securely. YES Bank has facilitated the issuance of a commercial paper (CP) of INR 100 Cr using blockchain technology for Vedanta, a natural resources conglomerate. Usually not backed by any form of collateral, a commercial paper (CP) is an unsecured money market instrument issued in the form of a promissory note. YES Bank used R3 Corda enterprise blockchain platform developed by US-based MonetaGo to facilitate the issuance. The blockchain platform, thus, ensures an efficient, transparent and secure mechanism for CP issuance and redemption. Records Storage And Management Documents in physical or digital form can be modified and copied. While there are many products and services that provide secure and verified document management, they tend to be expensive and often require the involvement of a third party. Blockchain embeds authentication into the document itself and using a closed-loop tracking system to protect against tampering or modification. One example here can be Indian startup RecordsKeeper that allows users to store documents, data and any transaction immutably in private-blockchain securely without the need of central authority. Similarly, Bengaluru-based PARAM Network is using the blockchain solution to cut the cost of e-invoice processing by half and store digital receipts on-chain. It also automates the entire process while bringing in transparency. This also cuts down the turnaround time and complexity of the verification process in invoice processing. Secure Digital Regulatory Process Blockchain’s immutability lends itself to the application of proof-of-process for compliance. Blockchain could be used to keep track of the steps required by regulation. Recording actions and their outputs immutably in a blockchain would create an audit trail for regulators to verify compliance. For example, based in Bengaluru, Signzy Technologies offers digital trust solutions based on blockchain and AI, aiming to simplify and secure digital regulatory processes. 1.6K",2021-03-07T01:43:53.818Z,"What is most fascinating about blockchain?

The most accurate description of Blockchain is “Blockchain is a solution looking for a problem”. Blockchain is claiming to solve this or do this or the other, when in nearly every case there is little benefit in using Blockchain and there wasn’t really any issue to resolve. Why would a secure (at a low level only), slow, encrypted log file, be a “game changer” for the industry. For most applications, Blockchain is not a useful tool to work with, its too impractical. Blockchain is slow, due to the heavy nature of trying to copy data to multiple databases and heavy cryptography, it will always be slower than a central DB or even a normal decentralised DB. Blockchain can’t be read like a Database, it can’t make joins, you can search on a field, its completely useless at this at efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Large amounts of applications in the real world, need to be fast. Interaction with the user and efficient batch processes, need to be quick. This eliminates Blockchain from a lot of areas of computing. Blockchain is immutable, in some cases this is a benefit, in others, this is a hinderance. Making a mistake, means that mistake remains. It’s very hard to fix incorrect data. Blockchain, is a very trustworthy way of storing data, but it doesn’t eliminate the most common cause of data corruption or hacking, it’s the programs/apps that write the data and read the data that can be hacked and Blockchain isn’t going to fix that. Blockchain data needs to be exported into a central DB to be useful, so again, defeats the purpose of BC. In most common processes: Application → DB → Application/Reporting/Export In Blockchain: Application -> DB -> Blockchain ->DB -> Application/Reporting/Export Where is Blockchain adding value here? Decentralisation is nice, in the fact, it’s not owned by a central entity, but that means you must trust multiple people with that data. Would you trust everyone with your data? You will probably have higher costs, due to multiple data infrastructures needed and Blockchain replicates the entire DB every time, which is massively inefficient. Most Blockchain experiments seem to be by big business, which means they will own the Blockchain data in full, which effectively defeats the point of Blockchain. A normal DB, can be read-only, distributed, replicated and can be very secure, so it’s not like there is a desperate need for this technology. Databases aren’t normally hacked, corrupted or manipulated at the DB level, they are very secure, so there isn’t really a great problem that needs addressing here. Hacking is mostly done by identifying vulnerabilities at a higher level, again, something Blockchain, doesn’t really address. If you wanted more independent transparent process, there are other ways to address this demand. You can encrypt data in a normal DB, you can distribute, audit and validate data in multiple, efficient ways. You can already communicate data efficiently between different systems/entities with API’s, XML, JSON, EDIFACT, etc. I think Blockchain has some merit and it will find its niche, but it isn’t some panacea solution to all the world’s problems. It’s just completely impractical in most real-world situations. I think at least it gets people thinking in a different way. Hopefully it will evolve into a better, faster solution that is practical.

A blockchain is a continuously increasing group of records (blocks), which are connected together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, all the way down to the original block that was mined on the network. They also contain a timestamp of when the block was created and transactional data. Due to its design, a blockchain is resistant to retroactive attempts to modify its data. It is a distributed ledger, which is operated on a peer-to-peer network which will generally, collectively adhere to coded rules and regulations for nodal communication and the verification of new blocks. Once information has been recorded on the blockchain, the data on that block cannot be altered, without every single subsequent block being amended also. This requires an overall consensus from other users of the blockchain. Despite the fact that blockchains can be altered in theory, they can be classified as secure by design and are an example of a distributed network that has high Byzantine fault tolerance. Due to this, a decentralized consensus has been achieved by using blockchain technology. The first blockchain was created by an entity called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, to act as the ledger of transactions for the cryptocurrency, bitcoin. Nakamoto’s creation of blockchain had solved a long-standing digital currency problem of double-spending, without the use of a network administrator or a centralized server. Blockchain platforms which are accessible to the public are the main platform for cryptocurrencies. There have also been suggestions that private blockchains could be effectively utilized by businesses. Blockchain can also be used to generate smart contracts that could be either fully, or, slightly completed and enforced without the requirement of human interaction. The main goal of smart contracts is to create a system where escrow can be automated. Despite there being a lot of positives to smart contracts, we have yet to see any viable systems emerge for this type of use. Many organizations that form part of the banking and financial industries are also beginning to implement distributed ledgers as part of their operations. The main reason for their interest in this technology is that it can help to speed up administrative functions within the bank and therefore can increase their efficiency and reduce costs. UBS, a well-known world bank has developed research labs that will seek to integrate this technology with their own systems. Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent and completely open public ledger, that can be used to keep track of sales and the use of digital content, so that content creators, such as musicians can be paid more efficiently. IBM has in fact partnered with ASCAP and PRS For Music, to try and develop musical distribution technologies based on blockchain technology. The blockchain is constantly evolving and as more time passes, the technology itself will begin to improve. These improvements will help to revolutionize the industry. There are many who believe that at a certain point in the future, blockchain technology will be widespread across numerous businesses and will be very commonly used by the general public. So, why we even need the coins? A coin is used for the decentralization of data to provide incentive to 3rd parties for verifying information. Without a coin, that would mean that the information is not being confirmed by a 3rd party, but by perhaps a group of trusted individuals. That is not a Blockchain. That would be a shared database, or a permissioned database. I think the main reason we need this kind of tech lay in our independence, we don't need banks or any 3party that will still our money, everything is written and cannot be corrupted, it can solve so many problems, transaction fees, convert funds, speed, reliability. This is how our future is going to look like, its only a matter of time.

60443071ed76476feda3d902,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-blockchain-hash?-,"A hash is a function that is created using an algorithm and is essential to blockchain management in cryptocurrency. A hash is sensitive. A hash is a function that converts an input of numbers and letters into an encrypted output of fixed length. Hashing involves processing the data from a block with the help of a mathematical function that results in an output of a fixed length. Solving a hash in a blockchain refers to solving a complex mathematical problem. It starts with the data available in the block header. In a blockchain, hashes are used to denote the current state of the world, or more precisely, the state of a blockchain. Miners in a blockchain must solve the target hash to add to a blockchain. Solving or meeting a hash uses an algorithm. This algorithm relies on the data from the block header. Each block header contains a timestamp (this denotes the time taken for each transaction on the blockchain), version number, the hash of the previous block, the hash of the Merkle root, the nonce (it stands for ‘number used only once’), and the target hash. A merkle root is the hash of all hashes of all transactions that are part of a block in a blockchain. Hashing helps secure data as it provides a certainty that the data in a blockchain has not been tampered with. Anyone who tries to decrypt the data by looking at the hash cannot work out the length of the encrypted information based on the hash. Hashing is a major function that helps root the integrity and reliability of a blockchain.",2021-03-07T01:46:25.634Z,"What is a blockchain hash? ",Quora

It is a digital asset which works as a medium of exchange using strong cryptography to secure financial transactions and verify the transfer of assets.The cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.Bitcoin was the first decentralized crypto-currency and it is a form of electronic cash.Now blockchain can succeed without bitcoin as the bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries and hence the Bitcoin uses the blockchain technology for transactions. But if there are no bitcoins the blockchain can still function as bitcoin is dependent on blockchain. Because of the recent fluctuations of bitcoin prices there have been doughts regarding the use of bitcoin by many.Though, Blockhain has many more uses. In the Indian government, for example, blockchain technology has many use cases where the technology can help achieve better efficiency and transparency, which don’t at all have anything to do with cryptocurrencies.The blockchain technology has enabled the use of many solutions which include a distributed ledger protocol for financial institutions, benefit distribution program for government bodies, Darwinsurance for Insurance settlement; Genuinity, an anti-counterfeiting program for supply chain and Reservoir, which addresses issues of products availability.The crytocurrencies have been a very important part in the history of blockchain because of the popularity it gained through bitcoins.Hence if not for the cryptocurrency -bitcoin the ongoing blockchain involvement and its development throughout the various industries and sectors like supply chain management , logistics, finance, Medicine,etc would not have been popularized and sparked the interest among the people and organisations.As many people have the notion that bitcoin and blockchain are synonymous or the same, it is not the case.Bitcoin is a digital currency system which is based on the blockchain technology.Blockchain technology is already being implemented in many places used by organisations for storage,etcOver the next couple of years we will be able to explore the field even more.Hence with the growth in this sector the need for professionals have been a must in the industry. A career in the field will be a major success as the growth is unprecedented and you can easily pursue a career in this field by pursuing a post graduate course online for it from platforms like upgrad or if you are a curious learner by pursuing a free online course which can help you learn more about the field.To conclude, The blockchain has grown bigger and better and the interest has shifted from digital currencies to this new blockchain technology, which clearly shows the technology will have a vast role to play in the future.

These solutions ensure that the owner of the cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets is the only entity who can access the funds by requiring elaborate passwords and other security measures. Users can view or access cryptocurrency wallets from smartphones and computers. Cryptocurrency wallets do not physically store the blockchain assets; instead, the wallets store public and private keys. Public keys are segments of digital code that are attached to a decentralized blockchain, almost like a bank account number. Private keys are also pieces of digital code, but are unique to an individual’s cryptocurrency wallet, similar to an ATM PIN code. Private keys match and prove ownership of public keys. Owners use their private keys to conduct all transactions with the cryptocurrency that they own. Cryptocurrency wallets can be utilized by businesses accepting payments through cryptocurrency payment gateways to securely store or exchange blockchain assets. To qualify for inclusion in the Cryptocurrency Wallet category, a product must: Allow users to store private keys associated with a blockchain ledger Provide a way to interface with said blockchains to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies, as well as monitor balances Offer security measures to ensure private keys are only accessed by owners of the blockchain assets Top 8 Cryptocurrency Wallets Coinbase WalletExodusMyEtherWalletBitGo Cryptocurrency WalletJaxxBitcoin Core ClientElectrum WalletBlockchainThe funny thing is even though i know all these wallets as the best i personally don’t save my cryptocurrency in any, why would i, when i can make double on all my investments at www.coinharbor.tech in a week, i basically started with 1btc and i have 8 btc right now and 2.5 ethereum, They’re the most trustworhty organization i know, and all my investments with them have been paid on time.",2021-03-07T01:47:36.756Z,"What are the best cryptocurrency wallets for 2021?

Internally, there is a need for a policy to ensure on the one hand security and safety of the technologies in use and on the other hand maximum effectiveness of technologies in development to improve the business model. Externally, managers should think about technology policy as well. Governments are by default late with regulating technology. This, because they first need to understand the implications of e.g. blockchain. Managers have - within ethical limits - a free hand during the regulation-free time but this does not last. Managers should help at an early stage to craft policies so that regulation will allow innovation to continue, without creating unwanted consequences for society and the environment. Technology policy can also be interesting from a funding perspective. Certain technological developments were and will be funded by the state, e.g. the internet. The reason can be competitiveness on the global market, a targeted technology shift in the economy or the execution of a strategy, e.g. the transition to renewable energy.

The technology supports cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and the transfer of any data or digital asset. Spearheaded by Bitcoin, blockchains achieve consensus among distributed nodes, allowing the transfer of digital goods without the need for centralized authorisation of transactions. The present blockchain ecosystem is like the early Internet, a permissionless innovation environment in which email, the World Wide Web, Napster, Skype, and Uber were built. The technology allows transactions to be simultaneously anonymous and secure, peer-to-peer, instant and frictionless. It does this by distributing trust from powerful intermediaries to a large global network, which through mass collaboration, clever code and cryptography, enables a tamper-proof public ledger of every transaction that’s ever happened on the network.A block is the “current” part of a blockchain which records some or all of the recent transactions, and once completed, goes into the blockchain as permanent database. Each time a block gets completed, a new block is generated. Blocks are linked to each other (like a chain) in proper linear, chronological order with every block containing a hash of the previous block.How is it different from current payment systems? Blockchain technology allows for instant recognition of the exact size of the block by all transacting parties in the chain since the block is simultaneously updated on all their databases, and has unique security features that do not allow tampering with the definition of the block. In addition, each block’s movements across the chain have the ability to be verified by all parties in the chain since the block carries with it the digital imprint, or ‘signature’, of wherever it has been.Therefore it creates instant trust without having to rely on a series of trustworthy banks to clear cheques. Here, various parties transacting regard their reputation as being more important than reneging on it. Unlike traditional banking system, cash transactions here are undertaken immediately.Benefits of blockchain technology: As a public ledger system, blockchain records and validate each and every transaction made, which makes it secure and reliable.All the transactions made are authorized by miners, which makes the transactions immutable and prevent it from the threat of hacking.Blockchain technology discards the need of any third-party or central authority for peer-to-peer transactions.It allows decentralization of the technology.Some telecom firms in places such as India and Kenya are already using their networks to help people settle cash transactions, but these are proprietary and meant largely for poor and underbanked areas with considerable mobile penetration.Concerns associated: Blockchain is still a (relatively) new technology and is not without its problems. For a start, there are ongoing concerns about privacy in the settlement and storage of securities – blockchain providers are working hard to address.Banks are also at threat with blockchain, since more and more firms (using their IT service providers from India and elsewhere) will build systems that can create and exchange ‘blocks’ with one another completely legally, without ever having to use the banks as a financial intermediary.Applications of this technology: There are applications for blockchain outside financial services as well. A ‘block’ could be defined as anything—a unit of services, products, raw materials—the list is endless. Continue Reading",2021-03-07T01:49:20.183Z,"What is a blockchain? ",Quora

If you give it the same input, it always produces the same result. Hash functions come in three more or less distinct varieties. One is a hash function for a hash table. We want to take some key, and hash it to get a position in the hash table where we’d store data with that key. In this case, the primary emphasis is on speed—we want to be able to store and retrieve data quickly, and we have to has the key to store/retrieve the data, so we want to hash as quickly as possible. For this purpose,  Continue ReadingA typical hash function takes some input of arbitrary size, and produces a result of some fixed size. If you give it the same input, it always produces the same result. Hash functions come in three more or less distinct varieties. One is a hash function for a hash table. We want to take some key, and hash it to get a position in the hash table where we’d store data with that key. In this case, the primary emphasis is on speed—we want to be able to store and retrieve data quickly, and we have to has the key to store/retrieve the data, so we want to hash as quickly as possible. For this purpose, we typically use a very simple hash function—often as simple as adding one byte of key at a time to the existing hash, rotate the hash value some amount, and repeat until we’ve hashed the whole key. The second common type of hash is something like a CRC. This is typically used for things like giving a reasonable degree of assurance that data you’ve transmitted arrives intact. For example, when you send data via TCP, the TCP stack does a CRC on the data, and sends that CRC along with the data. The receiver re-computes the CRC on the data it receives, and compares it to the CRC that was sent. If they don’t match, it asks for the sender to re-send that packet, because something was corrupted in the transmission. Here we’re typically willing to spend somewhat more effort on the hash function to get a better assurance that the result is intact. Given a specific amount of data and size of CRC, we can compute specific probabilities, so we have a 100% chance of catching any single-bit error in the data, 99% chance of a two-bit error, etc. The third class of hash functions are cryptographic hashes. One intent of a cryptographic hash (that’s different from the previous two) is that we want to make it as hard as possible to find a relationship between the input and the output. For example, with a hash function for a hash table, if I have one string that gives a hash of 1234, it’s typically pretty easy for me to find another string that will also give a hash of 1234. In hashing, that’s called a collision. It’s also typically fairly easy for me to design a string to produce a specified value of hash, of any of a number of specified values that fit some particular pattern. With a cryptographic hash, what I want to make both of those as difficult as possible. Blockchain Next, let’s consider a blockchain. How do we use that cryptographic hashing to produce a block chain? Let’s consider nearly the simplest possible block chain. We’ll do a single SHA-256 hash of an arbitrary string to get a result. For the sake of argument, I’m going to use “Cryptocurrency” as the starting point. That gives a hash of: 6ec60fe3-9028887e-7fe9c4b0-25545748-953c2751-5073bf9a-d17ceb54-17a407d7 So, that’s the beginning of our chain. Now for the sake of argument, let’s assume I want to store a list of names of people in the block chain. So I add my name to that to get: 6ec60fe3-9028887e-7fe9c4b0-25545748-953c2751-5073bf9a-d17ceb54-17a407d7-”Jerry Coffin” Then I hash that to get: b5771614-369c3317-06dc595e-9b9d8a22-dd9c8a7d-8e53bc6e-99373386-35e3a135 I can then publish that hash. By itself, the hash is little more than a big number. It’s a one-way function. It’s easy for me to prove that adding my name produces the right result, but hard for anybody else to guess the name necessary to get that result. Then if I want to add “Joe Blow” to the list, I take the previous hash, append “Joe Blow”, to get: b5771614-369c3317-06dc595e-9b9d8a22-dd9c8a7d-8e53bc6e-99373386-35e3a135-”Joe Blow” Then I hash that to get: fbf6255b-a72f2007-86ce1efb-7dbda43a-6a435bfa-ff6a2fd7-8dd8e075-e26c49ae Even though this is pretty much the simplest possible block-chain, it still records some marginally interesting data. In particular, it records not only the list of names, but the order in which they were added—once I’ve added my name to the list, every single name that gets added afterwards depends on my name having been there, and provides proof that my name was there way back at the beginning of the chain. Obviously, however, using names is pretty arbitrary. I can take almost any data I want to and do the same thing with it. So, we can keep the data itself private, but publish proof that the data existed at some particular time (at the very least, time relative to the other “stuff” that was published in the chain—that is, if it is based on X, it has to post-date X, an if Y is based on our data, it has to predate Y. Let’s circle back to the problem of anonymity for a minute though. Given the number of people named “John Smith” or “Bill Johnson”, it would be pretty easy to take a starting hash, add a common name to it, and see if you get the right result—given how common some names are, you’d succeed a fair amount of the time. To combat that, you’ll normally append some more or less random data to the data you really care about. Even if you append only a couple of bytes (16 bits) of data, somebody who wants to find your name in the list has to try your name with each of 65536 different random values added to verify whether your name is present. Increase that to 4 bytes, and they have to try over 4 billion different combinations. So, you rarely store just the data by itself—you add at least a little extra data to make it impractical for anybody else to guess the right data to verify what’s present. Currency That does get us to the point that (I think) we’re ready to talk about actual cryptocurrency. Most people think primarily in terms of the data itself. Bitcoins and bitcoin mining. In reality, that’s a fairly simple part of a cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin, you’re looking for a piece of data that produces a hash with a specified number of leading zeros (18, the last time I noticed, but may be higher than that now—and if it’s not yet, it eventually will be). The trick there is fairly simple: since each digit is essentially random, you have to hash about 10 strings to find a string with one leading zero, about 100 strings to find a hash with two leading zeros, and (for what matters today) about 10181018 strings to find one with 18 leading zeros. So that’s why people have giant racks of machines with ASICs or GPUs running around the clock for months on end—finding strings that produce hashes with the right pattern. By itself, that’s not really much. You need the whole blockchain infrastructure to make if mean much. And although the blockchain I’ve outlined above may not seem complex, that’s because it’s strictly a trivial sketch of the basic idea of how a blockchain could work—to be reasonably complete and usable, you need to support things like lots of machines with distributed storage, to give a solid assurance that when a transaction is recorded to the blockchain, it won’t disappear a moment later because somebody’s hard drive had a hiccup (or similar). A typical hash function takes some input of arbitrary size, and produces a result of some fixed size. If you give it the same input, it always produces the same result. Hash functions come in three more or less distinct varieties. One is a hash function for a hash table. We want to take some key, and hash it to get a position in the hash table where we’d store data with that key.

The technology that once evolved in the year 2009 as the underlying platform for Bitcoin exchange has now evolved into a mainstream technology.

Since the businesses have started to explore the capability of blockchain by building blockchain applications, the demand for the blockchain development platform is also off the charts. The growth of dApp development is also another reason that the number of blockchain platforms is increasing day by day. Before we dive into the best development platforms it is first important to know what a blockchain platform is? Blockchain platforms allow the development of blockchain-based applications. They can either be permissioned or permissionless. Ethereum, Hyperledger, and some others have built blockchain frameworks, allowing people to develop and host applications on the blockchain. Before you decide to move to use Blockchain, it becomes imperative to understand, what are the different aspects of the Blockchain platform that you are considering. Here are some of the parameters that you need to look at: Kind of network, Language used, Popularity, Activity, Pricing, and the consensus mechanism once you have found a platform matching all your requirements, you can go ahead with it. However, I would suggest some best development platforms for blockchain technology that I like… Ethereum Many individuals refer to Ethereum as an alt-coin or another form of cryptocurrency, aside from Bitcoin. However, Ethereum is also a blockchain platform. Since 2013, Ethereum has offered developers an open-source distributed computing platform where they can discover all the benefits of blockchain. IBM Blockchain- Visionary companies across the globe are using IBM's popular and exciting blockchain platform, which offers more transparent environments for company operations. IOTA -Despite being one of the younger blockchain environments in the market today, IOTA is easily one of the most exciting. IOTA took to the blockchain landscape with a mission to fundamentally change the way that people access distributed ledger technology. OpenChain it is a public blockchain platform developed by Coinprism. This powerful environment helps companies create a fantastic system for experimentation. Anyone can spin up a new instance of blockchain on the environment within seconds. Additionally, end-users can exchange values on the ledger according to rules identified by the administrator of the blockchain.

Initially, I ignored it because I thought it was another spammy blockchain project that didn’t bring anything to the community. Then I started hearing about it again. So I had to read about it: People are using blockchain projects as alternative banking products efficiently, placing real money on protocols such as Compound and seeing it grow every day. No need for banks, no need for intermediaries. That kinda surprised me. I didn’t expect to see billions of dollars worth of crypto stored in a few Smart Contracts. But yet it was true. A new era just started. An era where blockchain technology is starting to make sense for the general public as not just a transfer of value, but a valid alternative to tranditional banks. Just take a second to understand the impact of that. Banks are being replaced. Every. Single. Bank. Will disappear sooner or later because they are being improved and replaced with blockchain. Why? It’s simple. We realized it’s kinda stupid to base our entire society on a single system that is pretty much forcing us to give our money to banks to interact digitally and expect them to safely guard it while they devaluate it by printing more. Most of our modern society is based on the internet. Many money transfers are done online. However banks are the gateways to use money online, if they don’t want you to have a bank account they can deny it and you won’t be able to buy stuff or earn money online. Which is a massive disadvatage in our current economy. On the other hand, here’s how banks affect your money when they generate more dollars: Every new dollar printed is increasing the total supply of money. If you own 10,000 dollars and the total supply is 1 million dollars, you’re quite rich because you have a 1% of the total supply of money. In fact you’d be the richest man in the planet if that supply existed. Printing money makes your dollars worth less and less when new money is created. Don’t believe me? Some sources say that the total supply of the US dollar is about $10.5 trillion dollars. Assuming Bill Gates has around $100 billion dollars in total, he’s owning the 1% of the total supply. Gates is quite rich don’t you think? He’s the richest man in the planet. That’s why your net worth is highly dependant on how much money is out there, on the total supply. That’s why we shouldn’t allow banks to print more money under any circumstances. The total supply should never be modified to not devaulate your money. Banks didn’t agree with that premise so they went ahead and printed as much money as they wanted whenever they pleased and distributed it however they saw fit. Yes, they got rules and limitations but they can break them as easily as they can create them. Who rules the ruler? Nobody. That’s what we got for placing our trust in one single big institution that controls most of our society. The blockchain is here to change that. It’s already happening. People are using more and more decentralized finance products such as lending. With stablecoins as intermediaries to the current economy. At least until people use Bitcoin as the main currency for their purchases or until a currency is created to become the standard. DAI comes to mind. So to your question “how is blockchain technology going to change the world?” my answer is: it’s already happening, banks are being replaced and entire societies will be created based on this new dynamic.",2021-03-07T01:53:25.965Z,"How is blockchain technology going to change the world?

In Bermuda in particular, we are seeing a national push to become a world leader in technology and innovation. Firstly I will recommend Allcoinhodler Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.allcoinhodler,com) as it is relatively new (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 4 billion dollars) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support. We are hearing more and more about fintech, virtual tokens, digital assets, cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and initial coin offerings. Each of these concepts rely on blockchain technology which has been increasingly highlighted in the mainstream media as a revolutionary technology that promises efficiency and is shaking up the status quo, although it isn’t quite a household buzzword. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency with mass appeal and is what many people automatically think of when the topic of blockchain or fintech comes up. However, although bitcoin has continued to grab headlines, there is a much bigger picture here and there are many other uses for blockchain apart from cryptocurrencies. Blockchain has the potential to influence every aspect of the global economy and its applications are already developing faster than most governments or regulators can, or have been willing to, grapple with; although Bermuda has already impressively made significant legislative and regulatory advances garnering international attention. We all conduct our lives increasingly online — online banking, shopping, apps, social media, and online services. The execution of core functions of governments and economies are also increasingly on the internet. Most of us now have some sort of digital presence and all our online activities require the sending of information back and forth. Blockchain is expected to impact the way payments, transactions and record keeping are handled in the future, and affect various other aspects of our daily lives, as well as the way that large organisations, financial institutions, and governments are run. Transactions are at the heart of any blockchain in that an interaction with the blockchain involves the execution of transactions. The blockchain decentralised ledger keeps a record of all verified transactions and the transactions are organised into chunks of data called “blocks” that are irreversibly linked to one another — forming a “block chain”. Once a block is formed in the chain it cannot be reversed and is therefore immutable. Decentralisation, immutability, and transparency are key elements of blockchain. We can take ethereum as an example. The ethereum platform is developed by the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, which has advanced the concept of blockchain technology beyond currency applications. Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based platform that runs smart contracts to carry out transactions. Smart contracts are self-operating computer codes or programs that automatically execute when specific conditions are met and hence do not require third-party involvement. The fact that such technology cuts out the need for third parties means that third-party risk and costs are cut out of transactions. It also means that no one organisation controls the data. Developers around the world can use ethereum to build and deploy their own decentralised applications based on the ethereum blockchain. Etherscan is a “search engine” that allows users to easily lookup, confirm and validate transactions that have taken place on the ethereum blockchain. Hence, we have a large-scale tool for ensuring there is transparency with the technology. No company owns ethereum, and there is no one person, executive or even a board of directors making decisions, which is truly remarkable. It has been noted that ethereum is, in fact, more like a democracy than any private corporation could ever be. People around the world can join the ethereum community and participate in the future of ethereum, enhancing its integrity and minimising the risk of corruption. Blockchain technology creates a decentralised digital public record of transactions that is secure, tamper-proof, and unchangeable. Don Tapscott has an excellent Ted talk on blockchain and as he put it: “So for the first time now in human history, people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer. And trust is established, not by some big institution, but by collaboration, by cryptography and by some clever code.” A truly exciting aspect of blockchain is that it can potentially apply to any industry where information is transferred, or records must be kept — from insurance to commodities to healthcare. We are seeing major industries joining in the blockchain movement. The multitrillion-dollar commodity trading industry is currently looking at the potential of using blockchain technology to track and document the buying, selling and movement of goods. The tracking of cargo through various ports and jurisdictions has traditionally been challenging for the industry, making fraudulent activities difficult to detect — an issue that can be addressed by using blockchain technology to track and trace commodities. Energy companies BP and Royal Dutch Shell are among a consortium that is developing a blockchain-based digital platform for energy commodities trading. Behemoths like JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway, and Apple have all expressed interest in blockchain technology and undertaken various blockchain exploratory projects. The list of companies and industries looking to blockchain to provide solutions and create more efficient systems continues to multiply. Blockchain can also help prevent corruption in government. The implementation of systems of monitoring government spending, property registry and digital documents of citizens on the blockchain are all potential ways of ensuring governmental transparency and cutting back on corruption. If every piece of property in a country is accounted for on an immutable blockchain registry, then governments or big corporations could not as easily take land from someone just because a person did not have certain documentation to prove ownership. The risk of ‘land grabs’ potentially exists in any country, no matter how developed, and indeed occurred recently in the United States in relation to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock which was an act of land seizure that arguably occurred because of technicalities and confusion of property ownership in the United States. Of course, all of this is not to downplay the risks that exist in relation to blockchain or other technological developments more generally. There are always risks that need to be considered and mitigated. Poor management, problems with the technology, personnel vulnerabilities and mistakes in programming could create a range of potentially serious issues. Blockchain is not a panacea. However, when the right legislation and regulations are put into place, when the technology is used correctly, and when the right players are involved, these are powerful tools. Interestingly, VoIP (or Voice over Internet Protocol, such as Skype) used to be considered quite risky although it is now a mainstay of the worldwide telecommunications industry. Whatever its future, the success of any blockchain project requires the appropriate management of risk regardless of the continuing maturity of blockchain technology and increased cross-industry awareness. Don Tapscott summarised the potential power of blockchain quite aptly when he said “ … the technology genie has escaped from the bottle, and it was summoned by an unknown person or persons at this uncertain time in human history, and it’s giving us another kick at the can, another opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid and the old order of things, and solve some of the world’s most difficult problems, if we will it”. The potential applications of blockchain technology are growing exponentially because almost anything involving transactions or digital assets can be put on a blockchain. Our digital lives will likely develop to rely on blockchain technology without many of us even being fully aware of it. We are experiencing the evolution of how we do business and interact with each other.",2021-03-07T01:53:42.374Z,"What should be the new application for a blockchain in the nearer future? ",Quora

I mean what's the point in all the fancy code if there's no chance it will scale to support millions (billions?) of users simultaneously. In my view we're still at a stage, much like in the early days of the internet, were the discussion is mostly driven by academics, scientists, network architects and computer programmers. We need to move beyond talking about low level and often abstract concepts if we want a wider audience to understand what Blockchain is really about. Consumer facing applications that remove any need to become educated about the tech is where we need to be. Granted, there was a bit of a learning curve when people started using the internet for the first time, have a look at this classic clip from the today show and you'll get my point.  1994: ""Today Show"": ""What is the Internet, Anyway?"" It took a while for people to get used to new behaviours that where introduced with the internet and it's going to take time for people to get used to new behaviours introduced with Blockchain. When we first started using the internet we had to learn new things like setting up a home router, creating an email address, finding things online and using hashtags. The same analogies can be made with Blockchain. People will need to learn about using wallets, securing private keys and interacting with smart contracts. Given that we still have scaling issues with current Blockchain protocols and most people are not tech savy enough to use even the simplest defi apps plus there is a ton of bad press propagandising people into believing blockchain is used by criminals - I'd say we still have a long way to go before we see true mass adoption.

Waltonchain Waltonchain was the first project to be launch in the sphere of supply chain management that combines the best of both physical and digital world to create an efficient system. It uses RFID chips for IoT and combines it with the power of blockchain to achieve: Data Integrity for fair auditsAuthenticitySecurityTraceabilityIt provides a parent and child chain structure to connect various industries as per their needs. These chains are fueled by Waltonchain coin (WTC). They have already partnered with 6 big companies in this way. And the good thing is that they have their own chip technology, manufacturing which makes them independent in this competitive world. They are also moving into the future with an eye on efficient management, smart agriculture, smart medical care, smart food traceability, and smart art industry. I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively new (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 1.2 billion dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after 10 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that it has a really nice UI and support. 2. Ambrosus – Food & Medicine Supply Chain Ambrosus also started in late 2017 after Waltonchain to secure and make efficient another aspect of the market with an efficient supply chain via blockchain. Ambrosus protocol combines high-tech sensors, blockchain tech, and smart contracts to create a universally trusted, verifiable, and community-driven system to assure the quality, safety & origins of food and medicinal products. All of this happens via Ambrosus protocol that is fueled by its native token, Amber (AMB) which interacts with smart contracts too. 3. Modum – Pharma Supply Chain Modum is another supply chain management solution on the blockchain designed specifically for the pharma industry. Modum is based in Switzerland and combines IoT sensors with blockchain technology for providing data integrity for transactions involving physical medicinal products. This can hugely eliminate the problems of contract management, safety, and audit which is very much needed for pharma products. The Modum sensors record environmental conditions that goods are subject to while in transit. When the goods change ownership, the sensor data is verified against predetermined conditions in a smart contract in the blockchain. The contract validates that the conditions meet all of the requirements set out by the sender, their clients, or a regulator and triggers various actions: notifications to sender and receiver, payment, or release of goods. And this all is fueled by Modum token on the Modum blockchain. 4. VeChain VeChain is another supply chain management blockchain that provides huge opportunities to improve the supply chain management lifecycle in many ways. But the good thing about this VeChain platform is that it doesn’t restrict itself to one particular sector. The VeChain blockchain can have many use cases across the following industries: Cold-Chain LogisticsAutomobilesMedical & HealthcareLuxury & FashionLiquorAgricultureLogisticsAgain, it is powered by IoT chips, sensors, and blockchain tech to provide seamless integration of different business on the blockchain for SCM. One thing that I like about them is that they are quite unique and aggressive in pulling out huge partnerships with the likes of PwC.",2021-03-07T01:59:14.659Z,"How do I get cryptocurrency-based projects?

Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support. Though U.S. regulators have rejected ETFs based on bitcoins, they have approved blockchain-based ETFs, paving the way for the launch of ETFs based on the underlying technology. Canadian regulators have also approved the country’s first blockchain ETF called Blockchain Technologies ETF (HBLK), which was launched in early February 2018. (See also: SEC Denies Winklevoss Twins' Bid to Launch Bitcoin ETF.) Two recently launched blockchain ETFs in the United States include the Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN) ETF and the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK) ETF, which have managed to collect $240 million worth of investments in a week, which is a remarkable feat for new launches. This article examines blockchain ETFs, how they work, where they invest, the underlying methodology they follow, and the inherent risks. Blockchain PotentialWhile the blockchain-based monetary system, like bitcoin, is under review by different regulators across the globe, the underlying concept of blockchain has seen high adaptability and potential. Beyond cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is finding increasing use in various other sectors, that include services, supply chain management, digital apps development, digital entertainment industry, biotechnology and even agriculture. This has caused a lot of technology companies to embrace the blockchain technology for developing new systems, and also explore possibilities of porting the existing systems to blockchain base for enhanced efficiency and improved utilization. As per BLCN ETF's factsheet, blockchain has the potential to save infrastructure costs for banks in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion by 2022. Moreover, around 10% of the global GDP is expected to be stored on blockchain platforms. Investments in Blockchain SubsectorInvestors are opening up to the idea of investing in blockchain, which is emerging as a specialized sub-sector that sometimes gets classified under the technology sector, and sometimes under the finance sector. These investments can be made through various means. For instance, one can directly purchase virtual currencies belonging to various blockchain-based systems, like the ether token on Ethereum. However, that can be a complex affair for the common investor, and also carries inherent risk of losses should that particular blockchain system fail. (See also, An Introduction to Ethereum Classic.) An easy approach is to invest in shares of listed companies that are working in the blockchain space. For instance, if IBM is making significant progress in developing blockchain-based systems and gaining revenues from it, their shareholders can expect to benefit from increased returns on IBM stock. However, this approach also carries stock-specific risk. (For more, see IBM Could Ride Blockchain Craze to New Highs.) Blockchain ETFsEnter blockchain ETFs, which offer an efficient investment vehicle to invest in a select basket of blockchain-specific stocks. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, offers dual benefits – it offers diversification by spreading money across multiple stocks like a mutual fund, and live real-time trading opportunities like a stock that changes with every tick, allowing intraday trading opportunities to active traders. Such blockchain ETFs track the performance of an underlying index which acts as a benchmark. Underlying Index and MethodologyLet’s examiner the underlying index and methodology behind the working of an ETF with an example. The BLCN ETF is a passively managed ETF that attempts to track the performance of a specially designed index called the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index. This index is comprised of companies which are involved in research, development, support, or utilization of the blockchain technology and associated businesses. The index methodology assigns a “Blockchain Score” to each potential company stock that may be an eligible candidate for inclusion in this index. This score is based on several factors about how the business of the company is contributing to the blockchain ecosystem, its blockchain product maturity and associated economic impact, investments and expenditure on research and development activities, company results, and innovations. This factor-based methodology ensures that the potential of a blockchain company and its business is gauged with higher accuracy for realistic economic profits, renovated business prospects, and operational competence. The 50 to 100 companies with the top Blockchain Scores qualify for entry in this index, and the same stocks get replicated in the BLCN ETF. The index is rebalanced every six months. On the other hand, the BLOK ETF is an actively managed ETF which aims to invest in global companies that are deriving significant income from transformational data sharing-related business, or are engaged in the research and development, proof-of-concept testing, and/or implementation of similar technology. Industry and Regional CoverageFor both the BLCN and BLOK ETFs, global companies from a wide range of industry sectors are open for investments. They include companies from the banking and financial sector, technology, IT services, hardware, internet, telecom services, and even biotechnology which may be using some form of data sharing or blockchain-based systems. (See also: Can Blockchain Make Medications Cheaper and Safer?) For instance, the BLCN ETF is holding companies like Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO), Intel Corp (INTC), Overstock.com Inc (OSTK), Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Barclays PLC (BCS), while the BLOK ETF's holdings include Taiwan Semiconductor Co (TSM), NVidia Corp (NVDA), IBM Corp (IBM), Overstock.com Inc. and GMO Internet Inc. As blockchain technology remains open and global, companies from across the world are included in these ETFs. Regionally, both ETFs have the bulk of exposure to North America-based blockchain companies, while the rest is shared by Asian and European companies in varying proportions. Blockchain ETF RisksNo investment comes risk-free, and the same is true for blockchain ETFs. Being a theme-based investment, blockchain ETFs carry the inherent risk of non-performance, non-adaptability, or failure of blockchain ecosystem. While there is an increasing level of acceptance for blockchain systems, the concept is still in a nascent stage and remains dependent on the evolution of the overall ecosystem, the reliability and stability of the blockchain network, its configuration, and its successful adoption. Another inherent risk is that one may end up betting a significant portion of money on technology-based startups which are prone to failure. While the diversification through ETFs mitigates such stock-specific risk to a good extent, the risk of certain holdings not performing well remains nevertheless. Additionally, there is a mixed bag in the top holding companies of such ETFs, which have a big overlap with existing technology and internet companies. For example, although Microsoft and IBM are among the top holdings for both BLCN and BLOK, they are essentially technology companies deriving a larger share of their revenues from non-blockchain based products and services. Similarly, Cisco and Intel are primarily hardware components companies which derive most of their revenues from networking equipments and computer processors, while having a limited share from hardware that is used in blockchain-based systems. Blockchain segments may be contributing only a small part of overall revenues to such stocks, making the overall returns vulnerable to the non-performance of their majority non-blockchain segments.

Ethereum is a platform and ether is the currency based on this platform. Since Ethereum is a platform, new applications and currencies can be built on top of it. New currencies can be built on Bitcoin as well, but ethereum was built with the intent of being an almost like an operating system of sorts. Both Ether and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies and are seeing a lot of interest and speculation in recent times which is leading to huge swings in their prices. For instance, Bitcoin was trading at around $8000 in November 2017 and it jumped to around $19000 in December 2017 and again plummeted to around $8000. This has led to many speculators conjecture that some cryptocurrencies are over valued. Currently, Bitcoin is valued at around $8000 and Ether at around $800. In the long term, market corrections will take place and the final valuations would depend on the utility a cryptocurrency produces. The difference in prices of Bitcoin and Ether is due to the late start of Ether, and over valuation of Bitcoin. While Ethereum offers many improvements over Bitcoin, what find most interesting and what should lead to its greater adoption in future is smart contracts. Smart contract eliminates intermediaries and leads to more decentralisation. It also plugs the trust deficit that can result from intermediaries. A smart contract is a self-executing contract that is designed to enforce the terms of an agreement created between two parties. Terms of the contract are recorded in a computer language and are carried out automatically, thus almost eliminating any forgery or scam. For instance, payment would be automatically made once all the terms of the contract are fulfilled. Thus smart contracts reduce cost of transactions by eliminating intermediary fees, reduce chances of scams and leads to more decentralisation. These can be used in all spheres, from buying property to online shopping, from acquisitions to employment etc. Now lets discuss on how freely these currencies can be used. Cryptocurrencies, due to their anonymous nature, can create nightmares for Central banks and intelligence agencies throughout the world. Central banks control the monetary policy of a country by changing the repo rates as it is called in India. But with cryptocurrencies, central banks loose this power and it can’t do much to implement its monetary policy. If more transactions are carried through cryptocurrencies, the effect of repo rate changes won’t trickle down and the ability of the central banks to control inflation and growth through qualitative and quantitative measures would reduce. Even fiscal policy of the governments would be impacted if more people start putting their savings in cryptocurrencies. Moreover, cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous in nature and can’t be tracked by intelligence agencies. These can be used for illegal activities which can have disastrous security implications. So, how freely these currencies can be used in future is still in grey area as countries are skeptical about them. While some countries like South Korea have legalised them, others are still trying to comprehend its implications. Cryptocurrencies are still in the grey area in India. Arun Jaitley, in his 2018 Budget speech said that cryptocurrencies aren’t legal tenders. But nobody stops you from holding cryptocurrencies. Thus, the long term valuations of cryptocurrencies also depend on how freely they are usable which depends on the policies of different governments regarding them. But complete restriction on cryptocurrencies is not possible due to their anonymous nature. There will be cryptocurrencies as long as there is demand. So, governments can restrict cryptocurrencies by reducing this demand. And this can be done by making the fiscal and monetary policy more predictable and objective, and restricting currency devaluations. Having said that cryptocurrency is just the tip of the iceberg. What is interesting is the other applications that the underlying technology i.e. block chain offers.",2021-03-07T02:00:46.845Z,"Is ethereum the next bitcoin? ",Quora

It’s the technology that drives Bitcoin and other alternate currencies that have been making headlines around the world lately. Not a single day goes by without mention of Bitcoin’s wild swings, as cryptocurrencies experience dramatic surges and massive crashes. The era of blockchain and crypto is upon us, and with that comes the buzz, hysteria, and frustration associated with every new tech wonder. There are still many questions surrounding the nascent industry. What does the future of blockchain look like? Will cryptos eventually replace cash or are they just a passing fad? Optimists believe that blockchain technology will rid the world of bureaucracy, corruption, and unfair elections in the near future. There will be no Internet fraudsters and unfulfilled contractual obligations. We will simply forget about all the evil of these days.  We do not know how justified such optimistic forecasts are, so we’ll see the results in the future. At the same time, one thing is clear: the blockchain is a revolutionary, fundamentally different way of storing and transmitting information over the network, which has a lot of options for practical use. If you still do not know what blockchain is and how it works, you are behind the times. It is just lazy ones who never heard about the digital money and applied technologies, so if you are among those who do not know anything about virtual money, we will guide you in the question and explain all the benefits and specs of the digital currency. It is believed that the widespread introduction of blockchain technologies will make the whole world better. Why? Everything is simple – thanks to the decentralization of the blockchain, it is practically impossible to make changes to it. That means that none can crack, forge, or control the system. At the same time, there is no need for intermediaries to complete transactions, no other operations related to the transfer of valuable information are to be done. The information is transmitted via peer-2-peer protocol – from user to user. In addition, each participant has information about other participants, as well as access to the entire history of transactions performed in the system. Not only cash transactions but also any other operations with a risk that one of the parties fails to fulfill certain conditions will protect and secure the blockchain procedure. After falling more than 17% last week, funds in short positions climbed back up 13 percent and all investors at www.primaxxcrypto.tech made 100% profits surge up and keep doubling their investments within each 7 days because it’s encrypted and decentralized by the protection of Blockchain Benefits of the Blockchain Technology Of course, benefits are just obvious. What is more, fields of its use are diverse and numerous: cash transactions;commercial contracts and transactions;purchases of goods and payments for services;transfer of confidential information;insurance;protection and transfer of the ownership;personal data management;archiving of the official documents;intellectual property protection.The system has a lot of advantages – it is decentralized, almost impossible to hack and all the info that is formed into blocks is automatically encrypted. Moreover, the data that arrives in the system cannot be changed retroactively. In theory, it is stored there forever not on servers, but on each computer at the same time. Therefore, if you doubt using digital money and do not believe in the blockchain, we recommend you to give it a try and see how it goes in the future.

You can use AWS as a means for computing infrastructure, but don’t get stuck in their “as a service” blockchain offering. Using a platform like Forma you can create a Kubernetes cluster in your AWS account and with three clicks deploy blockchain nodes there (that can later be migrated to other cloud providers if you wish). Then other members for that network can choose to deploy them either in their own AWS accounts or in other cloud providers like IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Digital Ocean, or even on-premise. This is real multi-cloud for Enterprise Blockchain. Here’s a comparison table so you can better understand how Forma compares to cloud provider “BaaS” offerings: Forma versus IBM Blockchain, AWS, and Azure Blockchain - WorldSibu You still get the best experience (just use a user interface, no scripts) while everybody keeps control over the infrastructure deploying wherever they wish to. The premises behind Forma are: Using cloud providers as infrastructure providers is a great decision. But not getting locked into their offerings.Each participant should have control over where, how, and when to deploy their infrastructure components for a network (nodes, cryptographic materials, etc).You should be able to access everything from the ledger to the private keys.

When we talk about technology we are always present focused, meaning we never look beyond what is available to us. Go back 50 years in time, and you will find people back then never looked to computers beyond mathematical computations and now without computers we can’t sustain. Technologies change and evolve all the time and we always end up changing with them and those who fail to adapt to change are thrown out from the civilization up gradation race. Lets discuss a case study on one of the Blockchain company, Cashaa which is focused towards Fin-tech sector and how a company like Cashaa, by making use of Blockchain can replace the exiting technology of fin-tech sector. Cashaa is next gen digital bank built on blockchain. if you go deep into the history of its inception, you will end up with a name “BTC2BID”. This was the name given to prototype version of Cashaa. This prototype remittance app was used by people to exchange crypto currencies with real cash and this allowed people to buy sell different currencies by eliminating the remittance companies like WesternUnion and MoneyGram completely. This also mean that these people paid zero fees for these. The prototype product of Cashaa was an instant hit and by the time they closed the support for the prototype product, the app had successfully allowed 12500+ traders from 147 countries with 97 different currencies to trade 2100+ bitcoins. With the success of the beta app, the team moved on with full fledged development of Cashaa and by 2016, they had made so much significant progress that they launched the public token sale of CAS Token which is the fuel of Cashaa ecosystem. Now, lets come back to why Cashaa will shatter the traditional Fin-Tech sector. Lets first talk about the current fin-tech sector, specifically the remittance industry. The current remittance industry is dominated by the brick & store companies like Western Union and MoneyGram . Although Banks too have a good share in international money transfers using their SWIFT network, however they are expensive and more time consuming than the companies like WesternUnion. So when you go to a store of WesternUnion to send money to some one sitting in other country, the store executive takes few information about your receiver and once you confirm the amount which you want to send, he gives you a total payable amount including the fees and the forex rate applicable. Usually people here ignore the fees and forex rates as they get to send money to their receiver in less time and within minutes, the reciever can go to a western union store in his country and submit his identity proof and collect the money. There are 2 key problems here. First is that the receiver is bound to go collect the money from a western union store and if there isn’t one near him he has to go find it. Second thing is the forex rate. When you have to send the money you usually don’t care for the forex rate as sending money would be your priority and this is what cashed out by companies like WesternUnion. These companies usually give you a bad forex rate, and its obvious as they want to make profits.They can’t simply rely of fees as there are lot of middle men involved with WesternUnion and majority of the fees goes to these middle men. Now with Cashaa, all of these problems are solved by making use of Blockchain. If you analyze the primary aspect of a remittance company and an end user using the company to send or receive money, it is trust. Now that is the basis of blockchain. Blockchain concept is based on a universal trust concept hence there is zero chance of anything wrong happening with the transaction. Now digging deep into the Cashaa platform, what we see is that when you want to send or receive money using cashaa, Cashaa internally does the following: Your money is first used to buy a stable, extremely less or not volatile crypto currency at that point of time. How it does that? using AIThen it sells the same crypto currency within seconds by matching with a buyer who is willing to buy it using the currency which is required for us, i.e our receivers currency.Now once we have the money converted from one currency to another, Cashaa sends the money to the receivers bank account via MasterCard network. As Master Card is involved here, then you must know that you have to input your receivers debit card number which is of MasterCard typeThat’s it, your money gets credited into your receivers bank account in as low as 30 minutes.Now compare this with the traditional remittance companies, Cashaa has no middle men, so no need of Cashaa to charge extraordinary fees. The only fee which is charged is while initiating the transfer to the sender and that to it is minimal charged in the form of CAS token. Since the currency exchange is happening over crypto, you will get the best forex rate, better than any other forex exchange in the world. It’s true that the companies like WesternUnion and MoneyGram will collapse for sure ,but hey not every one is adamant to change. Who knows either of these companies or some low level companies make moves and integrates with cashaa payments platform and still survives. So finalizing the answer, yes blockchain will for sure replace the current technology but the industry will also adapt to it for a greater prosperity. Short answer is Yes, Blockchain will sure replace may of the traditional technologies being used by us. read below for the extra long explanatory answer. When we talk about technology we are always present focused, meaning we never look beyond what is available to us.

Secondly every block is encrypted with a hash value. And it is extremely difficult to hack it as block chain is chain of blocks so to decrypt hash of one blog and change it and so for chained paired blocks is not that easy man!! 4.Faster Transaction: So, in times of an emergency, many consumers can’t rely on the slow-paced system of traditional banks. However, with blockchain, you can complete a transaction within a few seconds!That’s awfully faster than any traditional means so far. 5.True Trackability: Even the first block to block added a milli sec ago is traceable as blocks are immutable!! You can’t change the data everrr and its visible for all at once!! Top 5 Disadvantages of Blockchain Technology 1.Can’t Edit Data in a Block: Since blocks in blockchain are immutable.

Block chain is complicated and you need to get the essence of it to be able to crack it well! 3.Data is visible to all: That is a major major limitation that you are making a decentralized and distributed system whose data is visible to all the users. Access is the biggest thing in a system to play with functionality and that here has limited the game altogether! 4.Lower Performance: In reality, the computation needs of this technology are more repetitive than centralized servers. It’s because every time the ledger is updated, all the nodes need to update their version of the ledger as well. http://5.It is costly to host: Decentralized means it is hosted at all the hosts where nodes are!

Zero Knowledge Infrastructure As another security tactic, we have implemented a zero-knowledge architecture when communicating with client devices. Client devices (app, web browser, etc.) connect through a public API. This public API has no direct access to databases that hold financial information. The public API only has access to authentication mechanisms to verify and authenticate clients. It passes all operations to a private API which brokers requests out to other micro-services as required. Segregating calls in this manner provides two layers of security: 1. It helps to thwart pivot attacks 2. It helps to prevent SQL injection Industry Best Practices Best Practices are so-named for a good reason — they work. We have followed Industry standards where practical, especially when it comes to reliability and availability. Every facet of our infrastructure has been tuned for high availability. We operate in geographically diversified locations for disaster aversion, as well as local latency and privacy concerns. Our datacenters are located in countries with stable governments that have a track record of supporting and demanding privacy standards. Our datacenters are in countries with highly reliable internet connections, and are located away from environmental problem areas; we do not have data centers in locations prone to Natural Disasters or conflict zones. We operate with fully redundant data-sets and automated failover mechanisms.

Blockchain provides a solution to these cumbersome processes. Payment systems are mostly still centralized. Banks have to maintain a costly and complex web of ""corresponding bank"" relationships to move money across borders. Transfers are cleared through central banks. Synchronizing internal bank ledgers can take several days. Money can still get lost. Reporting is complex and arduous. All this increases costs, time and risk. Equities settlement Just like it takes the world's biggest banks days to synchronize their ledgers, when investors want to settle a stock trade, it usually takes three business days from the time the order executes to do the payment and transfer legal ownership of the security. Blockchain promises settlement that could be very close to real time. That has attracted the attention of the ASX, which has to assume risk during the T+3 settlement period. ""We think if we can get this right, we can get very close to real-time settlement,"" Funke Kupper said last month after ASX said it had taken an equity stake in a New York-based fintech start-up, Digital Asset Holdings, to build a blockchain that could ultimately replace the clearing and settlement systems provided by the CHESS platform. ""You should be able to sell shares at your desk right now and walk to the nearest ATM to get your money … The moment we are able to do that, we remove a lot of risk from the system."" Other exchanges are also innovating. Nasdaq launched a blockchain management tool for shares in private companies, Linq, in October. Investment banks are also exploring how the technology can be used to settling and trade bonds without a clearing house. Goldman Sachs, Citi and JP Morgan have also invested in Digital Asset, which is also exploring applications for syndicated loans, while UBS has embedded a team of engineers in the Level39 fintech hub in Canary Wharf in London and have executed bond trades using a blockchain system. Contracts When Sir Richard Branson gathered his group of blockchain experts on his Caribbean island in May, another participant was Paul Brody, who used to run IBM's ''internet of things"" division in Silicon Valley and is now technology strategy leader for the Americas at global consulting firm EY. In an interview late last year, Brody described the blockchain as ""the glue that is going to drive a productivity revolution across the globe on par with what Henry Ford did with the automobile"". He pointed to toilets being manufactured with cheap computer chips attached, allowing them to be tracked through customs, delivery trucks and onto building sites, thereby enabling builders to co-ordinate installation times and efficiently sequence work flow. At IBM, Brody worked on its Autonomous Decentralised Peer-to-Peer Telemetry (ADEPT) project, in partnership with Samsung, employing a protocol built by the start-up Ethereum that uses a blockchain to connect household devices and allows them to transact over the ""internet of things"". Ethereum has developed a programming framework that allows a blockchain to host ""smart contracts"", legal agreements or sets of business rules, that execute automatically when the rules set out in the code are satisfied. An example might be a share certificate that automatically sends their owners dividends if corporate profits reach a certain level. A drinks vending machine could use the blockchain to order new drinks when it is running low and to pay for them upon delivery. A driverless car could use the money earned from taxi fares to pay for repairs, petrol or parking, effectively operating autonomously. Banks could use smart contracts to allow for digital repossessions; blockchain could be used to shut down a car electronically if payments are not made. Financial inclusion Another guest at Necker Island for the Branson shindig was Hernando De Soto, the economist and president of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy who Time Magazine described as one of the five leading Latin American innovators of the century. De Soto is author of the book Mystery of Capital, which argues that no developing nation can build a vibrant market economy without an information framework that allows citizens to record the ownership of property and other economic information. Without proper records, and in places were corruption is rife, a lack of secure property rights is an endemic source of injustice. Forde, who left the White House last year to join the MIT Media Labs as director of digital currency, describes this as the ""corruption of the stamp"": officials in corrupt regimes can abuse their discretion with old technology like a stamp to deny fundamental rights However, with the blockchain, this middle man can be erased. A government could deliver instantaneous property ownership by holding its land titles records on a blockchain. Boosting financial inclusion can be a big boost to economies due to the velocity of money: more funds can be spent if they are cleared and made available in faster time. The use of digital currencies over the blockchain also promises to open up online retail shopping markets to those under 18 who don't have access to a credit card. For example, Microsoft accepts bitcoin to pay for content on the Xbox. Record keeping Property conveyancing is also cumbersome in the First World. Think of certificates of title being stored in land title offices, amended on paper by multiple law firms and real estate agents, and copied and stamped and moved by couriers. But a decentralised ledger could keep track of the multiple transactions that take place and all the amendments that are made to contracts and other documents, reducing costs and headaches associated with managing the process. If governments were to put property titles – or other pieces of information such as business licences or birth certificates – on the blockchain, citizens would be enabled to digitally conduct transactions without lawyers, notaries or queuing at government offices. Forde says governments will start to see the blockchain as an application that can be used to achieve policy goals, whether that be increasing trust and transparency through property title, or ""eliminating bureaucracy by creating ""responsive open data"", which interacts with government ledgers ""without having to interface with people using the rubber stamp"". While financial regulators are already closely scrutinising blockchain technology to determine whether they will approve its use by financial services players, Forde says governments will need to think about blockchain outside the financial regulatory framework. Inter-disciplinary policy groups will be important, he suggests. -Reference taken from Brian Forde’s speech.

Blockchain’s first major use-case was for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. But the application and uses of the technology have developed. Now various industries want to implement blockchain due to its nature and practical usage. Blockchain is a revolutionary technology — and China is well-aware of it, promoting blockchain worldwide. The Asian superpower stands for 25 % of new blockchain projects and holds the most patents related to blockchain worldwide. Apart from that, the greatest names in the blockchain and crypto community are Chinese companies. There are three possible reasons for China to embrace the blockchain technology: 1. Political: To Take the Leading Position in Technology President of China Xi Jinping stated the country’s need to “seize the opportunity” provided by the blockchain. He has also added that it would be “necessary to implement the rule of law network” into the blockchain systems. According to media, Xi Jinping added that China has a strong foundation to take a leading position in technology. Managing partner at blockchain-focused venture capital firm Proof of Capital Edith Yeung has commented on Xi’s remarks: “It’s clear China wants to lead the world’s standard for blockchain technology. China is a really government-driven country.” 2. Financial: Creating Own Cryptocurrency to “toast” USD Many analysts believe that China’s preoccupation with gold is a real sign that it is moving away from the USD. For instance, in the first half of 2019, the PBOC ( The People’s Bank of China) has purchased gold every month without fail. However, Max Keiser has a theory that China is planning to launch its own gold-backed cryptocurrency. He claims, “[China] is rolling out a cryptocurrency, a lot of the details have not been divulged. I can tell you that the cryptocurrency that China’s rolling out will be backed by gold”. Like many others, Keiser says that China has a lot more gold than it lets on, amounting to 20,000 tons. As a result, crypto, fully backed by gold, would turn people away from the dollar. With China launching a gold-backed Cryptocurrency in any form would leave the US dollar lagging behind and increase the demand for gold. 3. Technical: To Take Advantage of the Blockchain Technology Xi said that blockchain might help the economy by solving long-standing problems banks all over the country are regularly dealing with. Besides, Xi claims that blockchain could leverage the technology for improving people’s livelihood, boosting the quality of education and employment, making pension plans more productive, ensuring food safety, and promoting public welfare. No wonder China has been building its blockchain expertise during the last time, having registered more than 500 blockchain projects since March. Asset management, cross-border payments, trade finance, and supply chain financing are the four most common use cases for the blockchain in China. This might be the greatest news in the history of the blockchain because it sets a precedent for other countries and creates lots of competition. China promoting blockchain has become news that has concerned the whole world. Blockchain’s first major use-case was for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

Therefore, it’s main application is in the financial sector, obviously. Almost everyone on the internet has heard of cryptocurrencies - or at least one of them, namely Bitcoin. Bitcoin has quickly become a trademark of cryptocurrencies and blockchain over the initial five-year period. From its release in 2009 to 2016 and 2017, when it really penetrated the popular knowledge, the digital currency rose from a several-cent token into a several-thousand asset. Payments Of course, the first thing that the cryptocurrencies are used for is payments. The blockchain technology allows for secure transaction threads that are both encrypted and anonymous. Since it isn’t governed by a centralized organ, there are no unitary monetary policies or monitoring mechanisms. This leads to a more democratic financial platform that only depends on the market forces. Besides, the fact that every transaction is embedded in individual blocks and they themselves are intertwined with other blocks is enough to make them virtually impossible to change. This way, the users can be sure that their payments won’t be meddled with. Trading Another popular application of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is in trading. Over the years, lots of new brokerages have emerged that offer crypto trading functionality. Markets Pilot Bitcoin trading is one of many examples of this current state. The main reason why cryptocurrencies are so popular in trading is their volatility. To take but one example, Bitcoin’s price in mid-September was $3,700, whereas in mid-December of the same year, the price spiked at almost $20,000. This level of sudden change makes this digital asset one of the most lucrative - and dangerous - tradable securities on the market. Other applications Now, while the blockchain is mainly used in finances, this doesn’t mean that that’s the only use-case for this technology. Since we’re talking about the platform that is both secure and fast, it is quite attractive to lots of industries altogether. Here’s one small example: the last year, Nestle and Carrefour have struck deal with IBM to incorporate its blockchain technology into their dairy production chains. Here’s what it’ll do: every single component used in the production will be embedded on the blockchain. What this will do is allow consumers to check out how the product was made, which component was added at what time, etc. Not only that, but the blockchain production chain will also show where these components were made, bought, what the mix ratio was, and many more. In short, this technology will make Nestle and Carrefour’s products more transparent for consumers. Then there are smart contracts that also benefit a lot from the blockchain. These types of contracts are best used in labor negotiations, making employer-employee relations much more balanced and transparent. Not only that, smart contracts automate the processing of abundant information. This is especially important for companies that depend on freelancers. The employers give various projects to their employees, as well as receive content from them, will find it much easier to sort through that data and avoid complications. So, the bottom line is that the blockchain can be used in various industries, be it finances, technology, or production. When blockchain was created in 2008, its main goal was to change the financial industry and make payments more secure, decentralized, and instantaneous. Therefore, it’s main application is in the financial sector, obviously. Almost everyone on the internet has heard of cryptocurrencies - or at least one of them, namely Bitcoin.
