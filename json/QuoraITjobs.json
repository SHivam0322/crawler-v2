Here’s How Managers Can Be Replaced by Software mentions a test for it - a 124-page research report for a fortune-500 company . Read below what they did & found.

    "answer" : "There is a great deal of truth to the many answers I read in the comments section of your link. Yeah its been a year and older IT people are rare on Quora, hence the lack of getting an answer. Young initiates to the IT field only see opportunity and big pay checks. Truth is people leave IT in droves because it has been and will continue to be a rough place to make a living with high turn over and burnout always nipping at one’s heels. Take a look at your current IT department and tell me how many plus 40 or 50 year olds you see? The field wasn’t invented 10 or 20 years ago but 80 years ago. Most people don’t make it to retirement in IT. The Grim IT career reaper awaits us all! Good luck!",

    "answer" : "Speaking from a US perspective, there seems to be a lot of age bias and a reluctance to hire more experienced people.   Even though there are laws against it, I think that it is difficult to get hired by a lot of organizations.  However, I do think there are some organizations that do a better job of hiring without being so focused on age.  Universities, as a whole, seem to do a better job and may be one place to look for IT positions.   So, keep trying as I think any organization that can get past the age bias would consider you.  Once you've identified those organizations without a significant age bias, I'd focus on those and keep trying.",

Hospitality does not pay well for equivalent roles when compared with pretty much any other industry and they do tend to struggle on with whatever and whoever they have on hand, on the day..
