But when you apply for a job, sometimes a resume is all the information that the firm has on you to make a decision. In that way, a resume is a reflection of your personality, and it is important to send the right signals to the firm. From the perspective of job applications in India, especially during college placements, here are some tips on how to write a good resume: Number of pages: If you are applying for a core job, the number of pages should not be more than 2. For non-core jobs, since you don't need to mention the technical details to that level of depth, you should try to keep the resume within 1 page. A firm has to scan multiple applications, and they don't have the bandwidth to go through long resumes.SeContinue Reading Continue Reading",

Dave Troiano There isn't really going to be a definitive, unquestionably best algorithm for an ML / data mining problem like this (the Netflix Prize winners employed a multitude of different techniques in their matching system), but here are some ideas. I'm not sure what your setup is for training your model, but I'll assume that you have a machine learning training set consisting of a set R of resumes, a set J of jobs, and <r,j> pairs of known good matches.  In practice, if this were a job website, you would collect those pairs for training and validating candidate algorithms from user actions (jobs viewed, applied for, taken, etc.).  Maybe the <r,j> edges are even weighted. With these inputs, you have a bipartite graph G of resumes and jobs, from which you can easily create a weighted graph G_j of jobs Continue Reading",

Rajat Vashishta If you are asking for just one thing, it would be a mismatch between the job the candidate is doing v/s the job she has applied for. When hiring experienced candidates we look for people with relevant experience. A lot of candidates just blindly apply to jobs. If their present job does not match the job that has been advertised, in most cases it calls for immediate rejection. Another thing is the mention of Salary in the resume. Immediately rejected. Somebody who cannot keep their salary to themselves and chooses to disclose it in a publicly shared document, will definitely not be able to keep company secrets in.

    "answer" : "Dinesh N I like to think of Resumes like personal shot at advertising oneself, which makes it important to decide which type of advert(format) you want to present yourself with. Depending on the type of job you are applying to, different resume formats may apply. There are several types of resumes out there but the four standard types of resumes include: 1) chronological, 2) functional, 3) combination, or 4) targeted. Coincidentally, I answered a similar question here - Dinesh N's answer to What are the best formats for a resume? The Chronological resume: this format lists your education, work history, experience, etc in reverse order of happening.

Khanna Curriculum Vitae is a medium for you to describe yourself not only through words but reflect something about your individuality as a human being through the colors, pictorial content (if any) or maybe potent use of words to reflect your personality; say your sense of humor or sheer wit or specialized knowledge or even a unique set of skills. Some will tell you that proper formatting, sophisticated lingual approach & direct insinuations would be the 'appropriate' methodology but I say go nuts!   You have this enigmatic opportunity to make a piece of paper reflect exactly what you are, who you are and why you are the way you are. And just like every other challenge that you come across in life, this too, is an opportunity  covered in a horrid disguise, waiting to be devoured.
