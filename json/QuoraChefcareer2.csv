603e286265e002964197edf1,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-being-a-singer-as-a-career-unrealistic?-,"It isn’t. There are many different kinds of jobs that pay something to singers. A few singers even make serious money. And singing makes people happy - especially the singer. What would be unrealistic, however, would be not having another stream of income to support you while you develop your singing profile and even when you have your career, since consistent income from singing is rare. It could be a related field like music teaching. It might be something else you enjoy, especially something that will leave you flexible to perform.

Of course it doesn't stop here. It's an incredibly competitive industry with a serious discrepancy between the supply of competent singers (way too high) and demand for competent singers (low, and sadly getting lower every year). Many young singers go through school without the slightest inkling of quite how scant the career opportunities in the world of professional opera are. A good number of singers will realize at some point during school that they don't really have the chops to make it, so pursue another career in the music or vocal field. At my alma mater, the fields of music education, speech pathology, and music therapy were popular choices. Then you have a certain number of singers that were successful enough to go on to grad degrees in performance. After a couple of years many of these singers will realize they don't quite have the chops to get hired into a young artist program or apprenticeship, and may decide to pursue an academic path in music history, theory, pedagogy, or other fields. Of the remaining horde of highly-educated young singers that have thus far remained on the path towards a performance career, only a relatively small percentage will go on to an apprenticeship or young artist position at a large-scale opera company (and we're not talking Chicago Lyric or the Met, many larger regional companies have very strong apprenticeship programs that produce successful professionals - Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Washington National, Seattle, and Portland, to name a few, all have highly regarded development programs). The remaining majority is left to fend for themselves, and many will move on to other careers after a few years in the wilderness. Of the few that do find work after grad school, a very select few (often lyric sopranos and tenors) will begin to find steady-ish work at major opera companies at such a young age. The rest get a couple of years of steady paycheques and then are left in a similar (but better connected) position as those who didn't get work after grad school. It is in these formative years in a singer's late 20's and early 30's that one's mettle is really put to the test. Those of us who can successfully juggle auditions, coachings, and the occasional halfway-decent paycheque from a gig with a day job and the responsibilities of everyday life for a few years might move on to more full-time work as a singer. But most of us will work some kind of a day job to support ourselves between gigs for the foreseeable future. As time goes on, more and more young singers realize this lifestyle isn't the glamorous jet-setting one they imagined when they were younger and get out while they still can, moving on to careers in all sorts of tangentially-related or completely unrelated businesses. It's about this time that those of us start getting a little more work since we've simply outlasted our colleagues. But even with this kind of persistence, there's still no guarantee that the work will continue or improve. Every singer has to be aware of the risks they are taking and we all (even the most successful of us) have had moments where we must take stock of our relative success and decide whether this career path is still sustainable. So the long answer to your question is that the decision to follow this career is usually a 10-15 year-long decision that plays out over a number of different stages in one's life. I'm sorry if this answer went a bit off on a tangent.",2021-03-02T11:58:45.017Z,How does an opera singer decide to pursue opera as career? ,Quora

Get to know your own voice.Be sincere & completely respectful to your Guru. If you’re a female, please join a female Guru. & accordingly if you’re a male.The reason here is, a proper reputed Guru of your gender, would be able to really understand your voice more, & help you work in the right direction.Since male & female vocals are totally different, (in terms of mainly pitch), it will be difficult for a female Guru to guide you in the correct manner, the way a male guru would.Keep listening to music, and most importantly, always enjoy what you sing. Protect & maintain a healthy voice.Unless you truly enjoy, you will never be able to sing with feel & soul.Once you get more accustomed & well versed with the concepts of Light Music, consult your own Guru to upgrade or progress to Pure Classical.If possible, purchase a Guitar of a good brand but affordable budget. The reason for a Guitar is because,1) You need to tune a Guitar properly before you could play it. This makes it compulsory for you to actually know how & what frequencies to tune your guitar strings to. 2) Once you start understanding the tuning concept of a guitar, you will slowly be able to recognize if any string is not tuned properly, judging from the tune of the string being ‘off’. This comes with practice. This also most importantly improves your understanding of ‘Sur’ or ‘Pitch’.3) A guitar is very much portable, & you could play it with a group of friends and learn with more enthusiasm & interest.(The quality of a guitar’s music, lies in the skill of the player, not necessarily just in the price & actual quality of the guitar.)Last but not the least, remember that it’s more important to focus on how to truly express the emotion of simple songs, rather than strain your voice & efforts on difficult songs (technically speaking).**Beauty lies in the Simplicity.

(He has since said that he doesn’t even particularly like playing the drums, and prefers the acoustic guitar.) He told the other members that he wanted to quit, but since they had had an informal agreement that if one of them wanted to leave, they would disband, he would agree to stay if his leaving meant the band would end. The others wanted to go on making music, so they agreed that they would continue as a three-piece. They wished him well, and he gave up full-time music and went to work running his hay farm in Farmington, Georgia. He still owns the farm, but pays other people to run it for him. He has not returned to playing music full-time.

It’s like this: Great songwriter #1: Writes great music, but makes no attempt to have a career as what is known as a “performing and recording artist.” There is a complex and ever-evolving social mechanism in Nashville, TN that is basically organized as follows: Aspiring songwriter - Plays all the open mic writer’s nights at hole in the wall clubs such as the Bluebird Cafe. The better of these is usually doing demo tapes and “shopping” them to publishers. Publishers have “Song Pitchers” whose job it is to place their companies songs into the hands of the “decision makers” who nurture, groom, and care for working performing artists. These folks do not have any song “on hold”, nor have they any songs that have been recorded as a commercial release (demos are not for public consumption). Even if you’re a well-known songwriter, the business works like this. Artist managers and musical directors (and sometimes the artist themselves) listen to hundreds of demos presented to them by already established writers, many of whom are staff writers at a big publishing house such as Acuff-Rose. Acuff-Rose had its headquarters on 8th Avenue South in the Melrose district of Nashville and was something of a landmark to those knowledgeable of the music industry. It was here that Hank Williams, to prove his ability to Rose, wrote what would become a major hit song (""I Can't Help It If I'm Still in Love with You"") while Rose went out to a nearby restaurant for a cup of coffee. In other words, if you’re a young indie songwriter trying to “break in” to the business, your competition is very, very tough. A friend of mine was pitching his song demo to a publisher and just as they called him in, Willie Nelson walked through the door. “Hoss, I hate to cut in, but I’m truly in a rush and double parked - do you mind? So my friend said, “Sure, Willie”. I mean, what would you do!? And true to his word Willie was in and out in 5 minutes. If your song is sufficiently interesting and seems to fit creatively with the overall vision, the artist’s management might ask for you for a “hold”. This means you stop shopping this song. Period. It’s typical for very successful songwriters to have 2–3 songs on hold, maybe 3 songs that have been recorded by various famous people, and 1 song that has turned into a “cut”. A cut, which is a word leftover from when vinyl records were made from metal masters. It is then called the metal master and is the basis for all the records manufactured. After the master disc is thoroughly inspected, a metal mold is formed from the metal master, and liquid nickel is poured into the mold to produce a nickel stamping record from each side of the metal master. There’s one more level a songwriter can aspire to. His song gets chosen, cut and placed on the record AND it’s decided by the marketing team (usually at the record label) that the song will be promoted to country radio as “the number one single”. That means this song is a step above the other cuts on the record. Two friends of mine wrote a song that Garth Brooks fell in love with and recorded. The record shipped platinum, which means the first order from the record stores, taken in total, was over one million copies. And although the writers had to split their end, the first royalty check was for $250,000. Each. Working songwriter - A wide variety of experiences typical based on how many years they’ve been in the business. A songwriter who has finally gotten a cut on a record (his/her first published song) is still going to be found at various writer’s nights ’round Nashville, but once you’re “part of the club” more doors open for you and you naturally need to cultivate working relationships with other successful working songwriters. Co-writing with other people has always been a commonplace affair on 16th Avenue, so it’s very important to get your face (and your music) better known. The Singer/Songwriter - Think James Taylor, The Eagles, Jimmy Buffett. You know, those guys, right? Well they might occasionally co-write with somebody, but basically they provide their own material. The Performing Artist - They do not write songs at all. Their material is provided entirely by outside publishers and writers. Think Elvis Presley and Linda Ronstadt. Here is a list of 85 of some of country music’s greatest songwriters. Some of them, you will not know. Some are household names. But there is a lot of great talent coming out of Nashville, which gives proof that with all the changes in technology, at the end of the day it’s all about the song: melody, harmony, lyrics. Without songs and songwriters, there would be no music business.

The singer was performing an a cappella version of Bob Marley's ""War"" with changed lyrics to bring attention to the rampant abuse in the Catholic Church, reports The Guardian. At the end of her emotional performance, O'Connor ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II. The action left audiences stunned. While talking to Irish magazine Hot Press years later, O'Connor said her decision to smear the Pope was inspired by Bob Geldof, who ripped up a photo of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John on television. ""And I thought, 'Yeah, f**k! What if someone ripped up a picture of the Pope?' Half of me was just like: 'Jesus, I'd love to just see what'd happen.'"" She also said the photo used in the performance actually came from her mother's bedroom wall. ""What I think is wrong is that the people running the show are misrepresenting what Catholicism actually is,"" she told The Guardian in a 2010 interview. ""What I'm talking about is the highest echelons of the Vatican as I call it. Do we need a f**king Pope? Why do we need a Pope? Christ doesn't need a representative. Ten years from now the church will be nothing resembling what it has been."" O'Connor's career hasn't been the same since, but it hasn't stopped her from stirring up drama Natalie Maines Politics and country music just don't mix. It's a painful lesson that Natalie Maines learned in 2003. The Dixie Chicks frontwoman received a firestorm of backlash after saying not-so kind remarks about then-President George W. Bush. ""Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas,"" Maines told a crowd during a London concert, reports Rolling Stone. Almost immediately, the radio stations across Texas began trashing their records and boycotting the group. Stations also hosted informal polls asking fans if their music should be banned from airwaves. In response to the drama, Maines released a statement (via The Guardian): ""We are currently in Europe and witnessing a huge anti-American sentiment as a result of the perceived rush to war. While war may remain a viable option, as a mother, I just want to see every possible alternative exhausted before children and American soldiers' lives are lost. I love my country. I am a proud American."" Many didn't find her remarks to be remorseful enough as she didn't quite apologize either. According to CBS News, Maines was forced to give a second statement shortly after, saying, ""As a concerned American citizen, I apologize to President Bush because my remark was disrespectful. I feel that whoever holds that office should be treated with the utmost respect."" In hindsight, the remarks may not have been the smartest given their fan base is mostly southerners who hold republican views.

People can scoff at your decision to do anything. Or at your indecision. If you’re going to let scoffers influence your decision-making process, you’re in for a very long and unproductive haul. A better method might be a critical self-evaluation: How many songs have you written so far? How have they been received? Do you write every day? If not, why not? You’re going to have a write an awful lot of songs if you want to make a living as a songwriter. Are you proficient on at least one (chordal) instrument (piano, guitar - something that can play more than one note at a time)? Can you read music? If not, why not? Would you try to make a living as an author if you couldn’t read and write English (or whatever language you’re writing in)? Do you practice writing out, note for note, every part for every instrument you want played on your song? If not, you should start. That’s part of being writer. People will tell you that you don’t need to be able to do all that in order to be a “writer” (you can be a writer without being able to write). And they will site one or more examples. Great. Those people are the exception rather than the rule. Learning as much as you possibly can about your craft is not a handicap, it’s an asset. If you want to be a writer, learn to read and write musical notation. That’s the language musicians communicate in. Just like if you want to be an author, learn to read and write english. Not knowing the language is a severe handicap. Once you’ve mastered that, you can try out your songs on YouTube. If your song becomes popular, you may be on to something. If not, change what you’re doing; write in another genre or another style. Again, if you can’t read or write music, that may be difficult. You may be locked into the only genre or style that you’ve listened to extensively. So, try to become fluent at a chordal instrument - preferably a keyboard; it’s just easier that way. Learn to read and write actual musical notation fluently. It’s a lot easier to be taken seriously if you’re fluent in the language. And practice practice practice! Write every day. If you’re not writing (actually writing it out, not just “making stuff up”) every day, you might question whether or not this is what you really want to do. Real writers write every day, just like a job. If you want it to be your job, you have to treat it like a job.

At this stage, the band relied heavily on covers, Bob Dylan for their two hits Mr Tambourine Man & All l really Want to Do & Turn, Turn, Turn was a Biblical adaptation but Gene Clark wrote the great B-Sides - I Knew I’d Want You, I’ll Feel a Whole Lot Better & She Don’t Care About Time.  The Byrds - Feel a Whole Lot Better written by Gene Clark & later covered by Tom Petty There’s a Beatlesque feel to his early songs but also a yearning quality that featured in much of his songwriting throughout his career. He wrote or co-wrote most of the original material on the first two Byrds albums including Here Without You & Set You Free this Time. He had his sole hit while a member of a band, the co-write and early psychedelic track Eight Miles High on their third album Fifth Dimension before he left the Byrds for his solo career. There was jealously from his songwriting royalties and he struggled with a fear of flying but it was also believed he had the talent to be a major star. He was signed to a solo deal by Columbia, the same label as the Byrds but despite his potential he would have no hits as a solo singer-songwriter. He would however have plenty of artistic success.  Elevator Operator His first solo album Gene Clark & the Gosdin Brothers was released in 1967 and features a couple of Baroque pop tunes (Echoes & So You Say You Lost Your Baby) orchestrated by Leon Russell and also some Country Pop-Rock (and lightly psychedelic tunes) long before the Byrds released the country rock Sweetheart of the Rodeo.  Tried So Hard features Clarence White Members of his former band, future Byrd Clarence White and members of the Wreckin’ Crew including a pre fame Glen Campbell and the aforementioned Leon Russell contribute. It’s release clashed with the Byrd’s release Younger than Yesterday. Perhaps he had been off the scene (8 months) prior to it’s launch, perhaps he lacked an agressive manager who would have ensured album promotion was written into his contract but either way, his debut album sunk.  So You Say you Lost Your Baby - A Baroque Pop beauty A brief three week return to the Byrds would be followed by his collaboration with Blue Grass musician Doug Dillard. After being there at the dawn of the fusions of folk, psychedelia & country with rock, Clark & Dillard updated Blue grass with amplified instrumentation and produced another hybrid style - New Grass. Another artistically successful and commercially unsucessful album, The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark. Check out the Train Song (co-written with Bernie Leadon) at the foot of this answer but here’s a couple more.  Out on the Side  The Radio Song The Eagles and Linda Ronstadt would later cover material from this album. An album that gives Sweetheart of the Rodeo a run for it’s money and is also very natural sounding, even moreso than SHOTR. After the departure of future Eagle, Bernie Leadon, another album would follow in 1969 Through the Morning, Through the Night which while not as successful does include a few more Gene Clark gems including Polly & the title track (both later covered by Robert Plant & Alison Krauss). Doug Dillard departed and would have more 70′s success than Gene Clark. You Showed Me a Clark/McGuinn Byrds era demo and co-write was a top 10 hit for the Turtles and provided income for Clark alongside his Byrd’s royalties at this stage. Gene Clark (aka White Light) from a solo Gene Clark followed in 1971. Now with a new label A&M and surrounded by another set of great musicians, Gene Clark delivered another singer-songwriter album masterclass (and a great cover of the Band’s Tears of Rage).  For A Spanish Guitar  White Light White Light again got great reviews in the music papers at the time and of course sold almost nothing. His next album Roadmaster is considered even better by many of his fans and of course was only originally released in the Netherlands even though five Byrds were united on two tracks. Germany and the Netherlands were the most supportive countries to Gene at this phase of his career.  She’s the Kind of Girl (1973) with the Byrds on Roadmaster  Gene Clark - Full Circle After a short lived Byrds reunion Gene Clark would release No Other in 1974. Now on yet another label, Asylum, this was an all out attempt to finally achieve success and features a host of great musicians, an OTT production style later perfected by Fleetwood Mac and another great selection of original Gene Clark songs.  Silver Raven It was another spectacular failure and not released as a double album as originally intended. Two Sides to Every Story with the same producer followed without the production excess and was eventually released by RSO in 1977. It was his last solo major label release and apparently Gene Clark’s favourite. Lifestyle issues were impacting Gene Clark’s career by the late 70s and he underwent divorce. A partial Byrd’s reunion with Chris Hillman & Roger McGuinn after they appeared on the same live bill together released McGuinn, Clark & Hillman in 1980. This has good songs buried in slick production and the obligitory disco track. Again Gene Clark (4) contributes more songs than McGuinn (2) & Hillman (3).  Gene Clark sings Backstage Pass on Dutch TV - this touches on his fear of flying one of the reasons why he left the Byrds, he partially overcame his fear to play live in Europe in the late 70s. In his last full decade Gene Clark would record Firebyrd in 1982 and two duet albums with Carla Olson So Rebellious a Lover in 1987 and the live Silhouetted in Light in 1992. Jangle Rock was back in vogue with the success of REM, Tom Petty, the Long Ryders and the Bangles, all quoting the Byrds as an influence.  The Rain Song from Firebyrd, not released until two years after it was recorded  with Carla Olson - Fair Tender Ladies (a folk ballad of Appalachian origin often called “Little Sparrow”)  Gypsy Rider from So Rebellious a Lover, another critical success He put together a Byrds tribute group with original drummer Michael Clarke and despite lack of interest from McGuinn, Hillman & Crosby. This would lead to legal issues when the three other original members tried to reestablish ownership of the Byrds name, as promoters had often billed the tribute act as “the Byrds”, Gene would drop out but others continued led by original drummer Michael Clarke. The success of Tom Petty’s Full Moon Fever would yield royalties to Gene Clark for I’ll feel a whole Better but he succumbed to drug use again. The Byrds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 and the original members performed together again despite some animosity. Gene Clark would last barely four months after the reunion dying at 46 in May 1991. His song writing legacy has only increased since his death with numerous covers of his material and collections of demos still being released. He wrote over 200 songs and left dozens more on his death. With his ease of delivery, stylistic adventure and wide reaching at times melancholic material there was no other singer songwriter like Gene Clark.

The Thing is that I feel like Jennie gives in more for her Solo Performances compared to group performances:  the Solo Jennie Performance that I watched on YouTube for the Seoul BLACKPINK Concert, I really felt Jennie’s Stage Presence and she really owned the stage.  Kyocera Dome Osaka one was also really good. The thing is that Jennie is a quad-triple threat (Vocals, Rap, Dance and Visual) and being a quad-triple threat it ables her to basically do everything she can in a group as a solo artist. Jennie is one of a kind who I would have to say would be better suited as a Solo artist than in an overall group with other members. As a Solo Artists, Jennie could basically have to spotlight to shine and maybe she would be able to showcase her Personal Talents like high-speed raps and stable vocals since she is not given many opportunities to do so in a Group with BLACKPINK. Jennie would be very successful as a Solo Artist, she has managed to secure herself with an Inkigayo Triple Crown with her solo debut song, Solo was ranked 86 on the Goan Digital Chart of 2018 with 358,064,167 Goan heat Index scores, 88 on the Goan Download Chart of 2018 and 86 on the Goan Streaming Chart. Solo seemed to have done better in 2019 than 2018: In the Half-Year Goan Charts, Solo Charted 16 with 455,318,601 Goan Heat Index Scores on the Digital Chart and that was ahead of BLACKPINK’s Kill This Love which was placed at 31 with 348,899,010 Goan Heat Index Scores. On the Half-Year Goan Download Chart, Solo charted at 15 and Kill This Love Charted at 28, On the Streaming Chart for the First Half of 2019, Solo Charted at 15 even ahead of BTS’s Boy With Luv which was placed at 16, Kill This Love charted at 31. Because of such success from Jennie as a Solo Artists compared to the other 3 members, Jennie is successful enough to sustain herself as a Solo Artist. But Jennie could be personally more comfortable in a group along with her other 3 members and the other 3 members keep her company and even cheer her up when she is crying in front of an Arena of 10,000. BLACKPINK’s friendship and Journey as 4 is the reason why Jennie should stay in the group:  Note: My opinions on Jennie as a Solo artist are my opinions and if anyone for whatsoever reason gets triggered please respect my opinion as I will respect yours.

The singer was performing an a cappella version of Bob Marley's ""War"" with changed lyrics to bring attention to the rampant abuse in the Catholic Church, reports The Guardian. At the end of her emotional performance, O'Connor ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II. The action left audiences stunned. While talking to Irish magazine Hot Press years later, O'Connor said her decision to smear the Pope was inspired by Bob Geldof, who ripped up a photo of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John on television. ""And I thought, 'Yeah, f**k! What if someone ripped up a picture of the Pope?' Half of me was just like: 'Jesus, I'd love to just see what'd happen.'"" She also said the photo used in the performance actually came from her mother's bedroom wall. ""What I think is wrong is that the people running the show are misrepresenting what Catholicism actually is,"" she told The Guardian in a 2010 interview. ""What I'm talking about is the highest echelons of the Vatican as I call it. Do we need a f**king Pope? Why do we need a Pope? Christ doesn't need a representative. Ten years from now the church will be nothing resembling what it has been."" O'Connor's career hasn't been the same since, but it hasn't stopped her from stirring up drama Natalie Maines Politics and country music just don't mix. It's a painful lesson that Natalie Maines learned in 2003. The Dixie Chicks frontwoman received a firestorm of backlash after saying not-so kind remarks about then-President George W. Bush. ""Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas,"" Maines told a crowd during a London concert, reports Rolling Stone. Almost immediately, the radio stations across Texas began trashing their records and boycotting the group. Stations also hosted informal polls asking fans if their music should be banned from airwaves. In response to the drama, Maines released a statement (via The Guardian): ""We are currently in Europe and witnessing a huge anti-American sentiment as a result of the perceived rush to war. While war may remain a viable option, as a mother, I just want to see every possible alternative exhausted before children and American soldiers' lives are lost. I love my country. I am a proud American."" Many didn't find her remarks to be remorseful enough as she didn't quite apologize either. According to CBS News, Maines was forced to give a second statement shortly after, saying, ""As a concerned American citizen, I apologize to President Bush because my remark was disrespectful. I feel that whoever holds that office should be treated with the utmost respect."" In hindsight, the remarks may not have been the smartest given their fan base is mostly southerners who hold republican views. Here is a great video with another 11 singers that screwed up in a big way.  It is amazing how stupid some of these people are.",2021-03-02T12:15:11.672Z,Which singers sabotaged their career? ,Quora

Singers, especially, will have many ears listening to them to see if they have anything to contribute to the music.

The obvious hopeless cases are usually eliminated early on, so coming into the “critical phase”, there’s a core group of people left who can at least stay on key. That’s when it becomes a beauty pageant talent segment, with the public voting. This often ends with the most talented people being voted off, because they don’t have “the look”. Like Jennifer Hudson. The winner is hustled into the studio to crank out an album, any album, before the public forgets the Continue Reading",2021-03-02T12:25:33.859Z,Why is it extremely difficult for singers who started their music career from popular singing competitions to follow up their debut album with a more commercially successful album? ,Quora

I usually don’t like to read long answers so I try to keep my answers brief, but this one takes a little explaining. I will do my best not to waste too much time, but it deserves to be noted. This particular performer DID NOT sell out, but most think that she did. I am talking about the original woman scorned, who started the entire feminist movement of the 1990′s, not Sarah McLaughlin, not Alanis Morissette, but Liz Phair. She dropped the most controversial album of any female (or even male) with “Girly-Sound.” Matador picked her up and polished her 3 CD release and cut her next two albums off of the tracks and several more songs for her third album. Keep in mind, “Girly-sound” was all recorded by Liz alone, on a 4-track recorder, in the bedroom of her parent’s home, where she grew up as a child. She had an AMAZING following through the 90s. Then there was a lull in her career. Then, in 2003, she cut “Why Can’t I Be Me” and Capitol Records took the rights and made it a pop song that she was not at all happy with, but she no longer owned the rights. It destroyed her. No matter what she said, her reputation is still struggling. I for one, know she is still the amazing “alternative” talent she always was, but it is amazing how people who “OWN” your rights can determine how the world perceives you.
