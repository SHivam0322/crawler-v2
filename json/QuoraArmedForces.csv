The pay and benefits aren’t going to make you rich, but they are as good as many beginning civilian jobs. There is very little beyond disposable income that you need to spend your money on. You are provided housing, food, a clothing allowance, medical and dental care, great educational opportunities, travel, and you can earn full retirement after twenty years of service. A young person who isn’t sure what they want to do after a year of post high-school, can enlist and get the benefits named. They will be exposed to many things they could experience in no other way, and be around people of many different career tracks. When their enlistment is up the will most likely have identified what they want to pursue as a career. A good number of those joining don’t plan to make a career of it, but feel drawn to service out of love of country and patriotism. This is particularly true during times of war. Of course there are down sides, being shot at and bombarded are two of them; but even with that most of the time military men have a lower death and injury rate than the average citizen of the same age. Boot camp is pretty tough, even horrific for some, but once in the regular service, the work is interesting and most service personnel travel as part of their job. It is not easy to get into the service. You have to have some post high school credits, have a clean criminal record, meet the physical requirements, and get a high score on their standardized testing. So you will not be with a bunch of dummies, but people that are above average in almost any measure.

Ian Fleming , who went on to write The James Bonds Books was an officer in British Naval Intelligence during WW2 , and was involved with D-Day Planning I recently read his biography, and recommend it. Extract from Wikipedia 30 Assault Unit[edit] In 1942 Fleming formed a unit of commandos, known as No. 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops. 30AU's job was to be near the front line of an advance—sometimes in front of it—to seize enemy documents from previously targeted headquarters. The unit was based on a German group headed by Otto Skorzeny, who had undertaken similar activities in the Battle of Crete in May 1941. The German unit was thought by Fleming to be ""one of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence"". Fleming did not fight in the field with the unit, but selected targets and directed operations from the rear. On its formation the unit was thirty strong, but it grew to five times that size. The unit was filled with men from other commando units, and trained in unarmed combat, safe-cracking and lock-picking at the SOE facilities. In late 1942 Captain (later Rear-Admiral) Edmund Rushbrooke replaced Godfrey as head of the Naval Intelligence Division, and Fleming's influence in the organisation dclined, although he retained control over 30AU. Fleming was unpopular with the unit's members, who disliked his referring to them as his ""Red Indians"". Before the 1944 Normandy landings, most of 30AU's operations were in the Mediterranean, and it also secretly participated in the Dieppe Raid in a failed pinch raid for an Enigma machine and related materials. Fleming observed the raid from HMS Fernie, 700 yards offshore. Because of its successes in Sicily and Italy, 30AU became greatly trusted by naval intelligence. In March 1944 Fleming oversaw the distribution of intelligence to Royal Navy units in preparation for Operation Overlord. He was replaced as head of 30AU on 6 June 1944, but maintained some involvement. He visited 30AU in the field during and after Overlord, especially following an attack on Cherbourg for which he was concerned that the unit had been incorrectly used as a regular commando force rather than an intelligence-gathering unit. This wasted the men's specialist skills, risked their safety on operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives, and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence. Afterwards, the management of these units was revised. He also followed the unit into Germany after it located, in Tambach Castle, the German naval archives from 1870. In December 1944 Fleming was posted on an intelligence fact-finding trip to the Far East on behalf of the Director of Naval Intelligence. Much of the trip was spent identifying opportunities for 30AU in the Pacific; the unit saw little action because of the Japanese surrender.

Moreover facing SSB is not going to be a cake walk unless you prepare yourself as such. By choosing NDA, you have taken up a big responsibility at an early stage of your life. Each passing day will bring you closer to the gateway of your goal. But don't leave your key behind in the race of running to the door. Everyone can reach the door but not everyone has that key to open the door. There's no shortcut or bribe or superpower which will help you cross the door. Even thereafter no one is gonna prepare you for the tough life you'll live in the academy and that so-called adventures, you'll face throughout your life in the armed forces which will ask you to take unexpected and terrible moral decisions. To sum up your physical or academic preparedness is negligible in front of the challenges you'll face throughout your life. You'll need a lot of mental preparedness than anything else. No one can teach you this. You just need to know that within 1, 2 or 3, whatever time in years, months or days you are left with you to prepare yourself, for your life as an Armed Forces Officer, if you could prepare yourself mentally even thirty-three percent, trust me provided you are academically good enough, physically fit and decent by personality, you'll make it to face 77 percent of hardships, that hardships for which you were never trained or cannot be possibly trained even in the academy. Further, it's your life. Decide wisely and don't take my words in a wrong spirit. Real life in armed forces is if fancier than imaginary, then it is also deadlier than imaginary. If you are able to prepare yourself, it's well and good. At last who is the one responsible for your life ? You right ?

We covered a wide scope of military topics: Mongol empire... ISIS... Iraqi mass retreat... Leadership... Logistic vulnerabilities... ELINT (electronic intelligence) ... Russia/Ukraine conflict... Donetsk airport... I posed the question of his long-term plan to join the military and why he would want to do such a thing. By that point in my career, I was at 19 years, jaded beyond all hope of redemption, with far too many friends listed on armyaircrews.com. I had seen leadership fail miserably, official 15-6 investigations uncover shit even I had no idea was going on, and the then-recent losses of Mosul, Tikrit, and Tal-Afar in Iraq to ISIS still stung. His response was warming and bothersome at the same time: “Dad, I want to join the Army... someone HAS to make it better... I’ll get a degree and I make it better...” His statement made me proud (and still does, three years later). For him to process that which has frustrated me over the years and determine that he can be part of a solution… Well, that should make any parent proud beyond words. At the same time, it sent chills down my back. I immediately thought of the two Gold Star mothers I am friends with on Facebook – each of them lost a son in either Afghanistan or Iraq. I read their heart-breaking posts every day, and I can almost hear the anguish in their words… especially when ISIS made such rapid gains in 2014 or when articles flippantly call for us to cut our losses and leave Afghanistan. The “glory” of combat is an addictive myth which will seduce the unknowing into its gory embrace as long as warfare exists. From present-day video games to the classic tales of antiquity – the idea of service, action, and purpose resonates strongly and down to a fundamental level for some. With the First World War, one can have a better idea of how the concept was quickly outpaced by the quick evolution of warfare; there should be nothing “romanticized” about the horrors of Verdun, Passchendaele, or Ypres (but yet there is, somehow). War is hell on earth. However, these are not the words of a born-again pacifist, mind you. As much as my studies and writings have really depressed the hell out of me at times, I still understand and appreciate the motivations and justifications for conflict – not every person or society is fully prepared to allow another to live in peaceful bliss. One of the more interesting quotes I have found recently comes from an interview with Hjalmar Schacht, one of the key economists of Nazi Germany: “If the military profession is honorable, it is the most self-effacing profession in the world because its duty is to prevent its use.” Schacht’s words came after the fall of Germany and during the Nuremburg Trials, but they ring true to this day… So… back to my son and his goals… Would I support him in going into the service? Sure. As an adult, I would not be able to prevent him from doing so, even if I didn’t support the decision. As a veteran, I would definitely try to steer him into a branch or career field which has the best civilian application for when he is done: law, intelligence, cyber, etc., but even if he wanted to be a regular 11B Infantryman or [gasp] a 15T Blackhawk Repairer (THAT I may just try to talk him out of), I would still be behind him. Would I constantly be fearful of getting that notification? You bet. However, safety is never guaranteed with anything one chooses as a profession, and the “immortality” of youth will always win over the concrete wisdom of old age. I would rather him live a life of pride than fear, and if he has the fire burning in him to be a positive change for the better in uniform, how could I not support him? “Would you support your child if they said they wanted a career in the military?” In 2015, during his annual summer visit, my 9-year-old son and I had a lunchtime conversation that would have probably piqued the interest of any eavesdroppers.

They do not know A or Z of the forces and simply put most of the so called facts that one possesses comes from myths and fallacies from other equally ignorant people.Secondly, the society itself beginning from parents, relatives and most importantly neighbors have always had a say in the process of choosing one's career. Friends may be equally ignorant and may be still in the more confused state and hence may or may not be of much help. It is a disturbing trend these days that most of the young minds prefer to opt for less burdensome and society approved careers namely engineering or medicine and in some cases CA. Arts and Science including commerce are generally treated as subjects for those who are below average and those who don't have the marks or the funds to study these expensive courses are pushed to study them. They however have their own problems later in life and end up job hopping till the end of the world.South Indian youth are always expected to have a SECOND career option. They are often chided by others, one and all for the lack of career choices and this leads to a person choosing careers out of fear rather than following his passion. Simply put, most youth lack the ability to take bold decisions and purposeful risks which form the backbone of the personality of a Defence officer.The education system itself is modernized and serves no purpose. A quick glance at the results of the recently concluded SSLC and 10+2 results would give even a sitting duck the idea that memorizing thoroughly the contents of the textbooks from A-Z would definitely fetch sure seats in medicine or engineering. Engineering education has reached its lowest point where a student first completes his engineering degree and the decides what he career he wishes to choose in life. Engineers in the south have become actors and politicians, directors and lawyers and some also starting their own food chains.But however there are exceptions, and exceptions are rare. I have personally been inspired and motivated by people IN and Out of uniform on numerous occasions and this confirms my faith that there will come a time when South Indian youth(esp. the ones from TN) will come out of the cocoon and spearhead a trend of dynamic and adventurous minds joining the Defence Forces.If there are any constructive suggestions from anyone please feel free to drop in your ideas in the comments box as it would inculcate a good spread of ideas to all concerned.Jai Hind.

I joined the navy for two reasons:  I wanted to see the word, and I wanted to retire at the age of 38.  I DID see a lot of the world, and not like a lot of other guys, I actually SAW the world.  I am afraid that too many people just get off the ship and go find a bar stool.  Not surprisingly, at most places I would run into rather elderly American couples who had saved their money all their lives to visit these places, and now, they were really too old to enjoy it like they could in their youth.  When I retired from the Navy, I did not have enough retirement check to actually retire, but I had a nice piece of change every month, and basically free health care for life.  Yes, it is not TOTALLY free, but it is a LOT better than what I see everyone else pay for health care.  Especially now, with Covid all over the place, I see how much my neighbor has to pay for three weeks in intensive  care, and just knowing how that is going to change his life.  I worked retail a few years ago, and I saw how the civilian world really works.  My friend was hurt in a car wreck on the way home from work one night.  Since he could not come to work with his injuries, he was fired.  And since he no longer had he3alth insurance after he was fired, he is in debt to his ears.  And after he finally got a new job, they will not cover anything that has anything to do with his  pre-existing condition.  So, he just gets deeper and deeper in the hole.  Do you think all those old folks are working at Walmart or Lowes or Home Depot because they like people??  They are working there because they like food and they like living indoors.  They probably had the same health problem my friend had---the insurance does not cover a pre-existing condition.  ---Mine does.

I finally was sent to Basic Medical Training. While there an NCO came to our class and asked for volunteers t for the career field of Aerospace Physiology. I volunteered and went to school for that. After being at my first permanent station, we received a request for volunteers to transfer to our base in the Panama Canal Zone. (At that time there were only three overseas assignments open to my career area.) To go to Panama you had to be able to speak Spanish or have a score of or better on the MLAT. My 178 beat out all other volunteers, so I went to the Berlitz Language Institute in Washington, DC. This was in 1966 and the two Defense Language Institutes were at capacity for Vietnam and a lot of people got to go to contract schools. I went to Panama on an eighteen month assignment and extended it to five years. While there, I had temporary assignments to Columbia (three times), Ecuador, Argentina, Guatemala, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil. (Yes, I know they speak Portuguese in Brazil, but they accepted our classes in Spanish.) We moved out operation to MacDill AFB in Tampa, FL. I continued in the same work of teaching the body’s reaction to flight in Spanish for another ten years. I taught these classes to pilots and aircrew members from every country where Spanish is spoken except Cuba and Equatorial Guinea. During that time I also preached inn Spanish for a Spanish speaking congregation of the church of Christ. I met my wife through a mutual friend because of that preaching. After I retired from the USAF, I went to the University of South Florida. Upon retirement I had 132 credit hours from courses I took in the Air Force and from testing. I was able to finish a double major BA in Spanish and Foreign Language Education in two years. I later earned a Masters of Education from USF. I taught high School Spanish for 22 years in Pinellas County, Florida. I am now happily retired in Tennessee.

Unlike the recruitments made for civil services, where personality test is only part of the selection process, Army selections are made mainly on the basis of personality test. Even a topper of a written test could be rejected during his personality test. An expert on defense matter told me a few years ago that such type regional, linguistic and castiest regimentation was done by British after 1857 rebellion to ensure that there is no further army coup in India. The Indian Army is divided into so many groups that no Army Chief can enjoy the loyalty of all Regiments and hence he can never think of any coup. You also see a gender discrimination in Army as most posts are not open to women. Even the reserved caste people are not too much interested in joining Army since it is a hazardous job which has high risk of life. I have never heard any movement to get reservation in Army. Further, some of the so called reserved caste people (Like Jats, Gorkhas) are already represented in Army due to their caste or region. This practice has been continued in the independent India because it suits the elected civil government which would never like Army to take over India. As they say ‘Everything is fair in love and War.’ Nobody wants to take chances in the matter of safety and security of our country.

The caption just read that these were “our allies from the Albanian Special Forces”. The interesting thing, however, were the comments posted by “SoF’s” readers: “We saw them in Afghanistan and they sucked big time!”, “Complete losers” and the demand that the picture should be removed because “it’s an insult to every soldier that fought in Afghanistan” were some of the more moderate comments. SoF complied and the picture was taken from the page.  Driton Demiraj (picture from his Facebook page). I haven’t had any personal experience with the Albanian SOF, but a look at their former commander (who is also the highest decorated soldier of the Albanian Armed Forces) tells me enough. Driton Demiraj is everything you don’t want a soldier to be: a braggart, an idiot, and a loudmouth. His understanding of military Special Operations is zero. Imagine Donald Trump joining the army. That such an “anti-soldier” can make a successful career in this unit is an indicator that there is something terribly wrong, not only with the Albanian Special Forces, but with their complete armed forces. Demiraj, while still being in command of the Albanian SF, gave hundreds of TV interviews, posted dozens of “Rambo” like pictures on his Facebook page and let himself celebrate as a hero. So much for the modesty and humbleness of a professional soldier. He later took good advantage of his popularity and even became the minister of internal affairs for a while. Albanian Special Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq mostly provided armed forces protection services for other military contingents, a job that is usually done by private military contractors. They lack the skillsets to be used for anything else. To end this answer with something positive, I’m a big admirer of Albania’s special police units.

However, during ‘peace time’ or down time, they are pushed away from the public eye and almost forgotten about. I would (and I could be wrong, this is just my opinion) say that a career in the armed forces today, is seen as perhaps a left-field choice. British people don’t really like being told what they can and cannot do. They have opinions and are free to express them in society. So, going in the Armed Forces sort of goes against that freedom. However, in times of need and for the right reasons, the population has proven that it will happily step forward, swell the ranks and stand for what’s right. But, until that need arises the Army itself (not including Air Force or Navy) is only about 80,000 strong compared to a population of around 60 million.

I put the “have” in italics because there is a difference between those who volunteered to serve in the military and those who were drafted. Ronald Reagan may have spent the war making movies with the First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU, known to people who worked there as “Fump U”), but he had enlisted in the US Army Reserves in 1937 as a Second Lieutenant in the Cavalry who later transferred to the Army Air Corps. When he was activated, Reagan went through a physical which determined that his eyesight was so bad that had been drafted he would have qualified as 4-F, unfit to serve. At least some sources claim that the Army tried to separate him (end his military service), but he appealed higher authorities, possibly as high as President Roosevelt. He didn’t serve overseas, but he did serve. Both Jimmy Stewart and Clark Gable enlisted in the Army Air Force. Stewart was the first Hollywood actor to enlist in the military while Gable, pulled strings with higher authorities - and in this case we know that that went as high as FDR - following the death of his wife Carol Lombard. Robert Montgomery joined the Navy, and commanded a PT Boat at Guadalcanal and was an officer on the destroyer USS Barton on D-Day. In fact he directed the PT Boat sequences in the movie They Were Expendable in 1945. Some actors tried to enlist and were told that they were more important doing their civilian jobs. According to his autobiography Mel Blanc, who was 33 at the time of Pearl Harbor attempted to enlist in the Army and was informed that he was of more value in his civilian work, doing voice work for Warner Brothers and appearing on various radio shows, including The Jack Benny Program. He would later do contract work for FMPU and provide the voice of Private Snafu for a series of animated training movies. His colleague on the Jack Benny Program, Eddie Anderson was 35 at the time of Pearl Harbor. He also tried to enlist and was also rejected. He started a company called Pacific Parachute, which made sections for parachutes that would be sewn together by larger companies. Pacific Parachute hired mainly women and adhered to fair hiring practices. One third of the company’s employees were white, one third black, and one third Hispanic. A lot of other actors did not enlist. Many were drafted. All were subject to the draft. Wonderful Smith, a black performer who worked on Red Skelton’s “Raleigh Cigarette Show” was drafted near the beginning of the American involvement in the war. He served with the Armed Forces Radio Service in India as a disc jockey, and by his account lost his ability to do the stereotypical accent as a result, When he came back from the military, he found that the Skelton show had been restructured and the role he had formerly played didn’t exist on the show anymore. Skelton himself was drafted in 1944, being inducted in June 1944. Skelton would later joke (or maybe it wasn’t really a joke) that he was the only celebrity who went into the Army as a Private and came out as a private. Another actor who was drafted was Mickey Rooney, also drafted in 1944. Both men served with the Army’s Special Services units, doing pretty much what they did in civilian life. Skelton did as many as ten to twelves shows a day in the US and Europe, a pace which drove him to a nervous breakdown. Dennis Day, who was the tenor on The Jack Benny Program entered the US Navy as a Lieutenant and served until 1946. It was not uncommon for film studios and others to do what they could to keep their stars out of uniform. Everyone knows the story about John Wayne not being drafted but people tend to forget that his repeated deferments were “third party deferments” with the request for the deferment coming from Republic Studio head Herbert Yates, a man by reputation was someone you crossed at your own considerable risk. Not many of the major actors at Republic outside of Gene Autry (who enlisted) served in the military. Sometimes it didn’t work. Red Skelton was drafted despite the intervention of both MGM Studios, where he was under contract and Raleigh Cigarettes (which owned Red Skelton’s radio show). For some actors the war had a negative impact on their careers. Major Clark Gable was actually released from the Army Air Force in June 1944. Since he was technically serving in FMPU, Gable’s discharge papers were signed by the unit adjutant, Captain Ronald Reagan. Gable pretty much returned to his career at the point where he left it. When Skelton was released for the service he also went back to his old show (which had been discontinued when he went into the Army and replaced by a show featuring the band leader and lead singer of the show, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson). On the other hand, Jimmy Stewart had some difficulty in his return to civilian life. He had returned to the United States in 1945 but didn’t make his first post-war film until It’s A Wonderful Life in 1946. He didn’t go back to making the same sort of movies that he had been making in the 1930s and up to 1941. The characters he played had a harder edge. The pre-war Stewart would never have made a movie like Call Northside 7777 or later Winchester 73, nor would he have entered into his successful partnership with Alfred Hitchcock. For other actors wartime service was disastrous to their post war careers. Mickey Rooney would never be as big a star after the war as he had been before the war. They weren’t making the sort of movies that had been his stock in trade before the war, and even if they did he was to old for them. His career floundered in the late ‘40s and most of the 1950s. Maybe the one most effected by this period was the one who tried hard to stay in the Army, Ronald Reagan. Reagan had been a rising star in 1941; he came close to an Oscar nomination for King’s Row. After the war he got parts like That Hagen Girl and Bedtime For Bonzo. The sort of roles that would have gone to Regan had he been separated out of the Army in 1942 were going to people like Van Johnson and Peter Lawford, actors who couldn’t serve in the Army because every of physical injuries. Van Johnson had been badly injured in an auto accident, while Lawford - whose father was Lieutenant General Sir Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford who commanded the British 41st Division in World War I - suffered severe nerve damage to his right arm as a teenager. As Johnson put it, “There were five of us, Jimmy Craig, Bob Young, Bobby Walker, Peter Lawford and myself. All tested for the same part all the time.” Someone like Reagan, a rising star but not someone on the level of Gable or Stewart, who had last four years of big parts wasn’t going to restart their careers where they had been. Reagan, and others like him, were at a disadvantage when it came to being cast because of that four year gap in being before the public.

The age, at which children play with their dolls & toy cars, I got the opportunity to sit in COCKPIT of Su-30 in Gwalior runway and imagine myself flying it one day. I was just 5-6 year old when I had fallen in love with the beast of the sky. When people were interested in 1999 World Cup & Shaktimaan, I was worried about the outcome of Kargil War & could see my dad going for guard duty every night. We all prayed for the safety of our pilot and soldiers fighting for us in the front on daily basis in the temple. That day a dream & an ambition had taken birth in me to be one amongst them. I needed no other role model other than my father who has inspired me to wear the blue uniform. Coming to your question “Why do you want to join the Indian Armed Forces?” Answer: I may live a happy life outside, I may earn a lot of money and achieve great height in whatever field I choose. But I will never be satisfied in life with all the happiness that money could buy you. I will loose the dream with which I have grown up. The status, the respect an Armed Force Personnel gets cannot be purchased, it has to be earned. One is respected for the years to come after martyrdom. The only organisation where you have continuous mental (higher education and various technical training) and physical growth (sports, team player & rigorous training) which brings the best man out of you. This provides you with the opportunity of having a very adventurous life.  You can go for higher education in prestigious institution like IIM & IIT while being part of Indian armed forces.Armed forces provides you with reasonably well pay & perks along with lifetime medical and post retirement benefits. But all these are too less compared to the life you will be living , the lifestyle you will have.Armed forces personnel goes that extra mile in helping other under normal circumstances and does miracle in case of natural disaster or external threats. My dad has given me the best upbringing where I have studied in various schools across the country and mingled with people of various backgrounds. Being in Armed forces I could give the same to my next generation.I have grown up in the Armed Forces environment where the entire community come to help you like Celebrating Diwali, Holi, Eid & Christmas with equal enthusiasm and distributing sweets.Taking your neighbours kids to school along with yours.Where neighbours take care of you time to time when your family is back in hometown.I have seen my dad helping others in shifting quarters while going transfer.I have grown up in that environment & I will loose it if I don’t live up to my dreams. I don’t want my next generation to grow up in an apartment playing games on a smart phone. I want to give them endless opportunity that I got from my father, become a worthy citizen with time and continue the family legacy. So being a part of armed forces I will definitely get to see the best version of myself. For me it is not a job, it is a way of living.

Therefore, influence of military in any form is negligible in youth. Whereas, the representation of people in Army is more from the Northern States because they see army in their day to day life and are aware about the kind of life and profession they will enjoy here. In Haryana and Punjab, it is matter of pride for people to get their daughters married to an army personnel as they gets recognition in the society. In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Northern States, youth are crazy to get into armed forces. They are so focused that they start preparing for the recruitment process of Jawans (enlisted soldier) years ago. 2. The challenges of Telangana is entirely different. Poverty in rural areas, education in the isolated parts, condition of drought because of water disputes and employment. Whereas, the Army dealings with civil population is almost negligible because of the role of Army in Telangana. 3. The southern states of India became locations of initial Information Technology boom. Also, IT companies such as Satyam, Wipro etc took birth in this part of the country. People were more attracted towards jobs where they can sit in front of computer and work from 9 to 6. The government also brought special economic zones which were developed by these companies such as Gachibowli and present Hi-Tech city in Hyderabad. Microsoft also established its office in Hyderabad which also started attracting the youth. 4. On the other hand, the army stayed inside the garrisons and the plush and adventrous lifestyle of Indian Army remained unknown to youth of Telangana. 5. The boom of engineering colleges also made the youth to aspire a position in a software company which also may give them ticket to go to foreign country. For matter of fact, among Indians in USA, majority of them are Telugu speaking. 6. The unawareness among youth of Telangana is so much that they are unaware about stature of commissioned officer of Indian Army. 7. Most of the youth after engineering are aware about Rupees 21000 per month job as software engineer in Infosys but they are not aware that a Jawan of Indian Army earns Rupees 27000 per month at age of 18 with a qualification of 10th pass which is the basic start level in Indian Army as an enlisted soldier over and above he gets various facilities. To my shock, the engineering graduates in Telangana who fails to get a job in a reputed company are ready to work in a call centre for 15000 CTC. I am talking about the youth who are not aware about the armed forces, package offered, facilities and stature in the society. I had personal interaction with youth of JNTU Hyderabad and various colleges where they were not aware but when I made them enlightened they were keen to know that how to get into armed forces. 8. Myths: I heard lot of myths which people of southern state has about armed forces. Myths such as low salary package, no family life and confusion about the role which they get. 9. Telugu Films. I have seen many Telugu films where the portrayal of an army personnel or army officer is away from the reality. As the silver screen is reflection of the society, it not only tells that the Telangana society earlier was not aware about armed forces but it also spreads further myths among youth. Our film makers needs to be responsible enough to portray reality which is sweeter than their silver screen.  SOURCE OF IMAGE: YOUTUBE As I said in first line that What you see, You aspire. In recent flood situations, Indian Army was called in when civil administration failed to rescue civilians. The civil population interaction increased with army during the clamity and there is a rise in the interest among youth to join armed forces increased. Also, the central government has realised that the youths need to be made aware about the armed forces as a career, and various advertisement campaigns are running which is highlighting the pay package, the facilities and kind of life they will get in armed forces.

Yahya Khan (president of Pakistan during 1971 War) and Sam Manekshaw served in the British Indian Army together before Indo-Pak separation in 1947.

If you ask a PLA officer how is he doing every day, he will probably answer that his job is just “mowing”, with a bitter smile. Basically this is a self-mockery that widely spread in the Chinese military, especially officers.  This should be understood from two aspects: first is that military servicemen do have to remove the weed (“normal” weed, not marijuana) on a regular basis and it is frustrating; second is that “mowing” is the symbol of all those dumb tasks that military men had to withstand.  Armed force is a place with absolute obedience and, on the other hand, absolute bureaucracy, and the Chinese military is one of the most bureaucratic and formalistic armed forces in the world. This reflects on how it treats its own personnel, especially the “professionals” - officers. One of the most notorious wordings in the PLA is “if a soldier is let to be idle, he will get himself into an incident”(兵闲着就会出事). Therefore, to prevent his soldiers from incidents that may risk the career of the CO himself, a commanding officer is always issuing orders to his subordinates to fulfill some completely-nonsense tasks, just to kill their time. This includes (and not limited to): Physical labors.Dealing with the personal issue for the commanding officers his staff members. *Cleaning jobs. (e.g. mowing).**Overseeing automobile operations.***Compiling (usually just making-up) various reports and records.etc, etc.*A soldier/officer could be asked by his superior to do grocery shopping, pick up kids after school, moving furniture or attend to a dinner party. **Some military units even refuse to purchase mowing machines just to extend the time of their soldiers spent on it. ***Under the regulation of the PLA, any vehicle, with its engine on, must have an officer sitting in the front passenger seat. This is referred to as “automobile overseeing”(带车). In the anti-intellectualism environment of the Chinese military, medical officers and technology officers are more often driven into such tasks, rather than fulfilling their own job.  In a Taiwanese version of a GI Jose scene in Family Guy, when asked about what had been learned after joining the (ROC) Army, the answer is: “I’m good at sweeping leaves and making up files”. It had to be noticed that the scene was created to satire the environment of the ROC (Taiwanese) Army, one of the major rivals of the PLA. It is shockingly amazing how these bureaucratic nonsense work just the same between two idealogical-confronting armed forces… PLA officers had a strong negative opinion on these formalistic and bureaucratic practices, but such practices are even worsened after the military reform since 2014, when more and more political-loyalty emphasis, therefore more and more formalistic rubbish, were introduced into the rank. This resulted in lower morale and a higher willingness to quit inside PLA officer corps.",2021-03-03T20:03:09.665Z,"What are some things that only a person in the Chinese military would understand?

The central pay commission before flooring the final recommendation undergoes several conference in which representatives from all the services argue about the recommendations with reasons and analysis. The Brigadier who was representing the Indian Armed forces, quoted that if you remove the pension from Indian Armed Forces then people will stop coming to this profession. Why? The profession offers you various privileges in which one of them is pension. If you serve for the nation for a fix stipulated time then only you become eligible to draw pension. In Army, the minimum qualification required to join as tradesmen is 8th pass, for general duty it is 10th pass and for clerk, nursing assistant, technician the minimum qualification required is 12th pass. If these people after serving in army goes out in civil to seek job then they will not find an equivalent salary paid job what government was giving. Just imagine a 8th class pass in 2019 drawing 27000 rupees at an age of 18. The same individual becomes eligible for retirement after serving for 15 to 17 years. His salary drawn around 15 to 17 years of service will be around 50k including all the allowances and taxes. If the same individual with such a low qualification goes in civil sector to seek job, he will not get a job of the Same salary stature. That is saddening as he has a family by now, he would had purchased house, he has to teach his kids. Considering all this, if pension is given to him and then he finds a job in civil area then in total he will be drawing a decent monthly salary to live a standard of life which he deserves to live with his family after serving for nation. Lot of young people join as jawan knowing that after 15 years they will get pension and then they can live a good life in civil society may be doing farming, micro-business, may pursue higher education while drawing pension and get a higher job. A pension gives him a boost after leaving the job. Also, consider this, he has served in various hard areas, operational areas, and he has kept his life on stake so that the country remains safe. Therefore, he deserves to get pension. Remove the privilege of the pension and many people will not consider armed forces after seeing its hardship as the first choice of service as people today are doing. To attract youngsters to join as jawans who has highest physical standards, one of the attraction kept among many is pension. In case of officers; an officer comes after doing graduation, most of them graduated in professional degrees of engineering, BSC, BA, MA, MBA, MBBS and many more. Many of them comes from reputed universities of India and they have joined armed forces leaving heavy packages. One of my course mate was working in ONGC PSU and left the job to join armed forces as he was attracted to various perks and privileges along with nature of job. I was working in HP research and development as firmware engineer in Bangalore, and left the job and heavy package as I was attracted to the perks and privileges which also offers pension. In my SSB, one of the candidate was from IIT Kanpur and he was highly motivated to join army as an officer. Even army in its notification highlights the perks and privileges offered. Majority of youngsters after graduation wants to join a fruitful career. Remove pension, and there will be a change in craze among youngsters towards armed forces. This is harsh truth which many people won’t accept but reality is this only. To attract highly educated people who can lead the men and run administration, pension is kept as one of the privileges out of many. The 6th CPC, had considered these points highlighted and pension was removed from all the government organisations and introduced contributory pension scheme in which the employee has to contribute from his salary for the pension. Only, Army, navy and Air Force were spared just because we cannot compromise on our war machines. Tomorrow, the situation may change and even the pension will get removed when the peace situation will prevail between India and Pakistan, India and China.

I have a Chindian (Chinese-Indian) friend who was in the army and was sent to the US to study engineering on the government’s tab. I was pleasantly surprised at that opportunity, until he told me that he was chosen because he speaks good English and the army couldn’t afford the embarrassment of sending someone who couldn’t speak the language well. The work culture is also seen to be slow. If one starts out working in the private sector, joining government service could be a culture shock. But this is not to be taken as painting the whole service with the same brush. I think how a government department shapes up has a lot to do with the big boss - directors and heads of department. Top down- they need to set an example and demand the best from their staff, no excuses or ‘kesian’ (‘pity’ - it’s very hard to get rid of non-performing staff compared to the private sector). The Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) for example, is one of the best run offices, from IT infrastructure to counter service. Looking at the way the new government is operating - most of the ministers are fast in getting to the ground to improve things (the Cabinet is also more multi-racial)- hopefully government service will become more attractive to the ethnic Chinese and other races.

That meant that a higher percentage of test pilots in the late 1950s had a Purdue degree and that meant the school was well represented in the early corps of astronauts.

That kept the Purdue percentage higher in the initial astronauts chosen for the Space Shuttle program. And the cycle continued. Studying at Purdue does not make you more qualified to be an astronaut. Wanting to be an astronaut makes it more likely you’ll study at Purdue. But I think the Purdue influence is fading.

In my previous company, we had an urgent requirement for a Xamarin developer. Back then, Xamarin used to new technology, 8 out of 10 resume which I got from HR was filled with bogus/fake/insufficient experiences. But then I got this profile of Mr. Vijendra. What a resume it was, Top NIT guy with 10+ years of experience in Mobility, in bold letters it read “Won Microsoft Xamarin Hackathon”, “Certified Xamarin developer” et all. Naive me, didn’t even bother to ask him a single pertinent question, the image which I carried after going through his resume didn’t allow me ask any tough technical question. I sort of assumed whatever I know he knows ten times in that area.  First day of his joining. Me: “Vijay, you got the 'git’ access, kindly go through the codebase, for any doubt just ping me, I will explain.” Vijay: “Sure man”. He kept himself busy for next 2 days, didn't, bother me for once, and I thought *Champ, got it all figured out himself, impressive*. 3rd day of his joining. “Who wrote this code man?” “Team has done it, why?” “You call it codebase? It is shit load of garbage man” Hearing this, I felt like someone just punched me straight on my nose, there was no team, I alone have coded it all, and I am a guy who takes extra care of design and abstraction. His word made me realise *I have miles to go before I can call myself a developer*. Gulping down the insult, I said “That’s why you are hired sir, guide us hehehe”. That whole day, I went through my code to find out what went so wrong, unable to figure out, I thought let’s take some help so I called Mr. Sachin, who was my tech lead in Wipro days. That very night I got my code reviewed from Sachin over Skype, he said “Man, you have done a brilliant job, it looks like official Xamarin repo.” While I got my confidence back, but I didn't fully recover, thought of meeting Vijay tomorrow again, kept me disturbed. 4th day of his joining. I was waiting for him to come to me because I didn't want more insults. And he did come, but not alone, he was accompanied with our technical manager. As usually beaming with confidence, he said “Saket, we need to start from scratch man. This codebase is shit, I had one to one with Vivek(manager) and I have shown him the code, he agrees with me.” This was limit, I looked at Vivek to seek the explanation, it was my three month of effort, how can someone scrap it like that? Vivek said, Saket let’s look for the future, I know, Xamarin was new for you, it happens. We need to deliver on the industry’s standard. I never expected my manager to say that. I said, “Look Sir, Xamarin company started in 2011, and I am working on it from 2013, so no, I am not new to it, also I would like a proper explanation from Vijay on the quality of the code before scraping it all.” Vivek gave a blank stare to Vijay, and this new guy was ready with his dialogue as if he was prepared for anything. “Saket, this is regressive attitude. When a guy twice your experience suggests something, he does it with responsibility, not to demean you.” I was dumbfounded, I didn't know how to counter this patronising behaviour, so I had to let it go.  Next day, I went to Vivek and directly said I won't work along side Vijay, because to me that code still works and unless someone explains me why should a working copy of code be disposed I won’t like to be part of it. What Vivek said made us burst into laughter. He said, “cool down Saket, your champion was not able to restore “Nuget” packages and other dll dependencies, he is getting 2000+ compile time errors. I just want him to start anything, I am pretty sure we have hired a guy who wouldn’t last 1 month.” [For non technical people: he just failed to setup working environment] Long story short, Vijay couldn't even setup the project in 2 weeks, in 3rd week he went on leave, come back after 3 weeks only to put the paper, served one month notice period, and went on to doom some other IT company. Lesson learned: NIT/IIT, this certificate/ that certificate, years of experience, recommendations whatever fuck, should not be taken on the face value, not in Indian IT industry.

In fact, at certain times, they can have the highest rate of military service for any American ethnic group. There is an in-depth book on this specific subject if anyone is interested:  However, for those that just want a summary or answer to this broad question, I’d suggest that it is a combination of a few things, but primarily it is a certain cultural value. As others have pointed out, there is certainly a continuation of a particular warrior tradition. As traditional warfare (and the Indian Wars era) waned, Natives joined the military to continue certain aspects of this tribal warrior culture. Basically, it is how one might gain warrior status in the modern era. And the community continued to respect warriors. However, it is a bit different than an intense flag-waving, overly-patriotic kind of thing. It’s more nuanced, in other words. In fact, you can see an example of how Natives might have a multi-faceted view of the the US and the military… Check out this video of grand entry at a veterans powwow, where they slide the 7th Cav banner on the floor (or step on it). Notice how many vets are there, directly involved in this?  This would be unheard of in any other context for veterans. But, these are Native American vets. There is a different context here. And they make no apologies for this ceremony, nor should they. Likewise, you’ll notice that in many powwow grand entries when they bring in the flags…the eagle staffs will come in first, in front of the US flag. This is because many Natives feel like joining the US military is by extension protecting their own tribal nations. But, they might have a primary focus on being tribal first, and American second (although, this can vary from individual to individual).  The other aspect about economic disadvantages probably holds true for all communities. Joining the military can be a way to gain education, training, a steady paycheck, benefits, etc. However, I’d disagree with the notion that this is primarily a way of escaping poverty and supposed rampant dysfunction. That’s a stereotype, to blanket across 500+ different tribes. Totally inappropriate. No, I think there are stronger cultural influences that propel Natives to join, rather than some kind of negative connotation - espoused in answers such as this:  This is fucking insulting, first of all. Victimhood mentalities? Alcohol abuse? I guarantee few people would make that statement at a Native veterans powwow or directly to the face of a large, grisly Native combat veteran. Look, it’s basically just “warriors doing warrior shit.” Pretty simple, really. Continue Reading",2021-03-03T20:08:44.329Z,"Why do Native Americans seem to join the military at such high rates?

As kids, we all dream of being a superhero and saving the world, as we grow up and become realistic we realize, superhero are fiction but heroes are for real and who are these heroes might you ask? None other than the soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces! May be being a superhero is stuff for kids but one can always be a hero by joining the defence services and save the nation from dangerous enemies- internal as well as external. This is why the popularity of the armed forces as the numero uno career option is sky high! Here are top 5 reasons why youth is crazy about this way of life: 1. Adventurous life : Do you want to sky dive? Do you love shooting? Are adventure sports your calling? Do you dream of being air-dropped on top of a building? If you feel adrenaline rushing to your brain as you read this, then congratulations! You are no different that the millions who dream of joining the armed forces and leading this life. 2. The Uniform : Well, who doesn’t love looking smart in a fitting uniform duly decorated with stars and medals? Imagine the self-image boost when you would look into a mirror and see a soldier with royal looks being reflected back! For most of the youth, the uniform is a big part of the attraction towards defence services. Also, it is a proud moment for their parents to see them in those brilliant colors on the day of their passing out parade or the day when they finally become officers. 3. Awesome pay package : Let’s face it, not much job satisfaction can be achieved without a good salary coming in by the end of the month. With the implementation of the 7th pay commission, the salaries of the defence personnel are set to rise still higher. Most of the cadets these days buy lavish cars within first few months of joining. While the rest of their friends are stuck at low paying jobs which demand a lot of office hours, our brave young soldiers take time out to take their new Chevrolet for a spin! 4. Perks over and above the pay : The lavish government bungalow, exclusive schools and colleges, canteen services, medical facilities, travel allowances, reservations in trains, flights and even some colleges! More than anything else, the safety of cantonment! These seem to be more than enough reasons to lure even the thickest of the youth towards the armed forces. It is also about the respect that one gets as defence personnel that makes the youth regard these services as the best career choice available. 5. Service to the nation : The youth is idealistic. We want our lives to have greater meaning than just collecting money. Youth want to leave their mark, to do something above average and unique. Joining the armed forces provides them the opportunity to serve the nation like no other job option. Providing service to the nation by dedicating one’s life to it elevates the person to the status of a hero. This is truly a noble cause worth dying for. For the passionate and honest youth, there can be no better career option than the great Indian Armed Forces. If, during school functions, blood rushed through your body and tears of pride came in your eyes during the hoisting of the national flag, then what are you waiting for? This is the best career option you can dream of! It will be the one path of achieving all that you wanted and all that you thought was possible. jai hind. Who wouldn’t like to live a dream?

A few days after the beheading, Indian Army discovered a video clip from a Pakistani militant who was killed in an encounter while crossing into Kashmir, showing Pakistanis standing around the severed heads of Adhikari and Singh displayed on raised platform. The Hindu has a copy of the video. After repeated recce over two months, the Army launched Operation Ginger on Tuesday, August 30. According to one of those involved in the operation, “We decided on Tuesday because in the past, including in Kargil war (of 1999) we always tasted victory on this day. We deliberately planned the operation just a day before the Eid as it was the time when Pakistanis least expected a retaliation,” he said.For the strike, about 25 soldiers, mainly Para Commandos, reached their launch-pad at 3 a.m. on August 29 and hid there until 10 p.m. They then crossed over the Line of Control to reach close to Police Chowki. By 4 a.m. on August 30, the planned day of the attack, the ambush team was deep within the enemy territory waiting to strike. Over the next hour, claymore mines were placed around the area and the commandos took positions for the ambush, waiting for clearance through secure communication route. At 7 a.m. , the troops saw four Pakistani soldiers, led by a Junior Commissioned Officer, walking towards the ambush site. They waited till the Pakistanis reached the site then detonated the mines. In the explosions all four were grieviously injured. Then the raiding commandos lobbed grenades and fired at them.One of the Pakistani soldiers fell into a stream that ran below. Indian soldiers rushed to chop off the heads of the other three dead soldiers. They also took away their rank insignias, weapons and other personal items. The commandos then planted pressure IED’s beneath one of the bodies, primed to explode when anyone attempted to lift the body. Hearing the explosions, two Pakistani soldiers rushed from the post but were killed by a second Indian team waiting near the ambush site. Two other Pakistani army men tried to trap the second team but a third team covering them from behind eliminated the two, says an official report. While the Indian soldiers were retreating, another group of Pakistani soldiers were spotted moving from Police Chowki towards the ambush site. Soon they heard loud explosions, indicating the triggering of the IEDs planted under the body, according to the report. According to assessment, at least two to three more Pakistani soldiers were killed in that blast. The operation had lasted 45 minutes, and the Indian team left the area by 7.45 a.m. to head back across the LoC. The first team reached an Indian army post at 12 noon and the last party by 2.30 p.m.. They had been inside enemy territory for about 48 hours, including for reconnaissance. At least eight Pakistani troops had been killed and another two or three more Pakistani soldiers may have been fatally injured in the action. Three Pakistani heads — of Subedar Parvez, Havildar Aftab and Naik Imran — three AK 47 rifles and other weapons were among the trophies carried back by the Indian soldiers. No Traces. “But this was not without the heart pounding moments. We got a message on our secure line that one of our jawans accidentally fell on a mine and blew his finger while exfiltrating. Till the time you have seen the person, it was difficult to say what exactly could have happened. He came back safely with his buddies,” said the source. The severed heads were photographed, and buried on the instructions of senior officers. Two days later one of the senior most Generals in the command asked the team about the heads. “When he came to know that we had buried them, he was furious and asked us to dig up the heads, burn them and throw the ashes into the Kishenganga, so that no DNA traces are left behind. We did so,” said the source. ………. My mom asks me why I keep trying for Defence sector even after getting conferenced out in SSB. There are many other higher paying and comfortable job than it. And the reason is this. Working with such a fearless and professional force is not only about getting a high paying job. It's all about pride and honour which is far more soul satisfying than working for someone else.  Better dying with brothers than living with strangers.

Some of the fellow quorans have given very valid points explaining that the Doctors in forces are respected and treated well. However, there is a flipside to the coin as well…. In my experiene, the authority to ‘downgrade’ serving personnel on medical grounds is sometimes the ONLY reason someone respects an AMC Officer. First, the trivial things — I have seen several Officers from other Arms and Services making fun of AMC Officers on the lines of “they know only how to prescribe Paracetamol”. Oftentimes, this is not mere fun and games but directed mockery. Also, going by the adage that “anything that you get for free is mostly ignored and undervalued” … the opinion of the Military Doctors is often neglected, medicines prescribed are taken half-heartedly and the treatment abruptly discontinued — in order to consult a civilian doctor — who, more often than not, advises practically the same treatment — after a battery of tests. [A generic example — Day 1 : “Doctor, my child is not feeling well.” ,(Doctor, after examination, says that it is a self-limiting illness and will go away in 4–5 days… prescribes symptomatic treatment.” Day 2: “Doctor, the medicines you gave are not working, I am taking the child to a civilian specialist” … the civ specialist conducts blood tests, concludes that it is a self-limiting disease, but still prescribes antibiotics ‘just to be safe’. Day 5: “Doctor, it was good that we took the child outside, she’s feeling fine now.” #facepalm ]  Good natured jibes apart, the most important example of discrimination against the AMC is the DACP case — Dynamic Assured Career Progression — under 6th CPC, all central government doctors — including those serving in uniform with BSF, CRPF and Assam Rifles — were cleared to receive promotion at regular service intervals. However, the same was denied to AMC on the pretext that “it will hamper the command and control issues” and then later citing that “Armed Forces doctors are not ‘Doctors’, but ‘Officers’ . As a result, an Infantry Officer faces selection board and may become a Colonel at 14 years of service or so, but an AMC Officer has to wait till 18 years to face that selection board — compare this with other Doctors in Uniform — who become entitled to at least the pay and perks of equivalent rank in 13 years. The dichotomy in the above is for all to clearly see and comprehend. The case has been heard in Armed Forces Tribunal and a decision in favor of the Doctors has been given — in 2011 — the implementation has been kept in limbo ever since by the MoD and the Armed Forces HQs … at present, the case is under process at the Supreme Court. Lastly, AMC officers and AMC Units (Hospitals etc.) are often seen as “Soft” — implying that they are not battle-worthy or battle ready and their personnel are not good enough at soldierly duties. On the contrary, the Medical Officer on attachment with any Infantry unit is often, in my experience, one of the most diligent and active members of the unit and is frequently tasked with administrative jobs like being the Adjutant and even Rifle Company commander when there is a dearth of Officers.

I hear this so often from people who believe that the military makes people qualified individuals. It doesn’t. It gives them some good habits, but six months out, that stellar Marine could be just another everyday slob. Generally, veterans are better off for their experience because one thing the military does is give them some fairly extreme challenges, mostly in the training, which gives people the confidence to believe they can do anything. This is drive, but it isn’t discipline. The people who are the worst about this are people who say things like, “The military will straighten him out.” They seem to think that the military takes losers and makes them into contributing members of society. Sorry, but you can’t make a delicious cake from rotten eggs. We die into our adulthood by killing off the parts of us as children that are potential paths we will walk as adults. Many people by the time they are 18 have already killed off the potential to be amazing people. A few, a few, will find potential in the military that they couldn’t have had in the outside but they are lucky. Most of the people I know who entered because they thought they were losers and that the military would make them superstars leave the military as losers… and some with a Dishonorable Discharge if not a massive record jacket filled with marks against their service for bad behavior and decision making. The people who do great in the military are those who enter, but are already great. They may not be the fittest or the most confident, but they are motivated by more than the fact that they failed at everything else. They want to be great because they were the competitive type in High School, so they did the hardest thing anyone could throw at them. They wanted to serve their country to carry on a tradition in a family that they want to make proud. Maybe they came from a poor town where colleges never noticed their potential, so they wanted opportunity after service. Maybe they wanted a way to take care of their family. All of these are good reasons to join and why people like that do well in the military. But the losers? I knew a few who turned it around, but just as many who crashed and burned. Worse, they were bad on the whole unit, making it harder for everyone. Whether you just fix computers or are in the infantry, that’s bad, but for some units a bad member of the team is downright deadly. If that’s you, and you know if it is, don’t bother the military until you get your life in order. They aren’t your dad or your psychologist. They are people who need the best, and until you have the potential to be that guy, please don’t burden them with your failures.",2021-03-03T20:13:43.415Z,"What are some bad reasons to join the military?

The US has had weeks of protests across the country. Some have been actively encouraged by the US president, in states where the Democrats are in power:  Not to mention that we are all globally in a pandemic at the moment, and so unlike usual, certain US states have made large gatherings illegal. So yes, the US government response has been very dysfunctional, but largely in the opposite way of what you are insinuating. By contrast, while China makes it much harder to share videos uncensored with the rest of the world, videos that have leaked about people breaking quarantine actually appear to be relatively tame. Here is an example of one of the most “brutal"" Wuhan arrest videos I could find. It's not so dissimilar from many takedowns in the US, except that there are no guns involved, and they don't ever strike the person being arrested. Note: some still may find this uncomfortable to watch.  This YouTube account owner labeled this video as “Police brutality continues"". I don't know the circumstances of this women's arrest. But I have seen numerous videos of US police treating people far worse than that. Like this recent one of a white police officer with his knee on the neck of a black man, telling him tauntingly to get into the car (of course he can't, because his neck is pinned to the ground by the officer's knee). That man later died. Warning: this video may also be very uncomfortable to watch.  But I can still say China is totalitarian with how it controls the media and society - which is true - while the US is less totalitarian in that regard. While I wouldn't doubt that police brutality may frequently be worse in the US than China, I also realize that China makes greater use of surveillance technologies to track people and ruin the lives of political dissidents, as well as their families. And I'm not sure that arresting the family members of dissidents or those accused of crimes is any better than out right brutality against individual suspects. For instance: Guilty by association: China targets relatives of dissident exiled in Canada I do have more hope for the US though, since I believe that they have better mechanisms in place in their society for bringing problems like police brutality to the surface, so they can be addressed, rather than suppressing them. This is why the 1st amendment to the US Constitution - the right to free speech - is held in such high regard. It has the capacity to bring awareness to the darkest aspects of society, and that is why many countries suppress free speech. But suppressing problems usually doesn't make them go away.

He was in the Reserves there, too, through Korea and Vietnam, rising to the rank of Brigadier General, only retiring after 27 years in the US Military, active and reserve, in 1968. I forgot to mention in my earlier comments that, as a result of staying in the Air Force Reserves, Stewart was very a great believer in bombers during the early days of the Cold War. He not only starred in Strategic Air Command in 1954, he personally made sure the movie had access to Air Force planes and ground crews, and that the film was as accurate as security allowed. He also narrated X-15, about the experimental rocket aircraft that entered the stratosphere, and did a MY THREE SONS episode as himself to promote the Air Force — in the story a friend of Fred MacMurray’s widower aeronautics engineer. James Stewart got one more post-service promotion — when his friend Ronald Reagan, as President, introduced him as “Major General James Stewart”. Stewart said nothing at the time, but the next day sent Reagan a note, “Thank you for the promotion, Mr. President — I was a Brigadier General until last night!” Reagan laughed and showed the note around to his White House staff and reporters — then put the wheels in motion to give Stewart that promotion anyway.

Texas: Texas has always been known as the provider of finest military recruits in the US army which can be dated back to WW2 history. Texas A&M Corps Of Cadets No. 3 Among Military Schools — more specifically the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets — is ranked No. 3 nationally in Top 10 military schools in America.  At the time of World War 2, Texans were voluntarily enlisting in greater numbers than any other state by 1941, and by 1943 there were 750,000 Texans in uniform, including two of the most decorated soldiers among the 16 million Americans who served. He notes that there were so many Texans in the Canadian Air Force that it was referred to as the Royal Canadian Texas Air Force.  Texas A&M University is only one of three public schools with a full-time corps of cadets on campus. Nevertheless, the university’s corps of cadets is the largest in the country (with exception of the service academies), numbering about 2,250 cadets.  The school has a rich tradition of providing quality officers to the U.S. armed forces. The school has produced over 225 flag and general officers, and members of the schools corps of cadets have been involved in every American armed conflict since 1875. The school’s marching band is also the largest precision military marching band- in the world! Texas does everything big.  The corps of cadets, to give one an idea of the scope of its military program is broken down as follows: 3 Air Force wings, 3 Army brigades, 2 Navy and Marine regiments, and the Fighting Texas Aggie Band. As a result, the university produces more commissioned officers for the U.S. armed forces than any other school outside of the service academies. Both states have contributed significantly to the Armed forces and it has been marked in history with golden letters. Due to the similarities in love, passon, grit, integrity and respect towards Armed Forces they are called as the synonyms of each other which is still not known by many.

Not found anything yet. Egypt of Ptolemus (Bible:) ’Everything came out from Egypt’ (Ptolemus=Greek). As a child and adult he did study in the Temple. This 14 generationsJew origin gifted person, all he understood from the texts of Temple is to “correct the mistakes of Judaism and clean religious tradition from dirt(influence) of the Greek polytheism”. Bible :“When he saw them approaching him, He said: now is time for glory of the Lord”(them=Greeks). In what language DID HE TALKED TO them,did he use Philippos? And his pupil in Christianity, Apostle of Nations,Jew himself, Saul, established these new ideas in W. Asia Minor, in Hellenic Ionia, where the real Christianity belongs(7‘Churches’ in all). Reading Gospel of Ioannis you can think that’s written by a Greek team. And yes old Jewish dna for the Christ, but, to be honest, someone went too far and in the person (scapegoat) of Judas, incorporated a whole nation. It was just the establishment(*). Go explain this last detail to fanatical masses of ex Gentiles. And as is natural,after that, they turn against their own’blood’: Eudoxia, mother in law of the not’great’emperor Const/ne in a letter,address to latter, in early 320sad,from Near East, wrote’come clean Jerusalem because we are inundated by the tens and tens of Temples of the Greeks!’. ((And he came, together with Helena. Helena starts to pay workers gold to dig,so much gold that ‘naturally’ workers discovered, among other, a cross. The Cross ! If you've been in Jerusalem , the guides are showing even today a window, from where ‘Santa’ Helena was throwing gold coins for the digging and archaeologists can indicate to you where it took place biggest resurrection(!) shuffle in the History of this city, mostly demolition and re use of building materials for ‘new’ Temples, almost identical sometimes for ex Gentile population to digest and accustom to ‘new’ style, easier, with less problems. Costantine cleaned alright))  (*)Religious establishment (:Sanhedrin) exterminated Him & that doesn't mean that Jewish population loved Him. They (=fanatic rabble for example), could easily think, that he was with pro Hellenized Jews. Or pro Parthian (See 3 Parthian Kings in His birth) or both (Parthian Kings has title “Philhellin”). Religiously and Political wise, obviously anti Roman, since Sanhedrin invited Rome in Judea or it didn’t happened like this?

I prophesy to you this evil man will plunge our Reich into the abyss and will inflict immeasurable woe on our nation..."" The two highest ranking officers in Germany at this time were holdovers from the days of President Hindenburg; Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, the Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, and General Werner von Fritsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. These stiff-lipped men with their rigid codes of honor were about to be toppled by that most vile of all things from their point of view, personal scandals involving sex. The new wife of Von Blomberg had a police record of prostitution and had posed for pornographic pictures. Von Fritsch was being blackmailed about a homosexual encounter earlier in his career.

Reading Books (self-help genre): This is the favourite pass-time of college going girls/boys of reading personality development books called as self-help books. Many armed forces officers also read these books. Books like the 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen covey; Emotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman; How to influence people and make friends by Dale Carniege etc.Simulated hacking practice on Kali Linux: Those who have computers can try their hands on Kali Linux (penetration testing software). As, we are entering the age of cyberwarfare, this hobby is sure to catch the attention of the ssb panel. This is a very technical thing and lots of questions can be asked to check technical knowledge.Learning Foreign language: I read on quora a girl had written answer on civil service interview experience where she said she had written learning foreign languages as hobby and was asked to say a sentence in 2/3 foreign languages she had learned. The panel was amazed on how she translated the sentence correctly and on asking how did she prepare, she replied just by using internet- YouTube videos, websites, blogs etc.As far as, Indian armed forces are concerned it is appreciated if you have knowledge of foreign languages like Russian, Arabic, Urdu, Phastun, Mandarin etc (for obvious reasons that we have to deal with countries like Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia etc. Knowledge of Spainish, French does not have much importance). Trekking: The best way to gain knowledge (practical) is by traveling place. You can start developing trekking as hobby but it requires a considerable amount of money.The best starting point for Trekking is going for a YHAI (Youth Hostels Association of India) organized trek (Dalhousie trek in Nov./Dec./Jan.; Sar pass trek in May- this is the most famous trek of YHAI).Also, there are YHAI local units that organize local treks. The best part comes when you are well trained in trekking and now you yourself organize treks to local places. (This shows leadership qualities and higher organisation abilities).

For example, in electronics and mechanical engineer corps- a women officer starts her career as workshop 2nd-in-command or Officer in command of technical section or adjutant. In all the appointment, the women officer is commanding the troops. Now, keep this whole paragraph in your mind, we will talk about it later. Women officers have commanded major and minor unit in various corps or services which I think very few civilians are aware of it. For example, few years back commandant of Command Hospital, Lucknow was a women officer. I have seen many women officer holding appointment of Officer-in-command of electronics and mechanical engineer workshops. I have also seen them holding appointment of Officer-in-command of signal company (basically dealing with telecommunication technology). One women officer also commanded an independent electronics and mechanical engineer advance workshop. Now, coming to your question. Yes, women officers should be given command appointments as they have already commanded body of troops of various strength from a platoon equivalent to a battalion equivalent. As they are getting permanent commission in their respective arms and services; the women officers fulfilling the requirement of command criteria should be considered with their men counterpart with uniform conditions.

To my mind, a job which provides an opportunity to do meaningful work is really worth joining. A job which not only provides you with a steady income but also is an learning experience in itself. We need to Work not only to earn but also to learn. I'll tell you what you can learn and what you will earn from a life as an Assistant Commandant in the CAPF WHAT YOU LEARN : Value System : CAPF is an Armed force of the Union. It shares the ethos of all armed forces : Discipline, Can do Attitude, Sacrifice,Courage and Honor. The experience of life in the Armed Forces inevitably means you imbibe these qualities in you. As an Uttarakhandi (The state produces mannny Faujis) and a person who has seen 3 generations of my family (My Grandfather to my Cousins) in the Armed forces or the police I have personally been witness to relatives possessing such character and integrity from close quarters.  Pledging allegiance to Bharat Mata. Taking an oath to serve the country with honor and pride. Leadership Opportunity: As an AC you will be appointed the Company Commander as soon as you join the force. This means you get to lead around 110 to 135 Jawans at a young age (mid 20s). This is not only an honorable opportunity but a huge responsibility - providing leadership to efficient , disciplined and well trained Jawans with prime fitness level . Joining as an AC will give you an unmatched leadership opportunity that no Civil jobs, no motivational seminars , not even a management degree can provide.  Every Man : A leader Discipline : A life in the forces means a life of discipline. This is probably the most important factor that separates Civilians from the Armed force personnel.  Discipline : A sine qua non for the CAPFs Discipline not only aids motivation but in the longer run discipline itself starts generating motivation. For example : One may shy away from working out but is determined and disciplined enough to hit the gym. After a period of time, as results start showing (due to discipline) the person becomes motivated to continue going to the gym. (Discipline creates motivation). Life as a CAPF AC is more disciplined than anything ever could be. You will learn discipline and apply it's magic to whatever you want to achieve. Service to the Nation : You are serving the society by instilling a sense of Security and safety in the people. Whether working in the NDRF (All battalions deputed from CAPF) for disaster management or fighting the terrorists or Naxals ; CAPFs provide an unparalleled service to the Nation. You will learn the power of selfless actions and sacrifice while serving as an AC.  NDRF : Ready to serve always Now coming to the other part of the answer ; WHAT YOU WILL EARN : Respect : Faujis earn respect as a result of the service they provide to the society. At a time when people are skeptical about the integrity of the Bureaucrats, Politicians or what have you ; the respect and awe for the Armed forces is still intact. As a part of member of the CAPF family you will immediately gain that respect.  Respect for CRPF AC USHA Kiran : The first ever female AC won the Vogue women of the Year Award. Salary and Power : This aspect is unfortunately the one which shapes the general perception of the aspirants/ people. There are certain issues with the CAPF in this respect. When it comes to salary CAPF AC is on par with the other Central Civil Services. It is a grade A gazzeted post with similar perks to other Civil Services. When it comes to power the IPS being an Organised Service (Greater Deputation opportunities) has an edge over the CAPFs. Lack of such status to the CAPFs creates stagnation wrt promotions and is demoralizing for the officers. The issue is yet to be finalised, so I won't talk about the issue any more. However one must keep in mind that CAPFs being under the control of the Union and not the states are relatively free from political interference and have better facilities wrt the State Police. The Best of both worlds : CAPFs provides the life of a Fauji while providing the safety and security of a Civilian Government job. That is; while a CAPF AC enjoys the pride and dignity of the uniform and is trained accordingly ; he/she simultaneously has an assured career path with good pay, dearness allowance , a chance to serve till the age of 60 years and Non functional Pay (NFP) offered by a civilian job.  Black Cat Commandos (NSG). You can even join these badasses through the CAPF. Final Words : Hence overall after considering all the factors above there is no doubt to my mind that indeed CAPF is worth joining. In fact CAPF AC is an excellent career opportunity that pays well and teaches even better. TL;Dr : Definitely. UPSC CAPF is definitely worth joining. It provides a chance to wear the uniform , teaches the ethos of a fauj, simultaneously coming with the perks of a Civilian Govt employee. Hope to see you in the force!  Jai Hind!!

Though a newly commissioned officer might earn much more than his civilian counterparts, the salary stagnates with no real increment as compared to corporates. In terms of perks, privileges and quality of life, the forces are way superior, but as long as things aren't  quantified in monetary terms, people tend to overlook such aspects. Rigorous Selection Process-  this is perhaps the most important point. To get into the forces, you need to clear an exam, followed by the Service Selection Board (SSB) Process and Medical Evaluation. The SSBs are known to take the best lot of people, who are evaluated along various intelligence and psychological parameters. The idea of selection isn't to fill up the vacancies but to take the suitable. There is never a compromise upon the standards of selection . To add to this, a couple of years back a similar observation was made wherein it was pointed out by the PMO that the Army was functioning with a strength of 36,000 ( current fig is 38,000) against the sanctioned strength of 46,000 officers. The media hype created around this issue questioned the rationale behind such selection when army was running short of officers . In a certain response  by a retired officer in some forum, he had lined up a point which stated that ' The Indian Army is not the Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Yojna, wherein as per vacancies people maybe inducted. The Army adheres to certain standards and shall continue to do so'.  Solutions to this issue:- Better salaryThough this idea may seem far fetched, but general economic progress of the country will help decrease the shortage. I say this because once we are able to reach a stage wherein Army isn't seen as ' just another job' to gain certain perks and privileges, people will contrive to enlist so as to serve the country in the real sense.

I will do the comparison only for the personal interview, and not for any other activity or test that is conducted in these selection processes apart from the interview.  Disclaimer: I have done this comparison according to my experiences. These are my personal opinions and observations. 1.Duration- IIM: 10 mins to 25 mins. There is not any fixed duration for IIM interviews.SSB: 45 mins to 90 mins. Usually interviews of most of the candidates last in this range.2. Structure- IIM: IIM interviews are completely random. You will be expecting that the panelists will ask you questions on academics, but you might end up discussing about what is wrong in the design of the building visible from the window.SSB: SSB interview is a bit structured. You will be asked questions on your background, family, personal life, experiences etc. You will be asked about your opinions on different matters. My observation was that time is allotted for different types of questions.3. Types of question- IIM: Mostly, the questions are asked on your academic stream, current affairs, background, career goals, business, economics and self. Questions are unpredictable.SSB: Again, you cannot predict what can be asked. However, most of the questions are on yourself. Very deep introspection is required for that. Questions are also on the candidate’s background, family, experiences, armed forces, current affairs etc.4. Number of panelists- IIM: 2 to 3 (up to 5 in some B-schools interview). The panel mostly consists of a faculty, industry expert, or an alumni.SSB: One. The interviewer is an officer from the armed forces.5. Interaction- IIM: In an IIM interview, you might have an interesting conversation with the panel just like you have with your friends. On the other hand, it can be also a grilling session that can become the worst memory of yours.SSB: SSB interview is very disciplined. You will be in the room for 1 hour in a serious atmosphere. Don’t expect the interviewer to laugh on your joke.6. Manipulation- IIM: Since, IIM interviews are shorter in duration, sometimes they can be steered according to you. You can make the interviewer ask you questions according to your interest.SSB: As the SSB interview is more structured, the interviewer doesn’t care much about you. You will be asked what he wants.7. Details- IIM: Again, because of the shorter duration, the interviewers will rarely ask about the minor details of the experiences or incidents that you share.SSB: There is no scope of lying here. If you mention anything carelessly, a lot of minor details will be asked and if you are lying, the interviewer will recognize in a moment.8. Expectations- IIM: IIMs expect the candidates to have decent communication skills, understanding of the concepts learned in the past, and clarity about the future and goals.SSB: It is very difficult to say what are the expectations in an SSB interview. According to me, they need the candidate to have a good personality and commitment to the armed forces. They need a person who can be trained for the armed forces with 1-1.5 years of training.IIM and SSB interviews are very different from each other because of the different expectations from the candidate.

To begin with, Indian Muslims do in fact join the Indian Army. Contrary to Gen K.M. Cariappa--- the first Indian Army Chief, who believed that Muslims would never be loyal to India, Indian Muslims such as Abdul Hamid have made significant contributions to India’s defence. However, in accordance with recent unofficial estimates of the Indian Muslim population within the Indian Army, Muslims make only 1-3% of the Army as a whole. There are three primary factors which contribute to this low percentage: the Fatwa-e-Jahandari, the Martial Races Theory, and the Partition of India.  Fatwa-e-Jahandari In accordance with the Fatwa-e-Jahandari, established in the 13th century by Ziauddin Barani, there has been a long standing caste system among Muslims established during the Delhi Sultanate. Barani’s social hierarchy was loosely based upon that of the Hindus, each caste had its own niche and contributed to Indian Society in a certain way. For centuries onward, these classifications would continue to define Indian society. As a parallel to the Hindu Kshatriya caste, the Muslim Sheikh (Brahmin/Kshatriya Converts and Arabs), Mughal (Central Asians and Kshatriya Converts), and Pathan (Pashtuns and Kshatriya Converts) castes would traditionally be the warrior groups within Indian Society, often serving Muslim sultan, nawabs, and emperors. Similarly, Barani’s Fatwa bounded the lower-castes of Indian Muslim society to their traditional occupations. In addition, Muslim warrior communities throughout Southern, Central and Eastern India were minuscule when compared to the Muslim warrior communities in the North and West; this was due to the importance of agriculture, priority of trade, and lack of conflict. While, Northern and Western India was the traditional seat of power and center of political conflict. Thus, Northern and Western India traditionally had a greater number of warrior communities, while the rest of India was abundant in mercantile communities.  Martial Races Theory When the British arrived in the Subcontinent they created three presidencies: Madras, Bengal, and Bombay. Each Presidency had its own Army which would later combine into a singular army. Prior to the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the British recruited warrior communities from all across India. In Northern and Western India these caste-communities were often Mohyal Brahmins (Punjabi), Rajputs (Rajasthani, Punjabi, and Pahari), Jats (Punjabi), Syeds (Hindustani) and Pathans (Hindustani, Awadhi); the ethnic groups they recruited regardless of caste were mostly Pashtuns and Balochis. In Eastern India, they recruited Bhumihar Brahmins (Bihari) and Rajputs (Bihari), and Gurkhas (Nepali). In Southern India[1] , most were Mughals (Dakhni), Nairs (Malayali), and Reddys (Telugu); the ethnic groups they recruited regardless of caste were mostly Kodavas. In Central India, they recruited the Marathas (Marathi) and other Rajput communities. During the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, most warrior communities of the North and West remained loyal to the British, while warrior communities from the South, East, and Central regions rebelled. However, Hindustani and Awadhi Muslims rebelled while Punjabi, Balochi, and Pashtun Muslims didn’t. Following the rebellion, the British conferred Martial Race Status[2] upon the warrior communities who didn’t rebel, most of these groups were from the North and West (Undivided Punjab, Rajasthan, Balochistan, and KPK and FATA). These communities enjoyed elite status and remained loyal to the British during much of British Raj. The Martial Race Theory was disbanded following India’s Independence in 1947. Following the Sepoy Mutiny, these Northern and Western communities would be the largest subset of the entire Indian Army. Indians who rebelled who later become the backbone of the Independence movement, alongside non-warrior communities. This is the primary reason why Bengal, Maharashtra, the United Provinces, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu would become the hotbed of the Independence Movement. The disenfranchised Hindustani Muslims were leaders of the Pakistan Movement.  Partition of India The Partition of India in 1947 divided the nation into two, one of main suppliers of the Indian Army--- Punjab would be split in half, thus causing all Muslims to leave for Pakistan and all Hindus and Sikhs to go to India. Thus, the Punjabi Muslims whose Jats and Rajputs formed a significant part of the Indian Army would now be Pakistani. The Balochi Muslims and Pashtun Muslims were also to be Pakistani. Lastly, many warrior-caste Dakhni, Hindustani, and Awadhi Muslims left India for Pakistan; most settled in Karachi.[3] In Pakistan, these warrior-caste individuals would form a majority of the Pakistani Army. For example, Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff is Qamar Javed Bajwa--- a Punjabi Jat. Similarly, retired General Raheel Sharif is a Punjabi Rajput. There is no doubt that military-inclined communities produce future soldiers in South Asia. Due to the shortage of Muslim warrior communities, as most migrated to Pakistan, the Indian Army will continue to lack Muslims. Most Indian Muslims today are a part of mercantile, agricultural, and religious castes. Today, India’s Army consists of mostly North Indians[4] , Punjab is 2.4% of India’s population but provides 16.6% of their army, similarly Himachal Pradesh is 0.6% of India’s population but provides 4.68% of the army, Haryana is only 2.2% of India’s population but provides 7.82% of the army. Whereas, Gujarat is 4.5% of India’s population but only accounts for 1.48% of the Indian Army. One consistent trend in Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh is the lack of Muslims, this is due to the fact that they all reside in Pakistan now.  There’s absolutely no evidence that remotely suggests that Indian Muslims don’t love their motherland enough to join the army. Instead, it’s extremely plausible to suggest that the lack of Muslim warrior-communities in a caste-based society like India is the primary reason for the subsequent lack of Muslims in the Indian Army. In addition, multiple sources have determined that there exists an underlying bias in the current Indian Army which favors members of former marital race; while this theory seems highly improbable due to the inclusive nature of the Indian Army, there is significant historical support for the continuation of this practice. India’s Muslims are as proud of their nationality as non-Muslim Indians. The Indian Muslim participation rate in the Indian Army is a result of historic doctrines, racist imperial laws, and geopolitics.

Thorne  Started out as a reserveSoon promoted when deservedAnd the legend has begunWith a bounty on his headThe Red Army wants him deadSoviet enemy Number One Lauri Allan Törni, native of Viipuri, Finland, was conscripted in the Finnish miltary in late 1938, and went to NCO school. He was to finish his tour of duty in December 1939, but Winter War came in-between. Törni had attained the rank of Corporal and acted as the veterinarian of his battalion. Soon his intelligence and initiative was realized, and he participated in the actual bang-bang battles with great success, going through ranks. He went to military academy in 1940, graduating as second lieutenant. He volunteered in the Waffen-SS in Germany 1941, but was repatriated in July 1941. In the Continuation War, Törni initially commanded a tank platoon, but was assigned later to head of a light battalion’s reconnaissance platoon. He proved to be extremely courageous, intelligent and being both innovative and initiative. In 1943 he was assigned to the commander a special forces company. He really was in his own element now. Detachment Törni became so successful that Stalin declared a bounty of his head. Detachment Törni consisted of long rangers, who did guerrilla strikes to Soviet rear, hunted down partisans and terrorists, and did reconnaissance and destroyed logistics. In 1944, he was awarded the Mannerheim Cross, the highest Finnish military decoration. He attained the rank of Captain. After the Armistice, Törni escaped to Germany. He was sure Finland was going to be occupied by USSR and prepared for guerrilla actions. He had previously served in the Waffen-SS, and now attained the rank of Hauptsturmführer (corresponds to captain). He returned to Finland after the war. Unbeknowst to him, the Valpo, state security police, had now been manned by Communist sympathizers, and they were after him. USSR had coerced Finland to declare an ex post facto law on people guilty of war, and joining the Germans was a high treason under the law. He was arrested and imprisoned, accused of treason. He managed to escape, and fled to Sweden. There he jumped a ship to Venezuela, where he changed to a Norwegian freighter. He jumped off the ship at Mobile, Alabama, and swam to harbour. Törni settled among American Finns in Brooklyn, doing odd jobs. His former superior, Alpo Marttinen, had gotten clue of him, and arranged him a place as a Private in the US military. Meanwhile in Finland, Törni was declared to have lost his citizenship and his officer’s rank, and issued an ABP. Törni was a natural soldier, and he quickly advanced through the ranks. He learned English, got naturalized, got citizenship and changed his name to Larry Alan Thorne. He applied to Special Forces, underwent parachute training, and eventually was admitted to officer school.  Thorne, having changed his name and abandoned his ungrateful fatherland Thorne became somewhat a legend in the Green Berets. In the age most people were well past the prime of their military career, Thorne excelled in all tasks. His most remarkable task was rescuing a helicopter at Zagros Mountains, Iran, at 4300 m altitude where all other rescue teams had failed. He was quickly promoted to Captain. USA managed to tangle itself to Vietnam quagmire, and Thorne hated Communists pathologically. He had a good reason for it: his hometown, Viipuri, had been annexed by USSR. So he volunteered to fight in Vietnam, applying his special forces’ skills and experience in Finnish forests on jungle warfare. [Tactics in taiga and jungle are actually surprisingly similar.] His incredible luck failed him eventually. His helicopter crashed on a mountainside in extremely bad weather in October 1965, killing everyone onboard instantly. He was 46. He was posthumously promoted as Major.  Törni was never forgotten by his comrades-in-arms nor the Finnish special forces. When the Parachute Rangers were founded in 1961, the old members of Detachment Törni declared the Parachute Rangers as their descendants and heirs. Törni was considered the most courageous and brave of all Mannerheim Cross awardees. President Mauno Koivisto was one of original Törni’s men. He served as a Private - later as a Corporal - on his long rangers, and he kept connection with his comrades-in-arms. He had a habit of quietly disappearing - SDP party meetings, Bank of Finland board meetings, Government office - and going to spend the night with his old buddies. Törni’s Men never announce when they are going or where, he always said.  The remains of the helicopter Thorne flew on his last mission 1964 were eventually found in 1998. His remains, and those of three South Vietnamese comrades-in-arms were buried together in a brothers-in-arms grave at Arlington Cemetary 2003. President Koivisto was present, representing Finland. His two sisters, and the representants of the Long Rangers Guild and Parachute Rangers’ Guild, were also there.  A honour which has never really been lost need not be rehabilitated, and punishment stated by an unconstitutional ex post facto law is never a valid one.

With the Armed Forces they share the uniform, with badges, ribbons, and gallantry& President's medals. In a sense, they are the administrative military. In the border areas, the Armed Forces, the DM &SP work in tandem; particularly to combat terrorism.  They train with the IAS during the Foundation Course in Mussoorie , and this is invaluable for both the services. It is here that friendships are formed, and roles are understood. Team work is emphasized,and rough edges ironed out. Lifestyles of both the services is one here.They are taught to be accessible and visible during this phase. Differentiation begins with professional training at SVP National Police Academy with great emphasis on physical fitness, mental resilience, functional & technological training. The uniformed life begins and the tone is set for the next 35 years.Training here is akin to the IMA. With new Districts formed all over India because of the population explosion, IPS officers almost instantly become SP of Districts. This is a unique position as criminal justice begins with the Police.Working in tandem with the DM, these are often the golden years for both. The job involves wide touring, public contact and political sensitivity. Government provides the functional perks in abundant measure to the IPS officers throughout their service career. In the Metros, IPS officers become Police Commissioners, combining the roles of the DM & SP. This is unique, and police commissioners have enormous power, responsibility, & visibility. Here, in addition to the above, they imbibe diplomacy from the IFS, as media management& facing the intelligentsia become important. The shift in technology management takes place here as cyber & economic crimes predominate the urban landscape. Lifestyles change as isolation from others begins if an IPS officer joins the CBI, RAW or IB, and the NSA is often an IPS officer. IPS  officers work closely with Interpol & police of other jurisdictions a la James Bond. This is the new age IPS officer, who, like the modern software pro has to make the mental shift to be truly world class, with necessary lifestyle changes,particularly when they work in UN missions.

Some of us really can’t feel the huge and tremendous sacrifices which are been made by the army but in actually it is true as their contribution to our system is not just unbelievable but unimaginable . Since we have heard about superheroes in comics books, TV shows and rest other places and the funny part is that they are just in fiction but these superheroes are in real life also which we call the Indian Armed Forces and they are not less any fiction character as they do give up their life for their motherland and safeguard us from external aggression and other threats to our country. Some of us have a bad mentality that the one who don’t have any job goes to the army . In reality however some of the most brilliant and valiant of men are the only ones who are able to make the cut to live a life a life less ordinary. After all…… The Indian armed forces are a symbol of discipline :  a symbol of respect :  a symbol of positive attitude :  a symbol of responsibility :  An organisation that looks mother nature in the eyes and challenges it :  The pride to the country :  A symbol of sacrifice :  Real heroes don't have name on the back of their jersey, they have stars on their shoulders and medals on their chest.

An uncontrollable influx of migrants would rather be called “attempts of foreign forces to organize violation of the Soviet territorial border”. Now, to the essence of the A2A. Since the era of Czars, an unauthorized border crossing was punishable. The Bolsheviks made the Soviet Union a fortress, and its perimeter was declared “sacred and inviolable”. A massive armed force was put to the task of patrolling the several thousands kilometers of its stretch. The troops were under an order to arrest or shoot anyone who tried to cross the border outside a few dozens authorized border crossings, either in inbound or outbound direction. Patrolmen who killed many unlawful trespassers were celebrated as war heroes. The system of immigration control was dovetailed in the USSR with the secret police. If you managed to cross the border unnoticed, the system would intercept you through rigorous ID-checks in settlements and transport hubs along the border. If you managed to pass these, many more routines of ID checks would weed you out at the place of your residence, work, study, healthcare. Once you were caught, a sentence of 1 to 3 years in prison would be slapped on you for the simple act of unlawful crossing. An intent of doing this to the detriment of the Soviet state would bring you an additional time behind bars, up to a life sentence if the authorities suspected your being a spy or a saboteur. The poster below “They shall not pass!” shows a rather humane Soviet patrolman: he’s simply shoving back tiny suspicious-looking trespassers with the butt of his rifle, without hurting them.",2021-03-03T20:30:26.342Z,"How would the Soviet Union have dealt with a migrant crisis?

There's no need to mention about the scope of this field as specialist Doctors are the need of the hour. MD/MS are 3 year degree courses while diploma is a 2 year program.Diploma of National Board(DNB) - This is the next best option to pursue for people continuing with their dreams of becoming a specialist doctor. DNB is a postgraduate course offered by the National board of Examinations, and recognised by the MCI. But there are a few problems with DNB. Firstly, the pass rates in DNB are very low, depending on your course and hospital from which you complete your course (find here - Official Pass rates in DNB for the last 4 Years!! ). Secondly, many hospitals give preference to MD/MS candidates than DNB candidates. Thirdly, DNB course is provided mostly in private hospitals where the amount of exposure is less than govt. hospitals, specially in surgical branches.Combined Medical Services(CMS) - UPSC conducts CMS examination every year in the month of July/August for entry into government institutions like Railways, Municipal Corporations as Medical Officers. The exam can be given by final year students and interns. It is a good option if you want a permanent job with the government and if you like to be a part of the administrative work force of the hospital.Civil Services - There's always the options to join the civil services (IAS/IRS/IFS/IPS) after MBBS. A good career option but you won't be dealing with patients anymore. Sought by many doctors.MBA - The demand for Doctor's with MBA is increasingly drastically, with many private hospitals, pharmaceutical companies being set up. Many MBA institutions take up doctors in their programs because of this. Few institutes offering MBA are IIM's, FMS Delhi, IBS Hyderabad, MDI Gurgaon, XLRI Jamshedpur. You need to give CAT for admission.Clinical Research - India is lacking behind when it comes to research work. There is a great demand for clinical researchers. Various institutes to offer research opportunities are ICMR(Indian Council for Medical Research), CIMAP, CCMB(Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology), St. John's Research institute. One can also join WHO. Many institutes like AIIMS, PGI, NIMHANS, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (TIFR) offer a Ph.D. degree. Masters in Health Administration(MHA) - It is a 3 year post-graduate degree(M.D.) in Health Administration which helps students to acquire the skills required in managing big specialty hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, etc. M.Tech in Biomedical Engineering and Biological Sciences - It is being offered in the IIT's for students who want to pursue their career in developing machines and instruments to provide better health care.

Similarly, an officer promoted as Lt Col, Colonel, Maj Gen and Lt General after 10 years, 14-15 years, 20-21 years and 28-29 years, respectively. Of course, the most exciting of all, for which you have to wait for some more time since the matter is reserved for judgement in the Apex court, yes, you guessed it right - grant of NFU to armed forces officers. You will not believe it, NFU if granted will be equally beneficial for serving and retired and if implemented will be a great blessing in disguise for army officers for the reason that all officers presently serving will get rise in pay after 18–19 years even though they are not empanelled for promotion and on retirement will draw pension equivalent to a Joint Secretary (Major General) . All such thoughts and emotions deeply combined in me gives a rich nostalgic feeling that I sincerely wish that I should have born after 2000 and joined forces to enjoy all the career prospects, perks and privileges that have been existing at present and in the coming future and that I have literally spoiled my life. That is my regret in life with the Armed forces. I remember during 1992 , while I was posted in J&K for counter terrorist operations, five young Captains with 9–11 year of service stayed in a single 180 pounder tentage with no toilet facilities for almost 2.5–3 years due to shortage of permanent accomodation and we never complained because no body was there to listen to us. I can vouch that, I am not the lone officer who had this feeling of anguish and regret of what I have said , but very many of other officers who were with me during that time also shares the same feeling. As a case in point, I wish to highlight what used to exist earlier in Army regarding promotions for officers in the ranks of Captains and Major. Time scale promotions exist that time . One has to complete 5 years of service to become a Captain and 13 year of service for promotion from Captain to Major. (later reduced to 11 years ) . Promotion from Majors to Lt Col was by selection, and for that promotion boards were held after 16–18 years of commissioned service and only 50% of officers gets through and others were filtered out and those who were not empanelled for promotion, only option left with them was to seek voluntary retirement in the rank of Major. At present there are nearly 1200 such erstwhile Majors who were non empanelled due to lack of vacancies and the grave injustice meted out to the erstwhile Majors is that the central Govt fixed OROP pensions of these Majors who had already put in 20 year of service by equating them with a present day Major with only 6 year of service.",2021-03-03T20:33:05.657Z,"Is there anything you regret while you were in the Armed Forces?

Mutating. I was A2A by Lyonel Perabo , pretty much everyone on this tread already have quoted and mentioned everything I had planned to squeeze in my answer. I would like to express my appreciation for their work on this question. I agree with all the points previously mentionned. The three words I have stated at the beginning of that answer, to me, pretty much summarize the current state of the Swedish Defense Forces. As mentioned in previous answers, the limp biscuits governments of these last couple of decades have done a great work in picking apart the Kingdom´s defense forces. This is been made clear by previous answers too. I will try to contribute by bringing a deeper perspective on Swedish Armed Forces. Plunged into a deep identity crisis by the actions of naive, corrupt and incompetent government policies, Försvarsmakten (Swedish Armed Forces) finds itself at a dangerous and uncertain crossroads. The first order of business after the abolition of conscription to make way for a standing professional army was to repackage. Försvarsmakten has been forced to change its model, nowadays the Swedish Armed Forces are refered to as an arbetsgivare or ""employer "" to make sure to deprive military enlistement from any sense of call of duty in favor of professional work or job. This is also largely observed in the new profile their recruitment departement is going after. The ideal new generation Swedish Army recruit is : not too keen on general knowledgenot politically conscious or idealisticborderline ignorant about world politicspreferably not previously interested by any things military ( you wont make it passed motivation interview by saying you want to enlist because your father was army or speak of legacy)wants a "" good way to get into the job market""preferably a young woman late teens to early 20´s ( the rare spots available in the Army being first hand assigned to women for the sake of equality)So the soldier of yesterday is slowly being replaced by a jobber. Nowadays the term "" working"" is used to the detriment of "" serving"" when it comes to the Swedish Armed Forces. An effort is being constantly made to suppress any sense of patriotism, duty or greater call in regard to a career within the Swedish Armed Forces. The remnents of these essential core values now belong to the older generation of enlistees, the coming generation of Swedish soldiers will be ""military employees"" doing a job. Not soldiers defending their country. This is not a discourse aimed at semantics but semantics are everything in a profound subject such as this and the solid proofs are here to confirm this agenda. A brief observation at the array of nugatory and utterly confusing recruitement adds that are the most confusing I have ever seen in any country I have been. In desperation of needed recruitement for a now increasingly unpopular career choice, these adds can be seen at every buss stop or subway station. They are the laughing stock of every other Swede in my town, who find themselves confused by the message and the way it is conveid. While these slogans are difficult to translate accurately in English due to language relativity, here are a few exemples :  ​The Armed Forces make a real difference. ( understand "" in reality) the inscription on this confusing,sorry white box lost in the middle of a forest says "" a real like"" . Go figure.  ​These ones are even more interesting. From left to right : Your friend doesn´t want any help in the event of a nature catastrophy. Your old classmate can almost make it without peacekeeping missions. Your uncle can think himself living in a society where civilians don´t have any protection. Okey. And a personal favorite of mine :  ​You are probably not the one we are looking for but you´re welcome to apply. One of the other problems which Försvarsmakten is being subject to is that it seems to be too influenced by any political trend of the moment. Sweden is seeing a rise of feministic ideals some of them even rather extreme,the Swedish Armed Forces are being redefined by this too. Nothing illustrates the problem better than the (true) story of The Lion Who Lost His Balls. To make one long story short, the century old symbol of a Swedish military task force, the Nordic Battle Group, was a fierce lion whose erected penis was depicted at the level of its crouch (exactly were a lion´s penis should be, anatomically speaking). One thing leading to another, demand was made by political lobbying for that unit to remove the spear of the mighty beast, for this furious phallus could be rather offensive to the female troops integrating that unit. Off with its balls ! was shouted by the outraged crowd and the savage animal was soon castrated of its pride.  ​I am now stylizing the story up a bit but the actual event of the lion´s balls being removed from the century old regimental shield for that very reason is an actual true story. In an effort to integrate women at all costs in the armed forces, Försvarsmakten is now going as far as touching the very culture of the military. Quotas are being implemented with priority for younger women and standars of physical nature are being lowered and disparated for the sake of that integration. But this is not an integration, it´ s a mutation, in the sense that absolutely no one knows what the long term effects of this plan are going to be on the overall combat readiness of these already limited troops. I have seen with my own eyes a Swedish Armed Forces recruitement turn down a 24 year old fit, mentally stable, mature and country loving young man only to admit a 20 year old frivole young lady with mild asthma, scoliosis and mediocre physical test results within their ranks. It is only a micro exemple of the result of quota politics that will become increasingly practiced within the Swedish Armed Forces.  ​ Here is another exemple of the effect of political trends on the Swedish Armed Forces :  ​"" Certain things are not meant to be camouflaged "" The rainbow LGBT flag strapped on the fatigues of a young female recruit being an attempt at pointing that all sexual orientation is welcome within the Swedish Armed Forces and again sending a confusing and improper message that need not be in focus within the ranks of troops. Your sexuality is not supposed to mean anything or be a topic at all in the first place as a soldier. But if you are an "" employee"" then maybe. While geopolitical factors are increasingly becoming unstable, Sweden , victim of the greed and irrisponsible policies of its current and previous governments, has been left with a decomposed and waterdowned military. Poor conditions for national defense are being cried out by high ranking officers whose warnings meet a deaf ear from the politicians. The Swedish Armed Forces found even themselves becoming the tool of NATO politics by joining the ISAF forces in Afghanistan, which is in concordance with a new "" business model"" , the "" export of Western democracy and peace"" to the detriment of the outmost priority of neutrality and defense of the realm.  ​General Sverker Göransson, former Commander In Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, officially stated that the defense dispositive of Sweden would not last more than a week in the event of aggression. The Swedish Armed Forces are now, as mentioned earlier in this answer, in a crisis that political torments both nationwise and global are increasingly making harder to solve. There is a distrust, a miscontentment among the population and the families whose relatives, sons, daughters, mothers, husbands and wives are currently members of Försvarsmakten. Situation that we all hope will resorbe. But the future does not look bright as of now. Hope this helps to paint a broader picture. There is a lot more to say about that topic. I will be editing that post when time will be available to depthen some details. Stay strong ! Cheers ​Dismantled. Confused. Mutating.

Although we talk about the president being the commander in chief, no president who came into the post without military and/or deep foreign policy chops has: (a) had the full respect of mil, state, or the IC (b) been truly allowed full executive latitude in those areas Possibly until this administration, possibly since Lincoln. While it is vital that there be civilian oversight of the military, it's equally vital that our great military power be guided by those soberly aware of military history, strategy, diplomacy, economics, and sociological and human aspects of war -- forecasting our nation's and armed forces' context as so much more than a blunt instrument of some nationalist brute force will. Or, likewise, our military can not be viewed as some bloody evil where the cost of deployment is always higher than what might be deterred. Our world is so complex. So, the view of “Obama?” Are we speaking of the Obama administration, or Obama the man? The Obama who came in promising to protect whistleblowers, or the Obama who threw Manning into Leavenworth, or the Obama who commuted her scentence? The Obama who came in condemning drone strikes or the Obama who confirmed and promoted CIA drones and SEAL surgical special ops strikes? How much of any of “Obama” was the community organizer lawyer from Chicago, and how much was the IC, Joint Chiefs, and other more senior advisors who -- when policies were unpopular or just ugly as hell -- blamed the boss? I don't really see a lot of “hope we can believe in” in our military, intel, and foreign policy establishments past week two of those eight years. Sure, we backed down from some of the more neocon aspects at State. But, we spent eight years with careerists running most aspects the President didn't have personal domain expertise in. Mostly, that's how it's supposed to work, although despite some folks' infatuation with Comey, I still fail to understand how a “progressive” or even centrist Dem could put up Comey or Brennan up for confirmation.

Instead, money awarded for prizes would be put into a fund and distributed evenly to all naval personnel when the war ended. Similar arrangements were made for the Second World War, except that air crews of the RAF also became eligible for a share of prize money. In their case the payments were made to charitable organisations providing welfare to current or former RAF members, rather than being distributed to individuals. The total amount distributed after the First World War was £15 million; after the Second, just over £5 million. (Far fewer enemy ships were captured intact in the Second World War.) However, the Prize Act of 1948 finally abolished the practice of prize money. It was felt that it had become anachronistic in an age where warfare was highly mechanised, often conducted over great distances, and involved teamwork from many different parties. Making a fair and equitable distribution of the prize money was fraught with difficulties, which had not applied back in Nelson’s day when ship fought ship broadside-to-broadside. We can also bring in the fact that capturing an enemy ship was much less likely in an age of explosive shells fired at a distance of ten miles or more — and when ships, being made of steel, tended to sink rapidly rather than stay afloat even after hours of heavy close-range gunfire, as wooden ships had been able to do. Furthermore, prize money might have been a great incentive in the days when sailors were hired for a single voyage only, and wages were often in arrears. By the 20th century, however, serving in the Navy had become a profession, with pay and benefits and structured career progression. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Viscount Hall, made a speech in Parliament in December 1948 setting out the reasons for abolishing prize money: Prize money has its roots deep in the past, and the custom came about by virtue of circumstances which no longer exist. Traditionally, prize money has been paid to encourage action against enemy merchant ships. On occasions it proved to be a prize indeed, and considerable sums were paid to individual captors. Conditions of service in the Armed Forces, not excepting the Navy, were extremely precarious in years past. In those circumstances, prize money had a very different meaning from what it has to-day. Conditions of service for the members of our Armed Forces are now vastly different. There is regular promotion, proper pay, and the Forces offer a man a career in the fullest sense. Prize money as a perquisite has, therefore, become out of place. Moreover, naval warfare has changed its character since the days when a vessel or squadron went out on the high seas to make individual and identifiable captures of enemy ships. Also, the three arms of our Forces are becoming increasingly integrated into one whole, and already the air forces have played a very substantial part in naval operations. Therefore, even if there were grounds on merits for the continuation of prize money, it would be impossible to avoid the most serious anomalies in any distribution which we might be able to devise in the future. I repeat, for these reasons His Majesty's Government are firmly of the opinion that this should be the last occasion on which prize money should be granted. At the start of the First World War, by an Order in Council dated 28 August 1914, Britain announced that prize money would no longer be paid to individual ship crews.

For about a week you are in a receiving platoon taking care of various medical and administrative matters. You are housed in a squad bay and have drill instructors but they are not your actual drill instructors. I was happy about this at the time because the drill instructor in charge of our receiving platoon was an asshole for real. I remember one night we had to take a urinalysis test and this recruit got stage fright and couldn’t pee. Solution? He had that kid stand in the front of the squad bay (while everyone watches), drop his pants to his ankles, hold the piss cup, and drink canteens of water until he finally pissed. I don’t remember how long it took but he was standing up there naked, dick in hand, chugging canteens, and throwing up water until the job was done. Holy fuck was I glad I wasn’t that kid. This did not blow my mind though. During that first week we didn’t really shower much so everyone stank (this comes into play later). There was a variety of reasons for it. We didn’t have all of our stuff yet, guys felt uncomfortable, I think we were low on underwear and hygiene products, and we didn’t know when we were going to be able to do laundry either. And some mother fuckers were just nasty and didn’t shower or change their underwear. I can’t remember all the reasons why but we were really grimy leading up to Black Friday. On Black Friday (for us it was actually on a Saturday) they marched us to a different squad bay to meet what we thought was one of our real drill instructors. He was actually kind of cool and we were all thinking this wasn’t going to be so bad. Then, he takes us to another squad bay and had us all sit down Indian style on the quarter deck (front of the squad bay) and wait. We thought we were about to get some form of instruction. I don’t remember how long we were sitting there but it was long enough for my legs and feet to start throbbing with pain. Then the office door to the left swings opens and 4 drill instructors march out in unison. They stop, face left, and stand at parade rest in front of the class. They just stood there with their heads slightly tilted down at deck. This caused the brim of their campaign covers hide most of their face. I knew then that shit was about to go down. That’s when all hell broke loose. They went fucking nuts and started yelling for us to get on line. That meant find a foot locker located in front of a rack (bed) in the squad bay and stand in front of it at the position of attention. So I get up to run and I immediately fall to the ground. Both my legs and feet are completely numb. They fell asleep after sitting their for so long. I’m surprised I didn’t snap both my ankles when I planted my weight on them. So I struggle to get up and hobble as fast as I can while shit is flying everywhere. It’s absolute chaos. As I’m trying to run I trip and fall over a foot locker that had been thrown by one of the drill instructors. That shit hurt like a mother fucker. I can’t tell you what all happened for the next several hours because it’s a blur. But this also isn't what blew my mind. Later on that night when the dust settled, we were all in the squad bay standing on line in our underwear. If you don’t know what a Marine Corps squad bay looks like just watch Full Metal Jacket. If you haven’t already seen Full Metal Jacket, shame on you. So there we were, absolutely exhausted from all the bull shit that had ensued and praying to God that we would get some sleep soon when Drill Instructor Sgt Black (using different name) tells us to get naked. I just remember thinking, ‘fucking goddamn it.’ So we strip down and stand there naked looking straight ahead at the guy across from us. Then he tells us to cross deck. That meant to walk across the middle of the squad bay and go to the opposite bed and stand there in front of that recruit’s foot locker. Basically switch places with the guy across from you. Then he says, “look down.” When I looked down I knew I was fucked. What I saw was a pair of white underwear with a yellow stain in the front and a brown stain in the back. Mother fucking track marks. Then he says, “put them on.” Goddamnit I fucking knew some horrible shit was about to happen but this I hadn’t anticipated. So I bend down and put these nasty disgusting things on. Everyone does the same. This is like the lowest point in my life up until that moment. I shit you not. It can’t get any worse than this. Wrong. Drill Instructor Sgt Black then tells us to get into a “school circle.” Basically it meant to gather around him. In his hand he is holding a plastic zip lock bag with what appears to be a pair of underwear inside. They were filled with shit. One of these dirty mother fuckers had shat themselves at some point during the madness from earlier. I don’t remember his exact words but it was something to the effect of, “if any of you don’t do exactly what I say and when I say it, every last one of you mother fuckers will put these on.” I’d never been so goddamn scared in all my life. And that my friend, is when my mother fucking mind was blown. We never had to wear those underwear, but it was always in the back of our minds.

Wow, I had 15 minutes to review the outline and give an off-the cuff lecture. I was better prepared next three cycles.That is how things work.

Late in the fall of 1970, the powers that be said I was now the XO and if we got another 2Lt he would be Training Officer. WOW , what an uplift, what a joy to behold. A platoon leader is a ‘straw boss’ learning his trade from the CO and mostly from the NCO’s. And they know quite a bit, but one dark night something happened that they did not recognize/understand/etc, and it gets real quiet, all heads turned to me, and a little voice said “What do we do Lt?”. Oh that was fun. During WW2, a lot of units said “Don’t send us any more 2Lt, we don’t have time to bury them or learn their names.” I will grant 2Lt Karl Timmerman was Company Commander of the first unit over the Rhine River, because everyone above him was KIA/WIA. He did a fine job, but had been in the Army four years. Audie Murphy most decorated US Army soldier went through the ranks from private to Captain. IMHO the prewar German SS put their potential officers (aspirants) through one year enlisted before commissioning. This did not last when war broke out, but no one can say they were not good fighters. What really bugged me was this was past the height of Vietnam, 1970, but the ROTC manuals were straight out of Korea. We only had one day of RVN hooch training at Summer Camp. And not a heck of a lot at Fort Benning IOBC, still Korea. IMHO I think ROTC should replace ROTC summer camp with regular Army Basic Training for 9 weeks. Perhaps AIT in the Branch you have selected then on to OBC. Then they will see what they have to command. What they do in “ROTC Summer” camp is combined Basic/Advanced. One colonel said we have to tell enlisted 3–4 times what to do, with you guys we tell you once and that is all. I currently have a friend with a degree who wanted to fly helicopter, so they sent him to Ft Sill for Basic and then to OCS for commissioning and then the Aviation school for AOBS. I think this syllabus is excellent. So my answer is ‘straw boss’ or platoon leader (not commander). One very good NCO said you could BS your way with a 2Lt, a 1Lt would chew your ass and a captain would bust you. When I got promoted 1Lt, things were better, I knew more and others could see it. But I think two years in grade as a 2Lt would be much better. I had a Col at Summer Camp who said OCS officers were better initially by training and experience, by one year you could not tell them apart, and after that the ROTC’s education was the key. Also just remembered one incident. I had one sorehead NCO who figured since he had been in ‘Nam, and was an experienced sergeant he could do my job better. His attitude said it all. AND I agree he could have done my job better, physically, mentally and experience. BUT I was sent to NBC school for a week and scored No 1 in class. The Bde NBC officer was in that class and later called me and said “Would you write the Bde NBC SOP?”. I said yes, send it over. I really wanted to call that E-5 in and tell him, “You think you can be a better 2Lt than me? I think so too, but here is the Bde SOP to write, please take charge of it?” I never did it but damn well wanted to. My two cents. As a former 2Lt 1970, I remember quite clearly what our job was in a BCT company. To be at training with the company, and report if a senior officer arrives to inspect training. Also writing and typing skills help since the company clerk was swamped. I think I supervised the Training NCO, but he was very good and took little time. One time on the schedule there was ‘Command Information”, I asked our Senior DI who taught that. He said “You do”. Wow, I had 15 minutes to review the outline and give an off-the cuff lecture. I was better prepared next three cycles.That is how things work. In those da Continue Reading",2021-03-03T20:37:45.689Z,"What is the key role of 2nd Lieutenants in the armed forces? ",Quora

I know anything against the present Modi government or against the romantic, selfless image of the Indian Armed Forces is going to be termed outright anti-national. Call me that, I will not mind - for someone has to spill the beans and dare to call a spade a spade, right? But why don't you hear me out first? We are a country of 1.5 billion people, soon surpassing China as the most populated country in the world. The only thing scarce here is but people. What surprises me is the (artificial) manpower crisis every organization is facing, especially the government ones. It has almost become a norm to blame insufficient manpower to hide our inefficiency and shortfalls. I mean come on India, if we can't find manpower in the most populous country of this entire universe, where else are we going to find them? In Mars? In the Armed Forces too, they are falling short of a special breed of employees - the officers. They consist of roughly 10% of the total Armed Forces and the rest are termed as PBORs i.e. Personnel Below Officer Rank. Both cadres have nothing in common except the uniform and the country they fight for. There are two parallel universes inside the Armed Forces - one that of an officer's and the other one of the PBORs. Nobody in this vast country aspires to become a PBOR, a very few knows their ranks and a majority of the youths at some point of time or other have dreamed of clearing the SSB and becoming an officer. Why not, after all there is a certain glamour attached to being an officer in the Armed Forces. To talk about the ‘meager’ pay, which the officers of the Armed Forces often attribute to the shortage; the starting salary of a Lieutenant (the first rank in the Indian Army as an officer after completing training) is almost 70K per month. If you look in terms of cost to company for an entry level officer, it is more than 10L per annum (which includes other perks and allowances like housing, medical, outfit, ration, clubs etc. etc.) This is lucrative enough for an average engineering graduate (if he is not the son of Ambani or a politician or someone with the skills to become the next CEO of Google) looking for a decent job. In a country like ours where a government job is the holy grail of success for the middle class, the numbers of youngsters applying for a commission in the Armed Forces are only increasing. To say that they are not attracted towards a career in the Army is a sweeping generalization and spending millions of rupees in those silly advertisements just don't make any sense. It is equally BS to say that you need a million people to choose just some hundred candidates and would have needed a billion to choose from had you needed few thousands! It is purely a hype created by the Officers of the Armed Forces as a bargaining tool and an escape route to increase their perks and allowances and cover up organizational inefficiencies, often perfectly synced with a pay commission or a situation going out of hand due to inaction or nearsightedness. The argument is crystal clear - ""how can we fight efficiently when we have such shortage of leaders to lead our men? Please increase our salary by tenfold so that more people join us."" I find it very hard to believe in the Army propaganda that the youths of this country are reluctant to join as officers and there is a scarcity of officers in the Forces. Counter arguments for the following points are welcome:- 1) The starting pay of a PBOR is just a third of that of an officer's and their life much much harder. Yet there is no shortages of PBORs as such (or is it not being highlighted by the Army?) and people are happily joining the Army as PBORs - if not entirely out of patriotism but to secure a decent government job with pension. I don't understand what can possibly stop someone to join a job paying thrice the salary and much better facilities/ lifestyle in the same organization?  Had the perks, allowances, privileges, service condition and life style of an officer so miserable, as the officers of the Armed Forces often complain, they would have not been fighting court cases just for a few more years of service. 2) Interestingly enough, the so called shortage is only in the fighting ranks i.e. of Majors and below. There is no shortage of officers from Lieutenant Colonel and above. Does that ring a bell?  Due to the lopsided promotion policy of the officers, every Tom, Dick and Harry becomes a Major within 5-6 years of being commissioned and a Lieutenant Colonel in almost 13-14 years. This is the very reason that may have led to the shortage, if there is any. So, why doesn’t the Army increases the time for such promotion so that officers can have more time in the fighting ranks as it was before 30 years? Yes, their careers will be affected adversely but again, who would like to compromise his career when it is so convenient to blame the government for everything? 3) Considering the Army is not getting enough candidates in the officers’ cadre, why are there limited vacancies and limited intake capacities in its training institutions? To start with, has anyone ever wondered how many vacancies are there in the OTA or IMA in the ongoing batches? Why doesn’t the Army expand its training infrastructure to accommodate more trainees instead of spending in those shiny prime time advertisements? Don't we have any intention of filling out these so called vacancies? 4) Let us assume for a moment that there is a shortage of talented people having the qualities to become an officer. Than why on earth are you sending those Short Service Commission (SSC) officers home? Why all the SSC officers are not given PC (Permanent Commission) and retained in the Army to cater for this so called shortage? One may argue on the technicalities of such a scenario saying that we need officers in X cadre and those going out belong to Y cadre. Let me tell you, most officers in the Armed Forces are supposed to be a generalist. Once we have identified people with ‘officer like qualities’ what is stopping us to cross train them and relocate them in the specific cadres facing a shortage? It is high time that the Armed Forces focus more on solving such problems, if they at all exist, rather than creating an unnecessary hype out of it and making the Forces vulnerable by revealing the numbers to everyone.

I hardly went to any party, movie or outing because my curfew time was 6 pm in the evening. There were exceptions only when my parents dropped or picked me up or one of my friend took the responsibility to drop me home by 8:00 pm. When the clock ticks off post 8 pm , I am in soup.The curfew time was pretty much there for my elder brother too but with exceptions. Or let’s say he was good at breaking them and getting away. My brother would hang around with his friends till 12 sometimes. He always went for 9:30 pm movie shows and birthday party celebrations always started at 12. The discrimination was based on grounds of Safety.My brother did MBA. After my graduation, at one point even I thought of doing MBA, or something like event management. I had that little intuition feeling of jumping into the creative field. But I was told “Corporate jobs is not for girls” and with this declaration my little thought bubbles were pricked.I manage to make way through 60–65 candidates and place my name in top-ten spot for the Ph.D programme. I see the results, and happily run to my mom smiling molar to molar- “Maa I got selected”. My mom gave me the routine normal look, she didn’t ask anything and kept gazing. Later on I realized her concern that, my rising qualifications will dwindle the eligible groom numbers.And this one we all come across at some or the other point of life- No matter how early you wake up, no matter how tired you come back home, you have to make sure that the house is clean, food is cooked not just for family members but even for random guests. Because you are the woman of the house and this is your birth duty. No sick leaves, No causal leaves, No paid leaves- 24*7 always on call job.Point 1–3 is how I grew up, but fast forward A sensible guy married me and takes pride in me and my Ph.D with every breath he takes in. I always had his back, He stood by my side rock solid.My mom later on became my biggest moral strength. I guess she finally realized her daughter is made of grit and determination.The man of my house shares equal responsibility and helps in chores whenever the need arises. The helping hand is always there. But most often I am super-quick handling my chores all by myself. Not because I am the woman of the house and this is my birth-duty, but because I am responsible, sensible and practical. I enjoy doing what I do. No complaints. No regrets. Not that I want to be the queen of multi-tasking , it’s just that ‘shit happens in life’ and I know how to handle it.And as far as corporate jobs are concerned, I am in for a different league all-together.Edit I- I forget to mention and honor my aunt. So here goes the first edit. The worst discrimination doesn’t come from men but sometimes it comes from our fellow sisterhood. My aunt (one of mom’s cousin sister) is a fine example of high education (she holds Ph.D) and yet poor thinking standards. She lives in a metropolitan city which is the IT hub of India and works in a reputed central govt. organization . I always looked up to her as the bold independent woman. But slowly with increasing communications in family whatsapp group I realized she had a different side altogether something that never came upon. She would keep asking me to send pictures of my various trips in US. She would praise my short-sleeveless dresses on whats app but openly criticize me in front of other family members. At one point she thought I would be bad influence for her teenage (still in 5th grade and 1st grade) daughters. And during one family wedding I wore a sleeveless dress(salwar-suit) and some creep local boys tried to click pictures and passed lewd comments (the wedding was in the southern part of India- Nagercoil). My other uncle and brother took notice of it at the right time and handled the situation. I never felt there was anything wrong with my dress. But my aunt certainly felt it was my fault. As per her own statements- “ Wearing such dresses is not our culture. If you wear such a dress, then obviously boys will pass comments at you. They are not at fault.” My aunt should have stood by my side and supported me, instead she stood on the other side to point fingers at me and assassinate my integrity. Here the discrimination was my from my own family, my own woman on grounds of culture, lifestyle and character. But it didn’t bother me at all. The problem was with her thinking not with my dress. So I still continue to wear my favorite sleeveless dresses and simply chucked her number out of my contact list. See, getting negativity out of your life is so simple.
