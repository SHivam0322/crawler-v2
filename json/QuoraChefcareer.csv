When you finish high school, go to chef school and learn everything you can. I believe that the key here is practice, the most you practice the better you will become. To achieve this practice you should ask your parents if you can cook dinner once or twice a week.

It isn’t usually all that creative, unless you are operating your own business and make creativity the focus of that business.

From the point of job prospects, a Degree is better than a diploma. The degree gives you more options for career progression than a diploma. And If one is not able to get admission into a Degree because of low rank, then diploma is better in such a scenario to have a go at getting some professional qualification from a reputed college. After having some experience under the belt post a diploma one can always compete with degree holders in the job market. For Degree (Hm, Bsc in Hm etc.) the duration of the course is 4 years, but a lateral entry can be taken directly to the second year if a person has done a Diploma course. Polytechnic (Diploma ) is mainly done by those who are not able to afford a degree and need to get into a job as early as possible. Hope it helps. and Thank You.

Being a fresher, you will start as a Commis 3 which is the lowest rank in the kitchen hierarchy, only after presenting your basic culinary skills. Be ready to be under-paid for the amount of work you put in during your shifts (8–10k/month INR). This definitely won’t bother you if you are passionate and work to learn. There will be lots of physical as well as mental activities involved during the shift which might stress you out. Be ready to sacrifice your weekends and occasions like Christmas and New years’, as this is the time when the work will be more than ever. Issues need to be solved in a very short amount of time, you won’t get enough time to even think about the solutions (Kitchen accidents, customer requests, food running out in the buffet, etc.).
