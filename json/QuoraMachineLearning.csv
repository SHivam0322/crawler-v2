Have you done any capstone projects in any of these classes? There is a difference between learning theoretically and solving real world problems so you should take steps to give you experience in the latter. Its not just for your resume, but working on real customer use cases and the scale of data will shape your knowledge to get you ready for the real world. These are three steps you can take towards that - Apply your knowledge to recreate a published ML research work. For example typically you see examples of understanding housing prices or something like that pointing to a data set. It does not teach you where you hone your skills because your goal is not theoretical. (Thanks to Siraj Raval of Sirajology for this suggestion). Find a paper from arxiv.org and try to recreate the research results. First, this will make you go through lots of recent ML research and introduce you to new work that you may not be aware of. Second it will help you figure out what you are really passionate about within ML and the algorithms you have learned. Third, you will get confidence in dealing with large volume of data as you recreate a research result. But what I’d bet on is that you may come up with a different thinking of a different approach for the same problem and it can lead you to play with a large data set to solve a new problem.Look at the work of other ML students globally to validate what you know, what knowledge gaps you may have to learn more and to get to play with their work. Bench marking yourself among your peers is important to keep learning.The source I can think for this are - a. Prof. Andrew Ng’s Standford CS229 class students projects are all archived online over the years. See links for 12 years of classes each with links to the projects 2016, 2016 spring, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 Look at these projects for ideas and see what you would like to recreate. These should also give you ideas of knowledge gap of topics you need to learn. b. Github has 44K respository under ML. Comb through them the same way for ideas to find topics to learn and research code to recreate. (Some of this will overlap the Udacity courses or the research papers in other places). 2. Ask your Profs. or mentors to find a capstone project (or internship if possible in person) to do couple project for 1–2 companies to get experience not just in ML research but to get a sense of reality of what the role of a ML engineer is. All courses teach you algorithms to make you a ML researcher. In a real workplace with large scale data, the role of a ML researcher is different from that of a ML engineer. You should try to understand the difference and the interaction to see where you fit in and what skills you need to develop. Also the roles are slightly different in different companies so try for atleast to get experience from more than one company in different geography. Best of Luck!

Unfortunately , most of the time lines get blurred in the industry which ends up confusing people around.  Here is my 2 cents on this:  The main difference is because of the objective  and the end audience or consumer of the respective work. A data scientist is a person who makes sense out of data , using some science. Sense is the key operating word.  And that is what underlines the difference in objectives here.  For a data scientist it's about drawing conclusions, inference , interpretations from data. That can be done either using machine learning models or doing hypothesis (A/B) testing or even coming up with a new product metric and validating it through statistical procedures. In all the exercises a data scientist's end objective is to understand the data.  For a machine learning engineer the end objective is about making a machine learn from the data. The goal is not to explain or interpret the data for better inference but to build a system in the form of a product which is better at predicting the end objective. The focus is on prediction rather than inference unlike what data scientists try to achieve.  Now the obvious question. Why both have different objectives ? Aren't both working on the same data and using science ?  Well the objectives are different because the end consumer or audience of the work is different. For data scientists the end audience or consumer is normally the business side of an organization. Folks or a product manager owning a product who want to understand how their business or a product is working. Usually such audience is from business background with not much technical know how. And that is why a data scientist has additional responsibility of being able to communicate their results and findings in a very non technical interpretation.   For a machine learning engineer the end consumer or audience of the work is usually the technology side of an organization. And the focus is more on building a system using technology rather than understanding the business side of things. Consequently the conversation here deals with more technical know how rather than having to explain any findings or draw conclusions in a non technical manner to the end consumer of work.  And due to the difference in the nature of work and objectives , there comes slight difference in expectation from the role. A data scientist can be anyone with good statistics , machine learning and some coding background. For a machine learning engineer since your objective is to build a system which learns from the data , the focus is more on pretty good coding/software engineering skills with machine learning knowledge and some statistics.

If so, I’ve listed out some projects that you must do (after you’ve got a strong grasp on Machine Learning) I’m going to start by stressing on the importance of GitHub. GitHub is tremendously important nowadays for Data Scientists and developers and is a leading software development platform. As an entry-level Data Scientist, you should use and exploit GitHub to, primarily: Show your code and projects in an organized and efficient manner in a variety of programming languages to one of the largest coding communities. (I’m assuming it’s R or Python for you)Show that you are well-versed with the environment and are good-to-go upon hire.You can get your code reviewed by others too.Assuming that you’re not familiar with the platform, you can start learning as you sign-up. There are several tutorial videos to help you get started! Now, as an entry-level Data Scientist you should focus on projects that stress on the following in R/Python: Getting and Cleaning Data Project: Competing in Kaggle competitions or dealing with pre-cleaned/pre-processed datasets will definitely increase your ‘model-building’ skills but practically, it’s a known fact that Data Scientist spend a major chunk of their time getting, importing and cleaning their data (a good example is where there are too many white spaces, NA values coerced). So displaying that you’re good in web scraping techniques (XML, JSON), accessing through API’s, and cleaning and manipulating data to create ‘clean’ datasets is an excellent practice. Exploratory Data Analysis - This project would display your manipulation and visualization techniques which are very useful when analyzing data. You learn about patterns, any unnecessary data, and how you practice to get to the visualizations and graphs you want. You should practice simpler analyzing techniques to come to conclusions about the dataset you’re working on. Machine Learning Project 1: This project is very important. You must have a good theoretical grasp, but if you don’t have any practical experience, it’s hard for the employers to know that you possess the knowledge in the first place, of course, knowing how the algorithms work is essential too. In this project you should demonstrate that you are capable of approaching a problem systematically, what made you write and execute the code you wrote, why you thought your approach was good and what your opinions and thoughts are. It could be anything, classification, regression, clustering and using vital dimensionality reduction techniques, etc. It’s very important to evaluate and quantify your model and show that you did, in fact, perform, somewhat of a ceiling analysis on your problem, trying to realistically improve its efficiency. Machine Learning Project 2: Although your first project should get the ball rolling and make you feel much more confident, I’d highly recommend a 2nd project where the purpose of the project is different. (for example: classification problem, instead of regression; or unsupervised learning techniques used). This would incredibly strengthen your portfolio and we all know that more projects are always better. Text Mining: A project highlighting your skills in Text Mining would definitely go a long way and help you gain a strong edge! Other projects: Your other repositories can also demonstrate: Your programming skills in R/Python or both. Time series Analysis skills and knowledge Interactive visualization techniques.

Machines beating the world’s best at Go, self driving cars, Snapchats face filters. It’s sexy to be a Machine Learning engineer, to be involved in the very real wave of new technologies.   But there comes a point where the public greatly over values a profession. News articles such as the New York Times’ listing salaries of 300 - 500k for AI professionals[1] lead young graduates to believe Machine Learning is the best way to make big money. The problem begins when people start to pursue a career in Machine Learning because it’s the supposed “best career”. Combine this with the fact the field is so vaguely defined, encompassing everything from Data Engineers to statisticians to quantitative analysts with Python and you have a misinformed public and a ballooned valuation.  Since the field is so young, there are massive shortages in graduates educated with the relevant skills. As a result, salaries have of course rocketed. However, just a few years behind, the Universities of the world are starting more and more “Data Science” and “Machine Learning” degree programmes. Surely, this is the answer to the job shortage problem? Not quite. Because the field’s value is so distorted universities across the globe are starting sub par programmes which receive buckets of applications from (genuinely interested) students. These programmes make nice money for the university but only make the problem worse. Thousands of graduates now qualified as “Machine Learning experts” are under equipped for the task necessary, further clouding the definition of Machine Learning field. You can bet that in the years to come, when ML has stabilised, so too will the salaries and only those who are truly interested in the field will find their jobs fulfilling.  The real message I want to communicate in this answer is not that Machine Learning is overly hyped. My main message is that there is no such thing as “the best career”. There is only “the best career for you”. The most important thing to remember (just like for any job, however publicly valuable) is to honestly assess whether you have a genuine interest in the subject. Do you love playing with data and ML algorithms? Do you find the underlying math beautiful? Machine Learning is a fascinating field and, if it's right for you, it's rewarding, fulfilling and you can make some decent money doing it.

The world’s challenges are complex, and they will require complex systems to solve them. Machine Learning engineers are building these systems. If this is YOUR future, then there’s no time like the present to start mastering the skills and developing the mindset you’re going to need to succeed. So here I have listed the most important skills required: Programming Skills- This is one of the main skills and mentioned in almost all the answers here. There are multiple languages which provide machine learning capabilities. Some of the popular programming languages to learn machine learning in are Python, R, and C/C++. It's up to you to decide which programming language you want to master, but it's advisable to have a little understanding of other languages and what their advantages and disadvantages are over your preferred one.C/C++ are almost as low level as you can get in programming. They’re especially suitable for developing software that is memory and speed critical such as operating systems and networking protocols. They’re also hardware interfacing programs. These are usually the languages used to program the infrastructure and mechanics of machine learning engines.R is a language that has been specifically tailored for statistical computing and data mining, making it an excellent choice for machine learning tasks. There’s a huge repository of algorithms and statistical models developed in R for various tasks.Python is one of the favorite languages of data scientists and machine learning engineers. Although a general purpose language, Python has a number of useful libraries (NumPy, SciPy and Pandas) for efficient data processing and scientific computing. It also has a number of specialized machine learning libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, Theano and TensorFlow) that make it easy to train algorithms using different computing platforms.Fundamentals of Programming and CS- Machine learning is a field that involves performing computation on huge sets of data, and therefore it requires proficiency in fundamental concepts such as data structures, algorithms, complexity and computer architecture. This is a good opportunity to take out those semester books and review your stacks, b-trees, sort algorithms, or skim through your programming book and solve a few parallel programming problems.Software Design- As a machine learning engineer, you’ll have to create algorithms and systems that integrate and communicate with other software components and ecosystems that are already in place. That is why you’ll need a strong background in Application Programming Interfaces (API) of different flavors (web APIs, static and dynamic libraries, etc.) as well as designing interfaces that will sustain future changes that will overcome your overall system. Creating reliable and flexible software requires mastering skills such as requirements analysis, developing use cases and test cases, documentation and testing.Applying ML Libraries and Algorithms- Part of your job as a machine learning engineer will be to use algorithms and libraries created by other developers and organizations. There are already a lot of packages, APIs and libraries you can use such as Google’s TensorFlow, Microsoft’s CNTK and Apache Spark’s MLib. But applying them effectively will require understanding models and learning procedures, how they apply to each technology, and the potential pitfalls.Probability and Statistics- Most machine learning algorithms are about dealing with uncertainty and making reliable predictions. The mathematical tools to deal with such settings are found in principles of probability and its derivative techniques such as Markov Decision Processes and Bayes Nets. Also of importance are tools and techniques that enable the creation of models from data. Relevant to this task is the field of statistics and its various branches such as analysis of variance and hypothesis testing. Machine learning algorithms are often built upon statistical models.Data Modelling- Machine learning often involves analyzing unstructured data, which relies on the science of data modeling, the process of estimating the underlying structure of a data-set, finding patterns and filling gaps where data is nonexistent. Understanding data modeling and evaluation concepts is key to creating sound algorithms that can be trained and enhanced over time.Now a days there are many courses available and these are the best way to kick start your machine learning journey. Both students and professionals will have an edge over all other applicants if they leverage these degree or a certification on the same. Intro to Machine Learning - GL4L- Machine learning is starting to redefine the way we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. This course is for anyone who is curious about machine learning but has no idea where to start. It is a free course and it broadly covers:What is machine learning?How can a machine learn?Basic terminology and algorithmsHands-on exercisesGreatlearning- Machine learning course- PGP-ML is a 6-month comprehensive program that combines Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning to prepare candidates for the roles of Data Scientists, Machine Learning engineers, Machine Learning architects, Technology architects, Solution Engineers, Technology Consultants, Chief Technology Officers etc.Industry Exposure: The program gives the participants an opportunity to learn from some of the Industry’s leading minds in Machine Learning.

There’s no such thing called the best Machine Learning or Deep Learning course. Every course is different and every one aims at different areas of specialization. For me though, personally I think the best course right now is the Applied AI Course. There are like tons of courses that you will come across on the internet, but Applied AI is the clear winner. I see a lot of people talking about Udacity, Udemy, Coursera, Up-Grad and IIIT courses and no one talks about Applied AI. That’s very strange! Firstly, Up-Grad and IIIT courses are bad. Period. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable. But what’s the point of having so much knowledge if you can’t transfer it to someone? I have seen some of my friends do the courses from Up-Grad and IIIT, but they were basically below par. They have focused on analytics much more than ML and AI. I have a friend who has done this IIIT course last year which costed him around 3 lakhs. At that time, he was earning 4.5 LPA in Infosys and after he did the course, he could only get an offer of 6.5 LPA. Pretty low right? Specially after spending almost 3 lakhs on the course from IIIT. ROI? Absolutely bad. The Udemy A-Z coursed by Kiril and Hadeilin was extremely good in terms of the explanation. However, it’s only meant for beginners. It won’t help you get deep mathematical insights on Machine Learning algorithms. But if you do these courses that they are offering you will have a broader perspective of how things work in Machine Learning and then you can move on to a more specialized course. What you will not gain is specialized skills to solve real world problems on large datasets. However, their AI and Computer Vision courses are good. As far as Udacity is concerned, the course instructors and the content is extremely good. But, they are not meant for someone who is a starter in this field. It’s a more advance course and the instructors will explain at a very high level, assuming that you are extremely smart and will be able to pick up everything that they teach. The Great Lakes course is not upto the mark either. It has a lot of high level contents and the amount they all charge for enrollment is massively high. I have completed my B.Tech within INR 12000, so it feels very odd to pay someone almost 3+ LPA to learn about only one area of specialization. I am not sure about the IBM, TCS and SimpleLearn courses because I don’t have any contacts who has done these courses. If you are really someone who is extremely serious about building your career in Data Science, then I would ask you to blindly get the course offered by Applied AI course. The explanations are like state of the art. It’s my challenge, that throughout the internet, you won’t find someone who explains the concepts as clearly as Mr. Varma. In Applied AI course, they will simply assume that you don’t know anything about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI. They will explain any problem or scenario in great detail. All the intricate details and rigorous calculus seems fairly easy when Mr. Varma explains them! You will learn how to approach ML problems, how to deal with huge datasets, you will understand every mathematical concept related to Data Science and Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI in great details. The instructors at Applied AI will make you understand Calculus and AI just like how your parents made you understand the English alphabets when you were kids. And on top of that, they will offer you lucrative jobs! What more do you need? The course content is exhaustive and will cover most of the things that you need in order to kick start your career in Data Science or ML roles. At 25000 INR, I think there’s no course in the entire universe that you can find as good as this. So how can you land a job in Machine Learning domain? I would advise you to take a time frame of two months and first complete the Udemy A-Z course on ML, DL and AI. It should not take you more than 2 months to complete all the courses. Once you are done with these courses, you will have a much broader perspective on how ML works. Once you are done with Udemy, just get the Applied AI Course. Plan your time well and finish all the 30 case studies that Applied AI has. By this time you should land a job in ML through their placements. Once you get the job, do Andrew NG’s course on Deep Learning from Coursera. Alternatively, you can also do some courses from Udacity. It's a time consuming strategy, but you should be job ready in under an year’s time. Udemy + Applied AI should will make you extremely job ready and highly knowledgeable. Once you land a job, just do the courses from Coursera and Udacity for specialization. Please do not purchase the courses from IIIT or Up-Grad. At the price they are being offered and the content that they offers, it’s not at all worth it. But still if you want to go ahead and waste your hard earned money you can purchase them. The choice is yours. P.S. : I have followed the same strategy I had just mentioned. After completing the Applied AI course, I got more than 150% hike. For extremely talented people (unlike me), the hike percentage will be in the range of 250-500%. Yes, I am not kidding. Once you get the job, just do some specialization from Udacity or Coursera. That should do the trick for you. Well, this is a fairly straight forward question for me to answer. But I will elaborate a bit more on this. There’s no such thing called the best Machine Learning or Deep Learning course. Every course is different and every one aims at different areas of specialization.

Obviously, on the slow and overpriced Amazon hardware, everything looks like big data. My advantage is that I can write any application from a large ERP to a microcontroller program. Also, I can effectively manage teams of programmers, plus I hold a PhD in computer science. This is the case in the whole industry. People don’t understand Machine Learning. Sometimes I am asked to write neural networks that actually translate to a one table SQL query, with filter. However, they are happy to give a regular database jobs to somebody who seems to be knowledgeable about data. Academia is no safer place, as fundamental Machine Learning research is declining, despite being considered everywhere a buzzword. Machine Learning is still in its infancy. It is like oil business at 1900, when people used kerosene instead of whale oil. The fact that our results are not 100% correct is a big drawback, this requires specific UI interfaces to let the people make the right decision. My approach is that while I’m doing the boring job, I also do a personal research of applying AI in robotics. Here what I do is really AI (i’m not limited to deep learning, but sometimes I use FeedForward neural networks, convolutional layers, along with other techniques, out of fashion, like Kohonen networks or Hopfield neurons, and new things that I have no intention disclosing). My home datacenter is a cluster of 48 CPUs and four times more hard drives, so I think I’m pretty seriously in the business. Also I own a number of 3d printers, a milling machine and a lathe. Once I will understand clearly the problem I’m solving, I will move probably to new nvidia hardware. If this works, I will own a company that builds a generally purpose robot (not humanoid) able to self assembly in a desired shape and use common tools to do any domestic or industrial task, like for example cut a tree, replace tires of a car or build a piece of jewellery.

In short, it wasn’t easy to transform from being data dumb to a data nerd, but I managed to do so while going through a terribly busy work schedule as well as being a dad to a one-year-old.  The point of this article is to help you if you are looking to make a similar transformation but do not know where to start and how to proceed from one step to the next. If you are interested in finding out, read on to get an idea about the topics you need to cover and also develop an understanding of the level of expertise you need to build at each stage of the learning process. There are plenty of great online and offline resources to help you master each of these steps, but very often, the trouble for the uninitiated can be in figuring out where to start and where to finish. I hope spending the next ten to fifteen minutes going through this article will help solve that problem for you. And finally, before proceeding any further, I would like to point out that I had a lot of help in making this transformation. Right at the end of the article, I will reveal how I managed to squeeze in so much learning and work in a matter of ten months. But that’s for later. For now, I want to give you more details about the nine steps that I had to go through in my transformation process.  Step 1: Understand the basics Spend a couple of weeks enhancing your “general knowledge” about the field of data science and machine learning. You may already have ideas and some sort of understanding about what the field is, but if you want to become an expert, you need to understand the finer details to a point where you can explain it in simple terms to just about anyone. Suggested topics: What is Analytics?What is Data Science?What is Big Data?What is Machine Learning?What is Artificial Intelligence?How are the above domains different from each other and related to each other?How are all of the above domains being applied in the real world?Exercise to show that you know: Write a blog post telling readers how to answer these questions if asked in an interviewStep 2: Learn some Statistics I have a confession to make. Even though I feel like a machine learning expert, I do not feel that I have any level of expertise in statistics. Which should be good news for people who struggle with concepts in statistics as much as I do, as it proves that you can be a data scientist without being a statistician. Having said that, you cannot ignore statistical concepts – not in machine learning and data science! So what you need to do is to understand certain concepts and know when they may be applied or used. If you can also completely understand the theory behind these concepts, give yourself a few good pats on your back. Suggested topics: Data structures, variables, and summariesSamplingThe basic principles of probabilityDistributions of random variablesInference for numerical and categorical dataLinear, multiple and logistic regressionSuggested exercise to mark the completion of this step: Create a list of references with the easiest to understand the explanation that you found for each topic and publish them in a blog. Add a list of statistics related questions that one may be expected to answer in a data science interviewStep 3: Learn Python or R (or both) for data analysis Programming turned out to be easier to learn, more fun and more rewarding in terms of the things it made possible than I had ever imagined. While mastering a programming language could be an eternal quest, at this stage, you need to get familiar with the process of learning a language and that is not too difficult. Both Python and R are very popular and mastering one can make it quite easy to learn the other. I started with R and have slowly started using Python for doing similar tasks as well. Suggested topics: Supported data structuresRead, import or export dataData quality analysisData cleaning and preparationData manipulation – e.g. sorting, filtering, aggregating and other functionsData visualizationKnow that you are set for the next step: Extract a table from a website, modify it to compute new variables, and create graphs summarizing the dataStep 4: Complete an Exploratory Data Analysis Project In the first cricket test match ever played (see scorecard), Australian Charles Bannerman scored 67.35% (165 out of 245) of his team’s total score, in the very first innings of cricket’s history. This remains a record in cricket at the time of writing, for the highest share of the total score by a batsman in an innings of a test match. What makes the innings even more remarkable is that the other 43 innings in that test match had an average of only 10.8 runs an innings, with only about 40% of all batsmen registering a score of ten or more runs. In fact, the second-highest score by an Australian in the match was 20 runs. Given that Australia won the match by 45 runs, we can say with conviction that Bannerman’s innings was the most important contributor to Australia’s win. Just like we were able to build this story from the scorecard of the test match, exploratory data analysis is about studying data to understand the story that is hidden beneath it, and then sharing the story with everyone. Personally, I find this phase of a data project the most interesting, which is a good thing as quite a lot of the time in a typical project could be expected to be taken up by exploratory data analysis. Topics to cover: Single variable explorationsPair-wise and multi-variable explorationsVisualization, dashboard, and storytelling in TableauProject output: Create a blog post summarizing the exercise and sharing the dashboard or story. Use a dataset with at least ten columns and a few thousand records Step 5: Create unsupervised learning models Let’s say we had data for all the countries in the world across many parameters ranging from population, to income, to health, to major industries and more. Now suppose we wanted to find out which countries are similar to each other across all these parameters. How do we go about doing this, when we have to compare each country with all the others, across over 50 different parameters? That is where unsupervised machine learning algorithms come in. This is not the time to bore you with details about what these are all about, but the good news is that once you reach this stage, you have moved on into the world of machine learning and are already in elite company. Topics to cover: K-means clusteringAssociation rules Introduction Not so long ago, using the pivot tables option in Excel was the upper limit of my skills with numbers and the word python was more likely to make me think about a dense jungle or a nature program on TV than a tool to generate business insights and create complex solutions. It took me ten months to leave that life behind and start feeling like I belonged to the exclusive world of people who can tell their medians from their means, their x-bars from the neighborhood pub, and who know how to teach machines what they need to learn.

Long answer: Let’s start with what is the use of data structures and algorithms, they will help you to model data containers (list, map, graph…) on computers and how to execute them efficiently. Let’s see use case of AI, In laymen terms, it helps computers to solve problems and control systems like humans do. To do so it needs to observe lot of data like humans do and process with speed of human brain. Let’s take a simple example of watching a movie by a human being. Human eye has >500 Mega pixels to detect different parts of the image and corresponding colours of the parts.It also detects phase and other attributes regarding vision, these will be passed to our brain and processed instantlyWith this we are able to detect the object(actor, car, background…) and also able to process what it’s doing(dancing, singing, action…),Apart from that, it also listens and process what’s going on and able to understand the semantics of it and relates to other things like what happened in past or what so everTo make a model to detector object in image using AI, we need to have some model which is complex and learns it in hierarchal way, in concrete terms we use something like Deep Neural Networks (or something complex like this). In general for a state of the art network like VGG-16, it has around 520MB model to detect a object in image (it can detect only one of the 1000 images and accuracy is around 70.5%). See my answer for more details on this, Yugandhar Nanda's answer to What is the VGG neural network? The above problem is just one of the small problem of AI, Let’s take sample AI applications like… The same problem above, but for detecting around 1 Million objectsNeed to learn from peta bytes of dataHas to gather data from different sources like mobiles which has challenges in data connectivity and computational powerIt also demands extra information detected from other sensors like gyroscope, barometer, accelerometer, …Detecting decease using MRI, CT, X-Ray, and blood reportsNeed to process tera bytes or even peta bytesNeed to be accurate near 100%Creating translator for different languagesHas to take decision in < 50 ms (user perception time)Has to train or retrain from tera bytes of dataUnderstanding of intents by listening to user speech and built systems like AlexaHas to take decision in < 50 ms (user perception time)Sometimes need to communicate with other systems surrounding itAnd think about systems like Self driving cars where you need tofind what are objects present and where are theyfind where is space leftprocess legal rules like traffic signaltake decision to control steering, accelerator, break, gear and clutchHas to take decision in milli second, while processing megabytes or giga bytes of dataIt also need to communicate with other cars and other systems at real time where have challenges in data connectivitySolving demand supply shaping problems in Uber/Lyft/Grab/Go-Jek/Ola/Didi and deciding price there after.Optimise customer and driver experienceOptimise revenue for companyStick to legal rulesHas to take decision in less than second while processing giga/tera bytes of dataFinance trading problemsAcross multiple stock exchangesStick to legal rules and current captialDecide when to buy and how much to buyHas to take decision in micro seconds while processing giga bytes or tera bytes of data at runtimeNeeds extra information detected from other sensors like gyroscope, barometer, accelerometer, …RoboticsNeed handle things like actuator, gripper…Response time must be with in milliseconds for decisionControlling rockets and spaceshipsit has to take decision in < 1 msGames based on AINeed to respond in < 50 ms (actually it’s more strict now a days)Needs extra information detected from other sensors like gyroscope, barometer, accelerometer, …etc So in summary we need process Large data in terms of tera bytes and peta bytesProcess data in low connectivity or challenging connectivityNeed to process data from new sources and sensorsThe above problems not only requires existing data structure models but also need to be enhanced and new hardware has to be developed for the above use cases.

Studying ML today is like studying electricity in the 1850’s when it was possible to make very basic discoveries and the field was moving very fast. If a student asked in 1850 what to major in to be an electrical engineer the answer is certainly “Physics” because what was needed was a broad background in the basics so that you would be able to keep up with advances.

Intuition Fails in High Dimensions One of the biggest problem in machine learning is the curse of dimensionality. This expression means that many algorithms that work fine in low dimensions become intractable when the input is high-dimensional. Generalizing correctly becomes exponentially harder as the dimensionality (i.e., number of features) of the examples grow, because a fixed-size training set covers a tiny fraction of the input space (possible combinations become huge). But this is what makes machine learning both necessary and hard. As you can see in the image below, even as we transition from 1-D to 3-D, the job of being able to tell the different examples apart seems to start becoming harder and harder — in high dimensions all examples start looking alike.  The general problem here is that our intuitions, which come from a 3-D world, fail us in high-dimensions. For instance, most of the volume of a high-dimensional orange is in the skin, not the pulp! For some more mind boggling: if a constant number of examples is distributed uniformly in a high-dimensional hypercube, and if we approximate a hypersphere by inscribing it in a hypercube, in high dimensions almost all the volume of the hypercube is outside the hypersphere. And this is bad news. Because in machine learning, shapes of one type are often approximated by shapes of another. Clarification Note: If you are confused by all the “hypes of the hypers”, hypersphere inside a hypercube, looks like this in two and three dimensions:  So as you can understand now, building a classifier in 2 or 3 dimensions is easy, but in high dimensions, it’s hard to understand what is happening. This, in turn, makes it difficult to design a good classifier. In fact, we often fall into the trap of thinking that gathering more features never hurts, since at worst they provide no new information about the class. But in fact, their benefits may be outweighed by the curse of dimensionality. Take away: next time when you consider adding more features, do consider the potential problems that might arise when your dimension becomes too big. 2. Feature Engineering is the Key At the end of the day, some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the difference? Easily the most important factor is the features used. If you have many independent features that each correlate well with the class, learning is easy. On the other hand, if the class is based on a recipe that requires handling the ingredients (features) in a complex way before they can be used, things become harder — feature engineering is basically about creating new input features from your existing ones. Very often the raw data does not even come in a form ready for learning. But you can construct features from it that can be used for learning. In fact, this is typically where most of the effort in a machine learning project goes. It is often also one of the most interesting parts, where intuition, creativity and “black art” are as important as the technical stuff. First-timers are often surprised by how little time in a machine learning project is spent actually doing machine learning. But it makes sense if you consider how time-consuming it is to gather data, integrate it, clean it and pre-process it, and how much trial and error can go into feature design. Also, machine learning is not a one-shot process of building a dataset and running a learner, but rather an iterative process of running the learner, analyzing the results, modifying the data and/or the learner, and repeating. Learning is often the quickest part of this, but that’s because we’ve already mastered it pretty well! Feature engineering is more difficult because it’s domain-specific, while learners can be largely general-purpose. Of course, one of the holy grails of machine learning is to automate more and more of the feature engineering process.  3. More Data Beats a Cleverer Algorithm Suppose you’ve constructed the best set of features you can, but the classifiers you’re getting are still not accurate enough. What can you do now? There are two main choices:design a better learning algorithm, or gather more data (more examples, and possibly more raw features). Machine learning researchers would go for improving the design, but in the practical world the quickest path to success is often to just get more data.As a rule of thumb, a dumb algorithm with lots and lots of data beats a clever one with modest amounts of it. In computer science, often the two main limited resources are time and memory. In machine learning, there is a third one: training data. Among the three, today the main bottleneck is usually time — tons of data is available, but there is not enough time to process it, so it goes unused. This means that in practice simpler classifiers end up reaching the finale, because complex ones take too long to learn. Part of the reason why using cleverer algorithms doesn’t end up giving much superior results is because at the end of the day they are all doing the same— all learners essentially work by grouping nearby examples into the same class; the key difference is in the meaning of “nearby.” When we have non-uniformly distributed data, even if complex learners can produce very different boundries to classify results, they still end up making the same predictions in the important regions (the region with a high number of training examples, and therefore also where most text examples are likely to appear). As you can see in the image below, whether a fancy curve, a straight line or a stepwise boundry, we can end up with the same predictions:  As a rule, try the simplest learners first (e.g., naive Bayes before logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor before support vector machines). More sophisticated learners are enticing, but they are usually harder to use, because they have more knobs you need to turn to get good results, and because their internals are more like black boxes. 4. Learn Many Models, Not Just One In the early days of machine learning, efforts went into trying many variations of many learners and still selecting just the best one. But then researchers noticed that, if instead of selecting the best variation found, we combine many variations, the results are better — often much better — and at little extra effort for the user. Creating such model ensembles is now very common: In the simplest technique, called bagging, we use the same algorithm but train it on different subsets of original data. In the end we just average answers or combine them by some voting mechanism.In boosting, learners are trained one by one sequentially. Each subsequent one paying most of its attention to data points that were mispredicted by the previous one. And we continue until we are satisfied with the results.In stacking, the output of different independent classifiers become the input of a new classifier which gives the final predictions.In the Netflix prize, teams from all over the world competed to build the best video recommender system. As the competition progressed, teams found that they obtained the best results by combining their learners with other teams’, and merged into larger and larger teams. The winner and runner-up were both stacked ensembles of over 100 learners, and combining the two ensembles further improved the results. Together is better!  ——— Attribution: These were just 4 of the 12 lessons needed to build successful machine learning applications extracted from this article: 12 Key Lessons from ML researchers and practitioners.

Sometimes the proofs are to formal for concepts that are supposed to be intuitive or obvious. Its a great reference but if you want algorithms, I’d recommend starting with OCW’s 6.006 first (or 6.046 for a more advanced version) Also, CLRS does not have a lot of real Machine Learning content. So I am not sure what exactly you’d want to get out of CLRS to do ML. Courses like CS229, cal tech’s undergrad ML courses (or even MIT’s 9.520) seem more appropriate to actually learn ML. Of course you need basic algorithms, like asymptotic analysis etc but I feel knowing probability, statistics and linear algebra are more useful than algorithms, but maybe thats just me because I’ve done a lot of algorithms and plenty of coding that I don’t really need it.

This hype is justified, and, as a result, create a lot of job opportunities.Doing a move is a good move - We are working in Computer Science. That’s not the kind of field you will apply the same thing your whole career. It is evolving fast, people have to keep looking the new stuff not to be too outdated. In this context, doing moving from your current place for something new is a kind of refresh which is definitely valuable. Both intellectually for you, and for your future employer. You are sending a message like: “Nope, I’m not a lifelong Java developer, I stay aware of the newest trends and have no problem adapting to it”. This is, to me, the real game changer.The Machine Learning market didn’t reached maturity (which is an opportunity) - I think that there is still a huge need of people to work on ML, and to integrate ML in companies as we did with IT previously. The good thing about it is that it opens a wide range of jobs. Learn about Machine Learning in order to find out what interests you the most about it. You can do research, research engineering, you can launch startup, start the first ML project of a company, join a R&D Team, different jobs/opportunities/environment.To me there’s no doubt, it is a great move.  Your experience in Java will help, but try to put it aside. My point is that, to learn a new thing, be open to it. You may need to change your point of view about some things. Don’t let your experience close your mind like “I worked 8y using Java guys, I’m not a rookie”. Let you start from scratch, then, you will see your experience helps. Then, the roadmap may vary depending on your objective. I’m quite biased here considering that I’m in research. To give a non exhaustive list: implement as much algorithm as you can - learning technique in class is good. If you already fully understand it the implementation will be fast. At least it proves you got it. In most cases, the implementation will raise many questions that you are not 100% sure about. I would personally (biais in 3… 2… 1….) prefer someone who exactly knows how a simple neural network works, than someone that can do image recognition with TensorFlow without any shit idea of what’s going on. My point of view.go one step further - it’s not easy nor always possible (because you need to sleep and live right?), but it is a good thing to at least write down, at the end of a project/exercise what would you implement/experiment to make it better. It can be “make learning rate a parameter” (implem) or “see what’s the effect of changing the learning rate” (experiment). If you have time do it, but at the very least, think about it. Again, it may raise interesting question into your mind.read papers - this point is quite conditional. Do it if you somehow like it. It’s interesting to see how the author speak about the technique he developed + he can give you ideas in his review of related works.do some competitions - See Kaagle or things like this. Some people would make it the first bullet point. I’m not found of it. You may like, you may not, anyway it’s a good training opportunity, and it may beget in touch with frameworks - well, I said that it is interesting to do things by your own hands. Right. But by the time, you want to build it easily, to integrate with other component and to get good performance (sorry to say you won’t use your own RNN implementation in a project, seriously). You could try TensorFlow & PyTorch, both Python but with really different philosophy. Then by the time you will probably read some project in every framework, thus getting a bit used. Then, its like programming language, there is no “one best”, just know which you prefer depending on the task/context.find a community, people who are doing the same kind of implementation, discussing things with others will help a lot and makes you see new perspectives — thanks Sarah Jamal, for this suggestion. I fully agree, not sure how I even missed it :)This answer is getting super long, do not hesitate to ask if I missed something or if I’ve been unclear.

When you talk about ML, you will be dealing with matrices and vectors every day. So, knowledge of Linear Algebra is a must. However, you’d also be required to know about other important topics like Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.Probability. Most ML algorithms try to “model” the underlying phenomena that generated the observed data. All of this modelling is probabilistic. It is therefore highly recommended that you are comfortable with the theory of Probability.Getting into actual ML:Take a great online course on ML. The most well-known course is the one offered by Andrew Ng (Coursera). It is a great course and it teaches you the basics of Machine Learning - Regression, classification, various ML algorithms, etc. The course also requires you to build a digit recognition system.Once you have the basics in place, it would be a great idea to practice some problems on Kaggle. Kaggle is a well-known Machine Learning contest platform where you can compete with others in training ML models on various datasets.Take up ML projects. This is the most important point. Ideally, you’d want to have not only ML experience but also some great projects on your resume that you can showcase. These projects will help you distinguish yourself from other candidates. After searching a lot for courses that teach ML through projects, I found the one by Eduonix quite relevant.The best way to learn Machine Learning is to actually apply it to real datasets and solve real problems.

Many businesses simply aren't aware of how machine learning could help them increase profits, and they will need the expertise to help them identify opportunities. However, there's a tendency in the software industry to view every new technology as a checkbox or a silver bullet. For example, many companies may have deployed a Hadoop infrastructure, because they read in the technical media that was the technology of the future. Deployment of such technologies for the sake of deploying the technology isn't going to make any gains for your business, which was the experience of numerous businesses who rushed head first to replace their existing data stores with Hadoop or who rush into data science without a business strategy that bridges how these technologies can be used effectively for business. There will be a demand for professionals who can help bridge the gap between business needs and technological capabilities. In the very long term, though, machine learning will almost certainly become just another core technology API. Some even speculate we will eventually experience what's been called the NLP singularity, in which computers are so good at interpreting the intent of humans that software engineers themselves can be replaced by NLP-fronted machine learning.

A Master’s degree in any engineering or science field with course work and a thesis involving Machine Learning application, if from a good university, will be of huge help in the learning. It will also make it easier to get job interviews. This is not to say that you cannot make it without a Master’s or Ph.D. You can, if you are dedicated enough; there are enough MOOCs, online learning material and contests to learn everything yourself. In fact, in India, many ML jobs do not expect a graduate degree, though the quality of work expected is no less than anywhere else in the world. Without a graduate degree, though, you will face the “Do you have work experience in Machine Learning?” paradox. You need relevant work experience to get the job, but how will you get relevant work experience before getting the job? There are some ways around it: Companies that do a lot of general analytics work, like Mu Sigma, Fractal, etc. do not expect prior relevant work experience for junior positions. You can make a move from Data Analytics to Data Science or Machine Learning more easily.Startups expect more of self-learning ability and less of work experience.Find projects in your own workplace that involves some ML. It won’t be part of your usual job description, so work overtime, impress your bosses, and gradually change your role in your organization.I’ve seen several resumes in which people completed 10+ or even 20+ online ML courses and put up personal projects on Github or personal blogs and websites.

In Machine Learning, you’d be working on a lot of optimizations that require knowledge of Calculus. It would be highly recommended that you are aware of functions, limits, differentiation, maxima, minima, etc.Linear Algebra. When you talk about ML, you will be dealing with matrices and vectors every day. So, knowledge of Linear Algebra is a must. However, you’d also be required to know about other important topics like Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.Probability. Most ML algorithms try to “model” the underlying phenomena that generated the observed data. All of this modelling is probabilistic. It is therefore highly recommended that you are comfortable with the theory of Probability.Getting into actual ML:Take a great online course on ML. The most well-known course is the one offered by Andrew Ng (Coursera). It is a great course and it teaches you the basics of Machine Learning - Regression, classification, various ML algorithms, etc. The course also requires you to build a digit recognition system.Once you have the basics in place, it would be a great idea to practice some problems on Kaggle. Kaggle is a well-known Machine Learning contest platform where you can compete with others in training ML models on various datasets.Take up ML projects. This is the most important point. Ideally, you’d want to have not only ML experience but also some great projects on your resume that you can showcase. These projects will help you distinguish yourself from other candidates. After searching a lot for courses that teach ML through projects, I found the one by Eduonix quite relevant.The best way to learn Machine Learning is to actually apply it to real datasets and solve real problems. Machine Learning is as much of an art as it is a science. You will learn it from experience. Your focus should be on attempting multiple ML projects so as to gain experience and build a strong profile.

6040862b22d1c358659e5492,https://www.quora.com/How-did-Aman-Goel-start-his-career-in-machine-learning?-,"I started with the most basic course on Machine Learning at IIT Bombay. The course was a relatively beginner level course and was focused on basic Machine Learning algorithms and the underlying Mathematics behind them. For instance, I learned about Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and basics of Neural Networks. Later, I took Andrew Ng’s course on Coursera which is certainly a great course to get started with ML. The course is a good mix of Algorithms + the Mathematics. The only downside is that it uses Octave as the programming language which obviously is something not very popular. After that, I studied deeper level details from books like Bishop’s Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Reading books is always a great idea, particularly when you want to dive deep into a subject. The book is highly detailed and you may want to read only specific portions which you are interested in - at least, that’s what I did. Subsequently, I focused on building stuff. The best way to learn something is to take up a couple of hands-on projects which teach you the concept end-to-end. Not only the projects are useful in learning, but also, they look great on the resume. For this, I took Eduonix’s course on Learn Machine Learning by Building Projects. The course is great for those who want to focus on applied Machine Learning rather than just the theory portion. Learning ML is like learning how to swim. You can never learn it by reading stuff. To actually develop skills in ML, focus on applying it and you will surely be a master at it. Read more such tech related content on my tech blog.

Make sure you do well on the GRE and I urge you to take it as soon as possible irrespective of when you wish to apply to universities abroad.  As far as I know, an RA abroad isn't a feasible option. I doubt any professor would offer a position to a non-domestic applicant with just an under-graduate degree. But do check. Maybe they do. If you can find a position with a stipend that covers living expenses, great.  From what I've learnt, universities in the US don't value work experience. So I don't think working for a company will help you with regard to admissions to universities abroad. Only if the job involves cutting edge research in Machine learning/Robotics, it may help. But in general, if you're sure of wanting to study further, I don't think working for a company is a great idea.  You could apply for an M.S immediately after B.Tech and get into some good programmes (uPenn, Georgia Tech for instance). But keep in mind that the M.S course is expensive (30-40 lakhs in tuition alone). (You may be able to. find an RA position that will cover some of the costs. Also, getting a job in robotics specifically may be hard.) Machine learning involves several areas, so you may be able to land a job involving machine learning in general.  There are some institutes doing pretty good research in Robotics and Machine learning in India. IIIT-H has a good robotics lab and they offer research positions for 6 months - 1year. You could also consider doing a masters/PhD there. They also have an excellent Computer Vision lab (CVIT). I'm sure there's good research being done in IISc in Machine learning. Possibly in some of the IITs as well.  Doing an internship/MS in India should give you great research experience and you'll probably be able to publish a couple of good papers. You can then make a competitive application to good PhD programmes in the US. (CMU, Stanford, Georgia Tech, uPenn, etc.) Unlike the MS, you will not be in debt when pursuing a PhD. Infact, you'll earn a fairly good stipend. Also, the expertise you acquire with a PhD is much greater than what you would acquire with an MS. From what I've heard, jobs in robotics are generally offered to people with PhDs. Of course, you can also choose to remain in academia. But do keep in mind that a PhD does require hard work. It's about doing meaningful independent research and not just taking courses.  As I mentioned earlier, I'm not really qualified to be giving advice as I'm in a similar situation to you. Whatever I've mentioned is based on my interpretation of things I've read from various sources. Do your own research and find an option that fits you. I hope I've given you some ideas on what you can consider. All the best!

Below I give a bunch of examples where math is used or helpful in ML. Research roles: If you are expecting to derive new formulas and develop new algorithms, then maybe you might be doing that in a role that is more research focused. For example, the Facebook team that developed their time series forecasting tool, Prophet, surely know a lot about Bayesian statistics, likelihood functions, the calculus of optimization, and Fourier transformations. That is the mathematical engine behind their modeling that they built. These guys are developing new methods, so they must know about the mathematics and understand it to a good degree. I’m positive these guys put pen to paper to write out the math and algorithm while they were developing it. Those people developing new neural network architectures to do many NLP and image modeling problems definitely know math and use it a lot. These guys need to understand the intricacies of how their network architecture works mathematically and computationally. Again, these roles are more research based. Just look at the many publications that come out in this space, some from academia and some from big companies like Facebook, Google, etc. Applied roles: If you are in an applied ML role, then you will mostly be using the tools/packages/libraries that others (who know the math) have developed. So, you just more need to know how to use them properly. But, use them properly helps if you know the math behind them. Here is an example: Let’s say you want to do model selection on a very large data set.The usual approach is to cross validate to find the best model.However, with such a large data set perhaps cross validation is expensive and time consuming. You have to refit the model on each fold.You can totally do it distributed with spark, but …A math person would know that information theory metrics like AIC/BIC are asymptotically equivalent to cross validation. Since AIC can be computed on a single model fit, there’s no need to repeatedly refit on any CV folds.Time saved to get an equivalent result.AIC/BIC model selection is great to use for time series modeling problems.Also again, it all depends on the role. Not every problem can or should be solved with machine-learning, so if you are doing more than just machine-learning then it is tremendously helpful to know/understand mathematics and statistics. Here is another example: Let’s say your task is to help your marketing team figure predict which customers are likely to buy more than once.You fit a bunch of classification models on the data set but your accuracy remains poor (say 65% accuracy on a balanced data set). You tried every possible model and no luck.Instead of telling your manager sorry I tried everything and I couldn’t get the accuracy to be that high you could instead …Model the problem using logistic regression, still get 65% accuracy, but then leverage the fact that logistic regression returns the significant drivers of your target metric (those lovely p-values).So, even though your model sucks you can still extract which predictors (which presumably characterize your marketing team’s customers) that make up a repeat buyer.The marketing team can then take that profile and target it more aggressively. Voila you’ve added tremendous value even though your target metric was not very predictable. Thanks to the math and statistics :)I am not sure why some people try so hard to down play and minimize the mathematics part of this space, probably because they don’t understand it I’m guessing. Honestly, can you be successful in ML without the math? Yes Can you find jobs where you don’t need the math? Yes Does the math help? Absolutely! Does it depend on the role? Absolutely!

It might just be impossible to do so or it might be doable. You have already spent one month on the problem. Do you spend another month or give up? How can you get up everyday and continue to hammer at the problem, when you have this constant nagging feeling that the given data/variable might just not be sufficient and the problem might just be unsolvable? On the other hand, in most software development projects, you know that the project is doable on Day One, and have a pretty clear idea which tools to use. I don't mean to under-appreciate the software engineering challenges involved in producing and maintaining big pieces of software or just in understanding and optimally reiterating customer requirements. But atleast feasability is often a given, in most corporate software projects. So for many people the inherent uncertainty and repeated failure at trying various approaches, the need to think very systematically, and having atleast some understanding of advanced maths (pink noise vs brown noise) might be frustrating, as compared to an SE position. As far as ""careers"" are concerned, both these fields change their form so rapidly, that probably no one can predict whether you will like one over the other ten years down the road. Twenty years ago software development used to be about knowing how to program from scratch, using relatively few libraries and frameworks. Today, the key skill is being able to connect the myriad of tools and libraries and frameworks together to get something to work. Your job is to create glue code that sticks ready made pieces together. Agile is being practiced everywhere which can be pretty stressful for many. Data mining used to have less ambitious goals, and was probably more of applied statistics. Less data, less computational capabilities. Today its all about big data, being able to use AWS and Hadoop, being able to query increasingly complicated RDBMSes, deep learning (black magic for many), and most importantly, your customers having very high expectations hyped up by media and industry buzz!  Who knows how either of career paths will be like tomorrow. Maybe SAP and Oracle and SaaS will completely wipe out the need for software developers in many commercial sectors. Or perhaps unsupervised learning methods will significantly reduce the need for data scientists, atleast vis-a-vis the kind of problems they work on today!

I had no SQL skills but showed up to the interview and got the job - I had the right attitude. Once that was contract was finished, I added SQL to my list of skills and slowly started building momentum as a database pro. Reading around online I found that a popular certification for SQL developers was focussed on SQL Server Analysis Services, I had a look at the syllabus and found that data mining was mentioned a lot. I studied data mining on my own, learnt the most common algorithms, learnt where I could fit it into my skillset. I won some freelance projects doing that. Wanting to dig deeper, I studied Mathematics courses by distance learning, slowly building on my skills. After a couple of years I had completed a fair amount of these courses and was getting a lot work in this new field of Machine Learning (in fact, data mining had just been renamed). I applied the University of Oxford to study a yearlong course that was at the same level as an undergraduate degree. I didn’t get in the first time. Finally, I was accepted to the course, worked hard at it and achieved a 93% average grade. During this time, my business grew and I was getting larger and larger projects from more important clients. I caught the machine learning bug and really wanted to do research, so I applied to lots of PhD programmes. I got into one of them. In order to focus more on my studies, I closed down my implementation business and started working with businesses on strategic engagements for very large projects. I productised that offering and also started experimenting with doing machine learning training for in-house teams of developers. Right now, I’m working on building online courses for people looking to make the jump to machine learning and also doing the occasional consulting project. This is by no means the *standard* way to get work in machine learning, but it’s been an interesting path and I mention it here to show that you don’t have to go the traditional route.

You need to realize that neither a bachelors degree in CS nor Statistics is likely to give you the training you need to be a ready-to-go ML practitioner. So if you have any chance of getting an employer to hire you, they’re going to be looking for evidence that you are hard working and intelligent. Both of those traits correlate a lot higher with CS degrees than Statistics degrees. Mathematics is another alternative to consider, since Pure Math is a lot more rigorous than Statistics. Math majors have comparable (and in some cases higher) intelligence to CS majors, but they may not be as hard working. I have simply never heard of a Statistics major (who had no further education) getting a crack at an ML job. For a CS major, it is still not easy to get an ML job without graduate schooling, but it is possible. You might have to settle for a job that starts out with doing mostly monkey coding in the beginning, and transition into a role that involves more ML development as you learn more about ML. This is possible, since most groups doing ML development also have need for monkey coders. What they generally don’t have a need for is B.S. holders who only know basic statistics and nothing else. A Stats majors is more likely to end up working at a market research firm than in an ML company. The other thing to consider is that knowing a lot about statistics is not so useful when it comes to “big data” machine learning, which is the most popular kind of ML today. Deep Learning is a form of “big data” ML. Statistics won’t teach you how to design a neural network. But when you have a lot of data, most of the stuff that a true statistician might worry about becomes inconsequential. Probability is important for a lot of ML techniques, but that’s only a very small part of what a Statistics major studies. The place where statistics would really be most handy is when trying to make inferences from “small data” sets. Unfortunately, small data learning is just not at all popular in the ML world these days, mainly because you generally can’t get very good results. When you don’t have a lot of data, usually the preferred solution is to get more data…not to throw a lot of statistics at it. In any case, your best bet to get a career in ML is to take a lot of ML classes, and you’ll generally only get that opportunity in graduate school, in a CS graduate program. And to get into a CS graduate program, you are definitely better off with a CS undergrad degree than a Statistics undergrad degree. My vote goes for CS.

You need to give ideas that are most promising more effort or resources then once you are done with those you can attack the increasingly less promising ideas with the remaining resources. The fun thing about research is that, you don't know what idea(s) will be actually worth pursuing further. That is why research is best done in groups and learning how to research is best done with the help of a mentor, like a professor who can help you figure out how to find a good research direction and build important solutions to important problems. But not everyone can have access to good mentors or groups. Thus in such a case: You must improvise, adapt and conquer. When starting out focus on breadth and then later, focus on depth. Get the overview of the field by spending time reading and washing videos especially the less technical ones. Start small and grow from there, make sure to read a lot of research papers, blogs and watch lecture videos on the topic of machine learning (ML) and practice a lot. Focus on understanding the underlying basic principles and never focus on memorization because you will end up forgetting and go back to square one after a while. There are now a lot of online courses you can take and lots of freely available reading materials such as blogs and actual research papers from many companies pursuing research in machine learning. Not to mention the availability of many programming tools that can enable you to quickly bring your research ideas to life. You just have to be disciplined and determined in order to find the time to read blogs, research papers and complete online courses. Many people are just not disciplined nor determined enough to self learn complex fields like machine learning to a level where they can do original research work. I mean it's not fun as it sounds, doing ML research is tedious work because you must spend an inordinate amount of time, from days to years, thinking and experimenting. You need to be comfortable with failing, because your ideas won't always produce the desired results and you need to start many times over. The process of absorbing ML literature is quite slow because you need to read, understand and practice. Reading doesn't mean just read once and throw away, no, you need to read over and over again while building your own understanding of the subject and then test your understanding by practicing. You need to go through that several times over in order to start being comfortable with your understanding and skills. Practice must start with simple and quick to solve exercises to avoid frustrating yourself followed by ever more increasingly challenging projects. You will build up your knowledge slowly and develop a perspective that is unique if you spend a great deal of time doing that. After reading a lot of literature and practicing a lot you can then start pursuing your own ideas. Check if they work and compare them to related work from other researchers, you will slowly become good at coming up with your own novel ideas and doing the right experiments to verify them.

In academia, there is no formal requirement to test code. You quickly learn the hard way, if you are the conscientious type, that this is never good idea because you check your work and you easily find mistakes (even if it seems to be the status quo that few others test their code). Secondly, you learn quickly how to mentally differentiate code that applies to one analysis or model, and code that should be reusable. In academia, if you take the coding part seriously, you’ll have a very strong bias to turn as much code into a reusable abstraction as you can. Yet, it can sometimes be hard to strike the right balance. Maybe you have a nice interface that nicely abstracts away as much logic as possible. But a reviewer asks for a new analysis that can sometimes not mesh well with those requirements you thought you needed for the code. Sometimes you have to ask yourself, do I write a hack to get around this because this is a one time thing, or instead should I invest time to update the interface to my code so I can do things like this more in the future? It can sometimes be quite unclear what the right balance is between pragmatism and maintaining extensible, reusable code, because you don’t know what your future projects / analyses will be. It’s important to keep in mind, in academia, your job is to produce research, not to write software, and you have a very limited amount of time. As a machine learning engineer, your primary job is to commit code to production, so there is less ambiguity about what future demands will be. But, there are still situations where similar concerns apply. Let’s say you would like to experiment with a new feature for your machine learning model, but you’re not sure if it’s going to help or not. Lets also say that writing the most comprehensive tests possible for these new features requires touching quite a few different systems and refactoring those systems so they place nicely with the new features. Well, that investment is clearly worthwhile if you are eventually going to use these features in production, but if it doesn’t help the model and you won’t eventually use them, is it the best investment in time to go through that investment? Finally, both being a machine learning engineer and doing quantitative academic research require being a good analyst and statistician, and having very strong attention to detail. Understanding why the outcome of an academic analysis or a machine learning model might not work often requires detective work. Sometimes, errors, bugs, or misunderstandings in early phases of a data processing pipeline have very detrimental effects to later phases, and this applies for both data processing pipelines in academia and machine learning engineering. For statistics, the specific techniques you need in a particular situation will always differ. But, cultivating the right mindset of skepticism, and when to trust and not to trust the data, are techniques that benefit from having a solid statistics background (and apply to both ML eng and academia).

Now, I want you to ask yourself: What happens when this field becomes obsolete or congested? What do you do then? What happens if people no more require a data scientist? (This day will probably never come, I am just putting forward an hypothetical case). It took me a lot of time to write this answer and I have tried to provide a comprehensive and holistic approach to make yourself not just capable enough to be a data scientist, but much more than that. Step 1 : Get your mathematics strong and clear. The following topics must be learnt with utmost clarity: Linear Algebra: Start from basic vector spaces and go up to Singular Value decomposition. Don’t underestimate G-S orthogonalization process.Matrix Theory: Learn to find the inverse, transpose, multiplication of matrices, determinants, Eigen values and vectors.Calculus: Integrals (This must be useful ), Differentiation (See here). Differential Equations (See here).Numerical Analysis: Numerical methods to find the solution of a Differential equation and Integrals.Statistics : Distributions, Different kinds of Charts, Mean - Mode - Median (Different methods of finding each and relation between them).Probability : Basic Probability theory, Bayes Theory, What is Likelihood?, Expectation.Don’t overdo the math. These suggestions are based on the assumption that you are strong in high school math syllabus. Step 2: Start reading blogs on data science: This site is like the hub of all data science, ML and AI related posts - KDNuggetsAnalytics Vidhya (See here)Anil Batra’s Blog (See here)BzST (See here)Data Science 101Data TauFor more go here: 90+ blogs on Analytics, Data Science etc. Step 3: Keep up the learning spirit. Keep yourself updated. Keep reading research papers and re-research the sections that you don’t understand. Google all the words and phrases you don’t understand, this process can be frustrating and might force you to go “Fuck this shit! I am gonna go study something simpler”. But believe me when I say that if you cross this phase, nothing can ever beat you. Be a regular visitor of Arxiv, read papers on a regular basis. If you are on Android, Arxiv comes as an Android App too. Step 4: Start some serious data science. (By data science I mean fuzzy Logic, ML, neural nets, AI, NLP etc.) ML by Andrew Ng at Stanford (Please avoid the one at coursera).ML by Abu Mostafa at Caltech.ML at NPTEL at IIT-M (For people outside India, NPTEL is an Indian site where students can see lectures by awesome professors from IITs and other institutes of national importance).Introduction to Data Analytics at Udacity.Introduction to Deep learning at Udacity by Google.Introduction to NLP using nltk-python (here).Introduction to Neural Networks: Book by Simon Haykin. Also learn how to use the neural network toolbox of MATLAB, comes real handy in visualising concepts.Introduction to Fuzzy Logic: Book by Timothy Ross. Same instructions as above.Learning data science concepts and R (or Python) simultaneously at DataCamp.I recently came across this site and this has made me fall in love with it. Check it out here: CodeMentor.Step 5: The Real Action Starts now Now that you are thorough with the basics, dive into making cool stuff with R, Python or any language of your choice. First and foremost let me give a very useful piece of advice. DO NOT TAKE UP A HUGE PROJECT AND END UP DOING NOTHING. Because, let’s face it, you (and me too) don’t have enough patience to sit and face the same dead-end a hundred times. Instead, take up a project and implement one functionality a day. This way you will have a balanced diet for your growing data scientist brain. Learn Numpy (Numpy|Official).Learn Pandas.Learn Matplotlib, Jupyter and Seaborn.These are the basic Python modules for data science using Python. I believe learning R is far easier than learning Python. Most of the R packages required for data science come pre-installed. However, a thorough list is as follows: stringr (string manipulation)Database connection packages RPostgreSQL, RMYSQL, RMongo, RODBC,RSQLitelubridate (time and date manipulation)ggplot2 (data visulization)qcc (statistical quality control and QC charts)reshape2 (data restructuring)plyr (data aggregation)dplyrThere are many more packages, you may explore them in your own time. Tips and Tricks: To save yourself from the hassle of installing so many modules each and every time on Python, use WinPython (download here). This will have most of the modules pre-installed in it and you can also use it in portable mode.For R, download the <package name>-release.zip from CRAN, and save it in a local directory. However, you will need an internet connection to install it, for that you can simply tether your phone’s data to your pc (if you don’t have Wi-Fi).For downloading any package, simply search <package name> Python module, or <package name> R package on Google.After you are done with the above, and if you still have some juice left, dive into the following: Data Visualization: d3.js, tableau, qlikview.Learn Julia.Compete at Kaggle.Learn MongoDb.For any doubts or queries, please comment below.

Let's say you want to detect an anomaly and have thus defined your problem ( to an extent).Let's further assume that you have researched the available machine learning frameworks and zeroed in on Apache Spark. It's a nice framework , it is scalable , it has a good number of algorithms like GBT, GMM etc.Now,1. Which algorithm would you use for your problem? GBT provides good results for a majority of the problems on Kaggle. But what if the ideal solution isn't in the same hypothesis space as the one proposed by GBT? Your degree in machine learning enables you not just to know what algorithms are out there but also provides you the capability to know which algorithm to use in which scenario. Of course , your ability to make a judgement call on the algorithm to be used gets better with practice.What your degree provides you with is the ability to understand what kind of hypothesis space each algorithm operates in and hopefully also some useful practice.I would encourage you to take some basic machine learning course and  then take applied machine learning courses which use these techniques to solve vision/signal problems 2. This should really be the first point , but , Let's say you defined your problem. Now, what kind of features would you use to build your dataset ? How would you know feature A is more useful than Feature B? Or how would you know that feature C is useful only when it is normalized ?Feature engineering is really one of the most important tasks in any machine learning problem. Getting your features right is 60% of the problem solved.And this aspect of feature engineering is one thing you'd learn in any machine learning class. To sum up,What would via a degree in machine learning - what algorithms are there ? How do they work? What makes them different from each other ? Which ones would you use in a particular situation? What kind of features work well with a particular algorithms? What kind of feature transformation techniques are available ? Those are just things I could think of.
