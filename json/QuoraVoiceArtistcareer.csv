You need to start… While I don’t think most people want to take my long path, here’s what worked for me and how you can do that in a shorter timeline. However, I made many mistakes early on and had some challenges that slowed me down. Find resources: VoiceoverXtra is a great website with lots of resources. It’s probably an overwhelming amount for anyone new to this world. And that’s just one place. However, go there and start exploring. Everyone there is in the voice over and voice acting world, is very knowledgeable, will provide you good advice and will link to other great resources. Make mistakes: Record yourself. Put yourself, and your voice, out there before you’re ready and then learn from it. Practice. Read aloud every day. Record yourself reading. Listen back to yourself. Then do it again. Try to remove all the punctuation and do it again. Put the punctuation where it needs to be to make this sound right for you, where it works for breathing and to make the copy sound real. Get thick skin. Get used to hearing yourself, and that you sound quite different from outside your head. I recorded my first work when I was like 17, PSA’s and sponsorship scripts for a college radio station. I had to listen to those horrible readings for several months before I had the opportunity to record them again. In that time I learned a lot about how to do it better. Get some training: My training started, completely by accident, shortly before my voice dropped. I had a lisp (called siblance in our world) plus the added benefit of stuttering and stammering. As a result, I mumbled. A lot. Speech therapy allowed me to make my mistakes in front of another person’s ears, hear how I could properly explore the different parts of my mouth, deliver words with more energy & presence, how to strengthen my lips, tongue and vocal cords. I learned and practiced several tongue twisters I still use to warm up. Don’t have the issues I encountered? Find your local community college, community theater group or comedy group and take an acting or improvisational class. Don’t want a class, or have a class nearby, look for a Meetup group for acting, improv or theater in the area. Start one if one doesn’t exist. For me… part of training is you, alone, learning how to be comfortable being uncomfortable while sounding comfortable. Oh, and get good exercise. Lung capacity is important. This will all prepare you for the next step… Get Coaching: The best thing you can do is have a professional in the field who helps you, to sound more like the best version of you, by giving you positive feedback and a positive path to grow and develop. I learned the best from a friend who was a very skilled producer/director and she helped me get so much better over several years of working together. We’d play back a reading, dissect how to do it better, then try again. I used this and would record my coaching sessions with my students. I’d ask my voiceover students to tell me about something great or exciting that happened to them. Later, I’d ask them to read a script. The next session I would have those recordings ready to play. I’d let them compare the sound of telling me a story and then reading me a story. Then we would work on getting the sound of reading a script more like them telling me a story. Proper coaching prepares you for proper mic position and technique and working with future producers, directors and clients too. If you skip it - you’ll regret it. There are coaches out there for all lines of voiceover and voice acting. They should all be positive, have a goal in mind (that you both develop for you together) and come to a point where they can no longer teach you more in a worthwhile manner. Once you have coaching under your belt, even if you don’t feel completely done, but you’ve started nailing your reads, gaining confidence and know how to avoid siblance, plosives, can change your energy from serious to ecstatic (with the same copy) without complaint, or many missteps, the next step is… Make your demo(s): You and your coach should agree that you’re now ready to make your demo(s). This isn’t something you should, in my opinion, schedule on day one. It also isn’t something that should takes years to be ready for. It can be weeks of work, if you have some natural skills and talents, or it can be months if you really need to develop your instincts and skills. The more prepared you are and the more willing you are to do the work to challenge yourself, the better this will be. Work with a demo producer who knows what they’re doing. Get recommendations. Many people at this stage are actually landing some work. Perhaps you’ve volunteered for a local friend or no profit to do a commercial, video, their phone system, or even get paid. You’ll need to work with the demo producer to get more coaching (mainly to select scripts and for them to learn your range) or you’ll work with your present coach to do this and the demo producer will record you before editing and mixing your demo. Please don’t make your own demo. Unless you’re a producer yourself it’s nearly impossible and, even if you are, it will take you far longer than it should to make it. Get equipment: Many people pick up the equipment along the way. You need a computer and then a low quality mixer (Behringer UM2 is as low as about $30), something like a Shure SM58 (about $90 or less, used is usually fine), an low quality XLR cable ($10 from a local music shop), some semi decent headphones (Audio Technica ATH M30X for about $60 or Sony MDR7506 for closer to $99) and software (Audacity is free and ‘good enough’ for awhile). These can be upgraded as needed with a proper mixer, a microphone that’s better suited to your voice and these headphones can be in your ‘road kit’ as you upgrade). You can land low paying jobs doing fan based work that will pay $5 - $20 for cartoons, game expansion packs and other work at places like ‘Casting Call Club’ and online groups. Once you have professional quality equipment you’re ready for the next steps… Marketing yourself and getting clients, managers or agents: You will need to tell people about who you are. You’ll need to have a niche (don’t be the person who claims ‘I can voice anything’) You’ll need business cards and a website where you can post your demos. You’ll need to network. This will give you clients. Clients give you cash flow and credibility. Cash flow and credibility establish you as a professional. You then become bookable. Bookable people who can do good work for clients, and can represent themselves well, can get representation from an agent or manager. You shouldn’t pay a manager money up front. For anything. Some will want more demos for a niche you don’t have represented well. Some will even pay for these to be made as an investment in your business and theirs. Overnight success?: As you can see - this might not be something you can do overnight. But, maybe you can. Start this as a hobby. Learn as you go. Build on what you do. Start making money. It’s a great problem to look at your full time job and feel like it’s holding you back from making what you should be making. Many people aren’t prepared to work on their own and many successful voice talents I know keep a part time job.

There have been a lot of attempts to present her as The Female Dylan which understandably annoys her as she likes to be considered an artist in her own right (and who could blame her). She's never really liked him even though he gave her a spot on the Rolling Thunder Revue tour which helped to boost her career. Bob and Van Morrison shared a bill for a short tour in 1998 and apparently the three didn't get along at all.  The most telling quote Joni gave about Bob comes after they performed together in 1994 ""On the third night they stuck Bob at the mic with me and that’s the one that went out on tape. And if you look closely at it, you can see the little brat, he’s up in my face — and he never brushes his teeth, so his breath was like… right in my face — and he’s mouthing the words at me like a prompter, and he’s pushing me off the mic. lt’s like he’s basically dipping my pigtail in ink.""  The plagarism quote comes at a time when Joni revived her recording career after an effective retirement. Bob had released a string of albums which were incredibly well received and were huge sellers. Several of them were on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 500 best albums of all time. Suddenly Bob wasn't just a nostalgia act he was considered relevant to the times and his knew albums were eagerly anticipated and devoured. MItchell's return to recording was greeted well but didn't recieve the glowing tributes Bob did. It appears she wanted some of the adulation Bob enjoyed as not just an elder statesman but as a contemporary recording artist as well and was annoyed she didn't get it.  As Andy Lohr has said, Bob borrows phrases and expressions from artists he's admired and things he's been reading. He's always done it and has always been open about it. Sometimes he quotes things that are more obscure but frequently his reference points are easier to spot. Michael Gray's book Song and Dance Man went to pains to document the references Dylan has included from the Old and New Testament long before his born again albums. Quite why this should annoy Ms Mitchell who comes from the same folk tradition Bob does is a bit of a mystery.  Joni and Bob are both considered fairly difficult people to get along with but Bob has always played his cards close to his chest and doesn't like talking about other people in derogatory terms. Mitchell however has always been a fairly bitter person and more than happy to vent. Finally there are those who believe Joni's dislike of Bob stretches way back to the seventies. Check out this video from The Band's Last Waltz. Everyone joins the group and Dylan onstage for a final rendition of I shall Be Released. It's clear a great time is being had by all. Neil Young (who has never held back in his admiration of Dylan) is clearly loving being onstage with Bob but keep your eyes on Joni who is standing next to him. She never cracks a smile and looks bored and annoyed throughout. Joni has always been a bit weird and prickly.

It's an example of how a boorish, egocentric person with no sense of empathy can blight someone's career with just one unjustified criticism. Fortunately, it did not have a lasting impact on me, but that was only a matter of chance. I am sure that the very selfish and thoughtless person who made it has done a lot of damage to others during his life. I have not shared this story with anyone outside my immediate family before, but reading this question brough the experience back. I believe that we all take responsibility for our actions and that if we make mistakes we may suffer as a consequence. However, it is also true that there are people who, however careful and conscientious you are, are impossible to please. Maybe it's because they feel inferior- perhaps with good reason- and they bolster themselves up by bringing others down. I'm not a psychologist, so I don't know. I also think that we should all be able to accept criticism and learn from it, provided that it is offered in a constructive way. Certainly, I have learned from past mistakes, and have no problem accepting other people's guidance and opinions. The key word, though, is ""constructive."" Here's the story: Back in the '90s, I was on the way to establishing myself as a composer and musical director. No, you haven't heard of me because I use a pseudonym in my professional life. In between jobs, I filled in as a freelance sound engineer, doing mainly voice recording: audiobooks, language courses, tourist guides and the like, and sometimes live sound for corporate and other events such as product launches, political speeches, and so on. I had a number of regular customers, and one of my main ones was a studio that recorded audiobooks. It was a good situation for me, as the work schedule was flexible, and I was able to make a good living whilst building up my musical reputation. I worked with many leading actors and voice artists and also enjoyed a great relationship with the various producers who worked for the different publishers. Except one. This guy, who went by the name of Stuart Owen, was a generally disliked by everyone in the industry. Before my first recording session with him, the studio owner/manager warned me that he was ""difficult."" I therefore went into the session with my wits about me, determined not to make a mistake. As it happened, the recording went well. The voice artist was the actor Simon Callow, who was a pleasure to work with, although Owen's abrupt manner, which often verged on rudeness, ensured that the prevailing mood in the studio was sombre and oppressive. Nevertheless, Simon did a professional job, as one might expect, and the production was a success, despite Owen's presence in the control room. Just to clarify- the role of the producer in any kind of sound recording studio is rather like that of a director on a film shoot. A good producer is an inspiration to work with, not just guiding his charges on technical matters, but also setting a creative mood. Owen was the opposite. He was known as someone who got the production jobs because he was an adequate administrator; someone who could be relied upon to finish the project on time and on budget. Nothing more than that. Everyone- studio engineers, voice artists, even the studio receptionist, all hated working with him. He was tolerated at this particular studio because he brought a lot of work in. Shortly after my first session with him, the studio boss thought that I was OK to be trusted with him, so he booked me into another. This session was a recording of a debut book by an unknown author, featuring the author herself doing the reading. The book was autobiographical and went on to achieve a degree of success. The author turned out to have a natural aptitude as a reader. She was easy to work with and the session went well, with the usual morose atmosphere that Owen dragged around like a bad smell lightening noticeable every time he left the room. At one point, the reader tripped over a word and mispronounced it. Owen did not appear to notice it, so I made a note on my copy of the script and during the next break, pointed it out to him. His response was to say that the mistake did not matter. I located it on the recording and played it to him in order to point out that it most certainly did- it was very noticeably wrong. It would have taken about a minute for the reader to re-record the phrase in question and for me to drop it into place. She was quite prepared to do so. Owen ignored me. I mentally shrugged my shoulders and made a note to myself to refer the issue to the studio boss. Had I not noticed, Owen would have had a definite reason to complain about me. It is part of the recording engineer's job to be aware of what is going down, and to keep his/her ears open for glitches such as this. The session finished and I went home feeling a little frustrated- I don't like submitting inferior quality work, but I considered that I had, at least, done my best. The next day, as I arrived at the studio, the owner was waiting for me. He informed me that, after the previous day's session, Owen had walked round to his flat, which was close by, and complained that I had ""undermined"" him. I have to say that I was in shock. It took me a few moments to grasp exactly what had happened. I had an unblemished record as a recording engineer, not only at this studio but at all the others at which I worked, and being criticised for such a stupid non-reason was hard to comprehend. I also found it hard to comprehend that anyone, even someone as untalented as Owen could be such an asshole. To cut this, already quite long story short, Owen insisted that I did not work on any more of his recordings. Other regular engineers could not work with him, either because they refused to do so or because the studio boss did not think that they were up to the particular challenge that he offered. Therefore, although I had the boss's support, he had to hire in a new freelancer to attempt to deal with Owen's future sessions. However, I still continued with the process of editing Owen's recordings. I coped OK with this, as I did the job alone without him being present. This work consisted of cutting out out-takes, and the odd extraneous sounds that find their way into recordings- page turns, coughs, overlong pauses, etc. During one edit, I was unsure of which take I was supposed to keep and which I should remove. Taking a deep breath, I therefore phoned Owen to ask him. To say that the conversation was strained would be an understatement, but he answered my question and I finished the edit to my usual standard. Then... a day later... guess what? He'd complained again, about my phoning him, despite the fact that I had been polite, and kept the exchange of words to a minumum. The upshot was that Owen threatened to stop using the studio if I remained there as a freelancer. This was a regular job that was earning me between £1,200 and £1,500 per month, which was quite good money back at that time. It only occupied about 8–10 days per month, which left me the rest of the month to take jobs at other studios and get on with my music career. Losing it, therefore was quite a blow. Legally, I did not have a leg to stand on. As a freelancer, I had no emplyment rights. I just had to suck it up and press on. Fortunately for me, I had just been offered a musical director's job with a leading theatrical production company. This was due to start about a month later, and it became a long-running partnership. The following year, I was also signed up to a major agency that dealt with film and TV composers. I'm still working with them now. In my case, this asshole did not do any long-term damage to me. Had I been relying on my studio engineering work for a permanent living, as many engineers are, it would have been devestating, with my income reduced by about 50% at a stroke. However good you are at what you do, it's hard to think of any defence against an egotistical, vindictive dickhead like this one. Sorry- a bit of a long post. I hope that it was worth reading.

Well, when you consider the indisputable fact that every successful voice actor today was once a newbie, then of course the answer is ""yes!""  I guess the relevant question is more like ""why do so many newbies give up the business after a year or two?""  I'm not sure that there's been any scientific surveys about this, but I think the top reasons off the top of my head would be: Lack of skills and training. Some people feel that because their friends or family tell them what a ""great voice"" they have, or because they can do a half-decent imitation of some popular cartoon voices, they're good enough to enter the marketplace. Not even remotely true. Voice acting is acting, and you need training to understand how to create a character and make strong acting choices. And even if you've been in the business for a while, it's always a good idea to ""sharpen your saw"" periodically, or to get some insight from a coach who keeps up with the latest trends in advertising styles. While being a good actor is a necessity, if you're submitting auditions in a style that is outdated, you're not going to book as many jobs.Speaking of which, another reason people drop out is a thin skin, or an easily-bruised ego. Even more so than ""normal"" acting, voice acting is characterized by rejection and isolation. Most of the time you'll record auditions in your home studio, send them off to your agent, and...nothing. Not a peep. No feedback, positive or negative. And did I mention isolation? You can gather round the water cooler, if you happen to own one, but your only conversational partner might be your cat. It's just the nature of the job, and some people can't handle that amount of rejection. Most of your day as a voice actor, by far, will be spent looking for clients (and even if you have an agent, chances are the majority of your business will come from your own efforts). Precious little time is actually spent doing the fun stuff, i.e. acting.Recording a lousy demo will also kill many careers before they get off the ground. Your commercial demo is your calling card, much more important than a resume (which I've never been asked for as a voice actor). It is absolutely not something that you should rush into, or try to cut corners on, and for God's sake never produce it yourself!  If you record a demo before you're ready to do so (because you don't think you need training, or you fall for one of those fly-by-night ""demo mills"" that promise to give you ""a professional demo after three easy lessons!""), or you record one that shows a lack of understanding of how to act for advertising, or has long periods of music before your voice is heard, or has other voices on it to the point where a listener can't tell who you are, or uses out-dated music beds, or has all the tracks in the same tone of voice, or (God forbid) is so poorly recorded that you can hear somebody doing dishes in the background (I wish I was making that up!)--and proceed to send said demo to a bunch of agents...well, don't say I didn't warn you. It might get a five- or ten-second listen before the Delete key is hit. And agents have long memories! When you come to your senses and record a decent demo a year or two later, those agents will probably delete it without listening. The biggest reason people drop out? They fail to treat it as the business that it most certainly is. They're afraid to reach out to potential new clients, they don't follow up with existing clients, they don't keep track of expenses and tax obligations, they don't network with colleagues, they don't have a business plan, etc. etc. etc. And worst of all, they don't put a professional value on their skills. If it's ""just a hobby,"" then, hey, why not do this voice job for ""the exposure"" or for $5? Why not? Because it's the surest way to failure! Lack of business sense is not at all uncommon among ""creatives."" That's OK, as long as you either partner with someone who can cheerfully and competently handle that end of the business, or learn how to do so yourself. Otherwise, you're likely to become yet another ""failed newbie.""  Unless you are exceptionally lucky, failure will outweigh success, and expenses will outweigh income for the first few years of your voice acting career. Understand that, prepare for it emotionally and financially, and you stand a much better chance of surviving that rough start. The ratios should gradually start improving, the dead periods between jobs should become fewer and further apart, and if you work hard and constantly try to improve your skills, you may wake up one day and realize that you're actually busy enough to consider either turning away work or hiring an editor/producer to help manage the deluge!

Finding clients, delivering recorded auditions and work, and even getting paid for your work can all be done online. I’m in the Richmond, Virginia area, and over 90% of my recording is done in my home studio. I’ve only met a handful of my clients face-to-face. I have agents in New York, Atlanta, and Amsterdam, and work by phone with one of the top VO coaches in Los Angeles. Clients from (literally) around the world find me through my website, my membership in various professional organizations, and referrals from VO colleagues. Now, to be sure, there are limits. If your dream is to voice animated characters for a Pixar movie, say, or for one of the many animated shows on TV, then yes, location matters. As one of my coaches explained, the people in LA who cast those shows want to know you, to see you audition face-to-face numerous times for a wide variety of roles. They want to have a good idea of not just your range as an actor, but also your professionalism and character. They’d much rather work with a very talented and reliable actor than with a genius who’s temperamental and flaky. It takes time to develop that level of familiarity and trust, so being there is really essential. This is also true, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent, for movie trailer and promo work. I do know of at least one successful voice actress who, after working on many successful animated shows, was able to move back home to Canada and yet still be cast in new shows. But there’s no way she could have done that without having first paid her dues for years in LA. I’ve done some animation VO work in Richmond for clients like Sesame Workshop (makers of Sesame Street) and others, but never for a network animated series. But for the myriad non-animation VO genres, such as commercials, corporate narration, audiobooks, telephony, e-learning, documentary narration, etc., the geographical boundaries have largely disappeared.

If you are interested in dubbing, find cartoons on YouTube and try to do different characters. When you make the first demo, sound quality is not so important. Do NOT buy expensive equipment. You can record your first demo with your phone. The purpose is to find out if other people think you have a talent for voice-overs. Play your demo to people who will honestly say what they think of your performance. This may be difficult because people tend to soften their opinions. If you know someone who is in the business; advertising, music or film industry, etc. Try to get to play it to them. Usually, people are better in some styles than in others. There is no use trying to break through by doing something average. Find out what is the style you are best at. If you have a deep sound, you can do all kinds of commercials that require that convincing voice-over or you may be good at doing characters and know how to act and sound natural or you may have a soft voice which is great for narratives. Make a new demo and make it your greatest hits collection, but not too long. Choose 3–4 best samples and try to keep the total duration around 2 minutes. Begin by saying your name and telling something about yourself in one short sentence so that the person who listens to your demo remembers you. After the introduction go straight to the samples. This real demo should be as good as you can make. If you believe you have the talent and you have had positive feedback, you may want to invest in a decent microphone ($100–$200). You can do the recording with a free Audacity app or f you are a Mac user you already got a great recording program the GarageBand. The hardest part is the recording environment. Check out from the web tips on how to do acoustic treatment to your recording room. The best option would be using a proper studio but if you don-t know somebody who has one, that could be quite expensive. After getting your demo done contact people who are in the line of business you are interested in. If you would like to do radio and tv commercials, look for agencies and studios who advertise themselves as professional commercial studios. Ask if they are looking for new talents and ask if you can come to do an audition or send your demo. Probably, you can at least send your demo. Do not leave it there. Remember to contact them again after a week or so. Ask for feedback! Even if your demo will not lead to a gig, you can get valuable feedback from the professionals and hone your skills.
