As a result, freelance authors are in high demand. Since many people have to be marketed and juggled at once, organization and process processes can help to guarantee that you have regular and timely work to do. Here are some suggestions for a good self-employed profession to create you: (i) Have a portfolio. LinkedIn, though it's a wonderful way to save your writing curriculum vitae and honors, is a great place to compile your own writing portfolio, so you have a blog or website as a professional. (ii) Establish a referral submission framework. Some of the more popular freelancers are looked to for the bulk of their jobs. (iii) Set up the receivable method for invoicing and accounts. It's quick to get lost in the paper and to neglect to submit an invoice or track someone who hasn't charged. (iv) Provide your best work by the time limit.

Yes, you can become a Makeup Artist with no basic degree, but there are certain qualities you do need to make you a successful Makeup Artist. First and foremost is understanding the client. Take time to interact and find what kind of make-up they want. Recognize the event and select the most suitable look for it. You cannot have grungy bold make up for a classy black-tie event or severe formal ensemble at a birthday party. Analyze the skin type and tone of the client as all of the makeup depends on it. Choose your materials and shades upon it. Makeup brands have not perfected the shades to every single client you get. You will need to understand color to customize and blend products to suit your Client's skin tone. Creativity is the ability to come up with unique looks by creating a style for your own. Your work should stand out in the crowd distinctly. Be flexible and have an action plan to avoid panic-ridden situations. You should be able to do last-minute fixes even if it's in a hurry. Professionalism is a must to maintain good clientele. Be on time and always treat your customers politely and with patience. Build a good rapport with your client. Engage in cheerful banter that will have them looking forward to booking you again and refer you to friends and family. Just take care not to be prying and invade their privacy. The last rule is the Willingness to Learn. Like any other art, there is always room for improvement and new techniques to learn. Find a mentor to coach you through the process of establishing yourself. Working or interning under a reasonably successful artist will lend you connections and leads that you cannot generate on your own. Kulsum Parvez academy has a hands-on training program and the students get to work under the tutelage of Kusum herself. She believes in the personal touch and even has students intern under her watchful eye to give them experience in the real field. Keep the above in mind when you are training to be an MUA or when you are an actual Makeup Artist for these simple thoughts will launch a successful career that you would only dream of.

However, I think if you are at the beginning of your makeup career, it is wise to get licensed or certified. The reason that I feel this was is that I believe that legislation is going to change and become more strict about who is allowed to legally work as a makeup artist. I think this will come as a result of the infiltration of beauty influencers on the makeup artistry industry. While many of them are very talented makeup artists, without training, they may make dangerous choices in regards to hygiene, or with putting unsafe materials in tender places (an example I frequently use is using wig glue to attach false lashes, which I’ve heard of influencers and untrained artists doing).  I think that states are going to realize that there’s also a large financial gain for them to require licensure, if they don’t do it as a result of something terrible occurring, like an eye infection or blindness. It is also a good idea to go to school so you can learn things outside of artistry (which, from what I am told, most schools barely touch on depending on the program anyway, so you should DEFINITELY continue to practice on your own and perfect the artistry part of the craft!) - sanitization, laws, business practices, etc. I have also seen other artists who DID choose to go to school get opportunities through their former instructors who are likely well-connected in the industry, so the networking opportunities of professional training are valuable as well! I am considering going back to school so that I can have a license so that I am ready when these changes happen and don’t have to completely stop my career at that point. I wish I had gone to school initially, though, so that I don’t have to pause now for it. Best of luck to you! First, certified and qualified are two very different things.

If that’s the case, then Shatner has very likely worn a hairpiece in every stage, film and television role from the 1950s up to the present. This would, of course, entail his wearing a hairpiece to auditions during his early career, including for Star Trek. There is no question that Shatner’s hair color, texture and styles vary greatly from one screen appearance to another, lending to the rumor that he changes hairpieces as often as he changes acting jobs. Fellow actor George Takei claims that Shatner wore a toupee from the very beginning of the 1960s Star Trek television series. However, makeup artists on that show have claimed that Shatner did, indeed, have a full head of hair (and the makeup department would be in a position to know, since they shampooed, conditioned, dried and styled his hair on a regular schedule). In fact, to artificially age Shatner in one Star Trek episode (“The Deadly Years,” Season 2, Episode 12), the makeup department had to make him partially bald with a skin head wig, which implies they were covering up his natural hair:  ^^^ Shatner wearing a skin head wig (to cover his natural hair) in the 1960s Star Trek episode “The Deadly Years” (S2E12). As for Shatner himself, he still seems to enjoy perpetuating the mystery of his hair, even at age 89, and he has teased about the subject in various appearances, interviews and his autobiography over the years.
