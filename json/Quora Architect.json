A good software engineer may be excellent at coding, excellent and detailed in their approach, and have a great deal of insight into the problem, but still may not be a good architect. At a minimum, a good architect should have the following skills: An architect is excellent at problem decomposition.   Problem decomposition is the skill necessary to see a problem at virtually any level and break it down into the steps and pieces necessary to implement it.
