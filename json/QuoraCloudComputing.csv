Please handle with patience. So, like every established private engineering college in West Bengal, the messiah of placements viz, TCS came to our campus just a day before the Durga Puja and the entire process was a 2-day affair. Many of us dreamed of pandal hopping with our loved ones boasting about a job and earning some pride that was completely lost around 4 years back. The preparation was in full swing and then comes the D-day. The morning I reached our college auditorium and we were made to wait for the TCS people to come. Around 10 am, I saw almost a dozen of white XUVs to rush into our campus with 60–65 good looking pretty faced raiders bumping into the auditorium as armada of anti-hero in movies rush to capture the heroine(those who are fans of south Indian action movies can surely relate to the scenario, take me one for your team. They are damn entertaining!!!). Now, the HR gave a well directed and scripted presentation citing examples of how does it feel to be a part of the parallel government in the nation. I along with our breed of 300 hungry job seekers was deeply convinced. This is it! If some good exists in this world, that has to be those glass buildings in the video! Then began the interview process. The first day had aptitude round and email writing round followed by a personal and HR interview on the next day. Being one of the toppers, I was exempted from the aptitude round and had to write an email. As I was about to head towards the venue, I heard the voice of our TPO “Hey Kaushik, what are you wearing?” I was confused. “Am I wearing anything wrong?”, I tried to remember my image in front of the lone hostel mirror some 3 hours back. “You will go with brown shoes and black pants for the interview?”, she shouted. “I have nothing else to wear. I will manage if required from someone who gets rejected today”, I calmly reverted(just see the confidence !!) Luckily, I cleared the email round. Next day, it was the personal interview. I was introduced to two panelists say P1 and P2. P1 was busy with his laptop(utilizing free wi-fi to the fullest) and P2 was busy with his smartphone. After a formal introduction and trying to sell me like any other random commodity, P1: So, I think you are from CSE background. Let’s discuss C++. Me: Sir, I would like to let you know that I am from EE background and I don’t know C++. However, I know C and JAVA. P2(not taking eyes off his phone): What? You don’t know C++ and you are into an IT interview. Ok, tell me is the AC an ac or dc? Me: It runs on AC supply sir and spoke all gibberish to keep them back on my track. P1(after a dramatic pause): So Kaushik…., I think you may leave. You should know C++ I think. Me(attempting a futile effort to impress): If given a chance I will learn in these few months. P2: Please leave(Facepalm…) I came out shattered and only got some comfort hearing other’s experiences. To my surprise, I was asked to wait and around 4 pm, I was again called for an interview, not sure if he was HR(all were so well groomed I say!!!).Let’s assume HR only. HR: So, Kaushik. I heard that you don’t know C++ but willing to learn. Me: Yes sir. I will learn for sure.(Back in my mind are my answers that famous??) HR: Do you know how to cook? Me: No sir. HR: You couldn’t learn cooking. How will you learn C++? Me: Again some gibberish about online courses, books etc HR: You must have learned. Anyways nice to meet you. Any questions? Me: Which one to learn? HR: I guess you need to know both to thrive. Bye. Results came a bit late that night and that’s my story…. And finally, Verdict: Oh!! Come on. Please see my credentials. I was too good to be selected. That night while many were busy planning pandal hopping, I took the last possible train from one of the most desolate places I have ever been, thought about my bag of dreams and moved on… P.S: Now, it’s easy to recollect these memories. But 3 years back it was a learning experience. I took that night seriously. Now I am a good cook and know C++ as well(with 2 years work-ex on both). If the HR of this story is reading, please ping me personally for dinner to discuss C++. You certainly deserve it. -Kush… Continue Reading",2021-03-04T14:46:13.754Z,"What are some interesting campus recruitment rejection stories? ",Quora

Fortunately, Computer Science has so many paths to take for starting a decent career path. You can be Software Developer, Software Engineer, Project Management personnel, Quality Assurance Engineer, System Analyst, Data Science Expert, Artificial Intelligence Expert, Machine Learning Expert (also AI), A Scientist/Researcher, Scholar in Academic sector and many other things. However, considering all these things I would like to categorise this decision making into 3 paths. Academic & Research : If you have very good academic results or excellent CGPA, then you would probably be interested in going to Teaching or Research in both Academic and Corporate sectors. If you are interested in Teaching, Research etc then you should just jump into your higher studies as soon as you graduate. If your CGPA is average/below average but you are still want to pursue this career path, then you can probably do some research work with a good professor for a while in your university and have a few good publications. This can be very helpful for the admission into renowned universities for higher studies. Don’t hesitate or waste your time if you want to go for this path. Jobs in Software Industry : If you have passion for software development things, you have to find out by yourself what you like most. Development tasks can be boring. So, unless you love what you do, you won’t feel good at your job. If you like Enterprise Software Development, find good companies around you who works in your preferred technologies. If you prefer mobile app development, then find companies that work in such things. Same goes for all other technologies and paths. If you don’t like core development things, then you may like project management, software testing, quality assurance and many other things. And there are many such roles in the companies where you can apply. However, the real problem can happen at another thing. As this is your first job, The big mistake that you might make can be “You go for the job that pays you most” . Believe me on this thing, Never do this. For your first job, Always choose that company which allows you do what you love most and the best possible opportunity to learn. There are many practices in Software Development/Engineering that you may think you know BUT actually you don’t know yet. You may not know how to write good, modular, reusable, testable codes, you may not know best practices of different layers in a good product development, You may not know how to work in a team as a good team member. These things are really important for your career. I have seen many of my friends and juniors do join a few big companies that pays better than others. But unfortunately, soon their job role gets limited to a certain thing within an already established product of that company. Eventually many of them gets frustrated and can not survive long. Those who survives, they eventually moves themselves into other management roles as time goes by. And many of them have to start fresh because of the wrong choice. So in summary, go for the job that you love to do. And think carefully before choosing the right company that helps you grow up to your highest potential. Entrepreneurship: This is probably the hardest path to take in my opinion. People may differ and I can’t argue because I didn’t took their path. So, I really don’t know their difficulty levels. However, I’ll only say why I chose this path back in 2013 just after my graduation. I started developing native Android and iOS mobile Apps as freelancer back in 2011 when I was a student. I really loved this work and that time was the rise-up time of Mobile Apps industry. I went to 3 locally reputed companies for job interview at my last semester and got decent job offers from 2 of them. But I wasn’t really happy with the role they chose me for. I wanted to be in Mobile platform & I wanted diversity in my works. That eventually brought Dhrubok Infotech Services Ltd. into existence. Well, I am not super successful entrepreneur in my career yet, But when there are discussions about the top tier talents in iOS and Android in Bangladesh, my name is discussed. If the discussion is about top App development companies, the name “Dhrubok” is discussed among some people. Well, maybe because Bangladesh is a small country :) Finally, the path of entrepreneurship is hard and stressful. But you are willing to follow your passion, want to take challenges and do something that you take pride of your work, then this is the career path. I have prioritised 2 things in my career. Firstly, I love what I do and secondly I take my work very seriously. I think that’s really important in someones career.

In my case, I became a cloud ""expert"" after putting in 15 years working in support/operations, troubleshooting servers, managing local and wide-area networks, and eventually working with hosting customers (website operators and web application developers) running into problems of scale. After that, it was a simple matter to learn a few new concepts that relate to ""cloud"", and then spend a few more years putting those concepts into practice. All the people working for service providers will have some similar story...they were developers first who moved into cloud later; they were sysadmins who learned to deploy hardware en masse; they were product or marketing guys who learned about the new ways the technology could improve their customers' business.  Even if you don't have that kind of background, there is so much open source code and community projects available that you don't necessarily have to work in the industry for 20 years to get started (though it may take you that long to become an ""expert""). If you don't have experience running servers, that's probably going to be a good place to start. That's still the foundation of public cloud providers. All they're doing is running servers so that their customers don't have to. If you've got some money to spend, you can use EC2/Azure/GCP to spin up servers and start learning.  If not, then Virtualbox is free and you can run server VMs on your home computer. Install some web applications. Set up web and database servers. Learn how they talk to each other. Etc. If you've got some experience running/managing servers, then check out OpenStack or CloudStack. Download and start learning how to install and manage them. Hack at the code, if you know python or java. Join the community forums, mailing lists, and local user groups (if available). Start building small clusters using Virtualbox on your home computer. No programming experience is required, though the ability to troubleshoot systems is a must. Learn about distributed computing, service-oriented architectures, and related concepts. A lot of these are the building blocks of cloud technologies. Keep learning and don't stop. You become an expert by doing. So start doing, now. Thanks for the A2A.

If this is your goal, I have three major recommendations: Build interesting projects around a specific platform (like AWS). Introduce complexity just to get practice, especially if it's not going to be something open to the internet.Read documentation around services you are using and see how they all can interact with one another. This won't give you all the answers, but it will give you scenarios/solutions you may not have thought of on your own.Use training platforms. You can find training for affordable prices and under monthly memberships instead of thousand dollar+ packages, and they will drastically speed up your learning. Instead of having to figure things out on your own, you are given the information you need in logical order and filtered out.I would definitely encourage you to combine all three of those options.
