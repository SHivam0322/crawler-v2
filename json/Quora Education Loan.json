    "answer" : "If you're asking about education loan certificate to claim income tax exemption as per section 80E of IT act then simply go to your bank and ask your loan officer to give a Education loan certificate for the current financial year / whichever year you want. If your parents/ guardian is a coborrower for your loan then he/she can also avail the benefits of section 80E for his income tax calculation. Some banks like SBI simply upload these certificate (education/ home loan certificates) in the internet banking profiles of the customers.

Hey generation Z, please don’t do that. Don’t compromise your College or University just for the sake of avoiding an Education Loan. Many students consider Education loans as ‘Debt’. If I can substitute the word ‘Debt’ with ‘Leverage’ that would be great. You can feel negative vibes with the term Debt. I say this because students try to avoid this a lot or they just procrastinate the process of getting it. If they delay the process to acquire an Education Loan then they are left with a compromised loan with Higher Rate of Interest and Lower Sanctioned Amount due to lack of time in hand. Our mind keeps on struggling between the polarities of good and bad Continue Reading Education loan is different type of loan therefore release of installments is also different. Generally educational institutes demand college fees semester wise or year wise. So after admission in a college the next fees is due after the semester/ year ends. Therefore, Banks require following documents for release of next installment:— a) Demand letter of the college / University b) Mark sheet of the student which shows that he/she has cleared the last exam c) Receipt / acknowledgement of the last amount paid to the college/ University d) Bill / demand letter of hostel fees / mess fees/ books etc. etc. The student shall have to deposit margin amount (Student contribution) If any and then the Bank remits the demand amount of fees directly to the college / university",

Anybody who wishes to study abroad or even in a domestic educational institute can opt for a student or education loan from any of the recognised banks. The basic motive behind the concept of education loan was to help the aspirants economically and not let them murder their dreams due to some economic constraint. Added to this, such loans have only helped many of the students in going overseas without worrying about any financial limitations.

Safer the underlying asset, lower is the interest rate. That is the rule followed by Bankers. Home loans are the safest asets in India. First of all people are afraid of loosing their home plus it has social stigma too so default rate are very very low . Then come car loan where in case of default at least car can be sold and majority amount can be recovered. And so on.. In case of education loan , most of the loans are given on personal gurantees. Default rate is very high (much higher than car loans) in Educational loans as compared to car loans.

    "answer" : "Education loan is applied by almost all students aspiring to go different countries to do their Masters. Let me explain the process and struggle I faced during this COVID situation to get my education loan sanctioned. After getting the offer letter from Saint Mary’s University, Halifax, Canada for my Masters in Data Analytics & Computing, I was filled with joy and also thought about rest of the process to get my Visa done. I started searching for banks from March 2020 with lesser rate of interest ( which I think is important) and have gone through bank portals of almost all banks in India. What I could find is except 3 to 4 small banks, every bank has the loan margin amount which I needed. I initially thought of HDFC Credila and ICICI as well, but seeing their RoI, I was in a dilemma of going to it or not. I know if I did go through anyone of them, by this time I would have Visa in my hand. But, as my University postponed the course to January 2021, I thought I had so much of time to search other banks as well. Then came to my mind is Bank of Baroda with lesser rate of interest. I went to the nearest branch of BoB and asked the process of applying education loan in that bank ( I actually went through the bank loan portal and all things on my own by that time). The process was very clear and the documents which you need to submit will be handy if you have a flat/house to keep as collateral. I filled the application form and submitted all the documents to the bank. The process was quite fast and within less time, legal opinion by advocate and legal valuation of the property is done. While I was waiting for Mortgage registration process, one day I got a call from BoB saying that my loan got cancelled as Pre-Visa disbursement is not happening in COVID time for non-premier institutes of BoB. This was a big shock to me and I couldn’t come out of that for 1 week. The thought of re-applying in other bank with lesser RoI and the process is tough. One of my friends in same cohort of SMU (Hem Sai Charan) suggested me to talk with WeMakeScholars once on this issue. Then I immediately approached them in no time and explained everything that happened to me with Bank of Baroda. Meanwhile as I got news that SMU is conducting online classes in January, I deferred my admission to September 2021 as I am LASIK operated. I need to thank Ms. Prathyusha from WeMakeScholars in understanding my issue and solving the problem. After WeMakeScholars and BoB talked on this issue, they asked me one thing. The assurance from University that, if Visa gets cancelled then the money paid to University need to be returned from University, which luckily I got it from SMU. I submitted the assurance and again re-applied the loan from Bank of Baroda via WeMakeScholars this time. This time the process was much smoother as already legal opinion and legal valuation is already done. I also need to thank Durga and Anand from Bank of Baroda SMS team, in processing my documents and the process. Due to the COVID time, the process was somewhat slow but Bank of Baroda is such a good bank to apply loans. Two days back, I got my Loan Sanction Letter and I am looking forward for disbursement and Visa process. The best bank really depends on your situation and varies person to person. You should evaluate the banks offers on these metrics to identify what works best for your case Interest Rate: This is the obvious feature many students compare. Pls note that the below factors are sometimes equally important.EMI payment before graduation: Banks usually provide a moratorium period up to 1 year after graduation during which the student can secure a job and start making payments towards his loan. Terms of the loan like interest rate also differ from bank to bank during moratorium.Early repayment penalty: Many banks charge an early repayment penalty if you want to pay your loan back early. Please make sure you understand the terms involved and compare the same across banks.Loan processing fee: Most banks charge a one-time fee to process your loan which is added to the total principal amount. Make sure you compare the loan processing fee along with the interest rate.Depending on your requirements, here are a few options to choose from: Vidyalakshmi: The NSDL launched vidyalakshmi.co.in to help students in searching for and applying for the best education loans. Vidyalakshmi works with all 40 major banks such as SBI, IDBI, BOI, Andhra Bank, etc. Please note that Vidyalakshmi mostly works with the public banks and does not help you compare your options among private banks, NBFC’s, and the new fintech startups.Public Banks / PSU’s: Usually, public banks like SBI and Bank of Baroda offer the best rates. However, they also have the most arduous process for application. If you or your parents have a personal relationship with the bank manager at a PSU, this is a good option to consider.Private Banks: Private banks like Axis and Kotak offer bank loans at reasonable interest rates and quick turn-around times.NBFC’s: HDFC Credila and Avanse offer some of the most flexible loan terms. They usually offer the biggest loan amounts and have options that do not include collateral. However, their interest rates are higher than banksFintech companies: Prodigy Finance and MPower Financing are 2 fintech startups that offer all their loans without collateral. They also offer a fully online process to apply for loans, and offer very aggressive interest rates.Good luck with your education! Yes, you can definitely avail two education loans from separate banks at the same time.People may face financial crunch or may need money for higher education. This is the situation when banks and NBFCs come into consideration. You can apply personal loan for a higher education from one bank and at the same time a personal loan from another bank.  You can also apply for personal loans from multiple banks for different purposes.",

Through personal experience i can say Yes, it's worth to take an education loan if you have the confidence of paying it back by getting a nice placement after you complete your B.Tech.  The education loan is kept at the highest interest rate by banks but they also wait for you to complete your 4 years of education and wait for 6 months or in some cases upto 1 year to start repayment of the loan. If you have confidence on your studies and your talents that you'll find a job and a good one for that matter then may be you can pay it back easily in 2 years(Considering you get a good package ;) ) Also in india Upto 4 lacs loan doesn't even need a collateral and from a good engineering institute even some private ones you can do it within that amount.  And why is worth? It'll provide you a sense of how to manage your own money and teach you the responsibility of not putting a burden on your parents' shoulders.

This video explains about education loans with a strong emphasis on unsecured education loans/ Education loan without collateral. Well, choosing a bank for you education loan might be confusing sometimes. There are many factors that we need to keep in mind, every student is different and so are their profile and targeted colleges. In order to get a loan from a Nationalised bank, one needs to provide collateral which is a security against the loan that you get. Security could be Property whose value must be (more than the loan amount required), FD’s (Must be of the same value of loan required at least). In Banks, you need to mortgage the property papers and you can't take them back until you repay the loan amount. Generally you can repay the loan amount till 15 years or 10 years depending upon the policy of the bank. Everyone doesn't have a suitable property or security to provide for the Education Loan, then in that case private lenders are there such as Incred, Avanse, Auxilo, M power which provides loan on the basis of certain factors like college, country, course, Financial Co borrower’s income and credit history.

    "answer" : "Germany has a decent job requirement for students skilled in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, collectively known as STEM courses. Pursuing one such course is a very good option, and can be supplemented by doing a Master’s in order to strengthen the job prospects there. Automation and technology are two fields in which Germany is among the global leaders.  It is important to know that most courses in Germany require a very low to no tuition fee, making Germany one of the preferred countries for pursuing undergraduate courses outside of India. (Here is the list of courses available). There are also a number of scholarships for Indian students, made available by DAAD. As the tuition fee there is low, the major expense that one would incur is the cost of living. On average, the monthly expense can be around 700-800 Euros (including accommodation, food, travel etc.) The duration of the undergraduate program in Germany is generally 3 years. So, the total living cost could be around 30,000 Euros, which when converted using the conversion rate of 1 Euro= Rs 76, comes close to Rs 23 L. Adding another 2 L for miscellaneous expenses, brings the figure close to Rs 25 L. Hence, when compared to countries like USA, where undergraduate studies can cost over Rs 1 Cr in several universities, Germany is a much safer, reasonable and more recommended option. Here is the process for obtaining a Permanent Residency in Germany after your education there. There are several banks in India that offer secured education loans for studying in Germany. SBI runs a scheme called the SBI Global Ed-Vantage scheme to provide loans for studies outside India. Other banks like Bank of Baroda also provide attractive deals on education loans. Alternatively, you may approach GyanDhan, which is an education loan startup by IIT alumni working closely with leading banks across the country to make the education loan process extremely convenient for the student. GyanDhan does not charge any kind of a fee! Good luck! Definitely not from banks. However, there are a few organizations that offer interest-free loans if you are interested in pursuing higher education. K. C. Mahindra Education Trust and Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation are two such organizations which offer interest-free loans for pursuing a postgraduate degree from foreign universities. As you might have already guessed, these scholarships are highly competitive and require a lot of hard work. Check out these articles if you want more tips on what these scholarships are, and what you need to do to apply for them. There might be several other similar organizations that you can research about. Apart from these scholarships and grants, some colleges also have alumni associations that support their students by providing low or zero-interest loans to help fund their postgraduate degrees. Talk to your college’s alumni association to see if they have any such provisions. As per IBA Model Policy [1] , the following expenses shall be considered for Education Loans: Fee payable to college/ school/ hostelExamination/ Library/ Laboratory feeTravel expenses/ passage money for studies abroadInsurance premium for student borrower, if applicable (Insurance become optional after CGFSEL[2] )Caution deposit, Building fund / refundable deposit supported by Institution bills/receipts. **Purchase of books/ equipment/ instruments/ uniforms***Purchase of computer at reasonable cost, if required for completion of the course***Any other expense required to complete the course - like study tours, project work, thesis, etc.***Notes: * Reasonable lodging and boarding charges will be considered in case the student chooses / is required to opt for outside accommodation. ** These expenses could be considered subject to the condition that the amount does not exceed 10% of the total tuition fees for the entire course. *** It is likely that expenditure under Item Nos. 6, 7 & 8 above may not be available in the schedule of fees and charges prescribed by the college authorities. Therefore, a realistic assessment may be made of the requirement under these heads. However, the maximum expenses included under 6, 7 & 8 may be capped at 20% of the total tuition fees payable for completion of the course. For example, if your total tuition fees for completing the course is Rs. 4.00 lacs, then these expenses put together shall only be considered to a maximum of Rs. 80,000/- Footnotes[1] https://www.iba.org.in/pdf/education/Model_Edu_loan.pdf[2] Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Education Loans",

    "answer" : "Thanks for A2A. An education loan can be availed for many courses and countries. Getting an education loan to pursue professional courses (like MBA, Mass Communication, etc) from India is quite easy given your academic record is good. But if you are looking for an education loan for undergrad courses like BA then chances of approval are very low. Education loans for undergrad studies from universities abroad are again tricky but chances aren’t zero. For Humanities courses and non-science courses such as BA, Liberal Arts, B.Com, getting a loan will be difficult but you can still get it. You will have to approach private banks or lenders as they are willing to take more risks. Private lenders and banks check the academic record of the student so make sure you have an excellent academic record. It is relatively easier to get an education loan for abroad undergrad studies if your course is related to the science stream. Whereas if you are going abroad for your postgraduation in STEM courses or any related field, chances of approval are very high. You can approach public sector banks for the education loan like SBI, Bank of Baroda. You can also read this blog for help → Top 10 Education Loan Details That You Should Know Before Applying for an Education Loan → Also, there is no time limit or deadline to applying for an education loan. You can apply for the same anytime. However, you should plan your loan application accordingly as the loan process and approval takes time. To know more about your options regarding education loans for abroad studies, the courses that are approved and for admission counseling, do get in touch with GyanDhan. We are an education-focused financing platform and help students select the best lender with maximum benefits. Our services are free of cost for the students. Hope this helps! As the name suggests, processing fees is charged by the financial institution to cover the processing (operational) costs incurred during loan processing. The amount varies across different institutions and also differs by the education loan (loan for studies in India vs abroad vs loans for non-degree courses). In general, banks charge no fees or the processing fees is refundable in most cases. SBI charges a nominal fee of Rs.10k for study abroad loans. NBFCs charge a processing fee which varies from 1%-2% of the total loan amount. The final fee is negotiated in most cases and can be as low as 0.5% (though rarely 0) for the NBFCs. Note: Property appraisal costs are incurred by the customer in addition to the processing fees in most cases. For example, BoB charges 7500 for property evaluation. SBI on the other hand will provide a list of agencies that will do the assessment for you in exchange for a fees. The good thing with banks is that in most of the cases, it is a transparent process. They also give you some amount for living expenses. I got to know about GyanDhan through the Internet. I would suggest each and everyone looking for a loan for higher studies to contact them once before taking any step further. I have personally utilised their service. They are very helpful and genuine people. They have tied up with some banks and get you in contact with their representatives in case you require an education loan. Not only that but also they follow up with you and the bank regularly to make sure everything is alright. They also negotiate with their partner banks to give you the best interest rates in case you have something for lesser interest rate. The best part, all this is done free of cost. Their aim to help people get loans so that the person can pursue his or her dream without much headache or running around. It is started by two IITians. This is not any publicity stunt and it's all at no charges. I would personally thank Mr. Saday who was a very wonderful guide to me throughout the process.

To study in a foreign country, you have to check with the bank whether the country of study is eligible to be considered for a loan.

    "answer" : "In terms of return on investment many of the non IIMs like FMS,SP Jain,XLRI,MDI,IIFT,JBIMS,NMIMS etc are much better than the new IIMs and a couple of old IIMs Almost all colleges in top 30 have a total fees of around 12 lakh plus and hence taking an education loan makes a lot of sense Now for a loan of say 15lakhs your EMI would be 32,241 per month at the interest of 10.5% per annum payable for 5 years or 25,291 per month for 7 years . For the two years you study your dad would be paying an interest of 13,125 per month.Or  your emi would be 39,205 per month at the interest of 10.5% per annum payable for 5 years or 30,754 per month for 7 years if no one pays any interest while you are studying. So in any case you should be in a position to keep aside 25 to 30k post your MBA for repayment. With an average salary of 9.22 lakhs you can expect an in hand salary of 60-65k in which you can comfortably pay off the EMIs Now lets talk about entrepreneurship. While doing my MBA ,I was lucky to be surrounded by a lot of people bitten by the startup bug. Many of them,including my very close friends started of various forms of ventures in the college itself, right from an eCommerce platform for ladies handbag, to a cab aggregator with allied services in Mumbai.  But all of them were mature enough to sit for the final placement and bag a job because they knew that they were not profitable and wont be in the near forseable future, also they are in the experimentation mode trying their hands on various things,learning the real life challenges, challenges you wont find in books and case studies but when you set out to get things moving. They are willing to fail but learn and ultimately come up with a model that works, and all of this is going to take time,which they will make from their busy schedules once they start working in the corporate world and if their passion lives on The idea is that you don't start a venture just from scratch with out a backup plan and a support system, it takes time and a lot of patience and effort, and its far from being as easy and straight forward as hype around startups would want you to believe. So my advice is join the college, and also side by side work on your ideas. Get a job to pay off your expenses and EMI and also work on your startup to make the product really good. Save a little that will be your starting operational expense till you reach a point that you think you can now pitch for and get a funding. Once you get your seed fund quit the corporate job and keep paying the EMI from the salary you would be drawing from your own company. Yes, plot can be kept as a collateral security with bank. Some banks provide 70% of the government valuation and others provide 100% of it. Plots must have a boundary wall, as any bank would not prefer open land or plots. You must have the complete documents of the collateral, including approved plan, registered sale deed, mutation, completion certificate in case of construction etc. Plots must be registered under Municipal corporation as banks do not accept collateral which are under Gram Panchayat or unauthorised colonies. If the market value of the Plot is INR 50 Lakhs, for instance, then it gets evaluated by the appointed civil engineers and valuers, who quote and produce valuation reports according to the current rates of that area, which is always less than the market value. So, if the market value is INR 50 Lakhs, and government value came to be INR 40 Lakhs, the bank will provide 70% of that value; however, some banks provide 100% of the value. Most of the banks have margin money criteria, but some banks do not ask for that, if the admission is secured in a renowned university. Students are not fully aware of these terms, and always suffer while finding out what is best for them. This problem has been eradicated completely, since Gyandhan came into the market. Our main objective is to help students get admission into their dream college, and at the same time, funding it, by evaluating their profiles and initiating the suitable education loan process. Interesting and amazing fact is that all this is for free. We have a highly professional loan counseling team that evaluates your overall profile and starts the loan process with the best possible bank or lender. Unlike any other consultants, there are no hidden costs and the reason behind this is that we have corporate tie-ups with Public sector banks like SBI, Bank of Baroda, Axis bank etc. and we get our revenue from them. We are helping students in every possible way and figuring out options for those who do not have any security to keep as collateral but have a dream to study abroad and secure their futures. If you're one among them, check your loan eligibility or request a call back. First, let's have a look at the average, minimum, and maximum salaries offered across campuses in the previous Academic Year (Figures for this year would be higher since placements have improved this season)Salary packages offered in Top B-schools like IIMs, XLRI, etc. Assuming that you get the college which offered the minimum amongst the lowest packages in your graduating year (IIM K with 6 lacs in this example- the college can change from year to year, and so can the package). Assuming, further, that you stay at Delhi/Mumbai and have monthly expenses of around ~20-22k (Obviously, if you have got the lowest package, you would have to try and bring down that figure as low as possible). I personally have an average package(11lpa), and I keep my expenses below 20,000 per month. 6 lacs would amount to, typically: 40,000 in-hand per month. So, even if you consider the option that you won't save much in the first 1-2 years, you can still start off with an EMI amount of about 20,000 pm to begin with.This translates to a period of about 10 years.  However, always keep in mind that your educational achievements will stay with you and opportunities will be there if you work hard. I know of quite a few people who started with 6.5-7 lacs in their first year but graduated to 10-10.5 lpa jobs within their second year. Once your income increase, the EMI shouldn't be much of a bother. I would suggest, for CTCs upto 14 lacs, you should keep the loan reimbursement period constant at 6-7 years (you get tax benefits). More than that amount, you can look at decreasing the loan tenure without significantly hampering your lifestyle or your savings. P.S: This is the absolute worst case scenario, considering you get the lowest package possible, you stay in a high-cost-of-living city, etc.",

    "answer" : "Getting an education loan for Commercial Pilot License or type rating would need collateral and third party guarantee, because of the loan amount. In this case, since the amount is high, you can also avail a loan against property by providing a collateral of higher value than the loan amount. It needs to be noted that the bank gives loan for not more than 65% of the market value of the assets. Moreover, the market value of assets also depend on various factors. For example, the bank would deny loan if the property is based in a red zone area. I recommend you to contact your nearest bank and see whether you can avail a loan against property or an education loan with the assets you possess.",

    "answer" : "An education loan is taken by students over 18 years of age for their higher studies either in India or abroad. Its process is not very difficult. If you are getting an admit from a good university then it gets much easier for the bank to trust your credentials and your loan process will be faster. Firstly, before you think of applying you must obtain a checklist from the bank beforehand and keep all the papers and documents ready which the lender would require. Documents required would include:  ID proof and Address Proof  Income proof  Bank Statement/Pass Book of last 6 months  Copy of admission letter or the Institute along with Fees Schedule  Mark sheets/pass certificates of schooling so far. Next, check if the institute you have applied in has any tie-up with banks for education loans. Compare the rate of interests of banks and negotiate accordingly. Most banks would state that repayment starts after one year or after six months of securing a job, whichever is earlier. Banks may claim to offer loan up to Rs. 4 lakhs without collateral, but for loans between Rs4 lakh and Rs7.5 lakhs, they can ask for personal guarantees, and for a loan above Rs7.5 lakh collateral is required. Education loan interest rate varies from bank to bank, which could be anywhere between 10-14% Know the terms of your loan i.e. what is the interest rate, what is the repayment period, and when precisely will the payments begin. Well, considering so many steps involved in applying for an education loan, I would strongly recommend you to approach GyanDhan, which is an education loan startup founded by IIT alumni, working closely with a number of banks and NBFCs across India, to help students get education loans without any hassles. You can check your loan eligibility here, and the loan counsellor from GyanDhan would contact you to discuss the various loan options that you can avail. You’ll be happy to know that GyanDhan doesn’t charge the student any kind of a fee. Checkout our new video below for complete information about unsecured education loans. In my honest opinion, it is beneficial to take out an education loan. Sometimes, people apply for education loans as a back up option/contingency plan. Rest, it depends upon your needs and requirements. If your target college/course is expensive or you are looking to apply to foreign university then education loan is the only option for you. You could also apply for scholarships or financial aid from the college you want to attend. Before you go ahead with an education loan from a certain institute, consider these factors - Loan amount required and the loan amount the bank can sanctionSecured loan or unsecured loan, that is if you can pledge collateral or notIn case of secured loan then the value of the collateral should be enough to cover the loan amount requiredRate of interest - compare ROIs of different banks to get the best deal.Moratorium periodLoan tenureExpenses coveredThere are many loan options available in the market and the schemes differ according to the needs of the applicant. If you are looking for an education loan to finance your study abroad then I would advice you to look at SBI’s Global Ed-Vantage Scheme.

    "answer" : "First, let's have a look at the average, minimum, and maximum salaries offered across campuses in the previous Academic Year (Figures for this year would be higher since placements have improved this season)Salary packages offered in Top B-schools like IIMs, XLRI, etc. Assuming that you get the college which offered the minimum amongst the lowest packages in your graduating year (IIM K with 6 lacs in this example- the college can change from year to year, and so can the package). Assuming, further, that you stay at Delhi/Mumbai and have monthly expenses of around ~20-22k (Obviously, if you have got the lowest package, you would have to try and bring down that figure as low as possible). I personally have an average package(11lpa), and I keep my expenses below 20,000 per month. 6 lacs would amount to, typically: 40,000 in-hand per month. So, even if you consider the option that you won't save much in the first 1-2 years, you can still start off with an EMI amount of about 20,000 pm to begin with.This translates to a period of about 10 years.  However, always keep in mind that your educational achievements will stay with you and opportunities will be there if you work hard. I know of quite a few people who started with 6.5-7 lacs in their first year but graduated to 10-10.5 lpa jobs within their second year. Once your income increase, the EMI shouldn't be much of a bother. I would suggest, for CTCs upto 14 lacs, you should keep the loan reimbursement period constant at 6-7 years (you get tax benefits). More than that amount, you can look at decreasing the loan tenure without significantly hampering your lifestyle or your savings. P.S: This is the absolute worst case scenario, considering you get the lowest package possible, you stay in a high-cost-of-living city, etc. I used the EMI calculator on the Enrizon website (www.enrizon.com) to do this quick calculation for you. I am making the following assumptions: Your course is a two year course and 50% of the loan amount is disbursed at the start of both the years.You are making interest repayments during your education and your loan repayments (EMIs) start immediately after you graduateYou take 10 years after your graduate to repay the loan in full.Your Interest Payment in Year 1: 15,00,000 * 15% = Rs. 2,25,000 Your Interest Payment in Year 2: 30,00,000 * 15% = Rs. 4,50,000 Your EMI for 10 Years after Graduation: Rs. 48,400 per month So, your total repayment at 15% interest will be Rs. 2,25,000 + Rs. 4,50,000 + Rs. 48,400*120 = Rs. 64,83,000 If your interest rate was 11% instead, your total repayment would have been Rs. 54,54,000 thereby saving you more than Rs. 10 Lacs.

Also the cost of living of your city in Germany determines how much time does it take to repay ! So, I will just narrate you my experience of studying MS in a small town called Bremerhaven. For me, it took 220 euros per semester for 5 semesters from 2010 to 2012. Apart from that, it costed me 200 euros per month for the student hostel and up to 200 to 300 euros additionally for health insurance, food and other expenditures. I roughly spent not more than 13000 euros in a period of 24 + 6 = 30 months. Most of the money I got back while studying in those 30 months itself, as I was doing a student job. I am bad at accounting the money earned and spent, but all I remember is that I earned more than what I spent. I returned some of the money back home while studying and used my own earnings as a student to book flights for vacations. Cheers if you found an MS in Germany. You are going to make money ! You will have excess in your hand, So do not worry about taking a loan !",

    "answer" : "While my collections experience has been in the U.S., I am very familiar with the tactics shown in the video. I am a little curious as to when this video was made, looks like 2009 from I could find. In the U.S., all of those tactics, such as making threats of legal action that cannot or would not be taken, are illegal. The FDCPA, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, was enacted in 1977, but it did not really start to protect the consumer effectively until 2006–7. I started doing collections in 2004, so I saw the business go through a lot of changes. I found that the U.K. has enacted laws similar to the FDCPA, but as you stated, Prodigy is not a regulated or authorized lender, so they would not be held accountable to such rules. Also, the FDCPA covers collection activities of 3rd parties, like where I worked, not the actual lender. I found this article FinTech: Here's Why MBAs, Investors Are Flocking To Tuition Crowdfunder Prodigy Finance which says that over 99% of loans are repaid, so there is apparently isn’t need for additional oversight. I am a conservative when it comes to government, and this isn’t a situation that warrants the government to intervene. Not only are the borrowers extremely well-versed in finance, clearly aware of the business model, How It Works | Invest In MBA Community-Based Student Loans | Prodigy Finance but the method used to enforce repayment could not be regulated. Prodigy uses social pressure, by publishing a dashboard of individual student repayment activity, which impacts a student’s ability to pursue a career within any business network. This successful business model works for the individuals involved, and government intervention would only result in arbitrary rules set by people less knowledgeable than those involved, unnecessary regulatory costs, that would have unintended consequences, such as a a higher default rate; the government could effectively cripple and put Prodigy and companies like it out of business. That’s not to say that the FDCPA is bad legislation; it lays the legal foundation for consumers to sue when they have been harassed, lied to, or otherwise compelled to pay a debt which puts their families financial security at risk. The FDCPA became necessary because of unethical business practices and lack of consumer knowledge and access to knowledge to make wise decisions. Legislation still has not found a way to have collectors abide by contrary rules that collectors must identify themselves and the nature of the call but avoid disclosure to third parties when leaving voicemail messages. Also, not all consumers can effectively invoke protections, due to the lack of legal assistance at the state level when dealing with businesses located in another jurisdiction. First, the big college question, will this money I spend to get a degree help me make more money over my lifetime than not going to college. The answer is still a firm yes, BUT it won’t always come back in 10 years or less like it used to. Often your return on investment for college comes on a longer time frame in money. I also encourage you to think about your health, working in an office gives you the opportunity to have more control over your health than working a factory line or another labor intensive job(doesn’t mean you’ll take better care of yourself but more of your health is your choice with a degree than without). Next, will I actually complete this degree? Lot of people in the late 90s and early 2000s went to college for two years and dropped out. It cost less back then, so the stakes weren’t so high, but with the rising cost of college tuition and the surrounding costs of lodging/food/entertainment all rising the stakes are much higher now. The only person who can answer that is you, but if you take the need to be present and put forth the effort to pass(no one cares if you got all As and also no one gets all As in college) then you will better yourself long term. Finally, how much should I borrow. Tuition is required, but many student loans offer residual funds and there is a scale for how much you can add onto the base tuition cost for lodging and food. I knew a lot of people who treated that like play money and that’s a huge mistake. I would say only add as much residual debt as you absolutely need. It may be tempting to take that residual money to fix your car or buy a new TV but remember student loan debt must be paid, you cannot bankrupt it and you will never get away from it until it is paid. Please do not add consumer items you can live without to this protected type of debt. Move back to a dorm, get rid of your car and walk to class before you put anything car or consumer related on a student loan. Lastly, how quickly can I get through to a bachelor’s degree? The last statistic I read stated that less than a quarter of people with bachelor’s degrees are working in a field related to their degree. That doesn’t make a degree a bad idea, it just means the labor market and the college campus are not directly in line. However, having a bachelor’s degree is still a requirement for a vast majority of corporate jobs. It tells the hiring department you can do things you don’t want to do because you need to do them. No one wants to get up for Philosophy at 8am. No one! But you had to and you did it and you finished your degree program. That is what having a bachelor’s degree is telling the hiring department and that is the value of having one in something, anything, even if you’re not going to work specifically in your degree field. Know what you’re getting for your money and find the shortest route to a bachelor’s degree that you do not hate. Anything in the business department will translate well to any professional job. Think of it like your cover charge to office work and just get it done. Yes - Prodigy Finance is relatively new and this is far too high an interest rate in any country globally in the current environment of globally low interest rates (or negative EURIBOR interest rates in the Eurozone).  It would be better to avoid such loan funding entirely, or negotiate a substantial fee discount directly with the Business School (often the top tier business schools will subsequently call this a \"scholarship\"; e.g. for €30,000 off their advertised headline MBA tuition fee rate) Details of discounts (scholarships) are Cracks in finances put business schools at risk - FT.com  Alternatively, stick to a conventional bank loan funding source, where the jurisdiction, legal system and ability to negotiate a restructuring or write off of such MBA debt is clear and well defined. Also, make sure any tuition fee payments to the school are paid by a credit card (e.g. Visa, American Express, Mastercard) with consumer protection (rather than paying directly by cash, cheque, bank transfer or debit card), in the event of a dispute later on and needing to pursue a refund or other claim. For example, in the United Kingdom, credit cards have excellent consumer protection under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, in the event that the MBA tuition goods or service prove to be unfit or unsatisfactory. Finally, many countries have credit cards with 0% interest rates on 'new spending' for up to 18 months. This would provide for 0% finance on paying for MBA tuition fees by credit card (e.g. £20,000 of MBA tuition on a 0% interest rate credit card), and be therefore much cheaper than the 10% loan funding offered by Prodigy Finance. In addition, it is possible to subsequently balance transfer the tuition fees on the 0% interest credit card to another 0% interest credit card when closer to the expiration of the 18 month interest free period, for usually only a relatively small 'balance transfer' fee.Another advantage of using a 0% new purchases credit card is the ability to get points, rewards, or other \"cash back\" for the purchase.

    "answer" : "I don’t know why students find it taxing to apply for Education Loans and always try to avoid that by emptying the bank balance of parents. Hey generation Z, please don’t do that. Don’t compromise your College or University just for the sake of avoiding an Education Loan. Many students consider Education loans as ‘Debt’. If I can substitute the word ‘Debt’ with ‘Leverage’ that would be great. You can feel negative vibes with the term Debt. I say this because students try to avoid this a lot or they just procrastinate the process of getting it. If they delay the process to acquire an Education Loan then they are left with a compromised loan with Higher Rate of Interest and Lower Sanctioned Amount due to lack of time in hand. Our mind keeps on struggling between the polarities of good and bad between them and thus this leads to disturbance. We often look for reviews about loans and then we make a judgement about a certain type of loan where the certain population goes but in reality it may not be a right fit for you. Leverage, on the other hand, has positive connotations attached to it. Leverage is further termed as “to use something to advantage” or in a financial sense, “to borrow since one can earn better on it.” Don’t you find it convincing? Let me explain to you in these four points: a. Leverage when your appreciation opportunity is high - This means about having job prospects for your Educational course which you intend to pursue. If you are confident about that then you’re good to go ahead. Many students are able to repay off the loans within the first 5 years of the repayment period. b. Leverage should be a choice - Taking a loan is nothing but borrowing from your future earnings to fund your present. So, unless the asset you are borrowing for is earning more than the cost of borrowing, you are leaving your future under-funded. c. Always have a plan for your Education loan - You’ve to breakdown all your expenses related to your living expenses as you can’t compromise the tuition fees. So we at Yocket help you with that! d. Evaluate every loan as an option that fits in your overall plan - There are many loan options available in the market, you just have to compare among the best options. We at Yocket can help you not just with Education Loans but also with Financial Counselling related to your Study Financial requirements.Good Luck! MBBS and MD are two different courses. One is a bachelor’s course while other is for masters. If you are opting for an education loan, then you need to apply for both these courses separately. However, if it is an integrated course in medicine which you wish to pursue then you can apply for it using a single loan application. In short, you can apply for just one course at a time. On the other hand, if there are two separate courses which you wish to pursue at the same time, then instead of opting for an education loan, you should opt for a loan which gives you the freedom of end usage. In order words, a loan which gives you the liberty of using it for any purpose you feel like. Two loan options which are very popular in this category include personal loans and loan against property. To opt for a loan against the property you must ensure that you have an asset which you can pledge an asset to the lender and in the absence of which your loan application will be rejected. Thus, if you do not have any asset to offer, I suggest that you instead opt for a personal loan. There are a number of lenders including financial institutions which offer personal loan for higher education at very competitive interest rates. The loan amount is high and the best part is that you get to choose the repayment tenor as per your preference. This ensures that repaying back the loan amount does not become a burden. I hope this helps. Thanks for A2A! The answer is big No. It is nothing but a financial blunder to invest 50 lakh for MBBS by taking a student loan. I don’t know whether you will be able to recover it or not but the cautious word beforehand is don't take a student loan for studying MBBS. In case you have 50 lakhs with you and want to be a doctor, you can consider MBBS but not with the loan. Let me explain you the financial aspect of it in a bit details. For the sake of simplification, I am assuming that you will be paying tuition fees of 10 lakh each year for 5 years and you will start repaying the tuition fees a year after that. The rate of interest ranges between 8–14% for education loan. I am keeping it 10% for the ease of calculation. 1st Year Tuition Fees: 10,00,000 2nd Year Tuition Fees: 10,00,000 + 10% interest + 1000000 = 2100000 3rd Year Tuition Fees: 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 = 3310000 4th Year Tuition Fees: 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 = 4641000 5th Year Tuition Fees: 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% = 6105100 6th Year Interest: 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 1000000 + 10% + 10% = 6715610 Once you start paying your 50 lac after the 6th year, you will have to pay 6715610. You have below-mentioned options to pay back your loan depending on the duration. 5 Year EMI Plan: Impossible to pay the EMI  10 Year EMI Plan: Impossible to pay the EMI  15 Year EMI Plan:  20 Year EMI Plan:  You will have to pay 65000 each month for 20 years to pay back your education loan. You will be in no position to do your post-graduation. Read here about a doctor's salary, Waseem Siddiqui's answer to What is the salary of a doctor in India? Cheers!",

    "answer" : "In my honest opinion, it is beneficial to take out an education loan. Sometimes, people apply for education loans as a back up option/contingency plan. Rest, it depends upon your needs and requirements. If your target college/course is expensive or you are looking to apply to foreign university then education loan is the only option for you. You could also apply for scholarships or financial aid from the college you want to attend. Before you go ahead with an education loan from a certain institute, consider these factors - Loan amount required and the loan amount the bank can sanctionSecured loan or unsecured loan, that is if you can pledge collateral or notIn case of secured loan then the value of the collateral should be enough to cover the loan amount requiredRate of interest - compare ROIs of different banks to get the best deal.Moratorium periodLoan tenureExpenses coveredThere are many loan options available in the market and the schemes differ according to the needs of the applicant. If you are looking for an education loan to finance your study abroad then I would advice you to look at SBI’s Global Ed-Vantage Scheme.

I hope this answer was of help to you. A student is not supposed to earn or to have taxable income while studying. So, it is never a criterion for education loan.

    "answer" : "Education loan is applied by almost all students aspiring to go different countries to do their Masters. Let me explain the process and struggle I faced during this COVID situation to get my education loan sanctioned. After getting the offer letter from Saint Mary’s University, Halifax, Canada for my Masters in Data Analytics & Computing, I was filled with joy and also thought about rest of the process to get my Visa done. I started searching for banks from March 2020 with lesser rate of interest ( which I think is important) and have gone through bank portals of almost all banks in India. What I could find is except 3 to 4 small banks, every bank has the loan margin amount which I needed. I initially thought of HDFC Credila and ICICI as well, but seeing their RoI, I was in a dilemma of going to it or not. I know if I did go through anyone of them, by this time I would have Visa in my hand. But, as my University postponed the course to January 2021, I thought I had so much of time to search other banks as well. Then came to my mind is Bank of Baroda with lesser rate of interest. I went to the nearest branch of BoB and asked the process of applying education loan in that bank ( I actually went through the bank loan portal and all things on my own by that time). The process was very clear and the documents which you need to submit will be handy if you have a flat/house to keep as collateral. I filled the application form and submitted all the documents to the bank. The process was quite fast and within less time, legal opinion by advocate and legal valuation of the property is done. While I was waiting for Mortgage registration process, one day I got a call from BoB saying that my loan got cancelled as Pre-Visa disbursement is not happening in COVID time for non-premier institutes of BoB. This was a big shock to me and I couldn’t come out of that for 1 week. The thought of re-applying in other bank with lesser RoI and the process is tough. One of my friends in same cohort of SMU (Hem Sai Charan) suggested me to talk with WeMakeScholars once on this issue. Then I immediately approached them in no time and explained everything that happened to me with Bank of Baroda. Meanwhile as I got news that SMU is conducting online classes in January, I deferred my admission to September 2021 as I am LASIK operated. I need to thank Ms. Prathyusha from WeMakeScholars in understanding my issue and solving the problem. After WeMakeScholars and BoB talked on this issue, they asked me one thing. The assurance from University that, if Visa gets cancelled then the money paid to University need to be returned from University, which luckily I got it from SMU. I submitted the assurance and again re-applied the loan from Bank of Baroda via WeMakeScholars this time. This time the process was much smoother as already legal opinion and legal valuation is already done. I also need to thank Durga and Anand from Bank of Baroda SMS team, in processing my documents and the process. Due to the COVID time, the process was somewhat slow but Bank of Baroda is such a good bank to apply loans. Two days back, I got my Loan Sanction Letter and I am looking forward for disbursement and Visa process. Generally, education loans are offered in specific slabs: a) Below Rs. 4 lakhs, b) Between Rs. 4 lakhs and Rs. 7.5 lakhs and c) Above Rs. 7.5 lakhs. Overview While availing any kind of loan, the most important aspect that has to be considered by the borrower is the interest rate offered by the chosen bank. The interest rate for any type of education loan differs according to the loan amount availed, the loan tenure, educational institution chosen and can be a fixed or floating rate. The interest payment for an education loan varies depending on the borrower. Interest rate payments are generally done immediately after the loan disbursal. Most banks offer a moratorium period after the sanction of the loan, during which the borrower does not have to repay the principal portion of the education loan. The scheduled repayment can start after this period, which is generally after the completion of the course. But borrowers can also pay the interest beforehand during the time of disbursal to avoid the burden of repaying higher amounts later. Another key point to be considered while looking into the interest rate given by any lender is whether the bank is calculating the interest on a quarterly reducing balance basis or on a daily reducing balance basis. The Central Government provides a full Interest Rate Subsidy Scheme to the economically weaker segments of the society, during the moratorium period of the education loan. Some banks also provide concessions for women applicants and offer a slightly lower interest rate. Comparison of different Bank Interest Rates Axis Bank  Up to Rs. 4 Lakhs (15.20%)  Loans greater than Rs. 4 Lakhs and upto Rs. 7.5 Lakhs (14.70%)  Loans greater than Rs. 7.5 Lakhs (13.70%) Bank of Baroda For all loan types and amounts (8.50%) onwards Canara Bank For Vidhya Turant Loan Scheme (6.60%)  Up to Rs. 4 Lakhs (10.40%)  Rs. 4 Lakhs to Rs. 7.50 Lakhs (10.40%) Loans above Rs. 7.50 lakhs (10.20%)  IBA´s Model Loan scheme for Vocational Education & Training (9.90%) HDFC Bank Minimum APR (9.00%)  Maximum APR (13.86%)  Average APR (11.57%) Kotak Mahindra Bank For all loan types and amounts (11.5% to 24%) Punjab National Bank PNB Kaushal (8.55% onwards)  PNB Saraswati/Udaan (10.30% onwards)  PNB Pratibha (for admission to IITs , IIMs and XLRI Jamshedpur) (8.45% onwards)  PNB Pratibha (for admission to other colleges) (8.55% onwards)  PNB Honhaar (10.45%) State Bank of India Up to Rs. 7.5 Lakhs (10.25%)  Above Rs. 7.5 Lakhs (10.50%) Avanse For all loan types and amounts (10% to 16.50%) Credila For all loan types and amounts (11.85%) onwards As on 04/03/2020 Note : As many of the PSBs have been merged i have removed few of the entries permanently and kept only top players in the field. There are other things too like processing fees, moratorium period and margins, check them out too. Thank you. Hope it would help. For any loan, interest has to be paid. The moratorium is only for repayment of the loan during the course period or until you secure a job whichever is later (because you do not have source of income, as a student). Simple interest is charged on Education loan during the moratorium period and once the repayment period starts, the interest is compounded, like any other loan. Pl verify whether the Bank has granted/classified your loan as Education loan, first.",

I personally have an average package(11lpa), and I keep my expenses below 20,000 per month. 6 lacs would  Continue Reading Date……………… To, The Branch Manager, Bank name Address …..

So, I will just narrate you my experience of studying MS in a small town called Bremerhaven. For me, it took 220 euros per semester for 5 semesters from 2010 to 2012. Apart from that, it costed me 200 euros per month for the student hostel and up to 200 to 300 euros additionally for health insurance, food and other expenditures. I roughly spent not more than 13000 euros in a period of 24 + 6 = 30 months. Most of the money I got back while studying in those 30 months itself, as I was doing a student job.

Education should be free. Many countries like the USA spend a fortune on their military and for war (using tax payers' money of course) whilst students can't get an education unless they are rich or can get a loan. A great proportion of these students go into debt for life cause they don't get an income that they hoped to have once they passed college. A college education doesnot guarantee a good pay or a job for the matter anymore. So someone who goes as far as to taking a loan to study must do so for the passion of studying, or if it is an absolutely necessary stepping stone for their goals rather than thinking it's the magic key to a dream job or because they should do it cause it's the norm to do it.",
