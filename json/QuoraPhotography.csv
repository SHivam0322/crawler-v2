Get ready by 4:30 am, reach our distribution spot. Then we must carefully listen to our supervisor/head’s directions. We must start arranging them on bicycles and start our trip. Seniors were given at least 200 newspapers ( both english and telugu). As I was a kid, they would give me only 100 newspapers. I used to distribute “The HINDU” and “EENADU” newspapers in  Continue Reading",2021-03-01T15:22:52.897Z,"Which are the most underrated professions in India? ",Quora

In my opinion, The first thing you should think when you think about a perfect job for you is, “Which job are you interested in, that you never get bored of doing ? “. No Job is perfect. You just have to remember that fact. whatever job it is , after a couple of years (sometimes just in months) if you don’t feel anything new, if there is nothing new to learn! Then you will get bored of it. So choose something that you will never feel bored of. If it’s cooking ! Be it, Go on , become a chef. When it comes to introvert point of view, If you go for a software job or govt job or any other such jobs  Continue Reading Continue Reading",2021-03-01T15:24:28.699Z,"What are the best jobs for introverts?
